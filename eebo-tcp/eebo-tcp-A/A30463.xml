            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>hat pleased me most in the places through which I have passed: But I will avoid saying such things as occur in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Books,</hi> for which I refer you to the <hi>Prints</hi>; for as you know, that I have no great inclination to copy what others have said, so a <hi>traveller</hi> has not leisure, nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour enough, for so dull an employment.</p>
            <p>As I came all the way from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Lions,</hi> I was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to see so much misery as appeared, not only in <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> but even in big <hi>Towns,</hi> where all the marks of an

extream <hi>poverty</hi> showed themselves both in the <hi>Buildings,</hi> the <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and almost in the looks of the <hi>Inhabitants.</hi> And a general dispeopling in all the <hi>Towns,</hi> was a very visible effect of the hardships under which they lay.</p>
            <p>I need tell you nothing of the irregular, and yet magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent situation of <hi>Lions</hi>; of the noble <hi>Rivers</hi> that meet there; of the <hi>Rock</hi> Cut from so vast a height for a prison, of the <hi>Carthusians</hi> Gardens, of the <hi>Town-house,</hi> of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Colledge, and <hi>Library</hi> of the famous <hi>Nunnery of S.

            <p>The <hi>speech of Claudius</hi> ingraven on a <hi>Plate of Brass,</hi> and set in the end of the low walk in the <hi>Town-hsuse,</hi> is one of the noblest <hi>Antiquities</hi> in the World, by which we see the way of writing and pointing in that age very copiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly. The <hi>shield of silver</hi> of 22 pound weight, in which some remains of gilding do yet appear, and that seems to represent that generous action of <hi>Scipio's,</hi> of restoring a fair captive to a <hi>Celtiberian Prince,</hi> is certainly the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest piece of <hi>Plate</hi> that is now extant; the embossing of it is so fine, and so entire, that it is indeed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A great many <hi>Inscriptions</hi> are to be seen of the late and Barbarous ages, as <hi>Bonum Memorium,</hi> and <hi>Epitaphium hunc</hi>: there are 23. <hi>Inscriptions</hi> in the <hi>Garden</hi> of the <hi>Fathers of mercy,</hi> but so placed, as it shews how little those who possess them do either understand or value them.

            <p>It seems the <hi>impiety</hi> was publick, otherwise a <hi>Husband</hi> would not have recorded it in such a manner; and it is plain that he thought it rose from an excess of <hi>piety.</hi>

The great Church of <hi>Bern</hi> is a very noble Fabrick; but being built on the top of the Hill on which the Town stands, it seems the ground began to fail, so to support it, they have raised a vast Fabrick, which has cost more than the Church it self; for there is a Platform made, which is a square, to which the <hi>Church</hi> is one side, and the further side is a vast <hi>Wall,</hi> fortified with buttresses about 150 foot high. They told me, that all the ground down to the bottom of the Hill was dug in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vaults; this plat-form is the chief walk of the Town, chiefly about Sun set; and the <hi>River</hi> underneath presents a very beautiful prospect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For there is a Cut taken off from it for the Mills, but all along as this Cut goes, the Water of <hi>Aar</hi> runs over a sloping bank of Stone, which they say, was made at a vast charge, and makes a noble and large <hi>Cascade.</hi>

The whole <hi>Order</hi> resolved to take their revenge, and in a <hi>Chapter,</hi> held at <hi>Vimpsen</hi> in the year 1504. they contrived a method for supporting the credit of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which was much sunk in the opinion of the people, and for bearing down the reputation of the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> four of the juncto undertook to manage the design; for they said, since the people were so much disposed to believe Dreams and Fables, they must dream of their side, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cheat the people as well as the others had done. They resolved to make <hi>Bern</hi> the Seene in which the project should be put in execution; for they found the people of <hi>Bern,</hi> at that time apt to Swallow any thing, and not dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make severe Enquiries into extraordinary Matters. When they had formed their design, a fit Tool presented it self; for one <hi>Ietzer</hi> came to take their habit as a <hi>Lay-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who had all the dispositions that were necessary for the execution of their project: For he was extream simple, and was much inclined to Austerities, so having observed his temper well, they began to execute their project, the very Night after he took the <hi>Habit,</hi> which was, on <hi>Lady-day</hi> 1507. one of the <hi>Fryers</hi> conveyed himself secretly into his Cell, and appeared to him as if he had been in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> in a strange figure, and he had a Box near his mouth, upon which as he blew, fire seemed to come out of his mouth. He had also some Dogs about him, that appeared as his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, in this posture he came near the <hi>Fryer,</hi> while he was a Bed, and took up a celebrated Story that they used to tell all their <hi>Fryers,</hi> to beget in them a great dread at the laying aside their habit, which was, that one of the <hi>Order,</hi> who was Superiour of their House at <hi>Soloturn,</hi> had gone to <hi>Paris,</hi> but laying aside his habit, was killed in his Lay-habit. The Fryer in the Vizar said, he was that person, and was condemned to <hi>Purgatory</hi> for that Crime; but he added, that he might be rescued out of it by his means, and he seconded this with most horrible Cries, expressing the Miseries which he suffered. The poor Fryer (<hi>Ietzer</hi>) was excessively frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the other advanced, and required a Promise of him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65702:26"/>
that which he should desire of him, in order to the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him out of his Torment. The frighted <hi>Fryer</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised all that he asked of him; then the other said, he knew he was a great Saint, and that his prayers and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications would prevail, but they must be very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; The whole <hi>Monastery</hi> must for a week together discipline themselves with a Whip, and he must lie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in the form of one on a <hi>Cross,</hi> in one of their <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,</hi> while Mass was said in the sight of all that should come together to it; and he added, that if he did this, he should find the effects of the love that the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> did bear him, together with many other extraordinary things; and said, he would appear again accompanied with two other Spirits; and assured him, that all that he did suffer for his deliverance, should be most gloriously rewarded.

The <hi>Fryer's</hi> Confessor was upon the Secret, and by this means they knew all the little passages of the poor <hi>Fryers</hi> life, even to his thoughts, which help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not a little in the Conduct of the matter.

            <p>The <hi>Fryer,</hi> that pretended he was suffering in <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> said so many things to him relating to the Secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In two of these Apparitions, that were both managed in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the <hi>Fryer</hi> in the Masque talked much of the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Order,</hi> which he said was excessively dear to the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> who knew her self to be conceived in Original sin, and that tbe <hi>Doctors</hi> who taught the contrary were in Purgatory: That the Story of S. <hi>Bernards</hi> appearing with a spot on him, for having opposed himself to the feast of the Conception, was a Forgery: but that it was true, that some hideous Flies had appeared on St <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures</hi> Tomb, who taught the contrary. That the <hi>B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> abhorred the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> for making her equal to her Son; that <hi>Scotus</hi> was damned, whose Canonization the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> were then soliciting hard at <hi>Rome</hi>; and that the Town of <hi>Bern</hi> would be destroyed for harbouring such plagues within their walls. When the injoined discipline was fully performed, the <hi>Spirit</hi> appeared again, and said, he was now delivered out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but before he could be admitted to Heaven, he must receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, having died without it, and after that he would say Mass for those, who had by their great charities <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n so far from sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any thing, that he gave no great heed to this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition. Some dayes after this, tbe same <hi>Fryer</hi> appeared as a <hi>Nun</hi> all in Glory, and told the poor Frier, that she was St. <hi>Barbary,</hi> for whom he had a particular devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and added, that the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> was so much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with his charity, that she intended to come and visit him: He immediately called the <hi>Convent</hi> together, and gave the rest of the <hi>Fryers</hi> an account of this Apparition, which was entertained by them all with great joy; and the <hi>Fryer</hi> languished in desires of the accomplishment

of the promise, that St. <hi>Barbara</hi> had made him. After some dayes, the longed for delusion appeared to him, clothed as the <hi>Virgin</hi> used to be on the great Feasts, and indeed in the same Habits: there were about her some <hi>Angels,</hi> which he afterwards found were the little Statues of Angels, which they set on the Altars on the great Holy Dayes. There was also a pulley fastned in the room over his head, and a cord tied to the Angels, that made them rise up in the Air, and flie about the <hi>Virgin,</hi> which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the delusion. The <hi>Virgin,</hi> after some endearments to himself, extolling the merit of his charity and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, told him, that she was conceived in Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, and that <hi>Pope Iulius the Second,</hi> that then reigned, was to put an end to the Dispute, and was to abolish the Feast of her Conception, which <hi>Six<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>us the fourth</hi> had instituted, and that the <hi>Fryer</hi> was to be the Instrument of perswading the <hi>Pope</hi> of the truth in that matter: She gave him <hi>three drops</hi> of her Sons blood, which were <hi>three tears</hi> of blood that he had shed over <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and this signified that she was <hi>three hours</hi> in Original Sin, after which she was, by his Mercy, delivered out of that State: For it seems the <hi>Dominicans</hi> were resolved so to compound the matter, that they should gain the main point of her Conception in Sin; yet they would comply so far with the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the <hi>Virgin,</hi> with which the World was possessed, that she should be believed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a very short while in that State. She gave him also five drops of Blood in the form of a Cross, which were <hi>Tears</hi> of Blood, that she had shed while her Son was on the Cross. And, to convince him more fully, she presented an <hi>Hostie</hi> to him, that appeared to as an ordinary Hostie, and of a sudden it appeared be of a deep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She said, that the five wounds of St. <hi>Lucia,</hi> and S. <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> were real wounds, and that she would also imprint them on him; so she bid him reach his hand; he had no great mind to receive a favour in which he was to suffer so much: but she forced his hand, and struck a nail thro it, the hole was as big as a grain of pease, and he saw the Candle clearly thro it; this threw him out of a supposed transport into a real Agony; but she seemed to touch his hand, and he thought he smelt an Oyntment, with which she anointed it, tho his <hi>Confess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next night the Apparition returned, and brought some linnen Clothes, which had some real or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vertue to allay his Torment: and the pretended <hi>Virgin</hi> said, they were some of the Linnings in which Christ was wrapped, and with that she gave him a soporiferous draught, and while he was fast asleep, the other four wounds were, inprinted on his body, in such a manner that he felt no pain.</p>

               </gap>, he dedicated himself to the Deyl; it is true, he did not oblige the rest to this, but only to renounce God. The composition of the Draught was a mixture of some Fountain-water and Chrism, the Hairs of the Eyebrows of a Child, some Qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Composition was a secret, which the <hi>Subprior</hi> did not communicate to the other <hi>Friers.</hi> By this the poor Frier <hi>Ietzer</hi> was made almost quite insensible: when he was awake, and came out of this deep sleep, he felt this wonderful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on his body: and now he was ravished out
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65702:28"/>
of measure, and came to fancy himself to be acting all the parts of our Saviours Passion: he was exposed to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the great Altar, to the amasement of the whole Town, and to the no small mortification of the <hi>Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</hi> The <hi>Dominicans</hi> gave him some other draughts that threw him into convulsions, and when he came out of those, a voice was heard, which came thro that <hi>hole</hi> which yet remains, and runs from one of the <hi>Cells</hi> along a great part of the wall of the <hi>Church</hi>: for a <hi>Frier</hi> spoke thro a pipe, and at the End of the hole there was an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Virgins,</hi> with a little <hi>Iesus</hi> in her arms, between whom and his mother the voice seemed to come; the Image also seemed to shed Tears, and a Painter had drawn those on her Face so lively, that the people where deceived by it. The little Jesus askt, why she wept? and she said, it was because his honour was given to her, since it was said, that she was born without sin; in Conclusion, the <hi>Fryers</hi> did so over act this matter, that at last even the poor deluded <hi>Fryer</hi> himself came to discover it, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to quit the order.</p>
            <p>It was in vain to delude him with more <hi>Apparitions</hi>; for he well nigh kill'd a <hi>Fryer</hi> that came to him personating the <hi>Virgin</hi> in another shape with a Crown on her head: he also over-heard the <hi>Fryers</hi> once talking amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, of the Contrivance and Success of the imposture, so plainly, that he discovered the whole Matter, and upon that, as may be easily imagined, he was filled with all the horror with which such a Discovery could inspire him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fryers</hi> fearing that an imposture, which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on hitherto with so much success, should be quite spoiled, and be turned against them, thought the surest way was to own the whole Matter to him, and to engage him to carry on the Cheat.

and is about two mile Diameter. This <hi>Lake</hi> falls into the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Como,</hi> over against the Fort <hi>Fuentes</hi>; when we passed there, the Water was so low, that the Boat could not easily get over a Bank that lay between the two <hi>Lakes.</hi> The <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Como</hi> is about eight and forty miles long, and four broad; it runs between two ranges of Hills: I did nor stay long enough in <hi>Como</hi> to give any Description of it; for I thought to have returned that way from a little Tour that I made into the <hi>Bailiages</hi> that the <hi>Switzers</hi> have in <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Lugane, Locarmo,</hi> and <hi>Bellinzona:</hi> but I took another Course, so I saw nothing in <hi>Como</hi>; the best thing in it is a fine <hi>Chappel,</hi> which the present <hi>Pope,</hi> who is a Native of <hi>Como,</hi> is building.

it appeared, that they bore the chief sway in the Election, This Combination was a thing known to the very people, tho the <hi>Inquisitors</hi> did all they could to break it, or at least to hide it, so that I never met with it in any of their Authors.

The <hi>Nuns</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> have been under much scandal for a great while; there are some <hi>Nunnerys</hi> that are as famous for their strictness and exactness to their Rules, as others are for the Liberties they take: chiefly those of <hi>Saint Zachary</hi> and <hi>Saint Laurence,</hi> where none but <hi>Noble Venetians</hi> are admitted, and where it is not so much as pretended, that they have retired for Devotion; but it is owned to be done meerly, that they might not be too great a Charge to their Family: They are not vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their neck and breast is bare, and they receive much company: but that which I saw, was in a publick Room, in which there were many <hi>Grills</hi> for several Parlors, so that the conversation is very confused; for there being a different company at every <hi>Grill,</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king generally very loud, the noise of so many loud Talkers, is very disagreeable. The <hi>Nuns</hi> talk much, and very ungracefully, and allow themselves a liberty in Rallying, that other places could not bear.

There is a <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,</hi> in which some parts both of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Apuleius</hi> are written, and in one place, one in a different hand had writ, that he had compared those <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> and he adds a date to this in <hi>Olibrius's</hi> time, which is about twelve hundred <hi>Years</hi> ago. I found some dipthongs in it cast into one Letter, which surprized me; for I thought that way of writing them had not been so ancient: but that which pleased me most was, that the <hi>Library-keeper</hi> assured me, that one had lately found <hi>the famous Epistle of St. Chrysostome to Cesarius in Greek,</hi> in the end of a Volume full of other things, and not among the <hi>Manuscripts</hi> of that <hi>Fathers Books</hi>; of which they have a great many. He thought he remembred well the place where the Book stood; so we turned over all the Books that stood near it, but I found it not: he promised to look it out for me, if I came back that way: But I changing my design, and going back another way, could not see the bottom of this. It is true, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Magliabecchi,</hi> who is the <hi>Great Dukes</hi> Library-keeper, and is a person of most wonderful Civility, and full of Candor, as well as he is learned beyond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, assured me, that this could be no other than a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of the <hi>Library-keepers</hi>; he said, such a discovery could not have been made, without making so much noise; that he must have heard of it. He added, there was not one man in <hi>Florence,</hi> that either understood <hi>Greek,</hi> or that examined <hi>Manuscripts</hi>; so that he assured me, I could not build on what an ignorant <hi>Library-keeper</hi> had told me: So I set down this matter as I found it, without building much on it. <hi>Florence</hi> is much sunk from what is was; for they do not reckon, that there are above fifty thousand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In short; the dispeopling of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> and most of the <hi>Principalities of Italy,</hi> but chiefly of the <hi>Popes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,</hi> which are more abandoned than any other part of <hi>Italy,</hi> seemed to flow from nothing but the Severity of the <hi>Government</hi>; and the great Decay of <hi>Trade</hi>: For the greatest Trade of <hi>Italy</hi> being in <hi>Silk,</hi> the vast Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Silks</hi> that the <hi>East-India Companies</hi> bring into <hi>Europe,</hi> hath quite ruined all those that deal in this Manufacture: Yet this is not the chief Cause of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling of those rich <hi>Countrys</hi>; the Severity of the <hi>Tax</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the true Reason: notwithstanding all that Decay of Trade, the Taxes are still kept up. Beside this, the vast Wealth of the <hi>Convents,</hi> where the only people of <hi>Italy</hi> are to be found, that live not only at their Ease, but in great plenty and Luxury, makes many forsake all sort of Industry, and seek for a retreat in one of those Seats of Pleasure; so that the People do not increase fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Am now in the last stage of my <hi>Voyage</hi> over <hi>Italy</hi>; for since my last from <hi>Florence,</hi> I have not only got hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but have been in <hi>Naples</hi>; and have now satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my Curiosity so fully, that I intend to leave this place within a day or two, and go to <hi>Civita vecchia,</hi> and from thence by <hi>Sea</hi> to <hi>Marseilles</hi>; and so avoid an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Winters Journey over the <hi>Alps.</hi> It is true; I lose the sight of <hi>Turin, Genoa,</hi> and some other <hi>Courts</hi>: but tho I am told, these deserve well the pains of the Journey; yet when one rises from a great meal, no Delicacies, how much soever they might tempt him at another time, can provoke his appetite: So I confess freely, that the sight of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> have so set my stomach that way, that the Curiosity of seeing new places is now very low with me; and indeed, these that I have of late seen are such, that places which at another time would please me much, would now make but a slight and cold Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
            <p>All the way from <hi>Florence,</hi> through the <hi>Great Dukes</hi> Country, looked so sad, that I concluded, it must be the most dispeopled of all <hi>Italy:</hi> but indeed, I changed my note when I came into the <hi>Popes T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

quite deserted. And that wide <hi>Town,</hi> which is of so great a compass, hath yet so few Inhabitants, and those look so poor and miserable, that the people in the ordinary <hi>Towns</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in its worst Places, make a better appearance. When I was within a days Journey of <hi>Rome,</hi> I fancied that the Neighbourhood of so great a <hi>City</hi> must mend the matter; but I was much disappointed; for a Soil that was so rich, and lay so sweetly, that it far exceeded any thing I ever saw out of <hi>Italy,</hi> had neither Inhabitants in it, nor Cattel upon it, to the tenth part of what it could bear: The surprize that this gave me, increased upon me as I went out of <hi>Rome</hi> on its other side, chiefly all the way to <hi>Naples,</hi> and on the way to <hi>Civita Vecchia</hi>; for that vast and rich Champian <hi>Country,</hi> that runs all along to <hi>Terracina,</hi> which from <hi>Civita Vecchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is well enough known, what a Plague the <hi>Banditi</hi> have been to the <hi>Kingdom</hi>; for they going in Troops, not only robbed the Country, but were able to resist an ordinary Body of Souldiers, if they had set on them: These travelled about seeking for spoil all the Summer long; but in Winter they were harboured by some of the <hi>Neapolitan Barrons,</hi> who gave them Quarter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when the present <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Viceroy</hi> sent a great body against them, but they desended themselves for sometime vigorously, and in one sally they killed five hundred men: but at last, seeing that they were like to be hard prest, and that the <hi>Viceroy</hi> intended to come against them in Person, they accepted of the terms that he offered them, which was, a pardon for what was past, both as to life and Gallies, and six pence a day for their entertainment i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are kept in a large Prison, and now and then, as he sees cause for it, he sends some few of them up and down to serve in <hi>Garrisons.</hi> And thus, beyond all mens expectation, he finished this matter in a very few months; and the <hi>Kingdom of Naples,</hi> that hath been so long a scene of Pillage and Robbery, is now so much changed, that in no place of <hi>Europe</hi> do the Subjects injoy a more entire Security. As for the <hi>Coin,</hi> it, as all the other <hi>Spanish Mony,</hi> is so subject to Clipping, that the whole mony of <hi>Naples</hi> is now light, and far below the true value; so the <hi>Viceroy</hi> hath resolved to redress this: he considers, that the crying down of Mony, that passeth upon the publick Credit, is a robbing of those in whose hands the mony happens to be, when such Proclamations are put out; and therefore he takes a method that is more general, in which every one will bear his share, so that none will be crushed by it.

               <hi>Physicians</hi> in <hi>Naples</hi> are brought under the Scandal of <hi>Atheism</hi>; and it is certain, that in <hi>Italy,</hi> men of sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching understandings, who have no other Idea of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> but that which they see received among them, are very naturally tempted to disbelieve it quite; for they believing it all alike in gross, without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and finding such notorious Cheats as appear in many parts of their <hi>Religion,</hi> are upon that induced to disbelieve the whole.

               </gap>magination to think, that the <hi>Christians,</hi> in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, were able to carry on such a work; for as this prodigious digging into such <hi>Rocks,</hi> must have been a very visible thing by the Mountains of Rubbish that must have been brought out, and by the vast number of Hands that must have been imployed in it; so it is absurd to think, that they could hold their <hi>Assemblies</hi> amidst the annoyance of so much corruption. I found the Steams so strong, that tho I am as little subject to Vapours as most men, yet I had all the day long after I was in them, which was not near an hour, a Confusion, and as it were a boyling in my Head, that disordered me extreamly; and if there is now so much <hi>stagnating Air</hi> there, this must have been sensible in a more eminent and insufferable manner while there were vast numbers of bodies rotting in those <hi>Niches.</hi> But besides this improbability, that presents it self from the nature of the thing, I called to mind a passage of a <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that was <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> after the middle of the <hi>third Century,</hi> which is preserved by <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> in his sixth <hi>Book,</hi> Chapter 43. in which we have the State of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time set forth. There were forty six <hi>Presbyters,</hi> seven <hi>Deacons,</hi> as many <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons,</hi> and ninety four of the Inferior <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> among them: there were also fifteen hundred <hi>Widows,</hi> and other poor maintained out of the publick Charities. It may be reasonably supposed, that the numbers of the <hi>Christians</hi> were as great when this <hi>Epistle</hi> was writ, as they were at any time before <hi>Constantine's</hi> dayes; for as this was writ at the end of that long Peace, of which both <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> speak, that had continued above a hundred years; so after this time, there was such a succession of <hi>Persecutions,</hi> that came so thick one upon another, after short intervals of quiet, that we cannot think the number<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>Christians</hi> increased much beyond what they were at this time. Now there are two particulars in this State of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> upon which one may make a probable estimate of the numbers of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>; the one is, their <hi>Poor,</hi> which were but <hi>fifteen
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65702:89"/>
hundred</hi>: now upon an exact survey, it will be found, that where the poor are well looked to, their number rises generally to be the <hi>thirtieth</hi> or <hi>fortieth</hi> part of mankind; and this may be well believed to be the proportion of the <hi>Poor</hi> among the <hi>Christians</hi> of that Age: For as their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was vigorous and tender, so we find <hi>Celsus, Iulian, Lucian, Prophiry,</hi> and others, Object this to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> of that time, that their Charities to the <hi>Poor</hi> drew va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The same Author also tells us, that <hi>Pertinax</hi> buried <hi>Commodus's</hi> body, and so saved it from the Rage of the People; and here is a positive Evidence, that <hi>Burying</hi> was the common practice of that time. The same learned person has since my first conversation with him upon this subject, suggested to me two passages of <hi>Festus Pompeius,</hi> that seem to determiné this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that tell us, by what names those <hi>Catacombs</hi>

            <p>It is true, it is very probable, that as we see some of the <hi>Roman Families</hi> continued to <hi>Bury</hi> their Dead, even when <hi>Burning</hi> was the more common Custom; so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps others continued after this to hurn their dead, the thing being Indifferent, and no Law being made about it; and therefore it was particularly objected to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> after this time, that they abhorred the Custom of <hi>Burning</hi> the Bodies of the Dead, which is mentioned by <hi>Minutius Felix</hi>; but this or any other evidences, that may be brought from <hi>Medalls</hi> of Consecrations after this time, will only prove, that some were still Burnt, and that the <hi>Christians</hi> practised <hi>Burying</hi> Universally, as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65702:91"/>
expressing their belief of the Resurrection; whereas the <hi>Heathens</hi> held the thing Indifferent. It is also clear, from the many genuine <hi>Inscriptions</hi> that have been. found in the <hi>Catacombs,</hi> which bear the dates of the <hi>Consuls,</hi> that these were the common <hi>Burial-Places</hi> of all the <hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> Century; for I do not remember, that there is any one da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he <hi>Christians</hi> might have had their Quarters, and their Walks in those common <hi>Burial-places,</hi> where they laid their <hi>Dead,</hi> and which might have been known among them, tho it is not likely, that they would in times of <hi>Perseoution</hi> make such <hi>Inscriptions</hi> as might have exposed the <hi>Bodies</hi> of their dead Friends to the Rage of their Enemies.

And this silence in an <hi>Age,</hi> in which <hi>Superstition</hi> was going on at so great a rate, has much force in it; for so vast a Work, as those <hi>Catacombs</hi> are, must have been well known to all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> It were easy to carry this much further, and to shew, that the <hi>Bas Reliefs,</hi> that have been found in some of those <hi>Catacombs,</hi> have nothing of the beauty of the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> time. This is also more discernable in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Inscriptions</hi> that are more <hi>Gothick</hi> than <hi>Roman</hi>; and there are so many <hi>Inscriptions</hi> relating to Fables, that it is plain, these were of later times; and we see by <hi>Saint Ierom,</hi> that the <hi>Monks</hi> began, even in his time, to drive a trade of <hi>Reliques</hi>; so it is no wonder, that to raise the credit of such a heap, as was never to be exhausted, they made some miserable <hi>Sculptures,</hi> and some <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions</hi>;

there was no doubt left of that, nor had they given any sort of Scandal in the change of their <hi>Sex</hi>; And if there had been any room left to suspect a Cheat or Disguise, the proceedings would have been both more severe and more secret; and these persons would have been Burnt, or at least put to Death in some terrible manner. Some <hi>Physicians</hi> and <hi>Chirurgions</hi> were appointed to examin the matter, and at last, after a long and exact inquiry, they were judged to be absolved from their <hi>vows,</hi> and were dismissed from the Obligation of a <hi>Religious</hi> Life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to go in <hi>mens habit.</hi> One of them was a <hi>Valet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>And since I am upon the subject of the Changes that have been made in <hi>Nature,</hi> I shall add one of another fort, that I examined while I was at <hi>Geneva</hi>: There is a <hi>Minister</hi> of S. <hi>Gervais,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gody,</hi> who hath a <hi>Daughter,</hi> that is now <hi>sixteen Years</hi> old; Her <hi>Nurse</hi> had an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thickness of hearing; at a year old, the <hi>Child</hi> spoke all those little words, that Children begin usually to learn at that age, but she made no progress; yet this was not observed, till it was too late; and as she grew to he two years old, they preceived then that she had lost her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and was so deaf, that ever since, tho she hears great noises, yet she hears nothing that one can speak to her. It seems, while the milk of her <hi>Nurse,</hi> was more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and that the <hi>Child</hi> suckt more moderately the first year, those humors in the Blood and Milk had not that effect on her, that appeared after she came to suck more violently, and that her <hi>Nurse's</hi> Milk being in less quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was thicker, and more charged with that vapour that occasioned the deafness.

It soon appeared how faithfully he pursued the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> of his <hi>Countrey,</hi> and how little he regarded his own. He rejected all <hi>Propositions of Peace</hi> that were hurtful to his <hi>Country,</hi> without so much as considering the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that were offered to himself, (in which you know that I write upon sure grounds.) He refused the offer of the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of its Chief <hi>City,</hi> that was made to him by a solemn <hi>Deputation,</hi> being satisfied with that <hi>Authority</hi> which had been so long maintained by his <hi>Ancestors</hi> with so much glory, and being justly sensible, how much the breaking in upon established <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,</hi> is fatal even to those that seem to get by it.

               <p>EVery body almost knows what 't is which in <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; especially at <hi>Rome,</hi> they call the <hi>Montes</hi>; it it is much like the Rents upon the Town house at <hi>Paris.</hi> The <hi>Popes</hi> having occasion of <hi>money,</hi> borrow great sums of particular Persons at 4 <hi>per Cent</hi> Interest; This they call at <hi>Rome</hi> the Establishment of the <hi>Monte,</hi> that is, the Creation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Officers, and the assignment of several Rents for the payment of those who have lent Mony to the <hi>Pope.</hi> The present <hi>Pope,</hi> finding the <hi>Chamber</hi> engaged to the annual payments of I know not how many Millions of <hi>Roman Crowns</hi> Interest, to those that had ient Money upon the <hi>Monte,</hi> resolved in part to reduce and lessen the great Sum of Money which the <hi>Interest</hi> amounted to, and having for this purpose raised several Millions of <hi>Roman Crowns,</hi> he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted those that had money upon the <hi>Monte,</hi> that they should come and receive their principal money, unless they would take 3 per cent Interest for the 4 per cent which they formerly received; w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ereupon, there being really no Trade in all the Ecclesiastical Territories, and the Lands worth nothing, and that the Estates of the Nobility were all sold to a penny, all Persons who had Money upon the <hi>Monte,</hi> not knowing how to Imploy it to advantage elsewhere, let it there remain, contenting themselves with three <hi>per cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their yearly Income, and the <hi>Chamber</hi> got I know not how many Millions of <hi>Crowns</hi> yearly by this Retrenchment of one per cent.</p>
               <p>It is almost incredible the Immence Sums the <hi>Pope</hi> hath raised by retrenching of many superf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I ought not here to omit relating, that the <hi>Inns,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> in <hi>Romania,</hi> and between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> are very sordid and incommodious, one may give a pretty good guess at the prodigious Wealth belonging to the <hi>Clergy</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of Naples</hi> by the great quantity of plate, Vessels and Statues of Silver in the <hi>Churches</hi>; and by the riches and magnificent Furniture of their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Vestments of the <hi>Priests.</hi> One may upon the whole matter make this Important Reflection, that if the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> doth not think of some expedient, to hinder the <hi>Clergy</hi> from Increasing their <hi>Estates</hi> in <hi>Lands,</hi> which they do daily, they will in a very little time become Masters of the greatest part of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi>; for they are already possessed of more than the half of the <hi>Lands</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> besides the other vast profits they make continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under pretence of <hi>Service to the Church,</hi> for their <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Buildings, Burials, Marriages, Confessions,</hi> and by their <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and the <hi>Legacies</hi> left them by Will.</p>
               <p>Tho these are Remarks made in hast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they may be of use to the Author.</p>
               <p>I know several very pleasant Stories of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> at <hi>Naples.</hi> The <hi>Prince of Salerme</hi> gave them the moiety of a great House which he had at <hi>Naples,</hi> and thereupon an Inscription was engaven in Capital Letters upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispice
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65702:130"/>
of the House, of the Donation thereof given to the <hi>Iesuits</hi> by the said <hi>Prince</hi>; within these few years the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have turn'd the <hi>Heires</hi> of the <hi>Prince of Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rme</hi> out of possession of the other Moiety of the said House, and have defaced the Inscription upon the House: and all this they have done by Colour of Law and Justice. Upon the first Establishment of the Society of <hi>Iesuits,</hi> the <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> who are very rich, voluntarily assigned them a yearly <hi>Pension</hi> of several thousand Ducats; but the <hi>Carthusians</hi> perceiving that of late years several of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi> were grown mighty rich, resolved to withdraw the said <hi>Pension</hi>; the <hi>Iesuites</hi> hereupon went to Law with them, and obtained Sentence, that the said <hi>Pension</hi> should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. The <hi>Iesuits</hi> have got a very considerable part of the Lands of the Nobility in the <hi>Kingdom of Naples.</hi> All the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,</hi> of what Order soever they be, who have Houses at <hi>Naples,</hi> have the Priviledge of purchasing all Houses that are contiguous to them on the one side or the other to the very end of the Street, in order to make their Houses entire and to stand alone like an <hi>Island</hi>; and for this purpose they have no more to do, than only pay the Proprietor for his House, not according to the present Value, but as it was last sold, perhaps 50, 60, or 100 years ago, and so hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from Father to Son successively to the person then in possession.</p>
               <p>Many other very considerable Remarks might be made of the divers Triks and Methods the <hi>Clergy</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> make use of to wheed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
