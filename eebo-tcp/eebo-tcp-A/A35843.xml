            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DEAR and Valiant Children of the most High, your faithful standing in the meek Spirit, to bear your Testimony for the Lord, in what he calls you unto, is a sweet perfume in the presence of the Lord, and a great refreshing to the hearts of his people; Therefore, abide in the pu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Oh Lord sweeten the passage of thy people, and make their Cups pleasant, thou suffers to be given them to drink, that thy mighty power may be manifest in all them that love not their lives to death, to do thy will this day; and plead their cause in bastening their deliverance, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of all Sions enemies, and the renown of thy great Name for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:46285:2"/>Dear Brethren and Sisters in the meek Spirit of our God, my life goes and abides with you, with the forceable love of the whole Church of the first born; Oh lift up your heads' &amp; let not the fear of the Sickness or any Representation of any Evil enter you, but all in staidness in the Light, Life, thought and will of God which is perfect in it self, and abiding as is written, God will keep every one of you in perfect peace all your dayes in every condition, and will keep you in sweet peace and unity one with another to the praise and glory of the name of our God, whose presence is with you, and will sweeten your passage in what ever you are to go through to the praise and glory of the Name of the Lord for ever, who will arise more and more, and plead our Cause in the sight of a mighty people, whom he will make to confess that you that are faithful, are the Children of the most High God, the righteous Seed that the Lord hath blessed, and it will be well every way with all the faithful and suffering people, and the blessing of God shall be upon us and our Children for ever that love the Lord Jesus this day. And the hundred forty four thousands shall stand upon Mount Sion, where some of the number is already established; and they shall sing the new Songs that not any shall learn but those that are redeemed from the Earth, who shall make the eares of all the enemies of God to tingle, and their hearts shall fail, and paleness gather into their faces, for dreadful will be the vengeance of the Lord upon Sions enemies, and great fearfulness shall surprise them; they shall run to fro like Vagabonds as <hi>Cain</hi> did, and not know where to hide their heads, for where ever they are the Lord will find them out and banish them from place to place, untill he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his glory upon them, in laying all low that withstands his arising, for he will dash the potsheards of the Earth to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and they shall lament and cry out, and gnaw their Tongues for pain, when you faithful, beloved, ever honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Children that endure unto the end, shall shout and sing praises and magnifie the Lord, and say, Oh how righteous are thy Judgments, oh thou King of Saints; for thou hast pleaded our cause and turned our sorrows into everlasting Joy, and hast overthrown all thy enemies that withstand the rising of thy Glory, that a door may be opened to gather our Brethren from far, and our Sisters from the ends of the Earth: Therefore will we sing of thy Goodness with Praises, Praises, Hallelujahs, and high Praises, for thou art worthy over all for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My dear Companions with me salutes you all in the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest love of our God, where neither Sea nor Land can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate; but in the bowels of love will we imbrace one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the chast life where no vulterous eye can behold our Joy and Felicity in the Lord our God; In whom fare you well, fare you well saith the Soul of your dear Brother in the name of the Lord for ever, both you that are for Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, and you that stand in a faithful Testimony in that City where the Lord hath sent his destroying Angel to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the pleasure of his will.</p>
            <p>And in the tender bowels of the love of God, I desire you all [in this gloomy dismal dark day that's come upon that City] put you on the shield of Faith, and in the Light of the Covenant, stand single before the Lord to be cloathed with the garment of Eternal Salvation, that you may reign over all fearfulness and unbelief, that every particular may stand as saviours on mount Sion in the midst of a desolate people, for this is the harvest of the great God in that City wherein he is reaping, threshing and winnowing the chaffe from the Wheat, and making a short work in the earth for his Seed sake, and many that shall have their lives given them for a prey shall receive the Word of Eternal Life in that City, and great shall be the number who shall submit to the Government of Christ, and they shall bless the Lord;
