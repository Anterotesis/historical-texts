            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE By Several PRACTITIONERS in and about the City of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is high time, ≈øince there have been already publi≈øhed many Treati≈øes in this kind, for us to declare our thoughts for the publick good. We have peru≈øed all that have been in this nature in Engli≈øh, and find them ≈øtrangely deficient, ≈øo crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with unnece≈ø≈øary Notions, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mi≈øtakes, that we thought it fit to give you warning of them, to prevent for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the many unfortunate Mi≈øchiefs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon ignorance of the≈øe Matters.</p>
                  <p>It is admirable to us, that our Country ≈øhould be ≈øo much deluded, to build all their practice on ≈øuch Authors, that have not at all conduced to any con≈øiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb facs="tcp:59975:3"/>
in this ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary and u≈øeful Art, as the pre≈øerving of Mankind. How many mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Volumes have the≈øe late times brought forth? Not to di≈øparage any that have de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but in ≈øo weighty a Concernment as this, we mu≈øt ≈øtand upon our integrity. There hath been a rea≈øonable intention in the publi≈øhers of ≈øome Books, <hi>viz. The Birth of Man,</hi> the mo≈øt Ancient, but very much unfurni≈øhed; as al≈øo the Books of <hi>Child-birth, The Expert Midwife,</hi> the wor≈øt that hath been written in that kind, in French; and it's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt a Miracle to us, that Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> a Man whom we otherways re≈øpect, ≈øhould de≈øcend ≈øo low, as to borrow his imperfect Treati≈øe from tho≈øe wretched Volumes, ≈øome of which are before mentioned; and we mu≈øt deal faithfully with you, that, that ≈ømall piece of his, intituled, <hi>The Directory for Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes,</hi> is the mo≈øt de≈øperately deficient of them all; except he writ it for nece≈ø≈øity, he could certainly have never been ≈øo idle to have expo≈øed it to the light.</p>
                  <p>Now, to give you a true information of what we have here done for your good, we ≈øhall not only ju≈øtifie what is here contain'd from our own Experiences, but fully demon≈øtrate from the Writings of the be≈øt Practi≈øers both of the <hi>French, Spani≈øh,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and other Nations; and we mu≈øt clearly confe≈øs, that we are highly obliged to the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb facs="tcp:59975:3"/>
labours of that mo≈øt Famous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the World, <hi>Madam Loui≈øe Burgeois,</hi> late Midwife to the Queen of <hi>France</hi>: The prai≈øes that we read of all tho≈øe that ever heard of her, are not ≈øo much a flouri≈øh, as truth; for her rea≈øons are ≈øolid experiences, and her witne≈ø≈øes have been all of the mo≈øt eminent Per≈øons of <hi>France</hi>; and not only of her, but as we have already expre≈øt, of the mo≈øt excellent known Men and Women of this Art of other Countries: It's upon this account that we break the barriers, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øtand the brunt of all Cen≈øures.</p>
                  <p>The chief occa≈øion of this Book, is, to make it a great Exemplary, and School, where Medicine married to the Midwife's indu≈øtry, may teach every one the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects of this art of Midwifry.</p>
                  <p>And now knowing, Reader, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts herein contain'd, which have ever had happy ≈øucce≈ø≈øes, are not made publick to the World on any other de≈øign, than for the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of ≈øuch per≈øons, whom either the want of fortune, or opportunity denieth ≈øuch ≈øudden helps, neither can we be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bleeding hearts, if we but con≈øider how many have been lo≈øt by the unskilfulne≈øs of tho≈øe that attempted this great Work; nor ≈øhould we have pro≈øtrated our reputation and private experiences, but to correct the frequent mi≈øtake of mo≈øt <hi>Midwives,</hi> who,
<pb facs="tcp:59975:4"/>
re≈øting too boldly upon the common way of delivering Women, neglect all the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome and profitable Rules of Art, which might concern them in the occult Di≈øea≈øes of Women, as al≈øo of the Anatomical parts of the Body. Thus having di≈øcharged our Duty, we have no more to write, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the Book it ≈øelf. We are the hearty Well-wi≈øhers of your good,</p>

                  <p>THE Book≈øeller de≈øigning another Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Midwifry, took care to have the Anatomick part compleated, and the whole Enlarged con≈øiderably, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any one that will compare the Fourth Edition with this.</p>
                  <p>It is a plain and u≈øeful Treati≈øe of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry, and is moreover ≈øtock'd with great variety of approved Remedies for the Di≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of Women and Children, and therefore may well de≈øerve to be accounted the be≈øt Book extant upon this Subject.</p>

                     <p>THE con≈øideration of the≈øe things is ≈øo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for the purpo≈øe of this Book, that they require not only a deep meditation but the preheminence to take up the fir≈øt thoughts of tho≈øe who would arrive to the knowledge of a thing ≈øo much needful to all mankind. And it may be rea≈øonably fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that many Women do mi≈øs their de≈øign, becau≈øe they know nothing but the out≈øide of things: ≈øo that in matters of extremity, becau≈øe they are ignorant of the ≈øtructure of the parts, they cannot tell how to go about their work. We ≈øhall therefore begin with the Anatomy of the privy parts, the Organs of generation, whereby through pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation is con≈øerved a perennity of mankind, which nature has denied to particulars.

                     <p>In Man, ≈øome of the≈øe parts afford matter for the Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spermatic Arteries; others bring back again the blood that is ≈øuperfluous to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Seed, and to the nouri≈øhment of the Stones, and the≈øe are the Spermatic Veins; and both the Arteries and Veins were formerly called prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                        <p>AMong the Spermatic Ve≈ø≈øels are to be con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fir≈øt, two veins, and two arteries: the≈øe are carried downward from the ≈ømall guts to the Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and are much bigger in Men than they are in Women.</p>
                        <p>The original of the≈øe Veins is not always the ≈øame; for commonly the right Vein ri≈øeth out of the <hi>Hollow vein,</hi> a little below the ≈øource or original of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgent; but the lea≈øt takes his original from the lower part of the Emulgent it ≈øelf. Yet ≈øometimes it hath a branch carried to it from the trunk of the hollow Vein.</p>
                        <p>The middle part of the≈øe veins runs directly through the Loyns, re≈øting upon the <hi>Lumbal</hi> Mu≈øcle, a thin Membrane only intervening; and thus having gone above half its journey, it branches out and di≈øtributes it ≈øelf to the near adjoyning filmy parts of the Body. The uttermo≈øt part of the≈øe ve≈ø≈øels is carried beyond the Midriff to the Stones, yet do they not pa≈øs through the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> but de≈øcend with a ≈ømall nerve and the Mu≈øcle called <hi>Crema≈øter,</hi> through the Duplicity of the Midriff; when it approaches near the Stones, it is joyned with an Artery: and now the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels which were before a little ≈øevered one from the other, are by a film ri≈øing from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> clo≈øed up, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59975:10"/>
bound both together; and ≈øo twi≈øting up, like the young tendrils of a Vine, they are carried to the end of the Stones.</p>
                        <p>The arteries which are a≈ø≈øociated to the≈øe veins, take their original a little beneath the Emulgent vein, whence they de≈øcend downward, and a little from their beginning or original, they are joyn'd to the≈øe veins, till they are clo≈øed together by an <hi>Ana≈øtom√¥≈øis</hi> or Ino≈øculation, ending like a Piramid.</p>
                        <p>It has been generally taught, that there are ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ino≈øculations of the Arteries, with the Veins in their pa≈ø≈øage, whereby the blood of the Veins and Arteries are mixed; but ≈øince the knowledge of the Circulation of the Blood, this Opinion has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; for the blood in the Arteries goes down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Stones, and that in the veins a≈øcends from them; and therefore if the≈øe two Ve≈ø≈øels ≈øhould open one into the other, the Blood in one of them mu≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily be thru≈øt back, or el≈øe ≈øtopping, ≈øtretch and break the Ve≈ø≈øels; but the truth is, the blood, both for the nouri≈øhment of the Stones, and the making of Seed, flows down by the Arteries only in an even cour≈øe, without any windings and twinings, like the tendrils of Vines, ≈øo much talked of, as the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Anatomi≈øt <hi>de Graef</hi> ≈øays he has found by frequent in≈øpection. The Veins carry back from the Stones, what of the blood remains from their nouri≈øhment, and making of Seed, and the≈øe indeed come out of the Stones, with a va≈øt number of Roots, whereby they ≈øuck up the ≈øaid Blood, and are mo≈øt admirably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven, and ino≈øculated one with another, 'till about four or five fingers breadth above the Stone, which ≈øpace is called the Pyramidal Body.</p>
                        <p>Two things are to be noted. Fir≈øt, That the≈øe ≈øper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Veins have from their ri≈øe to their end ≈øeveral

Valves, which open upwards, and ≈øo ≈øuffer the Blood to a≈øcend towards the hollow Vein, but not to return back again. Secondly, That tho' the Spermatick Arteries go a direct cour≈øe in Men, yet in Brutes they are more complicated, and twi≈øted with the Veins, but without any opening of one into another. There are Nerves and Lympheducts, that pa≈øs into the Te≈øticles together with the Ve≈ø≈øels of preparation.</p>

                        <p>THE U≈øe of tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels which are called the Ve≈ø≈øels of Preparation, is chiefly to attract out of the hollow Vein, or left Emulgent, the mo≈øt pure and exqui≈øitely concocted Blood, which is mo≈øt apt to be converted into Seed; which they contain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, giving unto it a certain rude form of Seed in tho≈øe parts that lie as it were in certain pleights or folds, which they do by a peculiar property bequeathed to them.</p>
                        <p>Another U≈øe of them is gathered by their ≈øituation; for as they are now ≈øituated, that is to ≈øay, the right Vein coming from the <hi>Hollow</hi> Vein, and the left from the <hi>Emulgent</hi>: This incovenience is avoided, that the left Vein is not forced to pa≈øs over the great Artery, and ≈øo be in danger of breaking, by rea≈øon of the ≈øwift motion of the Artery. Moreover, there being a nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity that Male and Female ≈øhould be begot, it is fit that there ≈øhould be Seed proper for the generation of both Sexes, whereof ≈øome mu≈øt be hotter, and ≈øome mu≈øt be colder; and therefore Nature hath ≈øo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that the hotter Seed ≈øhould proceed from the right Vein for the generation of man, and the colder from the left, for the generation of Females. The left
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59975:11"/>
Vein hath al≈øo this property to draw from the <hi>Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> the more ≈øerous and le≈øs pure Blood, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the ≈øerous humour might ≈øtir up Venery by its ≈øalt and acrimonious ≈øub≈øtance; and therefore it is ob≈øerved, that tho≈øe who have the left Stone bigger, are mo≈øt full of Seed, and mo≈øt prone to Venery.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Veins are ≈øo far from preparing the Seed, as that they only bring back, what was ≈øuperfluous from the making it. And indeed the Arteries in Men do no more merit the name of preparing Ve≈ø≈øels, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Seed, than the Gullet in re≈øpect of the Chyle, or the chyliferous thoracick duct, in regard to the Blood. But however we continue the old Names, declaring only again≈øt the rea≈øon of them.</p>

                        <p>THE ≈øub≈øtance of the Stones is glandulous, or kernelly, white, ≈øoft, loo≈øe, ≈øpongy and hollow, having ≈øundry ve≈ø≈øels di≈øper≈øed thorow them.</p>
                        <p>Now although the ≈øub≈øtance of the Te≈øticles be mo≈øt ≈øoft and moi≈øt, yet doth not this moi≈øtne≈øs con≈øtitute an uniform, or homogeneal body; for the ≈øub≈øtance of the Stones is wholly di≈ø≈øimilar, and full of fibres. The≈øe fibres al≈øo ≈øeem to be of a different ≈øub≈øtance from that of the Stones, being only cloathed with the fle≈øh of the Stones, as the fibres of the Mu≈øcles are inwardly nervous, but covered over with the fle≈øh of the Mu≈øcles. The≈øe fibres again differ in this, that the fibres of the Te≈øticles are hollow, but the fibres of the Stones full and ≈øub≈øtantial. The≈øe fibres are ≈øaid to come from the ≈øpermatic ve≈ø≈øels, and thence branch them≈øelves forth thorow the Te≈øticles, by which that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59975:14"/>
part of the Seed, which is over and above what ≈øerves for the nouri≈øhment of the Te≈øticles, is drawn forth and kept for procreation.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the temper of the Stones, they would ≈øooner be thought cold than hot, if that Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, were true, that, <hi>All white things are cold, and all red things hot.</hi> Notwith≈øtanding, becau≈øe nature is known to abhor all coldne≈øs in the work of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Therefore we mu≈øt pre≈øume to affirm the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Stones to be hot, for they always abound with blood, and a pure ≈øpirit that can never be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heat: be≈øides that, heat is requir'd for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of this blood, and the changing it into ≈øeed; yet, it is very temperate, as appears by the ≈øoftne≈øs of the ≈øub≈øtance: for as coldne≈øs and drine≈øs is the cau≈øe of hardne≈øs, ≈øo heat and moi≈øture is the cau≈øe of ≈øoftne≈øs.</p>
                        <p>Neverthele≈øs, we are to under≈øtand this, that the temper of the Stones are not alike in all, for in ≈øome they are far colder than in others. And therefore tho≈øe, who have hot Te≈øticles, are more ≈øalacious and prone to venereal actions, having the places near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout much more hairy, and their Te≈øticles much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than others. Tho≈øe that have their Te≈øticles cold, find every thing contrary.</p>
                        <p>The greate≈øt heat is in the right Te≈øticle, becau≈øe it receives more pure, and hotter blood from the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Vein, and the great Artery; the left colder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it receives a more impure, and ≈øerous blood from the Emulgent Vein.</p>

For the blood being received by the ≈øpermatic Ve≈ø≈øels, and there beginning to change its colour, is by and by received by the deferent Ve≈ø≈øels, or the ve≈ø≈øels which carry the blood ≈øo prepared to the Te≈øticles; where it is for a while contained, and afterwards being carried to the Stones, is by them made Seed, and the la≈øt work perfected.

Whether the Stones are the only efficient cau≈øe of the Seed is not here to be di≈øputed, being only a nice point, and no way profitable.

                        <p>THE ≈øtructure of the Te≈øticles being thus known; it remains that we ≈øhew you their u≈øe. This is fir≈øt di≈øcovered from their ≈øituation. For of tho≈øe Creatures that have Stones, ≈øome have them in their bodies, as all Fowl; others have them without, though not pendent; others have them hanging downward, as men. Men therefore have their Te≈øticles without their bodies for two cau≈øes; fir≈øt, becau≈øe it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Te≈øticles of the Male ≈øhould be bigger and hotter than tho≈øe of the Female; ≈øo that it were impo≈ø≈øible for them to be contained within the body, becau≈øe of their quantity. Be≈øides, the Seed of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59975:15"/>
Male being the effective original of the Creature, and therefore hotte≈øt; it is al≈øo required that the Seed ≈øhould be more abundant than could be contained in the Te≈øticles, were they placed within the body: for the ≈øeminary pa≈ø≈øages mu≈øt have been le≈øs, and the veins them≈øelves would not have afforded ≈øuch plenty of matter as now they do.</p>
                        <p>The motion of the Te≈øticles is al≈øo to be con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; by which they move ≈øometimes upward and ≈øometimes downward. The one of the≈øe motions which is made upward is voluntary, as being made by the Mu≈øcles; but the motion downward is a forced motion, not hapning without the laxity of the Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; the Te≈øticles, through their own weight, falling downwards. The≈øe Mu≈øcles are called <hi>Crema≈øters,</hi> their u≈øe being to draw up the Te≈øticles to ≈øhorten the way of the Ejaculation of the Seed; as al≈øo to keep the ve≈ø≈øels from being di≈øtended too far by the weight of the Te≈øticles.</p>
                        <p>The u≈øe of the Tunicles is now to be ≈øpoken of; and fir≈øt, of that which is outermo≈øt, and is called by the Latins <hi>Scrotum,</hi> being the pur≈øe wherein the Te≈øticles are contained. It is made to wrinkle it ≈øelf up, and to let it ≈øelf loo≈øe, that it may be large enough for the Te≈øticles when they ≈øwell with plenty of Seed, and to wrinkle up again, when the Te≈øticles being emptied, and ≈øo becoming le≈øs, are drawn upward. The other Coats, or Tunicles, are al≈øo made for the defence of the Stones, but ≈øo thin and light that they ≈øhould not oppre≈øs the Stones with their weight; that which is called <hi>Erythroides</hi> hath many veins for the nouri≈øhment of the adjacent parts.

                        <p>THat pa≈ø≈øage which comes from the head of the Te≈øticles to the root of the Yard, is called the Ejaculatory Ve≈ø≈øel. This, as I ≈øaid before, ri≈øes from the head of the Te≈øticles, and joyning downward to the Te≈øticle, de≈øcends to the bottom, and thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflected again, and annext to the preparing Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, it returns again to the head of the Te≈øticle; from thence it proceeds upward from the Te≈øticles, till it touch the bone of the ≈ømall guts, ≈øtill keeping clo≈øe to the preparing Ve≈ø≈øel, till it pierce the production of the <hi>Hypoga≈øtrium.</hi> Thence tending downward through the hollowne≈øs of the hip, it ≈ølides between the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the ≈øtreight Gut, till it reach the glandulous <hi>Pro≈øtatae,</hi> or Fore≈øtanders, and fix it ≈øelf at the foot, or root of the Yard, and there end. It is not all one at the beginning, and at the end; for at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, while it remains among the Tunicles of the Te≈øticles, it is full of windings and turnings; near the end, it hath many little bladders like to warts.</p>
                        <p>Now we mu≈øt under≈øtand that the≈øe Seminary Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels do not only contain the Seed, but they perfect and concoct it, having a ≈øeminifick, or Seed-making qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which they borrow from the Te≈øticles: There are other u≈øes of the≈øe ≈øeminary Ve≈ø≈øels, for, near the original of this ve≈ø≈øel, that is to ≈øay, the head of the Te≈øticles, many ≈ømall pa≈ø≈øages, or as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-pipes, do ≈øtretch them≈øelves forward into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Te≈øticle, into which the genital Seed that remains is remitted, and al≈øo drawn, or ≈øucked from tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øages; this ≈øeminary pa≈ø≈øage is at length wound above the Te≈øticles, adjoyning all along, but

no where incorporated into the body of the Te≈øticle, unle≈øs at the bottom, in which place it is thought that the Seed doth again in≈øinuate it ≈øelf into the Te≈øticles through tho≈øe hollow fibres: being thence propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and continually making ≈øupply to the Stones.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted al≈øo, that the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels while they move to the root of the Yard, do not go by ≈øtreight pa≈ø≈øages, which would be then very ≈øhort but by crooked windings and turnings making the pa≈ø≈øages as long as may be, that they may have longer time to contain and prepare the Seed.</p>

                        <p>AT the end of the <hi>Deferent</hi> Ve≈ø≈øels on both ≈øides, are certain little bladders, knit, and joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and placed between the Bladder and the right gut; the la≈øt of which, together with the ≈øeminary Ve≈ø≈øel, is terminated, in the <hi>Pro≈øtatae,</hi> or Fore≈øtanders, by a little channel.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe Bladders have two ≈øeveral u≈øes; for they do not only ≈øtrengthen the ≈øeminary Ve≈ø≈øels where they end, but al≈øo ≈øeem to be the ≈øtores and magazeens of the Seed. They are many, that every time a man u≈øes the act of Venery, he may have a new ≈øupply of matter from the≈øe ≈øeveral ve≈øicles. Thus that which is next the Yard being fir≈øt disburdened, the ≈øecond is the next time emptied, and ≈øo till all the ≈øtore is ≈øpent; and, were it not for the≈øe ve≈øicles, a man could not lie with a woman more than once.</p>
                        <p>In the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels ≈øuch is the propen≈øity of Nature to propagate, let the body be never ≈øo much emaciated, there is always found a le≈ø≈øer or greater quantity of Seed. They are hollow and round, to contain a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59975:17"/>
greater quantity of Seed; they are al≈øo full of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, that they may be contracted or extended as the plenty of Seed requires; they are crooked and full of windings and turnings, that the Seed contained may not ea≈øily ≈ølip out.</p>
                        <p>The≈øe ≈ømall Bladders are little Cells, like tho≈øe in a Pomgranate, or ≈øomething like a bunch of Grapes. <hi>De Graef</hi> compares them to the guts of a little Bird, diver≈øly contorted. They con≈øi≈øt of one thin mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, thro' which ≈øome ≈ømall twigs run, both of Veins, Arteries, and Nerves; they are about three Fingers breadth long, and one broad, but in ≈øome places broader, and ≈øome narrower, as they run in and out. They are two divided from one another by a little inter≈øtice, and they do ≈øeverally, by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar pa≈ø≈øage, ca≈øt the Seed contained in them into the Urethra: they are very winding, and con≈øi≈øt of many little Cells, that they ≈øhould not pour out all the Seed contained in them in one act of Copulation, but might retain it for ≈øeveral; they have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication one with another, not even in their very opening into the Urethra, but the Seed that is brought to the≈øe little bladders on the right ≈øide i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øues by its proper pa≈ø≈øage into the Urethra, and that which is brought to the left likewi≈øe, ≈øo that if by any accident the bladders on the one ≈øide be bur≈øt or cut, as in cuting for the Stone they mu≈øt needs be, yet tho≈øe on the other being entire may ≈øtill ≈øuffice for generation. When the Seed is ca≈øt out of the≈øe blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the act of generation, it pa≈ø≈øes out the ≈øame way it came in, which in this ca≈øe may ea≈øily be, tho' it be unu≈øual there ≈øhould be a contrary motion in the ≈øame ve≈ø≈øel; for when it comes in, it drills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long gently without any force, but in Copulation when the Mu≈øcles of the Yard, and all the bordering

                        <p>The u≈øe of the≈øe Kernels are partly to beget an oyly, fat, and ≈ølippery ≈øub≈øtance, with which the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinary pa≈ø≈øage is ≈øometimes anointed, to defend it from the acrimony both of the Seed and Urin, and to keep it always moi≈øt.</p>
                        <p>The other u≈øe is taken from the name of <hi>Pro≈øtatae</hi>; which word, in the ≈øingular number, ≈øignifies a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or Defender; for they are there placed to pre≈øerve and ≈øtrengthen the ends of the Deferent Ve≈ø≈øels, le≈øt by overmuch di≈øtention of the Yard, the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ve≈ø≈øels ≈øhould be either bur≈øt, or moved out of their places.</p>
                        <p>They have a third u≈øe: For, being placed between the Bladder and the right gut, they ≈øerve in≈øtead of Cu≈øhions for the Ve≈ø≈øels to re≈øt upon, and to guard them from all compre≈ø≈øion: Hence it happens ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that tho≈øe who are very much bound in their bodies, while they ≈øtrain them≈øelves over-vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do now and then void a kind of Seed, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by a violent compre≈ø≈øion of tho≈øe parts.</p>
                        <p>The Pro≈øtats, in Engli≈øh, ≈øtanders by, or waiters, are placed near to the Seed-Bladders. <hi>De Graef</hi> calls them the glandulous body, ≈øuppo≈øing them to be one body, and only divided by the common ducts of the ≈øeed-bladders, and the <hi>va≈øa deferentia</hi> coming through the mid≈øt of it.

They have all ≈øorts of ve≈ø≈øels which run chiefly on their out-≈øide, in the inner part, they have ten or more ≈ømall Ducts, which unload them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves into the <hi>Urethra,</hi> by the ≈øides of the great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcle, thro' which the Seed pa≈ø≈øes from the Seed Bladders into the <hi>Urethra</hi>; but them≈øelves have each one, a ≈ømall one to ≈øtop its Orifice, lea≈øt the liquor that is contained in the Pro≈øtats, ≈øhould continually flow out, or the Urine flow in: and the≈øe ≈ømall Ducts, I ≈øuppo≈øe, are continued from tho≈øe ≈ømall Bladders which are ≈øeen in the Pro≈øtats of tho≈øe that dye ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, after having had to do with a Female; for in ≈øuch, the ≈øpungy part of the Pro≈øtats is very full of a thin liquor, and in their inner part may be found the ≈øame ≈ømall bladders, which if you pre≈øs upon, they will di≈øcharge them≈øelves into the above ≈øaid Ducts. There is a great variety of Opinions, what the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in them ≈øhould be, or what is their u≈øe: Some think that the Seed that flows from the Te≈øticles, is further elaborated here; but that cannot be, becau≈øe the <hi>va≈øa deferentia</hi> depo≈øit nothing in them, but all into the ≈ømall Seed Ve≈ø≈øels. Others think, that there is ≈øeparated from the Blood in them, an acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and ≈øerous humour which ≈øerves for Titulation, or cau≈øing the greater plea≈øure in Venery. As to this, <hi>de Graef</hi> appeals to the ta≈øte of it, which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Acrimony in it. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> thinks they make a particular kind of Seed, as the Stones do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Seed Bladders a third; that the≈øe la≈øt make a different Seed from that made in the Stones, is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59975:19"/>
grounded on a mi≈øtake in Anatomy, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>va≈øa deferentia</hi> have no communication with the Seed-Bladders, whereas they apparently open into them, and de≈øpo≈øite in them all the Seed they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; that the Pro≈øtats make a peculiar ≈øort, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove, becau≈øe gelded Animals emit ≈øome Seed; but tho' they do emit ≈øomething, it is not nece≈ø≈øary it ≈øhould be any true Seed; or if it be, it may well be ≈øuppo≈øed to proceed from the ≈ømall Seed-Bladders that were full when the Animal was gelt; for this rea≈øon it has been ob≈øerved, that pre≈øently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gelding, they have ≈øometimes got the Female with Young, but not afterwards when that ≈øtock was ≈øpent. Others think they make an oyly and ≈ølippery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which is pre≈ø≈øed out opon occa≈øion to be≈ømear the <hi>Urethra,</hi> to defend it from the acrimony of the Seed and Urine, and le≈øt it ≈øhould dry up. <hi>De Graef</hi> believes, that the Humour that is ≈øeparated in the Pro≈øtats, ≈øerves for a vehicle of the Seed, which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in ≈ømall quantity, thro' ≈ømall Poors into the <hi>Urethra,</hi> it was nece≈ø≈øary, that this Humour ≈øhould be mixed with it, that it might the better reach the Womb; whatever this Humour be, it is ≈øqueezed out partly by the ≈øwelling and erection of the Yard, and partly, by compre≈ø≈øion of the ≈øphincter of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that girds the Pro≈øtats about: The≈øe Pro≈øtats are often the ≈øeat of a <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> and the Humour they contain, is that which flows out in the running of the Reins; for if it were true Seed, they could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a <hi>Gonorrhaea</hi> ≈øo long, ≈øome thirty Years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being much wa≈øted, the flux being ≈øo much as ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE ≈øtructure of the Yard is not unknown, that is to ≈øay, at the root of the ≈øhare bone in the hinder part of the <hi>Hypoga≈øtrion</hi> or lower part of the belly, where the hair grows; which bone is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Os pubis.</hi> Though the greate≈øt part of it, is not pendent without, but adjoining to the <hi>Podex,</hi> is ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted near the joining of the ≈øhare-bone, being fa≈øt knit to it in the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> or ≈øpace between the Cods and the Fundament; the other part is pendent and is ≈øeen hanging outward. This ≈øituation is mo≈øt appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the manner of the act of generation, u≈øual and peculiar to men, who do not couple after the manner of Bea≈øts. The figure of it is in a manner round, though not exactly; broader in the upper part which is called the back of the Yard.</p>
                        <p>The thickne≈øs and longitude of the Yard is ≈øo much as is required for Procreation; yet it is not ≈øo long as in many other creatures. Yea, and in ≈øeveral men there is a very great diver≈øity; little men being for the mo≈øt part, be≈øt provided in that part: It is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral received opinion, that the often u≈øe of Venery doth increa≈øe the quantity of it in all dimen≈øions.</p>
                        <p>The Yard will al≈øo be longer, if the Navel-≈øtrings are not bound up, or knit too clo≈øe by the Midwife, in Children that are newly born; but at ≈øome di≈øtance from the Navel: This happens by rea≈øon of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament coming from the Navel to the bottom of the Bladder; which if it be too much abreviated, draws up the Bladder, and con≈øequently ≈øhortens the Yard; but if the Navel-≈øtring be left at a longer di≈øtance, the <hi>Urachus</hi> is enlarged, and con≈øequently the Yard hath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59975:20"/>
more liberty to extend it ≈øelf; And therefore the Midwives are from hence adverti≈øed, that they do not ≈øpoil the harve≈øt of generation, by cutting the ≈øithe too ≈øhort.</p>
                        <p>As to the ≈øub≈øtance of the Yard; it is not of a bony ≈øub≈øtance, as in Dogs, Wolves, or Foxes; for ≈øo it would become always hard and erected, and hinder men from all bu≈øine≈øs but the act of Venery: Neither is it gri≈øtly, for ≈øo it could neither erect it ≈øelf, nor flag, when occa≈øion required: Neither is it full of veins, for ≈øo it could not be emptied and repleted on ≈øuch a ≈øudden as often happens; be≈øides, the Tunicles of the veins are ≈øo thin, that they could not ≈øuffer ≈øo great a di≈øtention; neither can it be full of Arteries, becau≈øe it wants a continual pul≈øation; neither can it con≈øi≈øt of Nerves, becau≈øe they having no hollowne≈øs, cannot be extended and loo≈øned, as it mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity happen to the Yard. It is therefore nece≈ø≈øary that the Yard ≈øhould have ≈øuch a ≈øub≈øtance, as is not peculiar to any part of the body. It is to be under≈øtood, that there do concur to the framing of the Yard, two nervous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the pa≈ø≈øage for the Urine which is called <hi>Urethra,</hi> the <hi>Glans</hi> or Nut of the Yard, four Mu≈øcles, the Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, and the skin.</p>
                        <p>Here doth ari≈øe a que≈øtion, why the Yard hath not any fat? Which is in brief, thus; becau≈øe that there ≈øhould be no hindrance to the perfect ≈øen≈øe of the Yard, which could of nece≈ø≈øity not be avoided, if that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were ≈øubject to any obe≈øity; the fat being ≈øubject to be melted by frication.</p>

                        <p>AMONG the parts that compo≈øe the ≈øtructure of the Yard, is that skin which with its cuticle,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59975:20"/>
and fle≈øhly pannicle, is common not only to this, but to other members; only it hath this peculiar to it ≈øelf, that it may be reflexed, and drawn back from the Nut of the Yard. This skin that turns back is called the <hi>Praeputium</hi>; becau≈øe that part in circumci≈øion was cut away; with which <hi>prepuce,</hi> the Nut of the Yard is covered.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Glans</hi> or Nut of the Yard is a fle≈øhy part, ≈øoft, thin,<note rend="inter">The Nut of the Yard.</note> repleat with blood and ≈øpirits; endued with an exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe; ≈øomething ≈øharp and acute at the end. This is fa≈øtned to the <hi>prepuce</hi> at the lower part by a certain ligament, which is therefore called the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or the <hi>filet,</hi> which commonly is broken in the fir≈øt venereal a≈ø≈øaults, which are for the mo≈øt part the mo≈øt furious.</p>
                        <p>The greate≈øt part of the Yard is con≈øtituted by two nervous bodies,<note rend="inter">The two nervous bodies.</note> on both ≈øides one, which terminate both together in the Nut. They ri≈øe from a two-fold original, leaning or re≈øting upon the Hip, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Share-bone; whence as from a ≈øure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they go on, till they arrive at the nut of the Yard.</p>
                        <p>They con≈øi≈øt of a double ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, the fir≈øt is nervous, hard,<note rend="inter">Their ≈øub≈øtance.</note> and thick; the inner part black, loo≈øe, ≈øoft, thin, and ≈øpongy. It is called the <hi>Nervous pipe.</hi> The≈øe two bodies are joyned together by a certain membrane, thin, yet nervous; which is ≈øtrengthned by certain overthwart fibres, being there placed in the likene≈øs of a Weavers ≈øhuttle: and though in their original they are ≈øeparated the one from the other, that there might remain ≈øome certain ≈øpace for the <hi>Urethra</hi>; yet they are joyned together about the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59975:21"/>
middle of the Share-bone; where they lo≈øe about the third part of their nervous ≈øub≈øtance.</p>
                        <p>The interiour ≈øub≈øtance, which is wrapt about by the exteriour nervous ≈øub≈øtance, hath this worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation, That there appears ≈øtretched, through the whole length of it, a thin and tender Artery, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the bigne≈øs of the body which is diffu≈øed through the whole loo≈øe ≈øub≈øtance of the Yard, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as far as the root of the Yard. Be≈øides the≈øe two, there is another body which lies between the≈øe two, as proper or rather more peculiar to the Yard than they are. This is a pipe placed at the inferiour part of the Yard, being called the <hi>Urethra,</hi> though it be a pa≈ø≈øage as proper to the Seed, as to the Urine; which is encompa≈ø≈øed by the two fore-mentioned bodies. This is a certain Channel produced in length, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the middle of tho≈øe nervous bodies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting of the ≈øame ≈øub≈øtance that they do, being loo≈øe, thick, ≈øoft, and tender; every way equal from the neck of the bladder to the nut of the Yard, ≈øaving that it is a little wider at the beginning, than it is toward the place where it ends, which is at the head of the <hi>Glans</hi> or nut of the Yard.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note rend="inter">The holes of the Vrethra.</note>At the beginning of this Channel there are three holes; one in the middle, and ≈øomething bigger than the other two, ari≈øing from the neck of the bladder; the other two, on both ≈øides one, being ≈øomething narrower, proceeding from the pa≈ø≈øage that goes out of the ≈øeminary ve≈ø≈øels, and conveighs the Seed into this Channel.</p>
                        <p>This is further to be noted in this place, that in the Channel, where it is joyned to the Glans, together with the nervous bodies, there is a little kind of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59975:21"/>
in which ≈øometimes either putrid Seed,<note rend="inter">Note.</note> or any other corroding humour, happens in the <hi>Gonorrhaea</hi>; being collected, it is the cau≈øe of ulcers in that part, the cau≈øe of very great pain: and it many times al≈øo comes to pa≈øs, that there is a certain little piece of fle≈øh which grows out of this Ulcer, that oftentimes ≈øtops the pa≈ø≈øages of the urine.</p>
                        <p>To the ≈øtructure of the Yard,<note rend="inter">The Mu≈øcles of the Yard.</note> there do moreover occurr two pair of Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, one more ≈øhort and thick, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a part of the Hip, near the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Yard, and being of a fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance. The u≈øe of the≈øe two Mu≈øcles, is to ≈øu≈øtain the Yard in the erection; and to bend the fore part of the Yard, which is to be in≈øerted into the womb: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pair is longer, and ri≈øes from the Sphincter of the Fundament, where they are endued with a more fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance, being in length full as long as the Yard; under which they are carried downward, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the ≈øides of the <hi>Urethra,</hi> about the middle of the Yard. Their u≈øe is to dilate the <hi>Urethra,</hi> both at the time of making water, and at the time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; le≈øt it ≈øhould be ≈øtopped up by the reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nervous bodies, and ≈øo ≈øtop up the pa≈ø≈øage of the Seed. They are al≈øo thought to keep the Yard firm, le≈øt it lean too much to either ≈øide, and al≈øo to pre≈øs out the Seed out of the <hi>Pro≈øtatae,</hi> or Fore≈øtanders.</p>
                        <p>There are Ve≈ø≈øels al≈øo of all ≈øorts in the yard: fir≈øt of all,<note rend="inter">The Ve≈ø≈øels of the Yard.</note> certain Veins appearing in the external parts, and in the cuticle; which do branch them≈øelves out from the <hi>Hypoga≈øtrium.</hi> In the middle, between the ≈øpace of the fibres, they ≈øend out certain branches from the right ≈øide to the left, and from the left to the right. The≈øe veins ≈øwelling with a frothy blood and ≈øpirit,

erect the Yard. There are al≈øo certain nerves which ≈øcatter them≈øelves from the pith or marrow of the Holy-bone, quite through the yard, bringing with them the cau≈øe of that plea≈øure and delight, which is perceived in the erection of the yard.</p>

                        <p>THE main ≈øcope of Nature in the u≈øe of the Yard, was, the injection of Seed into the womb of the Woman, which injection could not be done, till the Seed were fir≈øt moved; neither could the Seed be moved but by frication of the parts, which could not be done, till it were ≈øheathed in the Womb; nor that neither, till the Yard were erected.</p>
                        <p>This di≈øtention is cau≈øed by repletion; which is cau≈øed by the plenty of Seed: Secondly, by ≈øuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wind, which if it be too violent, is the cau≈øe of <hi>priapi≈øm</hi>: A third cau≈øe proceeds from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Urine contained in the Bladder.

                        <p>THE Yard is ≈øituated under the Midriff over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Womb. And is al≈øo placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the thighs, for the greater ≈øtrengthning of it in the act of copulation: neither is this the only ≈øtrength which it hath, for at the lower part it appears more fle≈øhy, which fle≈øh is altogether mu≈øcely, for the greater ≈øtrength thereof. Neither is it only contented with this Mu≈øcely fle≈øh, it having two Mu≈øcles al≈øo for the ≈øame purpo≈øe, on both ≈øides to poi≈øe it eaven in

                        <p>The figure of the Yard is not ab≈øolutely round, but broader on the upper ≈øide, le≈øt it ≈øhould be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the the convexity of the ≈øuperior part, in the ca≈øting forth of the Seed.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the bigne≈øs of the Yard, it is by mo≈øt e≈øteemed to be of a ju≈øt length, when it is extended the breadth of nine thumbs.</p>

                        <p>THE fir≈øt thing in the con≈øtitution of the Yard, that offers it ≈øelf to view, is the <hi>Skin,</hi> which is long and loo≈øe, by rea≈øon that the Yard which is ≈øometimes to be extended, and ≈øometimes to fall down again, ≈øo requires it. The extremity of the skin is ≈øo ordered, that it ≈øometimes covers the <hi>Glans,</hi> and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times draws back; that, whil≈øt it covers the Nut of the Yard, it may defend the Yard from frication, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the motion of the Seed.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, this skin in the act of copulation, ≈øhuts up the mouth of the Womb and hinders the ingre≈øs of the cold air. Concerning the two nervous bodies, con≈øtituting the ≈øub≈øtance of the Yard; their u≈øe is for the vital ≈øpirit to run through the thin ≈øub≈øtance of them, and fill the Yard with ≈øpirits. Moreover, by their thickne≈øs, they do prevent the two ha≈øty emptying and flying out of the ≈øpirits which are to ≈øtay in, for the greater and longer erection of the Yard.</p>
                        <p>The u≈øe of the <hi>Urethra</hi> is for the pa≈ø≈øage of Seed and Urine through it. The ≈øub≈øtance of the <hi>Urethra</hi> is much of the ≈øame with the two former bodies; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59975:23"/>
being more thin and loo≈øe, the out≈øide more ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and thick; which is ≈øo ordained, that it may be more apt to be erected with the Yard. It goes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the place where it begins, to the end of the Spermatick Ve≈ø≈øels, and the neck of the bladder, and the warty Fore≈øtanders, where there ari≈øes a thin and tender membrane, which the Chyrurgeons ought to take a great deal of care le≈øt they break, while they thru≈øt their Syringes toward tho≈øe parts; It is endued with an exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe to ≈øtir up plea≈øure and venereal de≈øire.</p>

                        <p>The parts that offer them≈øelves to view, without any diduction, are the great chink, with the lips, the mountain of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the hairs.

of this hill, which makes it bunch ≈øo up, is mo≈øt of it fat, and ≈øerves, as it were for a ≈øoft Cu≈øhion in copulation, to hinder the bone of the <hi>Pubes</hi> of the Man and Woman to hit one again≈øt the other; for that would be painful and di≈øturb the venereal Plea≈øures.

This in Women is the ≈øeat of Venereal plea≈øure: It is like the Yard in ≈øituation, ≈øub≈øtance, compo≈øition, and erection, and hath ≈øomething corre≈øpondent both to the <hi>Prepuce,</hi> and to the <hi>Glans</hi> in men. Sometimes it grows out to the bigne≈øs of the Yard, ≈øo that it hath bin ob≈øerved to grow out of the body, the breadth of four fingers.</p>

The Spirits they have from the ≈øame Nerves that run thro' the ≈øheath, and blood from one of the branches of the Iliack Artery: Veins they have al≈øo, which carry away the arterial blood from them, when they become flaccid. They are larger in old Maids than in young, and larger yet in tho≈øe that have u≈øed Copulation, or born Children. They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, according to Nature reach above half way out from between the lips; their u≈øe is to defend the inner parts, to cover the urinary pa≈ø≈øages, and a good part of the Orifice of the ≈øheath; and to the ≈øame purpo≈øes ≈øerve the lips.</p>

                        <p>PRe≈øently behind the wings, before we go far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the middle of the Cleft, there do appear four knobs of fle≈øh, being placed in a quadrangular form, one again≈øt the other; they are ≈øaid to re≈øemble Myrtle-berries in form. In this place is incerted the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice of the bladder, which opens it ≈øelf into the fi≈ø≈øure, to ca≈øt forth the Urine into the common Channel.

                        <p>The <hi>Hymen</hi> is a thin, nervous membrane, interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with fle≈øhy fibres, and endowed with many little Arteries and Veins, coming acro≈øs the pa≈ø≈øage of the ≈øheath; behind the incertion of the neck of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with a hole in the mid≈øt, that will admit the top of ones little finger, whereby the Cour≈øes flow; where it is found, it is a certain note of Virginity, but upon the fir≈øt Copulation it is broke, and bleeds, and when it is once broke, it never clo≈øes again.

upon the Mu≈øcles of the Loins, and this for that cau≈øe that they might be more hot and fruitful; being to elaborate that matter, with which the Seed of man engenders man.</p>
                        <p>In this place ari≈øes a Que≈øtion, not trivial;<note rend="inter">A doubt.</note> whether the Seed of Woman be the efficient, or the material cau≈øe of generation? To which it is an≈øwered, that though it have a power of acting, yet it receives the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that power from the Seed of Man.</p>
                        <p>The Stones of Women differ from mens al≈øo,<note rend="inter">Their figure.</note> as to their figure, becau≈øe they are not ≈øo round and oval as tho≈øe of men, being in their fore and hinder part more depre≈ø≈øed and broad, the external ≈øuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being more unequal, as if a great many knots and kernals were mixed together.

                        <p>Their coverings al≈øo do make a difference: for mens are wrapt up in divers Tunicles, becau≈øe being pendent outward, they were otherwi≈øe more ≈øubject to external injuries; but the ≈øtones of women have but one tunicle, which though it ≈øtick very clo≈øe to them, yet are they al≈øo half cloathed over with the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi>

                        <p>They have but one membrane, that encompa≈ø≈øes them round, but on their upper ≈øide, where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Ve≈ø≈øels enter them, they are about half way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved

in another membrane that accompanies tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels, and ≈øprings from the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> When this cover is removed, their ≈øub≈øtance appears whiti≈øh, but is wholly different from the ≈øub≈øtance of Mens Stones; for mens are compo≈øed of Seed-ve≈ø≈øels, which, being continued to one another, are twenty, or thirty ells long; if one could draw them out at length, without breaking: but Womens principally con≈øi≈øt of a great many membranes, and ≈ømall fibres loo≈øly joined to one another; among which, there are ≈øeveral little bladders full of a clear Liquor, thro' who≈øe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, the nerves, and preparing Ve≈ø≈øels run. <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> and their followers, imagine the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor contained in the≈øe Bladders to be Seed; but from Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> downwards, many learned Phy≈øici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Anatomi≈øts, have denied that Women have Seed. Some Women, ≈øays Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> ≈øend forth no ≈øuch humour as is called Seed, and yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; for I have known ≈øeveral Women, ≈øays he, that have bin fruitful enough without ≈øuch emi≈ø≈øion, yea, ≈øome that after they begun to emit ≈øuch an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, tho' indeed they took greater plea≈øure in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, yet grew le≈øs fruitful than before. There are al≈øo infinite in≈øtances of Women, who tho' they have plea≈øure in Copulation, yet ≈øend forth nothing, and notwith≈øtanding conceive. It is moreover to be ob≈øerved, that the humour is ca≈øt out, and i≈ø≈øues mo≈øt commonly from about the <hi>Clytoris,</hi> and Orifice of the privities, and very rarely from any depth within the neck of the Womb, but never within the Womb it ≈øelf, ≈øo as that it ≈øhould be there mixed with the mans Seed; be≈øides it is not ropy and oyly like Seed, but ≈øerous like Urine. We mu≈øt therefore agree with that new, but nece≈ø≈øary Opinion, that ≈øuppo≈øes the≈øe little Bladders to contain nothing of Seed, both becau≈øe the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59975:33"/>
Liquor is ≈øent forth in a greater quantity, than can be ≈øupplyed from them, and al≈øo, becau≈øe they have no pa≈ø≈øage, whereby the Liquor contained in them might i≈ø≈øue out; for if you pre≈øs them never ≈øo hard, unle≈øs you bur≈øt them, nothing will pa≈øs out of them; therefore it mu≈øt be concluded, that they are truly Eggs, Analogous to tho≈øe of Fowl, and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that the Stones ≈øo called are not truly ≈øo, nor have any ≈øuch Office, as tho≈øe of Men, but are indeed an <hi>Ovarium,</hi> wherein the≈øe Eggs are nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood Ve≈ø≈øels, di≈øper≈øed through them, and from whence one or more, as they are fecundated by the Mans Seed, ≈øeparate, and are convey'd into the womb by the <hi>Fallopian tubes.</hi> If you boyl the≈øe Eggs, their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor will have the ≈øame colour, ta≈øte, and con≈øi≈øtency with the white of Birds eggs, and their difference in wanting ≈øhells is of no moment; for Birds eggs have need of a ≈øhell, becau≈øe they are hatched without the Body, and are expo≈øed to external injuries; but the≈øe of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being fo≈øtered within their body, have no need of other fence than the Womb, whereby they are ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently defended.

Where they begin, at the bottom of the womb, they are hollow and large; but as they proceed further on, they grow narrower, till, near their end, they do again obtain a larger bigne≈øs; the≈øe two pa≈ø≈øages thus running from the corners of the womb to the Stones, are taken only to be certain ligaments, by which the Stones and the Womb are ≈øtrongly knit together; and the≈øe ligaments in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are the ≈øame things with the <hi>Crema≈øteres</hi> in men.</p>

of the Womb, and by the≈øe latter, ≈øuch as were already impregnated; for that if it ≈øhould have i≈ø≈øued into the bottom of the womb, where the conception was, it would have corrupted, to the great prejudice of the <hi>Faetus.</hi> But many accurate Anatomi≈øts have not bin able to find the lea≈øt foot-≈øtep of the≈øe latter ducts; and as for the former, ≈øeeing they have not any cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore can have nothing of ≈øeed in them, we mu≈øt conclude, that they are only ligaments of the ≈øtones to keep them in their place; and this may be proved farther, by ob≈øerving that they come not into the inner cavity of the womb, but are knit only to its outward Coat, and there are only two holes in the bottom of the womb, that admit a probe, and tho≈øe lead to the fallopian tubes, and not to the≈øe ligaments.</p>
                        <p>Seeing therefore, that tho≈øe which have bin accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ejaculatory Ve≈ø≈øels, either are not to be found at all, or are found unfit for ≈øuch an Office, and having withal rejected the Opinion of Womens having ≈øeed, and affirm'd, that that which makes the Conception, is one of tho≈øe little bladders in the ≈øtones, dropping from thence, and conveyed into the womb, we mu≈øt enquire by what way they can pa≈øs; for if the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid ligaments reputed deferent Ve≈ø≈øels, have no pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage, whereby the ≈øeed, if there were any might pa≈øs, much le≈øs cou'd one of the≈øe bladders be conveyed that way; and therefore, for deferent Ve≈ø≈øels, we a≈ø≈øign tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øages, that are called the fallopian tubes, they are very ≈ølender, and narrow pa≈ø≈øages, nervous and white, ari≈øing from the ≈øides of the womb, and at a little di≈øtance from it, they become larger, and twi≈øt like the tendrel of a Vine, 'till near their end, where cea≈øing their winding, they grow very large, and ≈øeem membranous and fle≈øhy, which end is very much torn and jaggy, like the edge of rent Cloaths, and has
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59975:35"/>
a large hole, which always lies clo≈øed, becau≈øe tho≈øe jags fall together; but yet being opened they are like the outmo≈øt orifice of a bra≈øs Trumpet The≈øe tubes are the ≈øame in Women, that the horns of the womb are in other Creatures, for they an≈øwer to tho≈øe, both in ≈øituation, connection, amplitude, perforation, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and al≈øo office: For as other Creatures always conceive in the Horns, ≈øo it has been ≈øometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, that a Conception has in a Woman bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in one of the tubes, which mu≈øt have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Egg, being received out of the ≈øtone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, has been ≈øtopt in its pa≈ø≈øage to the womb, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from its own bigne≈øs, or ≈øome ob≈øtruction in the tube. The ≈øub≈øtance of the tubes is not nervous, as <hi>Fallopius</hi> affirms, but membranous; for they con≈øi≈øt of two membranes, the outer and inner; the inner ≈øprings from, or at lea≈øt is common with that, which covers the inner ≈øub≈øtance of the womb: But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ≈ømooth in the womb, it is very wrinkled in the tubes, the outer is common with the outmo≈øt of the womb, and this is ≈ømooth.</p>
                        <p>The capacity of the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages varies very much, for in the beginning, as it goes out of the womb, it only admits a bri≈øtle; but in his progre≈øs, where it is mo≈øt capacious, it will receive ones little finger, but in the extremity, where it is jagged, it is but about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øo wide, their length al≈øo is very uncertain, for they ≈øometimes increa≈øe from four or five, to eight or nine fingers breadth long. Their u≈øe is in a fruitful Copulation to grant a pa≈ø≈øage to the finer part of the man's Seed, or of a ≈øeminal fume towards the ≈øtones, to bedew the Eggs contained in them, which Eggs, one or more being thereby ripened, and dropping off from the ≈øtone, are received by the extremity of the tubes, and carried along their inner cavity to the womb.</p>

                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59975:36"/>Two objections may be made again≈øt this u≈øe: Fir≈øt, That the end of the tube not ≈øticking clo≈øe to the ≈øtone, when one of the Eggs drops from the ≈øtone, it would more probably fall into the cavity of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than light ju≈øt pat in the mouth of the tube. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when it is received by it, its pa≈ø≈øage is ≈øo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now, that it is hard to imagin how it can pa≈øs by it: But as to the fir≈øt, the ≈øame objection may lye again≈øt the u≈øe of the oviduct in Hens; for in them it does not join quite clo≈øe to the <hi>Ovarium,</hi> and yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the rudiments of the Eggs do all pa≈øs by them to the womb. Moreover it is probable, that when all the other parts of the Genitals are turgid in the act of Copulation, the≈øe tubes al≈øo may be in ≈øome mea≈øure erected, and extend their open mouth to the ≈øtones, to impregnate the Eggs with the ≈øeminal fume thro' their pa≈ø≈øage, and if any one be ripened, and ≈øeparate, to receive it afterwards by its orifice. As to the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond objection again≈øt the narrowne≈øs of the≈øe tubes, he that con≈øiders the ≈øtraightne≈øs of the inner orifice of the womb, both in maids and in women with Child, yet ob≈øerves to dilate ≈øo much upon occa≈øion, as to grant a pa≈ø≈øage to the Child out of the womb, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder that to ≈øerve a nece≈ø≈øary end of Nature, the ≈ømall pa≈ø≈øages of the tubes ≈øhould be ≈øo far ≈øtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to make way for an Egg, ≈øeeing its proportion to their pa≈ø≈øage, is much le≈øs, than of the Child to the u≈øual largene≈øs of the ≈øaid orifice.</p>

                           </note>Fal≈øe Conception hath many ≈øigns, common with the true conception; as the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion of the flowers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved appetite, vomitings, ≈øwelling of the belly, and of the brea≈øts; ≈øo that it is a hard thing to di≈øtingui≈øh the one from the other: only the≈øe that follow are more properly the ≈øigns of a fal≈øe than true concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For in a fal≈øe Conception, the face is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily puffed up; the brea≈øts, that at the fir≈øt were ≈øwollen, afterwards become, every day more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øofter and lanker, and without Milk. In fine, the face, the brea≈øt, the arms, the thighs and groyns grow lank and meager: The belly waxes hard, as happens to tho≈øe who are troubled with the Drop≈øie, and almo≈øt of an equal roundne≈øs; with many prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains, at the bottom of the belly, which have ≈øcarce any intermi≈ø≈øion; which is the cau≈øe that they can hardly ≈øleep, being encumbered with a heavy and dead burthen. It may be known al≈øo by other ≈øigns, for in the conception the Male-Infant begins to move at the beginning of the third Month; for the mo≈øt part; and the Female at the beginning of the third or fourth Month: now where any motion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, the woman ought to ob≈øerve whether ≈øhe have any milk in her brea≈øts or no: if ≈øhe have milk in her brea≈øts, it is a ≈øign of true conception; if ≈øhe have not, it is a ≈øign of fal≈øe conception. Be≈øides, in a true conception, the Mother ≈øhall perceive her Child to move on all ≈øides oftner though to the right flank than to the left, ≈øometimes up, ≈øometimes down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any a≈ø≈øi≈øtance; but in a fal≈øe conception, although there be a kind of motion, which is not enlivened;

that proceeds from the expul≈øive faculty of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not from the Mole.

                        <p>This di≈øtinction is to be ob≈øerved in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Mole, that the flank and thighs are more ≈øtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                        <head>CHAP. VI. How Women with Child ought to govern them≈øelves.</head>
                        <p>IN the fir≈øt place, ≈øhe ought to chu≈øe a temperate and whole≈øome air, neither too hot nor too cold, nor in a watry and damp place, nor too ≈øubject to fogs and winds, e≈øpecially the South-wind, which is a great enemy to Women with Child, cau≈øing oft-times abortion in them. The Northwind is al≈øo hurtful, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring Rheums and Catarrhs, and Coughs, which do often force a woman to lie down before her time. Likewi≈øe tho≈øe winds which carry with them evil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours and vapours, for the≈øe being ≈øucked with the air into the Lungs, are the cau≈øe of divers di≈øea≈øes.</p>
                        <p>For her Diet, ≈øhe ought to choo≈øe meat that breeds good and whol≈øome nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which breeds good juice;<note rend="inter">Her Diet.</note> ≈øuch are meats that are moderately dry; the quantity ought to be ≈øufficient, both for them≈øelves, and for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and therefore they are to fa≈øt as little as may be; for ab≈øtinence, unle≈øs upon good occa≈øion, renders the child ≈øickly, and tender, and con≈øtrains it to be born before its time, to ≈øeek for nouri≈øhment; as the over-much diet ≈øtuffs it up, and renders it ≈øo big that it can hardly keep its place.</p>
                        <p>All meats too cold, too hot, and too moi≈øt, are to be avoided, as al≈øo the u≈øe of Salads and Spiced meats, and the too much u≈øe of ≈øalt meats are al≈øo forbidden, which will make the child to be born without nails, a ≈øign of ≈øhort life. Her bread ought to be good wheat, well baked and levened. Her meats ought to be Pigeons, Turtles, Phea≈øants, Larks, Partridge, Veal, and Mutton. For herbs, ≈øhe may u≈øe Lettice, Endive, Buglo≈øs, and Burrage, ab≈øtaining from raw Salads:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59975:44"/>
for her la≈øt cour≈øe, ≈øhe may be permitted to eat Pears, Marmalade, as al≈øo Cherries and Dam≈øins; ≈øhe mu≈øt avoid all meats that provoke urine, or the terms; and ≈øuch meats as are windy, as Pea≈øe, and Beans. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there are ≈øome Women that have ≈øuch depraved ≈øtomachs,<note rend="inter">Of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> by rea≈øon of a certain ≈øalt and ≈øowre humour contained in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the ≈øtomach, as that they will eat coals, chalk, a≈øhes, cinders, and ≈øuch like tra≈øh, ≈øo that it is impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible to hinder them; to ≈øuch therefore we can only ≈øay thus much, that they ought to forbear as much as in them lies, a≈ø≈øuring them that ≈øuch tra≈øh does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endanger their own health, but the health of the child. Yet if they cannot command that depraved ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, let them ≈øo provide, though it be by giving ≈øome ≈ømall ≈øatisfaction to their depraved longings, that they do not ha≈øten any further inconvenience; for though tho≈øe ≈øtrange meats be very contrary to nature, yet the ≈øtrange de≈øire that they have to them, does not a little avail to the di≈øge≈øtion of them. For her drink, let it be ≈ømall Ale, though now and then a cup of pure Wine does not ami≈øs, to comfort the Stomach, and the parts dedicated to Generation.</p>

                        <p>Laughing and crying, if it be immoderate, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hurtful, as al≈øo immoderate anger.</p>
                        <p>In the fir≈øt four months ≈øhe ought not to lye with her Husband, for that ≈øhakes and moves the fruit of her Womb, and cau≈øes the Flowers to de≈øcend; ≈øhe mu≈øt al≈øo ab≈øtain in the ≈øixth and eighth; but in the ≈øeventh and ninth it is not denied, and is thought to facilitate the Delivery.</p>
                        <p>She ought al≈øo to keep her body ≈øoluble, which if it ≈øhould not come of it ≈øelf, ≈øhe mu≈øt take loo≈øening Syrups to help nature; as ≈øoon as ever they perceive them≈øelves to be with Child, they mu≈øt lay a≈øide their Busks, and not ≈øtreighten them≈øelves any way, for fear of hurting the fruit of their Womb, by not giving it its full liberty of growth.</p>
                        <p>A Woman with Child ought to be accounted ≈øick, for the time of going with Child is called a ≈øickne≈øs of nine Months, and ≈øhe is indeed ≈øubject to many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences on that account; therefore ≈øhe ought to u≈øe her utmo≈øt endeavour to prevent tho≈øe many accidents ≈øhe is then ≈øubject to, and that ≈øhe may pre≈øerve her ≈øelf in health, as much as her pre≈øent condition will allow of, let her be careful to ob≈øerve a good diet, agreeable to her con≈øtitution and condition. The air of the place where ≈øhe dwells ought to be temperate; for if it be too hot it di≈ø≈øipats the humours and ≈øpirits, and if it be moi≈øt and cold it occa≈øions rheums and coughs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mi≈øcarriages have been cau≈øed; ill ≈ømells are al≈øo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offen≈øive to Women with Child, as the ≈øtink of a candle, the ≈ømell of char-coal. Their Stomach gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally loath Meat, and are weak; and therefore they mu≈øt plea≈øe their Stomachs, and let them not fa≈øt too long, for thereby their blood is unfit to nouri≈øh the Child;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59975:45"/>
but they mu≈øt not eat too much at a time; e≈øpecially for Supper, becau≈øe the bigne≈øs of the belly hinders the Stomach from containing much; wherefore let the Woman eat little and often. Her bread mu≈øt be made of good Wheat, white, and well baked; her meat may be Mutton, Veal, Fowl, or Pullets, Pidgeons, or Partridges, boyled or roa≈øted according as ≈øhe likes be≈øt. New laid Eggs are al≈øo a good Diet, and to purifie the Blood, which is generally ill during the time of pregnancy; ≈øhe ought to eat ≈øometimes Broths with ≈øuccory, borrage or ≈øorrel boyled in it, but hot ≈øea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pyes and baked meats mu≈øt be avoided; if ≈øhe long for Fi≈øh, River fi≈øh, and tho≈øe of running ≈øtreams are to be preferred before others. But note, that this ought to be a general rule in this ca≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> That if Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men earne≈øtly long for any thing, they mu≈øt have it. And becau≈øe their Stomachs are always weak, they ought to drink ≈øome good Wine, or ≈øome other good Liquor at Meals to help dige≈øtion. All things very hot, and ≈øuch things as force Urine ought to be ≈øhunned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are apt to force the cour≈øes, and ≈øo to cau≈øe mi≈øcarriage.</p>
                        <p>They ought to ≈øleep moderately, becau≈øe by ≈øleep, the functions and the concoction are ≈øtrengthened, whereas exce≈ø≈øive watchings wa≈øte the Spirits, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the faculties; therefore a Woman with Child ought to ≈øleep nine or ten hours at lea≈øt in a Night. As to exerci≈øe and re≈øt, re≈øpect mu≈øt be had to the various times of pregnancy. At the beginning of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, if the Woman perceives it, ≈øhe ought, if her condition will allow of it, to keep in Bed, at lea≈øt till the fifth or ≈øixth day, and not to conver≈øe with her Husband all that time, for then a little matter will cau≈øe mi≈øcarriage: She mu≈øt not ride on Hor≈øe-back, or in a Coach, or Waggon, all the time ≈øhe is with Child, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially

when ≈øhe is near her time; becau≈øe the≈øe kind of motions increa≈øe the weight of that which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Womb, and often cau≈øes abortion. But ≈øhe may be carried in a Chair, or Litter, or walk gently. She mu≈øt forbear carrying or lifting heavy burthens, nor mu≈øt ≈øhe rai≈øe her Arms too high, or dre≈øs her own head; for many have mi≈øcarried, the ligaments of the Womb being relaxed on this account.

The Woman ought rather the two la≈øt Months of her reckoning to ab≈øtain from Copulation, the Body being thereby much moved, and the Belly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed, which makes the Child ≈øometimes take a wrong po≈øture; and without doubt if the≈øe things, that have been ≈øaid concerning exerci≈øe and re≈øt were well regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the lives of many Women and Children would be ≈øaved, and much pain and ≈øorrow prevented.</p>
                        <p>Some Women are ≈øo very apt to mi≈øcarry, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frightned, or ≈øurprized, by the noi≈øe of a great Gun, or the ≈øound of a Bell or a clap of Thunder they have mi≈øcarryed.</p>
                        <p>Women with Child are ≈øubject to be bound in the Bodies, the Womb by its weight pre≈ø≈øing the right gut and ≈øo hindring an ea≈øy di≈øcharge of the Excrements.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59975:46"/>
In this ca≈øe, ≈øuch things as loo≈øen the belly are to be frequently u≈øed. She may now and then eat ≈øtewed Prunes, or Veal-broth, or a Gli≈øter of Mallows may be injected, but ≈øharp Gli≈øters, and things that purge too much, mu≈øt be avoided; for <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ≈øays, that too great an evacuation downward is apt to occa≈øion mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.</p>
                        <p>The Womans mind ought to be kept ≈øedate and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, all melancholly news, and frightful objects mu≈øt be removed far from her, nor mu≈øt any thing that may cau≈øe ≈øorrow, be ≈øuddenly told her. She mu≈øt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate her pa≈ø≈øions, and exce≈ø≈øive anger mu≈øt by all means be avoided, for the pa≈ø≈øions do wonderfully affect the Child and often cau≈øe mi≈øcarraige; ≈øome have been born dumb, others have had a continual ≈øhaking of their Limbs, and the like, when the Mother has been ≈øuddenly and violently ≈øurprized or frighted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is be≈øt to be di≈øcour≈øing of ≈øuch things before big-bellied Women, as may moderately rejoyce them, and that ≈øuch objects be pre≈øented, as may plea≈øe and divert them; and if it be ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to acquaint them with ≈øorrowful things, great care and caution mu≈øt be u≈øed, and the mi≈øery mu≈øt be di≈øcovered piece-meal.</p>
                        <p>Some Women are ≈øo very vain, that they will lace them≈øelves hard with Bodice ≈øtifned with Whale-bone, to pre≈øerve their ≈øhapes for≈øooth: but they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider what injury they do them≈øelves; for their Brea≈øts being pre≈øt too much, are apt to be inflamed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtumated, and the growth of the Child is hindered, and the Limbs of it too often disfigured thereby, and ≈øometimes mi≈øcarriage happens. They ought therefore at this time, to have their Cloaths more loo≈øe and ea≈øie.</p>
                        <p>Some Women have al≈øo a cu≈øtom to bleed once or twice when they are with Child, tho' they have no need of it, but this is certainly an errour, for Women
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59975:46"/>
with Child ought not to bleed but upon nece≈ø≈øity, ≈øome having mi≈øcarried by bleeding but once, a little too much blood being taken away, tho' others I confe≈øs, having blouded nine or ten times whil≈øt they were with Child, and yet have not mi≈øcarried. Now ≈øeeing all are not of the ≈øame con≈øtitution, they mu≈øt not be all treated alike. Tho≈øe that have mo≈øt blood can be≈øt bear bleeding,</p>
                        <p>If Purging be thought nece≈ø≈øary, gentle things mu≈øt be only u≈øed, as <hi>Manna, Rhubarb,</hi> or the like.</p>
                        <p>Women with Child are ≈øubject to many accidents, the fir≈øt is Vomiting, whereby they often judge they are breeding, it is not always occa≈øioned by ill humours in the ≈øtomach, but ≈øometimes from a ≈øympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Stomach and the Womb, by the nerves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted in the upper Orifice of the Stomach, which have communication, by continuity with tho≈øe that pa≈øs to the Womb. Now the Womb, which has a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite Sen≈øe, becau≈øe of its membranous compo≈øition, beginning to wax bigger, feels ≈øome pain, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ≈øame time communicated by this continuity of nerves to the upper Orifice of the Stomach, cau≈øe there the≈øe Vomitings; for Women that were in good health, before they conceived, Vomit from the fir≈øt day of their being with Child, tho' they have no ill humours in their Stomach.</p>
                        <p>If the Vomiting continues a long while, it weakens the Stomach very much and hinders dige≈øtion, tho' it oftentimes continues till the Women are quick, and then they recover their Appetite; but in ≈øome it does not go off till they are delivered, and ≈øome are mo≈øt afflicted with it towards the end of their reckoning, and this ≈øort ≈øeldom cea≈øes before they are brought to Bed.</p>
                        <p>Vomiting at the beginning, if it be gentle, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ≈øtraining, is not much minded, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59975:47"/>
it is beneficial; but if it continue after the third or fourth Month it ought to be remedied, becau≈øe the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment being daily Vomited up, the Mother and the Child will be much weakened; and moreover, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ≈øubver≈øion of the Stomach cau≈øing great agitation, and compre≈ø≈øion the Belly, occa≈øions mi≈øcarriage. It is very difficult to prevent wholly this Vomiting, yet it may be much le≈ø≈øened by a good Diet, and by eating little at a time; and to ≈øtrengthen the Stomach, let her eat her meat with the juice of Oranges, or the like. Marmalade of Quinces is al≈øo very good, being eaten after dinner, or after meals, and ≈øhe ought to drink Claret-wine with water, and it is convenient to quench Iron in her drink. She mu≈øt forbear fat Meats and Sauces, for they much ≈øoften the membranes of the Stomach, which were too weak and relaxed. Sweet and Sugar Sauces are al≈øo injurious.</p>
                        <p>But if the vomiting continue, tho' regular diet has bin u≈øed, the corrupt humours mu≈øt be purged off by ≈øtool, by ≈øome gentle purge made of Mallows, Ca≈ø≈øia, Rhubarb, and the like; but if the vomiting continues, tho' the woman ob≈øerves a good diet, and tho ≈øhe has bin purged, we mu≈øt do no more, for there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of mi≈øcarriage.</p>

A woman being ≈øix Months gone with Child, upon ≈øtumbling felt ≈øomething crack in her belly, near the loins, and ≈øhe pre≈øently felt great pain in her back, and in one ≈øide of her belly, ≈øhe vomited violently, and the next day was ≈øeized with a continual Fever, this la≈øted ≈øeven or eight days without ≈øleeping or re≈øting an hour, and all the while ≈øhe vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up all ≈øhe took; and ≈øhe was al≈øo very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Hicoughs, and had great pains like tho≈øe of labour: But by keeping her bed twelve days, and by bleeding in her arm thrice, and by the u≈øe of a grain of <hi>laudanum</hi> divers times, and by corroborating cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ≈øhe was ≈øomewhat ea≈øed, and all the ≈øymptoms went off by little and little, and ≈øhe went her full time; and indeed there is nothing that will mitigate the pains of the back and reins better, than re≈øt in bed, and bleeding in the Arm, e≈øpecially if they were occa≈øioned by the ligaments broke, or two much extended, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to keep up the belly with a broad ≈øwaith, if the Woman cannot keep her Bed. Oftentimes when a Woman has conceived, the cour≈øes being ≈øtopt, a great quantity of blood flows to the Brea≈øts, which makes them ≈øwell and be painful, therefore to prevent inflammations, Women ought to take great care that they are not ≈øtrait-laced, ≈øo as to compre≈øs the brea≈øts, and this is all that needs to be done at the beginning, only ≈øhe mu≈øt be ≈øure, that ≈øhe receives no blows upon them; but it's better to bleed in the Arm after the third or fourth Month, if a great deal of blood flow to the Brea≈øts, then to endeavour to repel it on ≈øome other part by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtringent or repelling Medicines; becau≈øe it does lea≈øt hurt in the brea≈øts than any where el≈øe.

But if it flow in too great quantity, the Mother and Child will be weakened thereby; therefore if ≈øo, it will be nece≈ø≈øary to apply an a≈øtringent Fomentation made of a Decoction of Pomgranate Peel, Province Ro≈øes, Granat Flowers, and a little Allom, and to turn the Blood, bleeding in the Arm is requi≈øite.</p>
                        <p>Women with Child are ≈øubject to ≈øeveral Fluxes, <hi>viz.</hi> a Loo≈øene≈øs, the Flux of the Cour≈øes and Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

But whatever ≈øort of Flux it is, if it be much and of long continuance, the Woman is in danger of mi≈øcarrying; for in a Lientary, the Mother and Child are much weakened, that being ca≈øt out by Stool, which ≈øhould be the Nouri≈øhment; and the Strength and Spirits are much weakened by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Loo≈øene≈øs; but the bloody Flux is mo≈øt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, becau≈øe the frequent endeavours to go to Stool, greatly di≈øturb the Womb. As to the Cure of the≈øe Fluxes, whereof great Care ought to be had in time; for they occa≈øion Mi≈øcarriages; the Woman afflicted with a Lientery ought to u≈øe meat of ea≈øie dige≈øtion, and little at a time, that ≈øo her Stomach may be able to concoct it and ≈øhe ought to drink Claret mixed with water, wherein Iron hath been quenched, and before and after Meals, a little burnt Wine, or good Canary may be drank, or a little Marmalade of Quinces may be eat.</p>
                        <p>If it be only a loo≈øne≈øs, and is gentle, and is not of long continuance, it needs not be much regarded, and therefore ought to be left to Nature, but if it continues

five or ≈øix days, ≈øome gentle purging Medicine ought to be u≈øed, as Syrup of <hi>Succory</hi> with <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> or the like.</p>
                        <p>But great care ought to be taken in the bloody flux, le≈øt by its continuance it ≈øhould cau≈øe mi≈øcarriage. In this ca≈øe the ill humours mu≈øt be fir≈øt purged off with Syrup of Succory and Rhubarb or the like, and Broaths made of Veal and Chicken with cooling herbs in them mu≈øt be u≈øed to qualifie the Acrimony of the humours; and ≈øhe mu≈øt drink Claret wine and Water, wherein Iron has been quenched, or half a Spoonful of Syrup of Quinces may be mixed with Water, and every other Night at Bed time after purging, ≈øhe may take fifteen or 20 Drops of liquid <hi>Laudanum,</hi> and Gli≈øters may be injected made of Calves Head, or Sheeps head Broath; and to prevent the frequent Endeavours of going to Stool, a Gli≈øter made of Milk, and the Yolk of an Egg mixed, may be now and then injected. When a Woman is with Child, generally ≈øpeaking, ≈øhe ought not to have her Cour≈øes, becau≈øe their ordinary pa≈ø≈øage is ≈øtopt, and al≈øo becau≈øe the Blood is then employ'd for the Nouri≈øhment of the Child; yet ≈øome big bellied Women have their monthly purgations till the fifth Month, and yet go out their time, and do very well. A Woman having her cour≈øes, thought ≈øhe was not with Child, and becau≈øe ≈øhe found her ≈øelf indi≈øpo≈øed, ≈øhe advi≈øed with a Phy≈øician, who by Bleeding and purging her made her mi≈øcarry, after ≈øhe had bin three Months gone with Child.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted, that when Women with Child have a Flux of Blood, you mu≈øt carefully con≈øider whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the ordinary Cour≈øes, or a real Flooding; if if it be the ordinary Cour≈øes, the Blood comes at the accu≈øtomed times, and flows by degrees from the Neck, near the inward Orifice of the Womb, and not from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59975:51"/>
the Bottom of it as may be perceived, if trying with a Finger, you find the inward Orifice quite clo≈øed, which could not be if the Blood i≈ø≈øued from the Bottom. It mu≈øt be likewi≈øe con≈øidered whether the Cour≈øes flow, by rea≈øon of the Superfluity of the Blood, the Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it, or the weakne≈øs of the Ve≈ø≈øels. If abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood be alone the Cau≈øe there being more than enough for the Nouri≈øhment of the Child, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures neither Mother nor Child, but is a Benefit to both, provided it be moderate. But if there be not abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood, and if the Woman u≈øe to have but a ≈ømall quantity of her Cour≈øes, before ≈øhe was with Child, it is a ≈øign that the Flux proceeds from the Heat and Acrimony of the Blood, or the Weakne≈øs of the Ve≈ø≈øels.</p>
                        <p>To prevent this Flux, when it ought to be ≈øtopt, the Woman mu≈øt keep in Bed, and forbear all things that may heat her blood, and mu≈øt ob≈øerve a cooling and ≈øtrengthening Diet, and feed on Meat that breeds good Blood, and thickens it; as Broths made of Chicken, Knuckels of Veal and the like, wherein may be boiled cooling Herbs; Rice Milk and Barley Broth is al≈øo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, and in all her Drink quench Iron. She mu≈øt forbear Conver≈øation with her Husband. And to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Child, which in this ca≈øe is u≈øually very weak, Linnen dipt in ≈øtrong Wine, wherein Cinamon and Pomgranat Peel has bin infu≈øed, mu≈øt be applyed to the Mothers Belly.</p>
                        <p>Flooding is much more dangerous than a Flux of the Cour≈øes; for the Blood comes from the bottom of the Womb with pain, and in great Abundance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues flooding daily without Intermi≈ø≈øion; only ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Clods of Blood ≈øtop it for a while, but afterwards it flows more violently, and de≈øtroys both Mother and Child if not ≈øea≈øonably ≈øtop'd by the delivery of the Woman.</p>

                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59975:52"/>A fal≈øe Conception or a Mole, which the Womb endeavours to expel is u≈øually the Cau≈øe, when the flooding happens when young with Child, whereby ≈øome Ve≈ø≈øels at the bottom of the Womb continually ca≈øt forth Blood until the ≈øtrange Body is ejected.

                           <p>The Womb-cake, otherwi≈øe called the Womb-liver, is much like the Spleen, it has abundance of <hi>Fibres;</hi> and ≈ømall ve≈ø≈øels, it is two fingers breadth, thin near the edges, and thick in the middle. And when the Child is ready for Birth, it is a quarter of a Yard over: It is ≈ømooth and ≈øomewhat hollowi≈øh on the ≈øide next the Child, and is joined to the Chorion, but is very unequal on that ≈øide next the Womb, and has many Bunchings out, by which it ≈øticks fa≈øt to the Womb. When there are Twins, there are two Womb-Cakes, either di≈øtinct in Shape, or ≈øeperated by a Membrane one from the other, and a particular rope of umbilical Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels is in≈øerted into each from each Child; it at fir≈øt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears like a woolly Sub≈øtance on the out≈øide of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Membrane, that encompa≈ø≈øes the Child about the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59975:55"/>
ninth week; and a red fle≈øhy ≈øoft ≈øub≈øtance grows upon it in a ≈øhort time, that is unequal, and in little knobs, and thereby pre≈øently ≈øticks to the Womb, and is very vi≈øible about the thirteenth Week; till this time the Child is increa≈øed and nouri≈øhed wholly by the appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition of the Chry≈øtaline or Albugineous Liquor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ≈øwims loo≈øe in the inner Membrane call'd <hi>Amnios,</hi> having no umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels formed, whereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing from the Womb-cake: But when it grows bigger, and begins to need more Nouri≈øhment, the extremities of the umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels begin to grow out of the Navel by little and little, and are extended towards the Womb-cake, that they may draw a more nouri≈øhing juice out of it. It has Arteries, Veins Nerves, and Lympheducts, ≈øome from the Womb, and ≈øome from the Chorion. But tho' they are very large and vi≈øible in the Womb, yet they ≈øend but very ≈ømall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillaries to the Womb-cake. Tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels that come from the <hi>Chorion</hi> are Arteries and Veins, and perhaps the Lympheducts, the Arteries and Veins that come from the Womb, Spring from the Hypoga≈øtricks, and from that Branch of the Spermaticks, that is in≈øerted into the bottom of the Womb, the Umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels of the Child come from the Chorion. The Womb-cake for the fir≈øt Month ≈øticks very fa≈øt to the Womb, but when the Child is come to Maturity, it ea≈øily ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates from the Womb, and falls from it like ripe fruit from a Tree, and after the Birth makes part of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundine. Next to the Womb-cake follow the two Membranes in which the Child is wrapt, the outer is called <hi>Chorion,</hi> the inner <hi>Amnios,</hi> and when the Child is perfectly formed, there is a third betwixt the other two called <hi>Allantois.</hi> The <hi>Chorion</hi> is ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thick, ≈ømooth on the in≈øide, but ≈øomething une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual or rough; and in that part of it, that ≈øticks to the Womb-cake, and thereby to the womb, there are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59975:55"/>
many Ve≈ø≈øels which ri≈øe from the Womb-cake it ≈øelf, and the Umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels. Twins are both encompa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in one <hi>Chorion,</hi> but each a particular <hi>Amnios,</hi> it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Egg originally, and when the Egg is carried to the Womb, and becomes a Conception, this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane ≈øucks up the moi≈øture that abounds in the womb at that time; for while the Conception is loo≈øe in the Womb, it is increa≈øed in the ≈øame manner, as an Egg in a Hen, which while it is in the knot, it is only a Yolk, and when it drops off from thence, and falls thro' the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> it is not at all altered, but when it comes into the Cells of the Proce≈øs of the Womb, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to gather white, tho' it adhere to no part of the Womb, nor has any Umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels but as Eggs of Fi≈øhes and Frogs do without procure to them≈øelves whites out of the Water, or as Beans, Pea≈øe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pul≈øe, and bread Corn, being ≈øteep'd in Moi≈øture, ≈øwell and ≈øo acquire Nouri≈øhment from the Bud that is ≈øpringing out of them. In like manner, does a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh Moi≈øture flow out of the Wrinkles of the Womb, whence the Yolk gathers its white, and concocts it by its vegetative and innate heat: And indeed, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that abounds in the Wrinkles of the Womb, ta≈øts like the white; and in this manner, the Yolk falling by Degrees, is encompa≈ø≈øed with a white, till at la≈øt, the outmo≈øt Womb having got Skins and a Shell, is brought to perfection: Even ≈øo the <hi>Chorion</hi> ≈øucks up the albugineous Liquor that from the fir≈øt Conception in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øes daily in it, and ≈øweats thro' the <hi>Amnios,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Embrio-≈øwims, till the Umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels and the Womb-cake are formed, from and thro' which, the Child may receive Nouri≈øhment.

But becau≈øe this Liquor is ≈øo very little, there ≈øweats thro' this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane pre≈øently part of that nutritious albugineous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that is contained in the <hi>Chorion,</hi> which it had ≈øuckt out of the Womb, and the Child receives its increa≈øe by Addition of this humour to its undi≈øcernable Rudiments.

                           <p>The Membrane call'd <hi>Allantoides</hi> is the third that encompa≈ø≈øes the whole Child; it is very probable that this as well as the other two was originally in the Egg, yet it does not appear, till after the formation of the Umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels and Womb-cake, and 'till the Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineous Liquor cea≈øes to be ≈øuckt up by the <hi>Chorion</hi> out of the Womb: but as ≈øoon as the Child begins to be nouri≈øhed by the Umbilical Ve≈ø≈øels, and the <hi>Urachus</hi> is pa≈ø≈øable, then this Membrane begins pre≈øently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. It contains the Child's Urine, brought into it by the <hi>Urachus</hi> from the Bladder, and with which it is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more and more daily till the birth.

is very thin, ≈ømooth, ≈øoft, and yet den≈øe, it may be di≈øtingui≈øhed from the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios,</hi> becau≈øe they have a great many Ve≈ø≈øels di≈øper≈øed thro' them, but this has neither Vein nor Artery that is vi≈øible. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opening the Membranes that encompa≈øs the Child, the Navel-≈øtring appears, which is membranous, wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and unequal, ari≈øing from the Navel, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Womb-cake; it is about half an ell long, and a finger thick. The Ve≈ø≈øels contained in this ≈øtring are four, one vein, two arteries, and the <hi>Urachus</hi> wrapt in a common Coat. The Vein ri≈øes from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Child, and is larger than the Arteries, and from thence pa≈ø≈øing out of the Navel, it runs along the common Coat to the Womb-cake, into which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by many roots; but before it reaches it, it ≈øends ≈øome little twigs into the <hi>Amnios.</hi> It was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought, that the only u≈øe of this Vein was to carry the blood from the Womb-cake to the Child, and ≈øome ≈øtill think, that it carries chyle. In the common coat are included al≈øo two ≈ømall Arteries; they ≈øpring from the inner Iliack branches of the great Artery, and pa≈ø≈øing by the ≈øides of the bladder, they ri≈øe up to the Navel, out of which they are conducted with the Womb-cake, in the ≈øame common cover with the Vein and <hi>Urachus</hi>; wherewith they are twined like a Rope. Spirituous blood is driven from the Child by the beating of its Heart to the Womb-cake, and the Membranes for their nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from which, what blood remains circulates back again in the umbilical vein, together with the nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous juice afre≈øh imbibed by its Capillaries di≈øper≈øed in the Womb-cake; but Blood and Vital Spirits are not carried by the Arteries from the Mother to the Child, as <hi>Galen</hi> and many others have taught. The <hi>Urachus</hi> is the fourth Umbilical Ve≈ø≈øel, which is a ≈ømall membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, round pipe, endued with a very ≈øtraight Cavity,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59975:57"/>
it ri≈øes from the bottom of the Bladder up to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, out of which it pa≈ø≈øes along within the common Cover, and opens into the <hi>allantoides</hi>; the≈øe four Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels have one common Cover, which keeps each of them from touching the other, which is called <hi>funiculus,</hi> it is membranous, round and hollow, and con≈øi≈øts of a double Coat, it has ≈øeveral knots upon it here and there, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Midwives gue≈øs how many Children more the Mother ≈øhall have; but this is vain and ≈øuper≈øtitious. This Navel Rope is wont to be tied, when the Infant is born, one or two fingers breadth from the Navel, with a ≈øtrong thread ca≈øt about it ≈øeveral times, and then about two or three fingers breadth beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature, to be cut off; what is not cut off, is ≈øuffer'd to remain, 'till it drop off of its own accord.</p>
                           <p>There have been great di≈øputes among Phy≈øicians, with what, and by what way the Child is nouri≈øhed, ≈øome ≈øay by blood alone received by the umbilical Vein, others by chile alone conveyed in by the mouth; but indeed, according to the different degrees of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that an Egg pa≈ø≈øes from a Conception to a Child fit for the Birth, it is nouri≈øhed differently; for as ≈øoon as an Egg is ripened, and falls into the womb, it immediately ≈øucks up thro' its outward membranes ≈øome of that albugonious liquor, wherewith at this time the internal ≈øuperficies of the womb is much moi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; and therefore as ≈øoon as the fir≈øt liniaments of the Child begin to the drawn out of that Humour contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Amnios,</hi> they are immediately increa≈øed by the appo≈øition of the ≈øaid liquor ≈øtrained out of the <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> thro' the <hi>amnios</hi> into its cavity; but when the parts of the Child begin to be a little more perfect, and the <hi>chorion</hi> is ≈øo den≈øe, that not any more of the ≈øaid li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is ≈øuckt up by it, the umbillical Ve≈ø≈øels begin to be formed, and to extend to the ≈øide of the <hi>amnios,</hi> which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59975:57"/>
they penetrate, and both the Vein and the Arteries pa≈øs al≈øo through the <hi>allantois</hi> and <hi>Chorion,</hi> and are implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Womb-cake, that at this time, fir≈øt gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Chorion,</hi> joins it to the womb, and now the hypoga≈øtrick and ≈øpermatick Arteries, that before carried the nutritious juice into the cavity of the womb, open by their orifices into the Womb-cake, where either by ≈øtraining through it, or by fermenting, they put off the ≈øaid juice, which is ≈øuckt up by the umbilical Vein, and carried by it, fir≈øt to the Liver, afterwards to the Heart of the Child, where the thin ≈øpirituous part of it is converted into blood, but the thick and earthy part going down by the <hi>aorta</hi> enters the umbilical Arteries, and by tho≈øe branches of them, that run through the <hi>amnios,</hi> is di≈øcharged into the cavity of it. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may ridicule this pa≈ø≈øage of the nutritious juice, becau≈øe it is ≈øuppo≈øed, according to this account to chu≈øe its way, as if it were a rea≈øonable Creature, but they may as well expo≈øe the pa≈ø≈øage of the Chyle from the common duct to the Womb-cake, when the Child is in the Womb, for how ≈øhould the Chyle know, or the milky Ve≈ø≈øels by which it pa≈ø≈øes, that there is any Child in the Womb, that the one ≈øhould offer to go that way, and the other give it way to go thither at that time; whereas the pa≈ø≈øage is ≈øhut at other times; and yet this, they that laugh at this pa≈ø≈øage of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious juice, allow; and how comes the Chyle to turn its cour≈øe pre≈øently after the Child is born, and in≈øtead of going down to the womb, ri≈øe up to the brea≈øts. What rea≈øon can be given for the≈øe and many other things in nature? We are therefore forced to confe≈øs, that there are many things in nature, that are only known to Almighty God, the maker of all things. There is al≈øo another objection again≈øt this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it allows none of the Mothers blood to be received

by the Child thro' the Umbilical Vein, but only nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious juice, and how ≈øhould it come to pa≈øs that the blood ≈øhould be bred in the Child, ≈øeeing it has blood before the Liver, or Heart, or any other part that a≈ø≈øi≈øts in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king blood, are in a condition to officiate. It is indeed very ≈øtrange, how blood ≈øhould be made ≈øo ≈øoon, but that it is made out of the Nutritious Juice, without the mixture of any from the Mother, is manife≈øt by Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>'s curious Ob≈øervations concerning the order of the generation of the parts in a Chicken, which from fir≈øt to la≈øt receives nothing from the head; (≈øays he) there appears at the very fir≈øt a red leaping Speck, a beating Bladder, and Fibres drawn from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining blood in them; and as far as one can di≈øcern by in≈øpection, blood is made before the leaping Speck is formed, and the ≈øame has vital heat, before it is ≈øtir'd by the Pul≈øe: And as the beating begins in the blood, and from it, ≈øo at la≈øt, at the point of Death it ends in it. And becau≈øe the beating Bladders, and the ≈øanguinous Fibres that are made from it, and are ≈øeen fir≈øt of all, it ≈øeems as if the blood were before its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles. This Worthy Author, in his Treati≈øe of the generation of Animals, owns it is a Paradox, that blood ≈øhould be made, and moved, and have vital Spirit before any Organs for making blood or of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have a being; and that the Body ≈øhould be nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øhed and increa≈øed before the Stomach and Bowels the Organs of Concoction are framed. But neither of the≈øe are ≈øtranger, than that there ≈øhould be Sen≈øe and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before there is a Brain. And yet he ≈øays in his 57<hi>th</hi> Exercitation, that the Faetus moves, contracts, and ≈øtretches out it ≈øelf, when there is nothing to be ≈øeen for a Brain but clear water. Now if all the≈øe wonderful and unaccountable things do undoubtedly come to pa≈øs in an Egg, by the warmth of the Hen

only, why ≈øhould we count it a wonderful thing, that nutritious Juice impregnated with the vital Spirits of the arterial blood wherewith it circulates thro' the Mother's Heart, ≈øhould be turned into blood in a Child, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the friendly warmth of the Womb, tho' the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øends no humour to it under the form of Blood, and tho' it ≈øelf as yet has no perfect Organs to make Blood.</p>
                           <p>The thicker nutritious juice being put off in the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios,</hi> by the umbilical Arteries, the Child ≈øucks in ≈øome of it, as ≈øoon as the Mouth, Stomach, and the like are perfectly formed, which going down into the Stomach and Guts, is received by the milky Veins, as in grown people. <hi>Diemerbrock</hi> proves that the Child is nouri≈øhed this way, by the following Rea≈øons; fir≈øt, becau≈øe the Stomach of the Child is never empty, but has a milky whiti≈øh liquor in it, and in the mouth of the Child, there is al≈øo ≈øuch an humour. 2<hi>dly.</hi> Becau≈øe there are Excrements in the guts, and the Child voids them by ≈øtool, as ≈øoon as it is born, and certainly the≈øe are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of ≈øome nouri≈øhment taken in by the Mouth. 3<hi>dly.</hi> Had not the Stomach been accu≈øtomed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Concoction in the Womb, it would not pre≈øently after the Birth perform the ≈øame. 4<hi>thly.</hi> Becau≈øe the Infant pre≈øently after it is born, knows how to ≈øuck the Brea≈øt, which it cannot be thought it could ≈øo readily do, if it had taken nothing by ≈øuction, while it was in the Womb. 5<hi>thly.</hi> Becau≈øe many Children vomit up a milky nouri≈øhment, as ≈øoon as they are born, before they have ≈øuckt any Brea≈øt, or taken any thing by the Mouth, which therefore mu≈øt needs be received into the Stomach.</p>

The ≈øpinous proce≈ø≈øes of the Vertebrae of the Back are wanting; the Heart is very big, and its Ears large; there are two unions of the greater Ve≈ø≈øels that are not to be ≈øeen in grown per≈øons, namely, Fir≈øt the Oval Hole, whereby there is a pa≈ø≈øage open out of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Vein into the Vein of the Lungs, ju≈øt as each of them are opening, the fir≈øt into the right ventricle, and the latter into the left Ventricle of the Heart; and this hole ju≈øt as it opens into the Vein of the Lungs has a Valve, that hinders any thing from returning out of the ≈øaid Vein into the hole. Secondly, the Arterial Channel, which two fingers breadth from the Ba≈øis of the Heart joins the Artery of the Lungs to the <hi>Aorta,</hi> it has a pretty large cavity, and a≈øcends a little oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ≈øaid Artery to the <hi>Aorta,</hi> into which it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Blood that was driven into the Artery of the Lungs out of the right Ventricle of the Heart, ≈øo that it never comes into the left Ventricle, as the Blood that is ≈øent out of the left Ventricle into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> never came to the right, but immediatly pa≈øt into it out of the hollow Vein by the Oval hole, ≈øo that the Blood does not pa≈øs thro' both the ventricles as it does after the Child is born.

for this place we ≈øhall let go, and ≈øtick clo≈øe to them, who affirm, that the ≈øeed of both Sexes, being confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in the <hi>Womb,</hi> doth make up the fir≈øt matter of the Birth; ≈øo that if there were not a mixture of both <hi>Seeds,</hi> it were impo≈ø≈øible that any generation could be. Yet though there be of nece≈ø≈øity a confu≈øion of both Seeds, we deny not but that their qualities are different, for the <hi>Seed</hi> of a man exceeds the <hi>Seed</hi> of a Woman, both in thickne≈øs and heat, which is more cold and moi≈øt, and therefore more watry. Yet though they differ thus in quality, it is not to be denied, but that the <hi>Seed</hi> of the Woman gives a mutual a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to the <hi>Seed</hi> of the Man, in the work of generation.</p>
                        <p>But it being unque≈øtionable, that the men≈øtruous Blood is the matter of the Womans <hi>Seed,</hi> therefore that ye may know the Original of it, it is to be under≈øtood that the <hi>Men≈øtruous blood</hi> is nothing el≈øe but an <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the third concoction, gathered together every Month, and purged out.

                        <p>Under the ≈øaid vein called the <hi>Aorta,</hi> in the conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the heart, there is another vein called the <hi>vei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Artery,</hi> which was therefore framed to carry the cool air from the lungs to temper the great heat of the heart.</p>
                        <p>Now there being many veins, which running from the concavity of the heart, are in≈øerted into the lungs, therefore by the≈øe veins the lungs are al≈øo framed; for the vein which proceeds from the right concavity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a mo≈øt ≈øubtile <hi>blood,</hi> which is turned into the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of the lungs. By the great veins of the heart and liver the <hi>hollow vein,</hi> and the <hi>Aorta</hi> is the whole brea≈øt generated, and after that the arms, and legs in order.</p>
                        <p>Within the fore≈øaid time, is generated the la≈øt and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt part of this ≈øub≈øtance, that is to ≈øay, <hi>Brain,</hi> in the third little skin of this ma≈øs: For the whole ma≈øs of the <hi>Seed</hi> being repleat with vital ≈øpirits, that vital ≈øpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a great part of the Genital moi≈øture into one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hollowne≈øs, where the <hi>Brain</hi> is formed; outwardly it is covered with a certain covering, which being baked and dried by the heat, is reduced into a bone, and ≈øo is the <hi>Skull</hi> made.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59975:63"/>Now the Brain is ≈øo formed as to conceive, retain, and change the nature of all the vital ≈øpirits, whence are the beginings of Rea≈øon, and of all the Sen≈øes; for, as out of the <hi>Liver</hi> ari≈øe the <hi>Veins,</hi> out of the <hi>Heart</hi> ari≈øe the <hi>Arteries,</hi> ≈øo out of the <hi>Brain</hi> ari≈øe the <hi>Nerves</hi> of a more ≈øoft and gentle nature, yet not hollow like <hi>Veins,</hi> but ≈øollid. The≈øe are the cheife≈øt in≈øtruments of all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes and by which all the motion of the Sen≈øes are made by the <hi>vital Spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After the <hi>Nerves,</hi> is generated by the <hi>Brain,</hi> al≈øo the pith of the back-bone, which cannot be called <hi>Marrow</hi>: For the <hi>Marrow</hi> is a ≈øuperfluous ≈øub≈øtance begot out of the <hi>Blood,</hi> de≈øtined for the moi≈øtening, and for the ≈øtrengthening of the bones: but the <hi>brain</hi> and pith of the back-bone take their beginning from the Seed, being not de≈øtined for the nouri≈øhing, or ≈øtrengthning of the members but to con≈øtitute certain private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts of the body, for the motion and u≈øe the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, that all the other. Nerves may take their begining thence; for from the pith of the back-bone, do ari≈øe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nerves, by which the body obtains both ≈øen≈øe and motion.</p>
                        <p>Here is al≈øo to be noted, that out of the Seed it ≈øelf are generated gri≈øtles, bones, tunicles, for the Veins of the Liver, the arteries of the heart, the <hi>brain</hi> with its <hi>Nerves</hi>: be≈øides, the tunicles and pannicles, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coverings which the Infant is wrapt in. Now of the proper <hi>blood</hi> of the Birth, the fle≈øh is formed; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever parts are of a fle≈øhy ≈øub≈øtance; as the heart, the liver, the lights, Then are all the≈øe nouri≈øhed by the men≈øtrous <hi>blood,</hi> which is attracted through the veins of the Navel. This is all di≈øtinctly done from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception unto the eighteenth day of the fir≈øt month, in all which time it is called Seed. After which it receives the name of <hi>Birth.</hi>

                        <p>WHil≈øt the <hi>Birth</hi> remains in the <hi>Womb,</hi> it is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed up with <hi>blood</hi> attracted through the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, which is the rea≈øon that the flowers do cea≈øe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in Women, as ≈øoon as they have conceived.</p>
                        <p>Now this <hi>blood,</hi> pre≈øently after conception, is di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed into three parts; the pure≈øt of it drawn by the Child for the nouri≈øhment of it ≈øelf; the ≈øecond, which is le≈øs pure and thin, the <hi>Womb</hi> forces upwards to the brea≈øt, where it is turned into milk. The third and mo≈øt impure part of the <hi>blood</hi> remains in the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and comes away with the <hi>Secondines,</hi> both in the Birth, and after the Birth,</p>
                        <p>Now the Infant being thus formed and perfected in the <hi>womb</hi> for the fir≈øt month ≈øends forth its Urine thro' the pa≈ø≈øages of the navel; but in the la≈øt month that pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage being ≈øhut up through the privy-members; yet notwith≈øtanding, while the child is in the <hi>Womb,</hi> he voids nothing out at the <hi>Fundament,</hi> becau≈øe he hath taken no nouri≈øhment in at the Mouth. After the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth day it receives life, and is then called an Infant.</p>
                        <p>Now, though the Infant hath by this time obtained ≈øen≈øe, yet doth he not move: He mo≈øt commonly moves in twice the time that he was formed, and in thrice the ≈øpace after he began his motion, he ha≈øtens into the world; as for example, if the infant were formed in forty five days, it will move in ninety, and be born the ninth month after that.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. V. Of the condition of the Infant in the Womb, in the ≈øixth, ≈øeventh, and eighth month.</head>
                        <p>AFter the third and fourth month, the Infant is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed with more plenty of nouri≈øhment, until the time of delivery approach. Now you mu≈øt ob≈øerve that a child born in the ≈øixth month cannot live, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon that it is not come to its ju≈øt perfection; but if it be born in the ≈øeventh month, it will very ea≈øily live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it is come to its full perfection. Now the rea≈øon why tho≈øe that are born in the eighth month do not live, when as tho≈øe that are born in the ≈øeventh do, is plain; for in the ≈øeventh month the Infant ≈øtirs it ≈øelf to come forth; ≈øo that if it have ≈øo much ≈øtrength it ea≈øily performs its de≈øire; if not, it remains in the <hi>womb,</hi> till it have gathered two months more ≈øtrength. After this motion of the ≈øeventh month, if it be not able to come forth, it changes it ≈øelf into another part of the womb, by which motion it is ≈øo weakened, that if it ≈øhould be born in the eighth month, it were impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it ≈øhould live, for it is weakened by a double mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not only that of the ≈øeventh month, but al≈øo by that motion whereby it ≈øtrives to go forth in the eighth month.</p>

                        <p>The Male is commonly ≈øituated in the right ≈øide of the <hi>Womb</hi> the Female in the left.</p>
                        <p>The general ≈øituation of the Child, either Male, or Female, in the <hi>Womb,</hi> is always the ≈øame which hath been ob≈øerved and ≈øeen to be in this po≈øture, when the Infant lies with his Back and his Buttocks leaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Back of the Mother, the Head inclined, and touching his Brea≈øt with his Chin; re≈øting his two Hands upon his Knees; his <hi>Navel</hi> and his <hi>No≈øe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his two <hi>Knees,</hi> with his two <hi>Eyes</hi> upon his two <hi>Thumbs,</hi> his <hi>Legs</hi> folded backward, and touching his <hi>Buttocks</hi> with each <hi>Leg.</hi>

                        <p>This Figure is the mo≈øt natural, as being lea≈øt ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ≈øuffer any accident, being le≈øs inconvenient, and le≈øs trouble≈øome to the Mother.</p>
                        <p>The mo≈øt natural form for the Child to come into the World, is when the Head comes forward, the Hands being ≈øtretched upon the Hips.</p>
                        <p>The things which are the Cau≈øes of a Womans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, are three; fir≈øt, the want of re≈øpiration and Air for the Infant. The ≈øecond is the want of nouri≈øhment, of which, when the Infant finds a defect in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Womb</hi> he is forced to ≈øeek it in another place. The third is the narrowne≈øs of the place where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant lies, ≈øo that he is forced to ≈øeek room other where, which makes him to break the <hi>Membranes,</hi> wherein he was contained, pre≈ø≈øing and con≈øtraining the Mother by the ≈øharpne≈øs of tho≈øe <hi>Waters,</hi> to do her duty for his relea≈øe. Now as ≈øome ≈øay, there are three ways or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Childrens coming upon the Earth; Fir≈øt, when the <hi>Head</hi> comes foremo≈øt, and then the Woman is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily delivered: The ≈øecond, when it comes forth a-cro≈øs, or one ≈øide, or the <hi>Feet</hi> foremo≈øt, and then the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59975:65"/>
≈øuffers much, and either they both die, or one of them, As for tho≈øe <hi>Births</hi> which are unnatural, we ≈øhall in another place treat of them, and their remedies. In this combate, the Infant and the Mother ≈øuffer very much, by rea≈øon that Woman is a Creature delicate and timerous, and not patient of much labour: or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe women great with Child live a lazy and ≈øloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life; and be≈øides that, many times they eat bad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, which encrea≈øes <hi>Humours</hi> and ≈øuperfluous <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which quantity of <hi>Humours</hi> makes the Woman to breath ≈øhort, which is a thing very trouble≈øome to the Infant; for a Woman that will expel the <hi>Birth</hi> quick, ought to keep her breath in, as much as ≈øhe can. The third Rea≈øon of the pain in Womens Travail, is by rea≈øon that the <hi>Head</hi> of a Child is bigger, being compared to the <hi>Members,</hi> than the <hi>Head</hi> of any other Creature, which makes a greater <hi>opening</hi> and <hi>dilaceration.</hi>

Let us therefore con≈øider of the things required in a Midwife, in relation both to her Per≈øon, and her manners: As for her Age, ≈øhe ought to be neither too young, nor too old,<note rend="inter">Her Age.</note> in a good habit of Body, and not ≈øubject to Di≈øea≈øes, nor mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhapen in any parts of her Body, peculiar in her Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and in her Per≈øon; her Hands mu≈øt be ≈ømall. with her Nails pared clo≈øe, without any Rings upon them, in the time of her Duty, nor Bracelets upon her Wri≈øts; ≈øhe mu≈øt be chearful, plea≈øant, ≈øtrong, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and u≈øed to travel; it being required that ≈øhe ≈øhould be ≈øtirring at all Hours, and abiding a long time together with her Patient.</p>
                        <p>For her Manners, ≈øhe ought to be Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, Sober, Cha≈øte; not repining,<note rend="inter">Her Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Arrogant, or Covetous, nor apt to talk of what ≈øhe ≈øees in the Hou≈øes where ≈øhe hath to do.</p>

a-bed notwith≈øtanding that ≈øhe hath ≈øome certain pains ≈øometimes, yet ≈øhe may lie and re≈øt her ≈øelf, and now and then take a nap: By which means, both the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Infant do with greater ≈øtrength endure their ≈øucceeding hard≈øhip; be≈øides that, her waters do come down better. If her Travel be long, ≈øhe may take ≈øome broth, or the yolk of a porched Egg, with ≈øome bread, or a cup of wine, or di≈øtilled water; yet ≈øhe mu≈øt have a care le≈øt ≈øhe over-charge her ≈øelf either with meat or drink.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that all women are not delivered alike; for ≈øome lie in their bed, others ≈øit in a chair, being ≈øupported and held up by others, or el≈øe re≈øting upon the ≈øide of the bed or chair; others upon their knees, being upheld under their arms; but the be≈øt and ≈øafe≈øt is to lie in their beds; and for her good and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent delivery, let the Midwife and others ob≈øerve what follows.</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt, the woman that is in travel, ought to be laid upon her back,<note rend="inter">Certain Rules.</note> her head being lifted up a little higher with a pillow, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving al≈øo a pillow under her reins to ≈øu≈øtain her back; under her buttocks ≈øhe mu≈øt have a larger pillow, to rai≈øe them a little, and that her rump may be elevated; for a woman that lies low in tho≈øe parts, can never be well delivered, for the avoiding of which, this ≈øituation is very convenient. Her thighs and knees mu≈øt be a good way ≈øeparated the one from the other, with her legs bowed, and drawn up towards her buttocks, the ≈øoles of her feet, and her heels, being fixed upon a board, laid thwart the bed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, to ≈øome women they do u≈øe a ≈øwath-band four double; this ≈øwath-band mu≈øt be a foot broad or more; which being put under her reins, is to be held

up ≈øtreight, by two per≈øons ≈øtanding on each ≈øide ju≈øt at the time of her pains, both of them, at the ≈øame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant, heaving up both ends, with an exact evene≈øs; for otherwi≈øe it does more harm than good. It is al≈øo requi≈øite, that two of her friends ≈øhould hold the upper part of her ≈øhoulders, that ≈øhe may be able to force out the Birth with more advantage; And it will not be ami≈øs, for ≈øome of her friends to pre≈øs the upper parts of her belly, ≈øo to thru≈øt down the Infant, by little and little.

                        <p>Thirdly, as for the woman her ≈øelf, ≈øhe mu≈øt be of a good heart, and force her ≈øelf by ≈øtriving as much as po≈ø≈øibly ≈øhe can; ≈øtopping her mouth, and keeping her breath, as if ≈øhe were doing the ordinary deeds of nature.</p>

                        <p>WHen the Woman begins to cry out, and hath ≈øent for her Widwife; the fir≈øt thing that the Midwife is to ask, is, when ≈øhe did conceive? 2.

She ought then to ask her ≈øome que≈øtions concerning her pains; for if they be quick and ≈øtrong, begining at the <hi>Reins,</hi> and ≈øliding down all along the belly, without ending at the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, but ≈øtill falling down upon the groins, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly at the bottom of the belly, below which is the interiour neck of the <hi>womb</hi>; the≈øe are certain ≈øigns that the woman begins to be in Labour. 4.

therefore it is better to give ten or twelve hours for the <hi>Blood</hi> to ≈øettle in; as al≈øo for that which was ca≈øt upon the <hi>Lungs</hi> by the agitation of Travel, to di≈øtil down again into its place.</p>

                        <p>THere is great difference in the governing Women in Child-bed; for ≈øhe that thinks to order an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary labouring, or Country-woman, like a per≈øon of quality, kills her, and ≈øhe that thinks to govern a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of quality like an ordinary Country-woman, does the ≈øame to her. For the Stomach and Con≈øtitution of the one is tender and weak, and the Con≈øtitution and Stomach of the other ≈øtrong and lu≈øty; which will not be ≈øatisfied with ordinary Viands: For if you give to one of the≈øe ≈øtrong Stomachs pre≈øently after their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, any ≈øtrong Broth, or Eggs, or a draught of Milk, they are like Mills that always grind, and empty as fa≈øt as they pour in; and that that gives one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a fever, keeps another from it; and therefore Women in Child-bed are to be governed by their ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Con≈øtitutions. As for Women that are delicate, and have been accu≈øtomed to live delicately, greater care mu≈øt be taken of them, giving them meats that breed good nouri≈øhment, and do not clog the ≈øtomach, forbearing al≈øo to give her tho≈øe meats to which ≈øhe has too great a di≈ølike, agreeing to her humour, provided, that the meat which ≈øhe loves be not hurtful; and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her for the fir≈øt eight days of her lying in, boyled meats rather than ro≈øted, as gellies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the juice of Veal, or Capon, but not Mutton, it being too fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh: giving her to drink Barly-water, or el≈øe water boyled, wherein is boyled a dram of Cinnamon to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pint, and two ounces of Sugar di≈ø≈øolved; or if ≈øhe do not love Sugar, Coriander-≈øeed water; if ≈øhe drink wine, let it be two thirds of water to one third of wine, giving her in the morning white-wine, and in

the afternoon Claret, taking care of eating any thing that may breed any crudities: She may al≈øo take at the di≈øcretion of tho≈øe about her, Almond-milk now and then. There are ≈øome women that cannot be kept from ≈øleeping, and others that cannot ≈øleep at all. It will not be ami≈øs to give to tho≈øe that cannot ≈øleep, French barley-water; the way to make it well, is to let it boyl well, and to take the broth without ≈øtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; neither ought it to be taken after the eight days are pa≈øt, by rea≈øon that it nouri≈øhes exceedingly, and does not a little ob≈øtruct the Liver.</p>

                        <p>TAE Travel of a Woman bringing forth two Infants is more tedious, and it many times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that one of the Children comes forth very well,

and the other comes forth very hardly; and this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that that which comes forth fir≈øt, is always the ≈øtronge≈øt having the power to go before the other, and to break the membranes that enveloped it. And oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times while the fir≈øt is born, the other remains behind, wrapt in ≈øuch membranes as the former was, ≈øo that it remains a good ≈øpace behind the other, ≈øometimes two hours, and yet it hath been very well born. Now knowing, that that which came fir≈øt was the ≈øtronge≈øt, it would not be ami≈øs to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the other in coming forth, by breaking the Membranes that contain the waters; and, if that fail, by giving ≈øtrong Cly≈øters to excite the pain; which were it not many times done, the Child would never be able to endure the pain of coming into the World, by rea≈øon of its extraordinary weakne≈øs; which is ≈øo great ≈øometimes, that the bone of the Forehead is divided, and ≈øeparated down to the no≈øe; although the Infant being born, it joyns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again, and the Infant does very well: Which if it happen, you mu≈øt have a great care to bind ≈øome kind of ≈øoft pillow upon the place, that the air may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in.

                        <p>IT is an ordinary thing for Women that lye in, by rea≈øon of their bed to lo≈øe the benefit of their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which hinders the evacuation of their Milk, which cau≈øes Fevers, by ≈øending gro≈øs vapours to the head; yet can they not be freed by any Purgation taken in at the mouth; but it would be much to the purpo≈øe to take pertinent Cly≈øters which hinder the fore≈øaid evils cau≈øing their brea≈øts to become full, and to become, ≈øtiff, taking them as occa≈øion requires, once in two or three days.

                        <p>IT is an approved Maxim, that as ≈øoon as a Child is born, you ought to give it a ≈øpoonful of pure wine; for that a≈ø≈øi≈øts and helps the Child to regain its ≈øpirits Another advantage is this; that the wine cuts the flegm which the Child has in its throat; be≈øides, the ≈øpirit of the wine ri≈øing up to the head, comforts and ≈øtrengthens it; and it hinders al≈øo from the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep≈øie, which proceeds from the debility of the brain.</p>
                        <p>This being done, and the Mother fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, you mu≈øt tye the <hi>Navel-vein</hi> with a ≈øilk well twi≈øted, and many times doubled, and if there be any blood in the <hi>vein,</hi> you mu≈øt be ≈øure to empty it, for fear, if it ≈øhould be left, it ≈øhould turn into corruption; then it mu≈øt be well dried with powder of rotten wood: You mu≈øt tye it two fingers breadth from the belly, and leave it long, three fingers breadths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the tying place; and if it be fat, you mu≈øt clo≈øe it over and above, that the <hi>vein</hi> may be well clo≈øed, then wind the ≈øtring twice about it, knitting as many knots. But if the Child be come afore its time, you need not tye it ≈øo ≈øtrong, for fear of cutting it with the ≈øilk; but if the <hi>Navel-vein</hi> be full of water and wind, you ought then, having tied it one time, and wrapt a linnen cloth about the end of it, which is ≈øtill to be held upward, to uncover it again, about half an hour after, and then to tye it and wrap it about again, ≈øtill keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end up; for fear, that if the <hi>vein</hi> were not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clo≈øed, there might be ≈øome danger in the bleeding.</p>
                        <p>Some people give to the Infant Treacle di≈ø≈øolved in Wine; but this mu≈øt be done warily in a very ≈ømall quantity, and that not commonly neither.</p>

                           <pb n="126" facs="tcp:59975:77"/>The Infant mu≈øt be wa≈øhed with water and wine luke-warm, to clean≈øe it; afterwards wa≈øh the face, as al≈øo chafe the throat, the arms and hands, with Oyl of Walnuts, drawn without fire, which ≈øome ≈øay will keep them from Sun-burning, then put one hand upon the bone of the Fore-head, and another upon the bone called the Coronal bone, and ≈øoftly clo≈øe up the gap which was made during the time of travel, clo≈øing al≈øo the <hi>Sutures</hi> one again≈øt another exactly; then gently put your finger under the tongue, to ≈øee if the Infant have the ≈øtring or no; and if it have, it may be clipt away with the point of a pair of ≈øharp Cizzers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger. There are ≈øome that think they can ≈øhape the head and no≈øe of a Child as if it were of Wax, But let ≈øuch take notice that have flat no≈øed Children, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to let the no≈øe alone, than by ≈øqueezing and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing it too much to render the no≈øe ob≈øtructed; for that compre≈ø≈øing the Gri≈øtles of the no≈øe, renders the Child liable either to ≈øpeak alway in the no≈øe, or to lo≈øe his ≈ømelling.

≈øufficiently dilated, that he may put in his hand, and move the <hi>Infant,</hi> if it be needful, which mu≈øt be done as gently, and with as little violence as may be: He mu≈øt anoint it on all parts with ≈øweet-butter, or good Pomatum, and ≈øo opening it by little and little, he may put his hand quite in; and if the waters are not yet come down, he may without any difficulty let them forth; and then at the ≈øame in≈øtant, if the <hi>Infant</hi> comes with the head forwards he ≈øhall gently turn it. to find out the feet, and when he hath found one of them, he ≈øhall gently draw it forth, and immediately tye a riband about it, with a knot hanging down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then let him put it in again, ≈øuffering part of the riband to hang out, that he may more ea≈øily be able to find out the other foot; which he ≈øhall quickly do, by thru≈øting up his hand along the thigh of the <hi>Infant</hi>; when he hath found it, he ≈øhall take the other foot, and draw them both together at an even length, giving the woman now and then ≈øome lei≈øure to breath, but urging her ≈øtill to ≈øtrain her ≈øelf, when ≈øhe feels the pains coming on her: Then ≈øhall the <hi>Chirurgion</hi> or <hi>Midwife</hi> take a fine linnen cloth, and wrap about the thighs of the Child, le≈øt by taking it naked, his fingers ≈øhould ≈ølip; in that manner drawing it forth, 'till it appear all come forth, ob≈øerving ≈øtill that the Belly and the Face be ≈øtill kept downward.</p>

                        <p>If the <hi>Secondines</hi> come fir≈øt, the be≈øt way is to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Woman with all the expedition that may be, by rea≈øon of the great fluxes of blood that will follow, by rea≈øon that the veins are opened: But here are two things to be con≈øidered; the fir≈øt is, whether the <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> are much, or little come forth; if they are but little advanced, they mu≈øt be put back with care and diligence; and if the head of the Child appear fir≈øt, it mu≈øt be guided directly toward the neck of the <hi>Womb,</hi> as in the mo≈øt natural birth; but if there appear any difficulty in the birth, by rea≈øon of the weakne≈øs, either of the Child, or of the Mother, then the mo≈øt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient way will be to ≈øeek for the Feet, as we have ≈øaid before.</p>
                        <p>Another thing to be ob≈øerved is, that if the <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> be ≈øo far advanced, that they cannot be put back, and that the Child follow it clo≈øe, then are the <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi>

to be pulled away with all the care and expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can be, and to be laid a≈øide without cutting the <hi>Entrail</hi> that ≈øticks to them, for by that you may be guided to the <hi>Infant,</hi> which whether it be alive or dead,<note rend="inter">Of the Child dead in the Mothers Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> is to be pulled out by the feet with as much care and quickne≈øs as may be; though it is not to be done but in ca≈øe of great nece≈ø≈øity, for otherwi≈øe the <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> ought to come la≈øt.</p>
                        <p>If the Child be dead in the <hi>Womb</hi> of the Mother, the Woman is then to be ≈øituated in the ≈øame po≈øture, as when ≈øhe is troubled with a flux of blood.</p>

                        <p>Many times it happens that the Child lies athwart, and falls upon his ≈øide, which when it comes to pa≈øs, the Mother is not to be urged to her labour, neither is the <hi>Birth</hi> to be expected after that manner, for it is impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible that the Child ≈øhould be ≈øo born without ≈øome conver≈øion; and therefore the Midwife is to do all ≈øhe can to reduce it to a more natural form of <hi>Birth,</hi> by moving the Buttocks, and ≈øteering the Head to the pa≈ø≈øage; if this ≈øucceed not, let her try by often rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Woman to and fro, to bring the Child to its natural form of being born.</p>
                        <p>If it happen that the Child ha≈øten to the <hi>Birth,</hi> with the Legs and Arms di≈øtorted, the Midwife ought not to ha≈øten the Woman, but immediately ca≈øt her on her Bed, where ≈øhe may direct the Woman to roul her ≈øelf to and fro; or el≈øe ≈øhe may gently ≈øtroke the <hi>womb</hi> of the Woman as ≈øhe lies, 'till ≈øhe have reduced the Infant to a better po≈øture; If this profit not, the Midwife mu≈øt take the <hi>Legs</hi> and clo≈øe them together, then if ≈øhe can, ≈øhe mu≈øt get her Hand about the Arms of the Child, and in the ≈øafe≈øt way ≈øhe can, direct it to its coming forth; though it be the ≈øafe≈øt way to turn the Infant in the <hi>Womb,</hi> and by that means compo≈øe it to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Birth.</p>

                        <p>But when it happens that the Child ha≈øtens forwards, with one Arm extended upon the Thigh, and the other ≈øtretched over the Head, the Feet being ≈øtretched out at length in the <hi>Womb,</hi> the Midwife may by no means receive the Child in this po≈øture, but mu≈øt lay the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient upon the Bed, as we have ≈øaid before; then mu≈øt the Womans Belly be gently pre≈ø≈øed backward, that the Infant may retire into the <hi>Womb,</hi> and if it give not backward of its own accord, the Midwife may with her Hand gently thru≈øt back the Shoulder, and bring the Arm that was ≈øtretched back to its right place.</p>
                        <p>The mo≈øt dangerous of all tho≈øe that we have ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of is this, and therefore the Midwife mu≈øt take care to put back the Infant in this ca≈øe into the <hi>Womb</hi>: Fir≈øt of all therefore anoint well her Hands, as al≈øo the <hi>Womb</hi> of the Woman, then, if ≈øhe can, let her thru≈øt in her Hand near the Arms of the Infant, and ≈øo move the Shoulders that the Infant may fall back into the <hi>womb</hi>; and then to bring it to the natural form, let her thru≈øt up her other Hand, and reduce the Arms of the Infant to the ≈øides of it; If this ≈øucceed not, the Woman mu≈øt be laid on her Bed, and after a little re≈øt, ≈øhe mu≈øt be ordered as before we have ≈øaid: If this avail not, ≈øhe mu≈øt be brought back to her Seat, as we have before rehear≈øed; then mu≈øt her <hi>womb,</hi> by the help of tho≈øe Women that a≈ø≈øi≈øt her be gently pre≈øt downward, and on both ≈øides, while the Midwife having anointed the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and both the Arms of the Infant, joins them as clo≈øe together as ≈øhe can, and in that manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives

                        <p>If the Child come forward with the neck bowed, and the ≈øhoulders forward, with the Hands and Feet ≈øtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upwards; in this ca≈øe the <hi>Midwife</hi> mu≈øt carefully move the ≈øhoulders backward that ≈øhe may be able to bring the Head forwards, which may be ea≈øily done, for the ≈øhoulders being removed, the Head will ≈øoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear formo≈øt, yet if this ≈øuffice not, the Woman mu≈øt be laid on her back upon the Bed, and ordered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former Precepts.</p>

                        <p>MILK is certainly the occa≈øion of many tumours of divers kinds; if the ferment of the <hi>Brea≈øt</hi> be over-active and vigorous, it ≈øeparates <hi>Milk</hi> with too great Violence, cau≈øing thereby an over-fermentation of the parts, which u≈øually occa≈øions an Inflammation; if the <hi>Serum</hi> be hot or partake much of <hi>blood,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe it rai≈øes a flegmatic Swelling; or if the matter be di≈øpo≈øed to coagulation, the Kings-evil; and the≈øe are

If the ≈øecond, large Di≈øten≈øion with pain, but no heat: If the Kings-evil, then hard Kernels are ea≈øily felt. Swellings made by the over eagerne≈øs of the milky Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment go ea≈øily off, if no other Symptom attend them; ≈øucking and drawing the <hi>brea≈øts</hi> commonly di≈øcharges the <hi>Milk</hi> as fa≈øt as it can be made, and then all the danger is over. But if the fermentation occa≈øion any di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the <hi>Blood,</hi> the Patient is more or le≈øs endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, according to the quality of the ≈øwelling produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, namely an inflammation occa≈øions a <hi>Fever.</hi> Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick ≈øwellings are apt to grow <hi>Ulcerous,</hi> and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turn to the <hi>King's Evil,</hi> or a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a long time for their Cure. Abundance of Milk cau≈øes inflammations, and apo≈øtumations, and the like, and therefore the Woman ought to u≈øe a ≈ølender diet, and it ought to be of ≈øuch a quality as may le≈øs di≈øpo≈øe the Humours to ferment. <hi>Panadoes,</hi> Barly grewel, and ≈øuch like cooling and moi≈øtening Spoon-meat ought to be u≈øed; Chicken Broth is the highe≈øt Dyet whil≈øt the Humour is fermenting; the Medicines proper to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øh the Milk, are Lettice, Pur≈ølain, Endive, Succo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Smallage and the like; the Milk is u≈øually drawn out of the Brea≈øts by the Infant's ≈øucking; but if the Child be ≈øo weak it cannot ≈øuck, or not ≈øufficiently, the Milk mu≈øt be di≈øcharged by Whelps ≈øucking, or the Mother may draw her own Brea≈øts her ≈øelf by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument ≈øold for that purpo≈øe. The ≈øwelling made by the Milk is re≈øtrained by the application of Night-≈øhade, Lettice, Plantain, Vine tops, Bramble-buds, Hor≈øe-tail,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59975:99"/>
and the like, or Oyl of Ro≈øes, Myrtles with Vinegar and the like. The Tumour may be di≈øcu≈ø≈øed by the application of Mints, Cat-mints, Rue; the Seeds of Fenugreek, Cumin, Fennel, and the like; or dry'd up by applying Cloaths dipt in Lime-water, or in a ≈øolution of <hi>Sacharum Saturni</hi> made in Frogs Spawn-water, during which time fine Towe ≈øprinkl'd with Ceru≈øs, may be applied to the Arm-pits.

The cau≈øes of which are; fir≈øt, the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion of the flowers; or when the flowers are not di≈øcharged into their proper place, and in their proper time; as al≈øo from the corruption of the humours, by which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered divers bad fumes and vapours; for, this being received into the Brea≈øts, cau≈øes a di≈øtention much like a true ≈øwelling. The ≈øign by which it is known, is the pain which it brings along with it, which is ≈øharp and prickling, cau≈øing a di≈øtention of the part. The heart is not a little out of order, by rea≈øon of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine≈ø≈øes which lye ≈øo near it; and commonly the left Brea≈øt is mow ≈øwoln, communicating its pain to the arm, ≈øhoulder, and ribs of the ≈øame ≈øide. And the ≈øigns differ from tho≈øe of a Cancer; for in this di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the Brea≈øt is white and ≈øhining, by rea≈øon of the di≈øtention; and if you touch it, it ≈øounds like a drum. And if you pre≈øs it with your hands, you will find that it is ≈øwelled in all parts alike, and not in one more than another.

                           <p>THE watry tumour is ingendered by a thick and watry flegm gathered together in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the Brea≈øt and parts adjoyning, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens many times that this watry and flegmy ≈øub≈øtance is not always gathered to one particular place, but al≈øo diffu≈øed through all the parts of the Brea≈øt, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes a general ≈øwelling in that part. This ≈øwelling (that we may define it) is a loo≈øe and ≈øoft tumour without much pain, yielding to the touch and pre≈ø≈øing of the fingers, ≈øo that the hole which is made by the pre≈ø≈øing of the fingers remains a pretty while after; yet it ≈øoon becomes painful, if there be any <hi>Acrimony</hi> joyned with it; or if there be any di≈øtention by rea≈øon of the pre≈øs of <hi>Vapours</hi> to that part. This oftentimes happens by rea≈øon of the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion of the <hi>Cour≈øes</hi>; ≈øometimes it is occa≈øioned by rea≈øon of a clear and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try flegm, which di≈øcharges it ≈øelf upon the≈øe parts. This ≈øwelling is ea≈øily di≈øtingui≈øhed from other ≈øwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, by rea≈øon of the loo≈øene≈øs and ≈øoftne≈øs thereof, and by the pain, which is always le≈øs than in other ≈øwellings: and in this kind of tumour the pain a≈øcends up to the arms and ≈øhoulders, and the whole Brea≈øt is altogether ≈øwoln and rai≈øed; and this pain comes at certain times, chiefly when the <hi>Flowers</hi> ought to come down, which being once come down, the pain dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhes, by rea≈øon that the Woman is then throughly <hi>Purged.</hi> Yet notwith≈øtanding, there doth remain ≈øome certain kind of ≈øwelling, which happens not in the windy tumours, by rea≈øon that the purgations of the <hi>Flowers</hi> do totally di≈ø≈øipate the matter of tho≈øe ≈øwellings.

As to the Cure of the≈øe tumours, there is required fir≈øt an orderly Diet, which mu≈øt be drying, her <hi>Bread</hi> mu≈øt be well baked and levened, dryed <hi>Rai≈øins,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Almonds, A≈øparagus, ro≈øted Fle≈øh,</hi> and <hi>≈ømall Birds.</hi> Before meat ≈øhe may take a little <hi>Honey of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> upon a <hi>wafer-cake.</hi> For her drink, let it be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of <hi>Ani≈øeeds, China-roots, Sa≈ø≈øafras,</hi> and <hi>Sar≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paril.</hi> If the retention of the <hi>Flowers</hi> be the cau≈øe of this evil, let her then u≈øe rather boyled than ro≈øted meats, and then let her boyl them with <hi>Sage, Bettony</hi> and <hi>Hy≈øop.</hi> All meats made of <hi>Milk</hi> are dangerous, as al≈øo ≈øleep after dinner, and unleavened bread.</p>

                           <p>The Cure of the≈øe is undertaken two ways; by ≈øoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the hard tumour, and preventing the Cancer; and then al≈øo a ≈øtrict diet is to be ob≈øerved, which mu≈øt be moderately attenuating, and by keeping them≈øelves warm, which is perform'd by moderate exerci≈øe before meals, as al≈øo by u≈øing ≈øulphury baths; but full diet, ea≈øe, idlene≈øs, and meats of hard dige≈øtion are very dangerous; and indeed in all re≈øpects be≈øides, the cure is the ≈øame as is ≈øet down in the foregoing Chapter. but if the kernel be ≈øwelled up with a ≈øharp tumour, tho≈øe topicks are to be u≈øed that are pre≈øcribed al≈øo in the foregoing Chapter, only in ca≈øe the fluxion remain any time, you may mingle tho≈øe things which do a little more refre≈øh; ≈øuch are oil of Ro≈øes, and oil of Violets; when the flux of humours cea≈øes, you may then add oyl of Camomile, and Lillies, and other ≈øuch like things, to di≈ø≈øolve and di≈ø≈øipate the humour.

                           <p>THE <hi>Scirrhus</hi> of the Brea≈øts is a hard ≈øwelling without pain: Of this there are two kinds, the one ingendred of a Melancholy, and produced by a feculent and gro≈øs blood, or el≈øe from a thick Flegm; now this exqui≈øite <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is without pain, in which it differs from the other: The other is not ≈øo exqui≈øite an hardne≈øs, perhaps becau≈øe it is not yet come to its full maturity, or el≈øe becau≈øe it hath certain other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours mixt with it. This exqui≈øite kind of <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is ingendred, either becau≈øe the <hi>Spleen</hi> is ob≈øtructed, and cannot purge away the melancholy Blood, which for that rea≈øon abounding in the Body, di≈øcharges and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it ≈øelf upon the Brea≈øts; or by rea≈øon of the ≈øupre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the Cour≈øes, which cau≈øes the feculent and gro≈øs humour to di≈øgorge it ≈øelf upon the Brea≈øt, gathering together in the Veins and Fle≈øh of the ≈øame. Many times the ignorance of the Surgeon is the cau≈øe of it, when they apply an unrea≈øonable company of refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Medicines to the inflammations of the Brea≈øt, or too many re≈øolving and heating Medicines to it, in ca≈øe the Brea≈øts be over-hard. This <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is known by its hardne≈øs without pain, from the unevenne≈øs of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59975:104"/>
the Body, and the colour of the part either inclining to black or brown. Now though the cure of the≈øe hardne≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes be ≈øomething difficult, yet is there great hopes that they may be overcome; which is to be done two ways, by mollifying diligently that which is hard, and by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that away which remains hard and knotty in the Brea≈øt. And fir≈øt of all, care is to be had to keep good order of diet; to which purpo≈øe ≈øhe mu≈øt u≈øe Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en bread, rear Eggs, Pullets Capons, Partridge, Veal and Mutton, which mu≈øt be boiled with Spinage.

If the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cour≈øes be ≈øtopt, you mu≈øt ≈øeek to provoke them gently, which may be done by letting Blood in the Foot, or to let blood with Hor≈øe-leeches: In the next place, it will not be ami≈øs to purge well with Sena, and Rheubarb, to which you may add Catholicon, or <hi>Triphera Per≈øica,</hi> if you find that the Di≈øea≈øe needs a more ≈øtrong purgation.

The≈øe Wheals are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into gentle, and venemous, which are ≈øaid to be contagious; they are to be wa≈øhed in a water thus made. Take of Aloes the quantity of a Pea; of the flower of bra≈øs the quantity of half a Pea, powder the≈øe, and mingle them in an ounce of white-wine, Plantain-water, and Ro≈øe-water, of each an ounce, which is to be kept in a gla≈øs ve≈ø≈øel.</p>

                           <p>The next way of cure is performed by evacuating Medicines, namely, Rheubarb and ≈øolutive Syrup of Ro≈øes, Manna al≈øo profiteth much; the flower of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> taken from three grains to ≈øix, and put in any proper Syrup, purges the Womb.</p>
                           <p>There is another intemperancy which comes of cold, which is known by a le≈ø≈øer pronene≈øs to Venery, and little plea≈øure taken in it, a ≈øetling in the Cour≈øes, with a ≈ølimy and flegmy matter mixed, and an inordinate flowing of them by rea≈øon of the plenty of Humours collected in the Womb, which cau≈øes ob≈øtructions, by rea≈øon of abundance of windy vapours in the Womb, crudities and watrine≈øs of the Seed, which cau≈øes it to flow without any plea≈øure, a pale colour in the Face: It ari≈øes from cau≈øes contrary to the former, it is cured by contrary diet, by hot Medicines applyed to the <hi>womb,</hi> among which the roots of Birthwort, Clove-Gilliflowers, Angelica, and Eringo's, are very much

The≈øe kind of Compounds are al≈øo very u≈øeful, as Oyl of Mace, Oyl of Amber, Oyl of Myrrh, and of Cinamon.</p>
                           <p>There is another intemperancy of the womb, which comes of moi≈øture, and is joined mo≈øt commonly with the cold intemperancy: it is known by the plenty of the Cour≈øes, and by the thinne≈øs and watrine≈øs of them; as al≈øo the moi≈øtne≈øs of the Privities, by rea≈øon of the moi≈øtne≈øs of the Excrements; no plea≈øure in the act of Venery, and pronene≈øs to abortion, by rea≈øon of the growth of the Birth. It hath the ≈øame original with the frigid intemperancy, and happens mo≈øt commonly to Women, who are lazy and ≈øedentary: It is cured with the ≈øame Medicines as the former; only this may be added, that a fume may be made of the ≈øhavings of Ivory: And the decoction of Sage, being received into tho≈øe parts before ≈øupper, is very much commended. Baths of Sulphur do al≈øo profit much.</p>
                           <p>There is another di≈øtemper of the Womb, which is dry, which is di≈øcerned by the want of Seed, and the defect of the Cour≈øes, by ≈ølowne≈øs to Venery, drine≈øs of the Mouth of the Womb, by a blacki≈øh colour of the lower lip, which is always chopt.

The cure of this is performed fir≈øt by a contrary diet, where you mu≈øt al≈øo avoid much labour, watching, hunger, and ≈øadne≈øs.

                           <p>There is another which is a compound di≈øtemper, which is mo≈øt often cold and moi≈øt, which is di≈øcerned by comparing the ≈øigns of the ≈øimple di≈øtemperatures together.

                           <p>The ≈øigns are various; there is a ≈øwelling in the Womb with heat and pain, and a retraction of the Womb to the more inward parts; the neck of the Womb appears red, with little veins ≈øcattered up and down in it, like the web of a Spider.

Sometimes the whole body of the belly ≈øeems empty, or filled with water, and the Navel hangs forward, and the mouth of the womb is made very ≈ølender and clo≈øe; and upon a ≈øudden few depraved cour≈øes come down: then happens a burning Fever by rea≈øon of the great ≈øympathy with the womb and the heart, occa≈øioned through the Arteries and great Ve≈ø≈øels. There is a pain in the brea≈øts, with a ≈øwelling in them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the con≈øent and agreement between the groyns, the hips, the <hi>≈øeptum tran≈øver≈øum claviculare,</hi> and the forepart of the head, which is extended to the roots of the eyes; as al≈øo from vapours which ri≈øe from the putrified blood to the head, through the Arteries that run along through the neck, pa≈ø≈øing by both parts of the infundibulum into the fore part of the head.</p>

                           <p>The Cure is difficult, if the blood in that part be wholly putrified; for that cau≈øeth a ≈øordid humor which con≈øumes the Patient with a continual Fever.

                           <p>The≈øe inflammations ≈øometimes affect the whole womb, and ≈øometimes either ≈øide of the Womb, which cau≈øes the heat to de≈øcend into the Hip, becau≈øe of the ligaments of the Womb which are carred thither; the thigh is difficultly moved, and the groins are inflamed; ≈øometimes the inflammation po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth the po≈øterior part, which cau≈øes the belly to be bound, and a pain in the loins and back-bone; ≈øometimes it po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, which becau≈øe it coheres to the bladder, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed, or made very difficultly; and the pain is extended above the Privities: Semetimes it po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øes the bottom of the Womb, which cau≈øes ≈øuch a pain in the lower part of the Belly, that it is hardly to be touched, and the pain extends to the Navel.</p>

                           <p>THE falling of the Womb is the falling of it down below the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or Midriff, proceeding from a loo≈øene≈øs of the Ligamants.</p>

is perceived the di≈øtention of the skin, and as it were the weight of a good big Egg about the Privities.</p>
                           <p>The Cure of this is difficult, if there be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er falling of the Womb, if the Woman be in Age, if a Fever, Convul≈øion, or other ≈øymptoms happen; if that be in women with Child, it is deadly; and ≈øometimes it is corrupted by the ambient Air, and turns into a Gangrene. The Cure con≈øi≈øts in the re-putting of it into its own place, where you mu≈øt ob≈øerve, fir≈øt to ≈øtop the inflammation, if there be any; or if there be any ≈øwelling cau≈øed by the cold Air, you mu≈øt foment the part fir≈øt with decoction of Mallows, Mar≈øh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Flowers of Camomile, and Lawrel Berries: If there be any wind or excrement in the Gut, you mu≈øt u≈øe Cly≈øters fir≈øt; it is al≈øo to be fomented and anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with agglutinating and a≈øtringent, or binding Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, there is a Fumigation to be made of the skin of a ≈øalt Eel dried, and poudered.

Now to keep it up, the woman mu≈øt be kept lying on her back, with her thighs ≈øtretched out, and one laid upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acro≈øs; the Belly mu≈øt not be too much bound, le≈øt in the ejection of the excrement, the Womb ≈øhould be again precipitated, neither mu≈øt it be loo≈øe, le≈øt the Membranes binding the Womb ≈øhould be unloo≈øed: Then mu≈øt you u≈øe agglutinating Medicines, Pe≈ø≈øaries, Fomentations, and Injections; yet great care mu≈øt be had, le≈øt you ≈øuppre≈øs the Cour≈øes. Of this there be ≈øome differences, either by rea≈øon of the loo≈øene≈øs of the Ligaments which are four, which is di≈øcerned in that it is generated by degrees, and with le≈øs pain: It ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes

either from hard labour, or a pondero≈øity or heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the Child, or from the concour≈øe of flegmy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; it is cured by the evacuation of humors, and by the u≈øe of a≈øtringent and corroborating Medicines; ≈øuch as are the decoction of Musk of the Oak, Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, Laurel-leaves, and the a≈øtringent Plai≈øter.</p>

                           <p>SOme have thought that it is po≈ø≈øible for the Womb to a≈øcend up to the Stomach, which opinion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fal≈øe; for fir≈øt it is tyed ≈øo fa≈øt with four Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, that it is impo≈ø≈øible for it to move to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts: Be≈øides, ≈øuppo≈øe it had a natural motion by the Fibres, yet the Womb being ≈øo firmly annexed to the right gut, and to the Privities, it would nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarily follow that tho≈øe parts ≈øhould be al≈øo ≈øtretched. And though it happen to be ≈øtretched, and di≈øtended by the windy vapours, yet it follows not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ≈øhould be moved upward: and whereas women do ≈øay that they do ≈øometimes perceive a certain round body moving about the region of the Navel, that may rather be ≈øaid to be the ≈øtones, and that blind Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, than the Womb.</p>

                              <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59975:123"/>Of the wounds of the Matrix this mu≈øt be noted, that they are very difficult to be cured. Yet the cure is to be a≈ø≈øayed five manner of ways; by the u≈øe of things which do evacuate the peccant humor, which is done partly by a good order of diet, and living in a dry and temperate air; longer ≈øleep than ordinary, and the avoiding of exerci≈øe in this ca≈øe is to be ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and in≈øtead thereof to u≈øe moderate frictions: All repletion, and a loo≈øe belly are naught; the meat that ≈øhe eats mu≈øt be little, and contrary to the humour that offends, as rear Eggs, Milk, Chicken-broths, and the meat of them, dry Rai≈øins, Almonds, and Pi≈øtaches. For her drink, it ought to be chiefly the decoction of Barly or Liquori≈øh.</p>
                           <p>In the next place, it will not be ami≈øs to let blood in the Ba≈øilick Vein: let her take ≈øome convenient purge according to the humour which abounds: Vomitings al≈øo and frictions may be u≈øed, and the provoking of ≈øweat by the decoction of Guaiacum, Sal≈øaparil, and China-root, which are very proper to turn away the humors from the Matrix.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes this happens from an intemperancy of the womb, which if it be cold, the womb is not able to concoct ≈øufficient quantity of nouri≈øhment, and therefore heaps up together many excrements; if it be moi≈øt, it is not able to contain either the blood, or the ≈øeed, or the birth, as it ≈øhould do. The cure of this is above touched in the Chapter of Di≈øtempers.</p>
                           <p>There is another difference which is taken from the occult qualities which the womb is ≈øeen to have, there being a ≈øympathy and antipathy between that and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, as to covet the ≈øeed of Man, and to love ≈øweet things; and then the affection ari≈øes from no evident cau≈øe, there being no exce≈øs of coldne≈øs, or moi≈øture to be apprehended. The Medicines which
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59975:123"/>
are to be applied for the cure of this, mu≈øt be proper in their whole ≈øub≈øtance.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes the difference ari≈øeth in this, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat is either ≈øuffocated or di≈ø≈øipated; this affection is ≈øomething dangerous, becau≈øe it is a difficult matter to re≈øtore the natural heat.

                           <p>THE ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion of the Flowers is the retention of the men≈øtrual blood, either by rea≈øon of the narrowne≈øs of the ve≈ø≈øels, or through ≈øome corruption of the blood. The ≈øigns are evident from the relation of the Woman: Yet if they are loth to confe≈øs, it may be di≈øcerned by this; for in Virgins the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed blood wanders up and down the Veins, and begets ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions, changing the colour of the Body, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing Fevers. In Women, becau≈øe the blood is carried down to the Womb, where it begets many di≈øea≈øes, it is di≈øtingui≈øhed from retention after Conception, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe women with Child find no alteration of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind, and retain the native colour of their bodies; and in the third month they ≈øhall perceive the motion and ≈øituation of the Infant; and la≈øtly, the mouth of the womb is clo≈øed up.</p>

                              <pb n="217" facs="tcp:59975:124"/>The Cau≈øes of this di≈øtemper are the narrowne≈øs of the Veins, and the vitiou≈øne≈øs of the blood. The Cure of this mu≈øt be ha≈øtened, becau≈øe this ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion if it ≈øtay long begets many more di≈øea≈øes, as Fevers, Drop≈øies, Vomiting of blood, and the like: The Cure is hard if it be of any continuance, and if it ≈øtay beyond the ≈øixth month, it is almo≈øt incurable; e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it happen through any perver≈øion of the neck of the Womb; for then the woman is troubled with often ≈øwooning, and vomiting of blood, and a pain ≈øeizes the parts of the Belly, the Back, and the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, which is attended with a Fever, and the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Belly and Bladder are ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed; a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine≈øs po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes the whole Body, becau≈øe of the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the retained blood through the whole body, and e≈øpecially the hips and thighs, becau≈øe of the ≈øympathy of tho≈øe parts with the veins of the Womb. In the fir≈øt place, the letting of blood is commended; for the blood which every month ≈øtays in the body, and ≈øticks in the Veins, is to be provoked downward to the Womb; and therefore a vein is to be opened in the heel, for ≈øo the plenty of blood is dimini≈øhed, and the motion of the blood is made toward the Womb; if nece≈ø≈øity requires that it ≈øhould be done more than once, one day a vein mu≈øt be opened in one thigh, and another day in the other; and that which is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for evacuation mu≈øt be fir≈øt opened, that which is opened in the ham, or heel, mu≈øt be done after Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, three, or four, or five days before the time that the accu≈øtomed evacuations of the Woman ought to come down. Cupping-gla≈ø≈øes al≈øo are to be applied fir≈øt to the more remote places, as to the thighs; and then to the nearer parts, as to the hips: Ligatures, or bindings and frictions, at the time of the coming down of the Flowers, after Purgation of the whole body, are

                           <p>The differences of this Di≈øea≈øe ari≈øe, partly from the ob≈øtruction of the Veins of the Womb, cau≈øed by a cold and thick blood, and thick ≈ølimy humours mixed with the blood, and coming either from ≈øome hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtemper of the Womb, which di≈ø≈øipates the ≈øharp and ≈øubtil humours, and leaves behind the gro≈øs and earthy parts, or from the cold Con≈øtitution of the Liver and Spleen; e≈øpecially if at the time of the men≈øtrual Flux (at what time the Flux of Blood is more violent) tho≈øe ≈øubtil humours happen to be di≈ø≈øipated, and then at the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59975:125"/>
time of the monthly Purgation, the Party affected feels a great pain in the loins, and parts adjoining; and if any thing come down, it is ≈ølymy, whiti≈øh, and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh: The whole Body is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with a numne≈øs, the Colour pale, a ≈ølow Pul≈øe, and raw Urines. The Cure is the ≈øame with the former, great care being taken of a gro≈øs and ill diet.</p>
                           <p>There is another difference of this Di≈øea≈øe when it happens by Compre≈ø≈øion, which ari≈øes from external cau≈øes, as the Northern wind, and long ≈øtanding in cold water, which may be known from the relation of the ≈øick Per≈øon. The Blood in this ca≈øe is to be drawn to the lower parts by Frictions and Baths; or from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cau≈øes, as fatne≈øs, or ≈øwelling of the Womb, or of the lower parts; in which ca≈øe Medicines mu≈øt be applied that a≈ø≈øwage the ≈øwelling. There is another dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which is in the hardne≈øs of the skin which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens either from the fir≈øt Nativity, and then the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe is not ea≈øily taken away; or long after, from ≈øome cold and dry di≈øtemper: Concerning which look the former Chapters.</p>
                           <p>Another difference there is, when there happens a clo≈øing up of the skin, which is cau≈øed after Cicatri≈øing of an Ulcer, or by rea≈øon of ≈øome skin or Membrane growing to the Ve≈ø≈øels of the Womb, or by rea≈øon of frequent Abortion; after which the≈øe Veins to which the Secondines adhere, do grow together ≈øo clo≈øe that they cannot be afterwards opened.</p>
                           <p>Another difference of this Di≈øea≈øe there is, when it happens through want of Blood, which is not genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either by rea≈øon of external cau≈øes, as Famine, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much evacuation, I≈ø≈øues, and ≈øuch like; or through internal cau≈øes, as a frigid Con≈øtitution of the principal parts, old Age, and Fevers; or when it is converted to other u≈øes, as before full growth, to the nouri≈øhment of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59975:126"/>
the Body: In Women with Child, to the nouri≈øhment of the Birth: In tho≈øe that give ≈øuck, to the increa≈øe of Milk: And in fat people, to the augmentation of the Fat: Or when it is con≈øumed either by External cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, as over much Exerci≈øe, Affrights, Terrors, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Baths, overmuch Sweating, which do con≈øume the ≈øerous quality of the Blood; or through Internal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, as are hot and dry Di≈øea≈øes, or over-great evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in other parts of the Body. Sometimes another difference of this Di≈øea≈øe proceeds from the dryne≈øs of the Blood, which happens to Women, who in the Winter time do too much heat their lower parts, by putting Coals under their Coats. For the cure thereof you mu≈øt u≈øe refrigerating and moi≈øtning Medicines.</p>

                           <p>THE dropping of the Flowers is, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down for many days together drop by drop.</p>
                           <p>This happens both from external cau≈øes, as over hard labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And ≈øometimes from the dro≈ø≈øine≈øs of the blood, the pa≈ø≈øage not being wide enough. For the cure of this, it is convenient to open a Vein in the Arm with gentle purging, as in the former Chapter.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes from the weakne≈øs of the retentive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there being at that time great plenty, thinne≈øs, and ≈øero≈øity of the blood. In this ca≈øe there is no pain; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that bind and corroborate the Stomach here mu≈øt have place.</p>
                           <p>The difficulty of the Flowers is when they come down with pain and trouble, either through defect in the Veins, or in the Blood. The ≈øigns of this are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the relation of the ≈øick per≈øon, who is then much troubled with pain in the Head, Stomach, and Loins, and lower parts of the body. And they do either
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59975:126"/>
flow altogether, or drop by drop, as in the former di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe; It is a Di≈øea≈øe more incident to Maids than mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Women, becau≈øe the Veins of the Womb are le≈øs open in them, than in tho≈øe who brought forth Children.</p>
                           <p>It happens ≈øometimes from a corruption of the blood, that is, from the dro≈ø≈øine≈øs and thickne≈øs thereof, and then the blood clots together; and there is a great pain long before the Flowers begin to come down. The Cure of this is performed by attenuating Medicines. Sometimes from the ≈øharpne≈øs and acrimony of the Blood, which proceeds from a mixture of ≈øharp hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours with the Body, and then the genital parts do itch. It is cured by tho≈øe Medicines that temper the ≈øharpne≈øs of the Humour, as the four greater Seeds, Violets, and Flowers of Nenuphar. Sometimes from windy Vapours, and then the pain comes by intervals, and is ≈øuddenly exa≈øperated, rumbling up and down; and when the wind is forth, the pain cea≈øeth. The cure hereof is procured by evacuation of the matter, and di≈øpelling of the wind, as is before declared.</p>

                           <p>THE di≈øcolouring of the Flowers is when their right colour, which ought to be red, declines ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to palene≈øs, whitene≈øs, greenne≈øs, yellowne≈øs, or blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øhne≈øs, through ≈øome defect, or vitiou≈øne≈øs of the blood.</p>
                           <p>The ≈øigns are apparent by the ≈øight of the blood; be≈øides that it is accompanied with an ill ≈ømell, many times al≈øo it is the cau≈øe of Fevers, trembling of the body, loathing of the meat, pain in the ≈øtomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The differences of this di≈øea≈øe con≈øi≈øt fir≈øt in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou≈øne≈øs of the blood, which is cau≈øed through ≈øome di≈øtemper either of the whole body, or ≈øome part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Sometimes the blood is affected by rea≈øon of ≈øome ≈øtoppage thereof, and then the Flowers are ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59975:127"/>
which cau≈øeth pains in the Brea≈øt, and ≈øtrong beating of the Brea≈øt; and if the woman begin to amend the Blood flows out with a ≈øtinking putrefaction, which continues 'till the eighth day; or it may be, becau≈øe the Blood is foul'd by the Womb, being full of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and then you may perceive the ≈øigns of a foul Womb.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes the difference of this di≈øea≈øe con≈øi≈øts in the mixture of the Blood with other vitious humors. The Cure con≈øi≈øts in preparation and evacuation, but care mu≈øt be had, that becau≈øe the thick humors need attenuation, and that over attenuating things do melt the ≈øerous humor, that you therefore do not u≈øe over attenuating things, as Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another difference is, when the Flowers decline to a whiti≈øh colour, which 'proceeds from abundance of Flegm, or from Putrefaction, and then Ulcers follow in the Womb, and barrenne≈øs follows; unle≈øs the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Flowers do happen to flow for ≈øeven or eight days together, by which the woman is freed from the di≈øea≈øe; or el≈øe they break out to the parts above the groin without any tumor, and bur≈øt forth a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Hypochondrium, and then the woman ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom lives, or el≈øe there will appear after ≈øome few days a great ≈øwelling in the Groyn, without a head of a red colour, becau≈øe the Fle≈øh is there filled up with the Blood.</p>
                           <p>When it inclines to yellowne≈øs, or greenne≈øs, the di≈øtemper comes of Choler; when to a blackne≈øs and blewne≈øs, from Melancholy.</p>

                           <p>THE di≈øorderly Flux of the Cour≈øes is either the coming of them down before their time, or el≈øe the ≈øtoppage of them for ≈øome time after the u≈øual

They come down ≈øometimes before their time, partly by rea≈øon of internal Cau≈øes, and partly by rea≈øon of external Cau≈øes, as falls, blows, and ≈øuch like ca≈øualties that open the veins: Or from the expul≈øive faculty of the Womb too much provoked. Fir≈øt, by the plenty of blood, which is known by this, that the blood which is ≈øent to the womb from all part is fluid, and of its natural con≈øtitution; ≈øigns of a Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora, or fulne≈øs of blood, are apparent in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

                           <p>It comes al≈øo when the retentive faculty of the womb grows lank, which may be known by the loo≈øene≈øs of the Ve≈ø≈øels of the Womb, be≈øides a moi≈øt and faint ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the body: In the Cure, beware of things which are too A≈øtringent; baths, wherein the force and ≈øtrength of Iron may be effectual, may with ≈øafety be u≈øed. The ≈øub≈øi≈øtence and ≈øtay of the Cour≈øes beyond the accu≈øtomed time, proceeds from a fru≈øtration of the expul≈øive faculty; as when there is ≈ømall ≈øtore of blood, which is known by this, that the Woman is not troubled with the ≈øtay of the Cour≈øes; and e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if ≈øhe have over-exerci≈øed her ≈øelf, or u≈øed a ≈øpare diet before.

                           <p>There is another difference of this Di≈øea≈øe, which ari≈øes from the weakne≈øs of the expelling faculty, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed either by the frigid di≈øtemper of the Womb, of which we have ≈øpoken already; or by a kind of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs thereof, of which we ≈øhall ≈øpeak anon.</p>

                           <p>THE over much flux of the Cour≈øes is either a more abundant, or a more la≈øting Purgation of the Cour≈øes, through ≈øome defect, either in the blood, or the womb, or the veins of the womb.</p>
                           <p>The ≈øigns are evident, <hi>viz.</hi> want of Appetite, Crudities, a bad colour in the face, a ≈øwelling in the feet, and the re≈øt of the body, a waxing lean of the body; and in brief, a general ill habit of body.</p>
                           <p>The Cure (if it be of any continuance) is difficult; if it happen to an aged woman, there is none at all. It requires a revul≈øion, or drawing back of the blood, interception, and incra≈ø≈øation, or thickning thereof, and a clo≈øing up of the Ve≈ø≈øels by a≈øtringent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.

                           <p>Of this Di≈øea≈øe there are many differences: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happens from the blood which is derived from the bottom of the Womb, where for the mo≈øt part lies
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59975:128"/>
the blacke≈øt and mo≈øt clotted blood; or from the neck of the Womb, which is more red and fluid.

The ≈øigns of this are evident; that is to ≈øay, a fulne≈øs of blood in the body; be≈øides that, the blood which comes forth ea≈øily curdles.</p>
                           <p>In the Cure, you mu≈øt have recour≈øe to blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which if you do for evacuation, it mu≈øt be done in the Hepatick Vein: If the woman be weak, in <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatella</hi> of both hands.

In the third place, ligatures and frictions of the Arms are to be u≈øed.</p>
                           <p>Another difference of this di≈øea≈øe ari≈øes from a ≈øharp blood, which is known by the gnawing of the humor upon the Ve≈ø≈øels. In the Cure, you mu≈øt purge with ≈øyrup of Ro≈øes ≈øolutive, or with leaves of <hi>Sena</hi>; a pe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary of Sows dung and A≈ø≈øes dung, which is made up with Plantain water, and the mu≈øcilage of the ≈øeed of Quinces, is here of u≈øe if need require.</p>
                           <p>Another difference ari≈øes from a ≈øerous and watry blood; for either the Liver is weakned, or the Veins ≈øo debilitated, that it cannot attract the ≈øerous or wheyie humour in the blood: in this ca≈øe, the blood flows not forth in ≈øuch a quantity, nor is ea≈øily curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: If a Cloth be dipped in it, and then dried in the ≈øhade, it pre≈øently di≈øcolours.

                           <p>THE Whites is an inordinate eruption of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humour collected together through ≈øome vitiou≈øne≈øs of the blood. It affects Women chiefly, and ≈øometimes al≈øo Virgins, of which there are Examples: Yet it is more often in women, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be of a moi≈øt con≈øtitution, and live an idle and delicate life, eating ≈øuch things as are cold and moi≈øt. Old women al≈øo are affected herewith through the abundance of Flegm, and the weakne≈øs of the concoctive faculty.</p>
                           <p>It differs from the Gonorrhea, becau≈øe in that the ≈øeminal matter is white, and thicker; and flows by long intervals, and i≈ø≈øues forth in a le≈ø≈øer quantity from a nocturnal pollution; for that is joyned with venereal imaginations, and only happens in the time of ≈øleep. It differs from the di≈øcolouring of the Flowers; for they though not exactly, do always ob≈øerve their
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59975:129"/>
times of Flowing. Be≈øides, they happen not to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, or ≈øuch who≈øe Cour≈øes are ≈øtopped. It differs from the putrid humour that i≈ø≈øues from the Ulcers of the Womb, becau≈øe that is joyned with the ≈øigns of an Ulcer, and the putrefaction is thicker and whiter; if it be mattery, it is coloured with blood, and i≈ø≈øues forth with pain.</p>
                           <p>The Cure of this mu≈øt be ha≈øtned, becau≈øe in a ≈øhort time it endangers the making of women barren, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing them to be lean, to fall into a Con≈øumption, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, the Drop≈øie, fall of the Womb, Swoonings, and Convul≈øions; which is the cau≈øe that though it be not hard to be cured in the beginning, yet it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very difficult; for by this means the whole body accu≈øtoms it ≈øelf to ≈øend forth its excrements this way, and the Womb being now weakned, gathers excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments apace.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes it proceeds from the whole body, and then you may perceive the ≈øigns of an ill humor through the whole body. In the Cure of this, you mu≈øt avoid blood-letting, for that the bad humor mu≈øt not be recalled to defile the blood; be≈øides, that the di≈øea≈øe is a ≈øufficient weakning and con≈øuming of the body. The humor is di≈øcu≈ø≈øed by the decoction of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and Lentisk-wood. For the drying up of the humor, the Root of <hi>Filipendula</hi> doth very much conduce. For a≈øtringent Medicines you may u≈øe chiefly the powder of dead men's bones, the a≈øhes of Capons-dung in rain water. The Patient mu≈øt avoid ≈øleeping upon her back, le≈øt the heat of the Lungs ≈øhould carry the humors toward the Womb: Frictions al≈øo of the upper parts, for the diver≈øion of the humor may be u≈øed.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes it is cau≈øed by the Womb it ≈øelf, and then there will appear ≈øigns of the affection of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59975:130"/>
Womb, and the Flux is not ≈øo great. For the Cure of this, Suffumigations of Frankincen≈øe, Labdanum, Ma≈øtick, and Sanders are very requi≈øite.</p>

                           <p>The ≈øigns of the pre≈øent Di≈øea≈øe are, that when the Vapours are carried up to the Heart, and do there ≈øtop the vital Spirits, a light ≈øwooning follows, the Pul≈øe changes and is little, the Body grows cold, all the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits flying up into the Heart; the Vapour being thru≈øt up to the Head and Chaps, the Chaps are many times ≈øet fa≈øt, the Patient ≈øeeming to be ≈øtifled; the motion of the Brea≈øt and Diaphragm is di≈øturbed and hindred, ≈øo that the breath is almo≈øt ≈øtopt, the Patient living on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by tran≈øpiration.

                           <p>It differs from the Epilep≈øie, becau≈øe in that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul≈øive motions are more general; nor is there any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of tho≈øe things which happen about them after the Fit; the Pul≈øe is great, and the Mouth of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

affected fomes with a froth: It differs from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexy, becau≈øe in that the Fit comes ≈øuddenly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any notice; and the Patient is affected with a kind of ≈ønorting, and there is ≈øuch a Re≈øolution of the parts, that they feel not although they be pricked: It differs from a Syncope, in that there are no ≈øigns when the Fit will be, the Pul≈øe cea≈øes to the apprehen≈øion, and the Patient is troubled with cold ≈øweats.

                           <p>The cau≈øe of this is a venemous, ≈øubtle, and thin Vapour, piercing in one moment through the whole body, and carried up from the matter in the Womb, corrupted after a peculiar manner, either by it ≈øelf or from external means, ≈øuch are perfumes, anger, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not only a≈øcending through the veins, but al≈øo through all the other breathing holes, and ≈øecret pa≈ø≈øages of the body.</p>
                           <p>The Cure is doubtful if it have po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for a time, for it begets weakne≈øs, con≈øumes the ≈øtrength, and ≈øhews abundance of humour; or if it po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øeth Child-bearing Women, either after a difficult Travel, or after an Abortion; or if it po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, becau≈øe it induces fear of Abortion; there is more hope, if the act of Re≈øpiration be not too much impeded, and if the Fits do not return too often.</p>
                           <p>The Cure regards fir≈øt the time of the Fit, being performed fir≈øt by means of interception, which may be done by binding the Belly under the Navel with a girdle made of the skin of a Hart, killed in the very act of Copulation.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59975:132"/>
Eel-skins, the application of A≈ø≈øa faetida and Oil of Tartar to the mouth. Thirdly, by way of revul≈øion of the humour, by Frictions and Gly≈øters di≈øpelling the winds, and the application of Cupping-gla≈ø≈øes with much flame, fir≈øt to the Thighs, and then to the Hips, putting ≈øweet things into the Privities; ≈øuch as are Oil of Sivet half a ≈øcruple, Oil of Nutmegs one ≈øcruple: Fourthly, by di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of the humour, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed inwardly by the Oil of white Amber, with the pouder of Walnut Flowers, extract of Ca≈øtor; exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by an Emplai≈øter of the fat of a black Heifer, Sclarea boiled in butter, adding to it a ≈øufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Tachamahacca and Caranna: After the fit is pa≈øt, evacuation is to be regarded, fir≈øt with purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for which purpo≈øe it will not be ami≈øs to u≈øe the≈øe en≈øuing Pills: Take Siler mountain, Pennyroyal, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the innermo≈øt part of Ca≈ø≈øia Pipe, Pomegranate Kernels, Piony roots, and Calamus, of each three drams; Mu≈øcus and Spike of India, of each half a dram; then make Pills thereof with the juice of Mugwort, of which ≈øhe may take every day, or every other day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Supper.

It is cur'd by evacuation of the ≈øeed, ≈øuch as are Rue, and Agnus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtus,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59975:132"/>
and anointing with odoriferous ≈øalves, e≈øpecially if the woman be to live without the u≈øe of man.</p>
                           <p>If it come from the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion of the terms, which is known by the Cour≈øes being mingled with a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly blood, take powdered Agaric, a dram of Pioney ≈øeeds, or the weight of a dram and a half of Triphera magna.</p>
                           <p>But take this for a ≈øecret, that for a married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in ca≈øe of the pre≈øent ≈øuffocation, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than for the Man to anoint the top of his Yard with a little Oyl of Gilliflowers, and Oyl of ≈øweet Almonds together, and ≈øo to lye with her; for this a≈ø≈øuredly brings down the Matrix again.</p>
                           <p>This Di≈øea≈øe is very frequent, the Procatartick or external Cau≈øes of it, are either violent motions of the body, or, which is much oftner, vehement commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Mind from ≈øome ≈øudden a≈ø≈øault, either of Anger or Grief, or the like Pa≈ø≈øions. Therefore as often as Women are troubled with this or that di≈øorder of Body, the rea≈øon whereof cannot be deduced from the common Axioms; for finding out Di≈øea≈øes, we mu≈øt diligently enquire whether they are not chiefly afflicted with that indi≈øpo≈øition which they complain of, when they have been di≈øturbed in their minds, and afflicted with grief; which if they confe≈øs, we may be fully ≈øatisfied that this di≈øorder proceeds from this Di≈øea≈øe we are now ≈øpeaking of; e≈øpecially if Urine as clear as Chry≈øtal evacuated copiou≈øly ≈øome certain times, makes the Diagno≈øtick more manife≈øt. But to the≈øe di≈øorders of the Mind, which are u≈øually the occa≈øions of this Di≈øea≈øe, is to be added emptine≈øs of the ≈øtomach, by rea≈øon of long fa≈øting, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bleeding, and a Vomit or Purge that worked too much; and certainly this Di≈øea≈øe proceeds from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59975:133"/>
of the Spirits, upon which account too many of them in a crowd, contrary to proportion, are hurried violently upon this or that part, occa≈øioning Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions and pain, when they ru≈øh upon parts indued with exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øe, perverting the functions of the Organs, both of that into which they thru≈øt them≈øelves, and al≈øo of that from whence they departed, both being much injured by this unequal di≈øtribution, which is quite contrary to the Oeconomy of Nature.</p>
                           <p>The Origen and Antecedent Cau≈øe of this confu≈øion, is a weak con≈øtitution of the Spirits, whether it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or adventitious; for which Rea≈øon they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily di≈ø≈øipated upon any occa≈øion, and their Sy≈øtem ≈øoon broke: For as the outward Man is framed with parts obvious to ≈øen≈øe, ≈øo without doubt the inward Man con≈øi≈øts of a due Series, and as it were a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Spirits, to be viewed only by the eye of Rea≈øon; and as this is nearly joyned, and as it were united with the con≈øtitution of the Body, ≈øo much the more ea≈øily or more difficultly is its frame di≈øordered, by how much the Con≈øtitutive Principles that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted us by Nature, are more or le≈øs firm. That the ≈øaid Confu≈øion of the Spirits is the cau≈øe of Hy≈øteric Di≈øea≈øes, will appear by Mother-Fits, wherein the Spirits are crowded in the lower Belly, and ru≈øhing together violently towards the Jaws, occa≈øion Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions in every region thro' which they pa≈øs, blowing up the Belly like a great Ball, which is yet nothing but the rowling together or conglobation of the parts ≈øeized with the Convul≈øion, which cannot be ≈øuppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed without great violence. The external parts in the the mean while, and the Fle≈øh being in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitute of Spirits, by rea≈øon they are carried another way, are often ≈øo very cold, not only in this kind, but in all other kind of Hy≈øteric Di≈øea≈øes, that dead
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59975:133"/>
Bodies are not colder, but the Pul≈øe are as good as tho≈øe of People that are well; nor is the Womans life in danger by this cold, unle≈øs it is occa≈øioned by ≈øome very large evacuation going before.</p>
                           <p>And the inordinate agitation of the Spirits di≈øturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blood, is the cau≈øe of the clear and copious Urine; for when the Oeconomy of the blood is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the Sick cannot long enough contain the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum that is imported, but lets it go, before it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with ≈øaline particles, whereby the Citron colour is to be imparted to it, whereof we have daily experiment in tho≈øe that drink much, e≈øpecially of thin and attenuating Liquors; for then their Urine is very clear; in which ca≈øe, the blood being over-power'd by that quantity of ≈øerum, and being wholly unable to retain it, puts it off quite clear, not yet died by the juice of the Body, by rea≈øon of its too ≈øhort ≈øtay.</p>
                           <p>As to the Cold, by which the external parts are ≈øo often chilled, it is very manife≈øt that that happens, becau≈øe the Spirits for≈øaking their ≈øtations too officiou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, intrude them≈øelves into this or that part. Nor is it to be doubted, that weeping and laughing fits, which often ≈øei≈øe hy≈øterical women without any occa≈øion, are procured by the Animal Spirits forcing them≈øelves vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon the Organs that perform the≈øe Animal functions.</p>
                           <p>And now I ≈øuppo≈øe it is manife≈øt, that this whole Di≈øea≈øe is occa≈øioned by the Animal Spirits being not rightly di≈øpo≈øed, and not by ≈øeed and men≈øtruous blood corrupted, and ≈øending up malignant Vapours to the parts affected, nor from I know not what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of the juices, and conge≈øtion of acrid humors as others think, but from tho≈øe Cau≈øes we have a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ≈øame may be ≈øaid of a great lo≈øs of blood, whether it is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by opening a vein, or flows immoderately in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; or of emptine≈øs, or too long ab≈øtinence from Fle≈øh; all which would rather prevent hy≈øteric Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes, than occa≈øion them, if the fomes of them was involved in ≈øome matter; whereas on the contrary, nothing does ≈øo con≈øtantly occa≈øion this Di≈øea≈øe, as the≈øe evacuations<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> But tho' it is apparent enough, that the Original fomes of this Di≈øea≈øe is not lodged in the humors, yet it mu≈øt be confe≈ø≈øed that the confu≈øion of the Spirits produces putrid humors in the Body, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon the function, as well of the≈øe parts which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtended by the violent impul≈øe of the Spirits, as of tho≈øe which are deprived of them, are wholly perverted; and mo≈øt of the≈øe being as it were ≈øeparatory Organs de≈øigned for the reception of the impurities of the blood, if their functions are any way hurt, it can not be but a great many feculencies will be heaped up, which had been elimmated, and ≈øo the ma≈øs of blood puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if the Organs had performed their office, which they had certainly done, if a due Oeconomy of the Spirits had invigorated them. To this Cau≈øe is to be attributed great Cachexies, lo≈øs of appetite, a Chloro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis, and the White Fever in young Women, which is a ≈øpecies of hy≈øteric Di≈øea≈øes, and the ≈øource of many mi≈øeries.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="237" facs="tcp:59975:134"/>From what has been ≈øaid, it is very manife≈øt that that is the chief indication in this Di≈øea≈øe, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the corroboration of the blood, that is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Origin of the Spirits, which being done, the invigorated Spirits can pre≈øerve that tenure that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Oeconomy of the whole body, and the particular parts; and therefore when the confu≈øion of the Spirits has vitiated the humors by long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it will be proper, fir≈øt to le≈ø≈øen tho≈øe humors ≈øo corrupted by bleeding, and purging, if the Patient has ≈øufficient ≈øtrength before we endeavour to corrobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the blood, and which indeed we can ≈øcarce do, whil≈øt a feculent heap of humors lies in the way. But fora≈ømuch as Pains, Vomiting, and Loo≈øene≈øs, are ≈øometimes ≈øo very ≈øevere that they will not bear a truce ≈øo long, until we have ≈øatisfied the fir≈øt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fortifying the blood; therefore ≈øometimes we mu≈øt begin the Cure by quieting the effects (the cau≈øe being let alone a little while) with ≈øome anodyne Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and then we mu≈øt endeavour to rectifie the Spirits, who≈øe infirm con≈øtitution is the cau≈øe of this Di≈øea≈øe, by which we may again endeavour to Cure ≈øuch kind of Symptoms. And becau≈øe experience teaches, that there are many ≈øtinking things that will repell the inordination of the Spirits, and contain them in their places, which are therefore call'd hy≈øterics, we mu≈øt make u≈øe of them when we would an≈øwer ≈øuch intentions.</p>
                           <p>According to what has been ≈øaid, I order the Sick to be blooded in the arm, and that after bleeding, ≈øhe be purged three or four Mornings following. The Woman thinks her ≈øelf wor≈øe of tho≈øe days ≈øhe is blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and purged; for the≈øe evacuations promote the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion of the Spirits, which I take care to forewarn her of, that ≈øhe may not de≈øpair, the Di≈øea≈øe of it ≈øelf

being apt to incline her ≈øo to do: But however tho≈øe ill humours heapt up by the long continuance of the Di≈øea≈øe, are in ≈øome ≈øort to be evacuated, before we can well an≈øwer the prime intention. After the≈øe eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, ≈øome ≈øteel Remedy mu≈øt be pre≈øcribed, to be taken about a Month, to comfort the blood, and ≈øo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently the Spirits, that proceed from it, and nothing will more certainly an≈øwer your intention in this ca≈øe than ≈øteel; for it rai≈øes a volatile ferment in the vapid and languid blood, whereby the weak Spirits are rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, that before were kept down by their own weight; and this is very manife≈øt, for as often as Chalybeats are given in the Green Sickne≈øs, the Pul≈øe are pre≈øently greater and quicker, and the outward parts grow warm, and the pale and dead Countenance is changed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes fre≈øh and lively. But here we mu≈øt take notice, that bleeding and purging mu≈øt not always be u≈øed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chalibeats, or when the Woman is weak, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt worn out by the long continuance of the Di≈øea≈øe, they may and ought to be omitted, and you mu≈øt begin with ≈øteel, which mu≈øt be well minded.</p>
                           <p>I think ≈øteel is mo≈øt conveniently given in ≈øub≈øtance, and as I never ob≈øerved, nor heard, that ≈øo taken it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver injur'd any per≈øon, ≈øo I have been fully ≈øatisfied by frequent experience, that the bare ≈øub≈øtance performs the Cure ≈øooner, and better than any of the common Preparations of it; for bu≈øie Chymi≈øts make this, as well as other excellent Medicines wor≈øe rather than bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by their perver≈øe and over-officious diligence. I have al≈øo heard, and if it be true, it much ≈øtrengthens our a≈ø≈øertion, that the crude Mine, as it is digg'd out of the Earth, is more effectual in curing Di≈øea≈øes, than Iron that has pa≈øs'd the Fire, and bin purified by fu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So the Author affirms, but I have not yet try'd whether it be ≈øo or not. This I certainly know, that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59975:135"/>
there is no excellent and powerful Remedy, which has not received its chief Vertues from Nature: Upon which account, grateful Antiquity call'd excellent Medicines God's handicraft. Next to the ≈øub≈øtance of the ≈øteel, I chu≈øe the Syrrup of it, prepared with the fileings of Steel or Iron, infu≈øed in the cold in Rheni≈øh Wine, 'till the Wine is ≈øufficiently impregnated, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ≈øtrained, and boiled up to the con≈øi≈øtence of a Syrrup, with a ≈øufficient quantity of Sugar. Nor do I u≈øe any purging Medicine at ≈øet times, during the whole Chalybeat cour≈øe, for I think the Vertue of the Steel is de≈øtroy'd by a purge in hy≈øterical Di≈øea≈øes; and when the chief de≈øign is to reduce the Spirits to order, and to renew and confirm their Sy≈øtem.</p>
                           <p>If any one objects that fileings of Steel may hurt tho≈øe that take them, by ≈øticking in their Bowels, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs they are purged now and then; I an≈øwer fir≈øt, that I never found any ≈øuch thing in any one, and it is much more probable, that being involved in the ≈ølime, and with the Excrementious humours of the parts, they ≈øhould at length pa≈øs away with them, than when they are exagitated by purging Medicines, which occa≈øion unu≈øual compre≈ø≈øions, twi≈øting and contraction of the guts, whereby the particles of the ≈øteel, thru≈øt upon the coats of the Bowels, may penetrate deeper into them. When the patient is in a Steel cour≈øe, remedies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd Hy≈øterics are to be u≈øed, as it were by the by, to comfort the Blood and animal Spirits; in that manner and form, which is mo≈øt agreeable to the ≈øick. But if ≈øhe can take them in a ≈øolid form, they will more powerfully retain the Spirits in their office and place, than things that are liquid; for the very ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance affects the Stomach longer with its ≈øavour, and works more forcibly upon the body, than either deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or infu≈øions. Being about to an≈øwer all the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59975:136"/>
I have touched upon above, I u≈øe to pre≈øcribe the≈øe few and common things, which commonly do what I de≈øire. Let eight ounces of blood be taken from the Arm, the next Morning let her enter upon the u≈øe of the Pills of Coch. Major and of Ca≈øtor, as they are mentioned in the Chapter of the Green-Sickne≈øs, and let them be repeated, as it is there ordered. Take of Galbanum di≈ø≈øolved in tincture of Ca≈øtor, and ≈øtrained three drams, Tachamacha two drams, make a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter to be apply'd to the Navel.</p>
                           <p>Take of black Cherry-water, of Rue-water, and compound Briony-water, each three ounces, of Ca≈øtor tyed up in a Rag, and hanged in a gla≈øs half a dram, of fine Sugar a ≈øufficient quantity, make a Julep, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of let her take four or five ≈øpoonfuls when ≈øhe is faint, dropping into the fir≈øt Do≈øe, if the Fit is violent, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty drops of Spirit of Harts-horn.</p>
                           <p>After the Purging Pills are taken, let her u≈øe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pills made of fileings of Steel and extract of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, mentioned in the Chapter of the Green-≈øickne≈øs, according to the directions there ≈øet down; or ≈øhe may take the Bolus there mention'd, if ≈øhe likes a Bolus better than Pills.</p>
                           <p>Take of choice Myrrh and Galbanum, each one dram and an half, of Ca≈øtor fifteen grains, with a ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity of Peruvian Bal≈øome, make twelve Pills of every dram; let her take three every Night, and drink upon them three or four ≈øpoonfuls of compound Briony-water thro' the whole Cour≈øe of this proce≈øs.</p>
                           <p>But if the Pills la≈øt pre≈øcribed move the Belly, which ≈øometimes happens in Bodies that are very ea≈øily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by rea≈øon of the Gum that is in them, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are to be u≈øed.</p>
                           <p>Take of Ca≈øtor one dram, of volatile Salt, Amber, half a dram, with a ≈øufficient quantity of extract of Rue,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59975:136"/>
make 24 ≈ømall Pills, let her take three every Night.</p>
                           <p>But it is to be noted that Steel Medicines in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever form or Do≈øe they are taken, occa≈øion ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Women great di≈øorders both of Body and Mind, and that not only on the fir≈øt days, which is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øual almo≈øt in every body, but al≈øo almo≈øt all the time they are taken; in this ca≈øe the u≈øe of Steel mu≈øt not pre≈øently be interrupted at tho≈øe times, but Laudanum mu≈øt be given every night for ≈øome time in ≈øome hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteric water, that they may the better bear it; but when the ≈øymptoms are mild, and it ≈øeems that the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs may be done without taking ≈øteel, I think it ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bleed, and to purge three or four times, and then to give the altering hy≈øteric Pills above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Morning and Evening for ten days.</p>
                           <p>It is to be noted that ≈øome Women do ≈øo abhor hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteric Medicines, that they are much injured thereby, therefore they mu≈øt not be given to ≈øuch.</p>
                           <p>If the blood is ≈øo very feeble, and the confu≈øion of the Spirits ≈øo great, that ≈øteel ordered to be us'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the method pre≈øcribed, is not ≈øufficient to cure the di≈øea≈øe, the Patient mu≈øt drink ≈øome mineral waters impregnated with the Iron Mine, ≈øuch as are <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and ≈øome others lately found out. But this is more e≈øpecially to be ob≈øerved in drinking of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That if any Sickne≈øs happens, that is to be refer'd to hy≈øteric ≈øymptoms, in this Ca≈øe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient mu≈øt forbear drinking them a day or two, 'till that ≈øymptom that hindered their pa≈ø≈øage is quite gone.</p>
                           <p>But if the Di≈øea≈øe by rea≈øon of its ob≈øtinacy will not yield to ≈øteel-waters, the Patient mu≈øt go to the Bath; and when ≈øhe has u≈øed the≈øe waters inwardly three Mornings following, the next day let her go into the Bath, and the day following let her drink them again; and ≈øo let her do by turns for two whole Months.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="242" facs="tcp:59975:137"/>Venice Treacle alone, if it be u≈øed often, and a long while, is a great remedy in this Di≈øea≈øe.</p>
                           <p>Spani≈øh Wine medicated with Gentian, Angelica, Wormwood, Centaury, the yellow rind of Oranges, and other Corroboratives infus'd in it, does a great deal of good, ≈øome ≈øpoonfuls of it being taken thrice a day, if the woman be not of a thin and cholerick ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body.</p>
                           <p>The Peruvian-Bark al≈øo wonderfully comforts and invigorates the Blood and Spirits, a Scruple being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Morning and Evening. But if any of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies above-mention'd do not well agree, which often happens in cholerick and thin Constitutions, then a Milk Diet may be u≈øed; but nothing does ≈øo much ≈øtrengthen the Blood and Spirits, as riding much on Hor≈øeback every day for a long while. If the Di≈øea≈øe be ≈øuch, or ≈øo great a one, that it will not bear a truce 'till it may be cured with Medicines that corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate the Blood and Spirits, we mu≈øt pre≈øently make u≈øe of hy≈øteric Remedies, as A≈ø≈øa-faetida, Galbanum, Ca≈øtor, Spirit of Sal-Armoniack, and whatever el≈øe has a filthy and ungrateful ≈ømell.</p>
                           <p>To conclude, if ≈øome intolerable pain accompanies this Di≈øea≈øe, or if their be violent Vomitings, or a Loo≈øne≈øs, then be≈øides hy≈øteric Medicines above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Laudanum mu≈øt be u≈øed, which is only able to re≈øtrain the≈øe ≈øymptoms. But in quieting the≈øe pains which vomiting occa≈øions, we mu≈øt take great care that they are not mitigated, either by Laudanum, or any other Paregorick, before due evacuations have been made, unle≈øs they almo≈øt exceed all humane patience; but if the Sick has vomited a great while, you mu≈øt give Laudanum without delay, and ≈øuch a do≈øe as is not only equal to the violence and duration of the ≈øymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, but ≈øuch an one as is ≈øufficient to vanqui≈øh it.</p>

                           <p>BArrenne≈øs is an impotence to conceive, coming from defect either of the Genitals, or of the blood, or of the men≈øtruous blood.</p>
                           <p>Fir≈øt, through the defect of the Genitals, either by the clo≈øing up of the Orifice of the womb, which may be cut and opened by Art; or through the narrowne≈øs of the parts, for ≈øo they will not admit the Yard; or by rea≈øon of ≈øome Ulcers or Excre≈øcencies in the neck of the womb. Or by rea≈øon of ≈øome fault in the ≈øeed, either the woman being too young, or too old, or through ≈øome di≈øtemper in the Ve≈ø≈øels dedicated to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and then the woman perceives very little or no plea≈øure in the act of Copulation.

                           <p>THE Di≈øea≈øes common to Children, are fir≈øt certain little ulcerous ri≈øings, chiefly in the Head; ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the whole Body; they ari≈øe from ≈øome vitious humour either collected in the Womb, or out of the Womb, by rea≈øon of the badne≈øs of the milk containing a ≈øerous, ≈øalt, and nitrous quality: If there be no ill to be ≈øu≈øpected, the humour may be driven forth by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Child ≈øome Syrup of <hi>Fumatory,</hi> or Harts-horn burnt: The Nur≈øe is to be purged, and the matter offending to be tempered with Syrup of Borage, or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary: If there be much corruption under the Cru≈øt of the Scab, the Head of the Child is to bo bathed with ≈øome ≈øoftning decoction, and then to be anointed with ≈øome drying Ointments.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes they are troubled with an inflamation of the Head, with which is joined a hollowne≈øs in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Head; and in the Eyes; it may ari≈øe from the milk, if the Nur≈øe be ≈øubject to drink overmuch

≈øtrong drink; in the Cure, you mu≈øt beware of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying things which are too refrigerating.</p>
                           <p>They are al≈øo many times affected with a kind of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilep≈øie, which proceeds ≈øometimes from extraordinary frights, from Milk that lies corrupted in the ≈øtomach, and ≈øometimes from Worms moving them≈øelves in the guts; and ≈øometimes it is the con≈øequent of other Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes. The Cure is to be ob≈øerved, partly in the Fit, and partly after the Fit: The Smaragd-≈øtone, and the Hoof of a wild Elk put into the left Ear are very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and take good effect; vomiting al≈øo, and this Emplai≈øter of white Amber, Frankincen≈øe, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtick, of each a dram and a half, Galbanum, Opopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of each a ≈øcruple, Mi≈øleto of an Oak two drams, Ambergreece ≈øix grains, Musk three grains, ≈øeed of Male <hi>Peonie</hi> half a dram, Labdanum, one dram and a half, a little Oil of Nutmeg, and ≈øprinkled with the du≈øt of Cubebs; the forepart of the head may be al≈øo anointed with Oil of white Amber. Fears and ≈øtarting in the Child's ≈øleep, are occa≈øioned from the putrid Vapours which are carried up with the animal Spirits, and ari≈øe from the Stomach; therefore they happen to Infants that ≈øuck greedily. In the Cure, care mu≈øt be taken that the Child do not fill it ≈øelf too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea≈øonably, and provide that good and ≈øound Milk may be generated, and that the Children be not put to ≈øleep upon a full ≈øtomach: The ≈øtomach of the Child anointed near the orifice with Oil of Quinces, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtick, and Oil of Nutmegs. Before ≈øleep di≈ø≈øolve a little roll of <hi>Diamo≈øch</hi> in Milk, and give the Child; unle≈øs the Child be over-much troubled with heat, you may give it a little Treacle once in a week; over-much watching, or weakne≈øs, is occa≈øioned by ≈øharp Vapours which ari≈øe out of the ≈øtomach, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the badne≈øs of the Milk; ≈øometimes it is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioned

as they every one of them from the Seed of his Kind, ca≈øt into the Womb of the Earth, do bud or increa≈øe, and do naturally grow to the perfect Form of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Nature: So Man al≈øo being a rea≈øonable Creature according to the quality of the Body, doth naturally draw his Original and Begining from the ≈øperm and ≈øeed of Man, projected and ca≈øt forth into the Womb of Woman, as into a Field: But that matter of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which we call ≈øperm or ≈øeed, by its original and nature, is only a ≈øuperfluous Humor, the re≈øidue and remainder, I ≈øay, of the nutriment and food, and the ≈øuperfluity of the third concoction in the Body, derived and conveyed along through the hidden and ≈øecret or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans or in≈øtruments from the chiefe≈øt Members of the body unto the generative parts, and ≈øerveth for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration And it hath its beginning and breeding from the re≈øidues and remnants of all the meats belonging to the nouri≈øhment of Man, after they be altered and tran≈ømuted even to the third Concoction: Of the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of which concocted food collected and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in its proper and due manner, it is evident that the ≈øame is ingendred, according to the con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the age and nature; for there is made a three-fold concoction of any meat, altered and converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nouri≈øhment of the living Creature, even to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of ≈øeed, that concoction neverthele≈øs following, which is the pure≈øt of all Concoctions: For the Food being ≈øent down into the ≈øtomach, by chewing ≈øtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the pure Nutriment which is ordained to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part (the dry Excrement being driven downward thorough the Guts to the Belly) through the ≈øucking Veins (named in Latin <hi>me≈øaraicae</hi>) carried as it were to one Gate flowing out of innumerable Channels, is brought to the Liver; where to the di≈øpo≈øition of the former concoction, made in the ≈øtomach, there is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

made the ≈øecond concoction in the Liver of the food derived unto it, the ≈øuperfluous matter being ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, that is to ≈øay, both kinds of choler, and the watri≈øh humour drawn and attracted by the emulgent ve≈ø≈øels (in Latin <hi>va≈øa emulgentia</hi>) that it being ≈øtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the kidnies, might de≈øcend down into the bladder; then the re≈øidue, refined and clean≈øed in the Liver by this concoction, that is to ≈øay blood, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed over to the Heart, to receive its vital admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration and office. In the Heart again, is made the third Concoction of the food being received at one time; for there blood having taken unto it vital and lively ≈øpirit, being diffu≈øed and ≈øent abroad throughout the ≈øeveral members of the body, doth again expel and void out that which is ≈øuperfluous in it ≈øelf, by the ≈øecret pores and pa≈ø≈øages. At length here the Spirit chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and turneth the blood conveyed through the ≈øper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical or ≈øeed-ve≈ø≈øels (being branches of <hi>vena cava</hi>) there al≈øo further concocted into the nature of ≈øperm or ≈øeed, by the twined revolutions and back-turnings of the ≈ømalle≈øt ve≈ø≈øels for this purpo≈øe, and by the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or kernel'd ≈øub≈øtance of the Te≈øticles, and the ≈øeed pa≈ø≈øages (which they call Para≈øtatae) available in that behalf: So the blood, exqui≈øitely wrought and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for the mo≈øt part converted into vital ≈øpirits, is ≈øtraight-way conveyed by the Artery named <hi>Aorta,</hi> and branches thereof to all the other Members of the whole body.

                     <p>THAT the rea≈øon of this Generation may be made the more plain and evident unto us, we will declare by a brief demon≈øtration, that there is the ≈øame begining of Plants and Herbs, and of other things which fall under the ≈øame con≈øideration; therefore as in the ≈øeeds of every kind, the grain it ≈øelf ca≈øt into the Earth, is the food, and as it were the fir≈øt ≈øubject of all the alteration following, whereby it buds and ≈øprings, is augmented and grows up into a nature like unto it; ≈øo meat being taken, affordeth in mans body the fir≈øt matter to a variable concoction. And as in Plants we may ob≈øerve a mo≈øt certain ≈øeparation of the pure from the impure, and of the remnant from the ≈øuperfluous matter; ≈øo here we perceive a natural ≈øeparation and ≈øeque≈øtration of that which is unprofitable, from that which is profitable, by their certain degrees: For fir≈øt the ≈øeed being committed to the Earth, by and by ≈øwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the moi≈øture of the ≈øame, ≈øtrippeth it ≈øelf from that little skin, in which it was inclo≈øed, and ≈øpringing upward, ca≈øteth forth the ≈øame being empty, as a dry Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, the grain in the mean time budding and ≈øprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, that it may proceed forward toward the increa≈øe; afterward the increa≈øe and growth ≈øtretching even to the fruit di≈ørobed and bereaved of the Flower, the ≈øecond purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ca≈øteth down the flower ≈øprung up in the top of the bough, but pre≈øerveth the hope of the Fruit, being ≈øtripped of his flower, as that thing which remaineth pure and profitable by the ≈øecond purging. Afterwards the Fruit being grown to its ju≈øt quantity, the third alteration ca≈øteth down the leaves, as the ≈øuperfluity of this degree; but ordaineth the fruit, being now ≈øo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59975:149"/>
clean≈øed and purged, for the utility of mans nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment, maturity, and ripene≈øs being granted unto it. Put now, either the ≈øeed breaketh, the fruit lying hid in it, or el≈øe it ≈øendeth it out by putrefaction; and being ca≈øt into the ground it ha≈øteneth again into the property of its own nature, not tending towards it ≈øelf, which is remaining, but to the likene≈øs of its fir≈øt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, from whence it had its begining; ≈øo that in this it appeareth ab≈øolutely true, that Nature ingendereth things like unto it ≈øelf; for every thing doth naturally covet and de≈øire the form and likene≈øs of that form whence it is bred: Hence it comes to pa≈øs, that Apples grow not from Pears, nor Pears from any other kind of fruit, unle≈øs it be ≈øo brought about by the means of grafting and planting. And the ≈øame thing is to be acknowledged in the generation of Man and Woman, which is to be confe≈ø≈øed in the growing of Plants and Herbs; that becau≈øe we ≈øee bodies well di≈øtingui≈øhed by Members to be engendred of ≈øeed, we may al≈øo believe that the ≈øame ≈øeed is derived from the di≈øtinct and ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the body; wherefore let tho≈øe be advi≈øed what they ≈øay, who affirm the ≈øeed of generation to be ingendred of the Brain only, when as it is not ≈øo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the con≈øideration of the Concoctions, nor to the con≈øtitution of the bodies. True it is, that ≈øome, and that not a ≈ømall part, is derived from the Brain, but the chiefe≈øt part is collected together from the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt parts of the whole body: For if we ≈øay, that this ≈øhould be ingendred of one or two parts only; every one would find that this con≈øequence would follow by an infallible rea≈øon, namely, that tho≈øe ≈øame parts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øhould be ingendred again: Therefore we may more rightly conclude, that be≈øides that beginning which it draweth from the Brain, it is ingendred from the whole body, and the mo≈øt e≈øpecial parts of the ≈øame,

the effect it ≈øelf manife≈øting the cau≈øe, mo≈øt e≈øpecially when we ≈øee di≈øtinct members, and perfectly fini≈øht, according to the due form of the body, and ≈øo truly, that the thing begotten doth an≈øwer and agree to the con≈øtitution of the thing begetting; of feeble ≈øeed, a feeble man being born; of ≈øtrong ≈øeed, a ≈øtrong and lu≈øty man: By which means it happeneth that we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ≈øee the infirmities and ill favoured marks of the body in the Children, which are inherent in the Parents, and the≈øe we firmly believe to have pa≈ø≈øed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the corruption of the ≈øeed.

                     <head>CHAP. III. What cour≈øe Parents ought to take that they may beget wi≈øe Children.</head>
                     <p>IT may well be admired, what the rea≈øon ≈øhould be, that Nature being ≈øo wi≈øe and provident in all her actings, ≈øhould neverthele≈øs be ≈øo over≈øeen in a work of ≈øo ≈øpecial regard as Mankind, that for one whom ≈øhe produceth wi≈øe, ≈øolid and judicious, ≈øhe bringeth ≈øo many into the World of tho≈øe that are ≈øhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, half witted, and void of prudence: But having ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider'd with my ≈øelf, and ≈øearcht into the rea≈øon of natural cau≈øes of this ≈øo ≈øtrange a matter; I ea≈øily found the true rea≈øon to be this, namely, that Parents apply not them≈øelves to the act of generation, with that order and diligence that is required by nature, nor know the conditions which ought to be ob≈øerved, that their Children may prove wi≈øe and judicious. Now if by art we may procure a remedy for this, we ≈øhall have brought to the Common-wealth the greate≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit ≈øhe can receive. The main difficulty of this matter
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59975:150"/>
chiefly con≈øi≈øteth herein, that we cannot di≈øcour≈øe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in terms ≈øo ≈øeemly and mode≈øt, as exact decency would require; but if for this rea≈øon I ≈øhould forbear to in≈øi≈øt upon any particular note or ob≈øervation, the whole bu≈øine≈øs would be of ≈ømall validity; fora≈ømuch as divers grave Authors are of opinion, that wi≈øe men ordinarily beget fooli≈øh Children, becau≈øe in the act of Copulation they ab≈øtain from certain diligences, which are of importance that the Son may partake of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wi≈ødom.</p>
                     <p>For the more Methodical proceeding, I have thought good to divide the matter of this di≈øcour≈øe into four principal parts. The fir≈øt is to ≈øhew the natural quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and temperature which Man and Woman ought to po≈ø≈øe≈øs, that they may u≈øe Generation. The ≈øecond, what diligence the Parents ought to imploy, that their Children may be male, and not Female. The third, how they may become wi≈øe and not fools. The fourth, how they are to be ordered after their birth for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of their wit. As to the fir≈øt point: Divers both ancient and modern Authors have delivered their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions to this effect, that in a well ordered Common-wealth, there ought to be a≈ø≈øigned certain ≈øurveyors of Marriages, who ≈øhould have skill and judgment ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to look into the qualities of the per≈øons that are to be married; and to allot to every woman a husband, and to every man a wife agreeable and proportionable to them in all re≈øpects: But whether ≈øuch a thing be of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity in a State, or no, let it lye upon the care and con≈øideration of ≈øuch as take upon them to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and di≈øpo≈øe the affairs of Common-wealths. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> took much pains in pre≈øcribing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Precepts about this matter, with ≈øeveral rules to know what ≈øort of Women were fruitful, and what not; what men were able for generation, and what di≈øable:
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59975:151"/>
But touching all this, they deliver very little to the purpo≈øe, and that not with ≈øuch di≈øtinction as is requi≈øite for the bu≈øine≈øs in hand, therefore it will be nece≈ø≈øary to begin this di≈øcour≈øe from its principles, and briefly to give the ≈øame its due order and method that ≈øo we may plainly and clearly demon≈øtrate from what Union of Parents wi≈øe children are generated, and from what fools and faineants i≈ø≈øue. To which end is needful: Fir≈øt to be informed of a particular point of Philo≈øophy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knowledge of which depends all that which is to be delivered touching this fir≈øt point; and that's this, that man is different from Woman in nothing el≈øe, as <hi>Galen</hi> al≈øo ob≈øerves, than in having his genital Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers without his body whereas a woman hath all the very ≈øame parts within, ≈øo that if, when nature hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed her work in the formation of man, ≈øhe would convert him into a Woman, there needs nothing el≈øe to be done, ≈øaving only to turn the Organs of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inward, and if, having formed a woman ≈øhe would transform her to a man, ≈øhe may effect it by doing the contrary: But whether or no the≈øe things have hapned, as ≈øome affirm they have, and of the certainty of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodites</hi> being found in nature, may more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diou≈øly be referred to a di≈øcour≈øe by it ≈øelf. Now what might be the cau≈øe that the genital Members are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred within, or without, and that the creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Male or Female, is a thing plain and evident enough to demon≈øtrate, con≈øidering that heat extendeth and enlargeth all things, and cold retaineth and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth them up; ≈øo that it is concluded by all that are knowing in Philo≈øophy and natural cau≈øes, that if the ≈øeed be cold and moi≈øt, a woman is begotten, not a man: And if the ≈øame be hot and dry, a man is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not a Woman: Whence it is to be inferred, that there is no man to be termed cold in re≈øpect of a woman, nor woman hot in re≈øpect of a man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:59975:151"/>This therefore is to be noted as a thing without all controver≈øie or exception, that the qualities which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a woman fruitful, are cold and moi≈øture, the womb holding the ≈øame proportion with mans ≈øeed, that the earth doth with Corn or any other grain; and we ≈øee, that if the earth want cold and moi≈øture, the ≈øeed will not pro≈øper; and that tho≈øe are the mo≈øt fertile ≈øoyls which partake mo≈øt of cold and moi≈øt: yet the≈øe two qualities ought to keep a certain mea≈øurablene≈øs, le≈øt that, either by exce≈øs, or deficiency, generation be ≈øpoyled; for as the Corn is vitiated by exce≈øs of rain, and overmuch cold; ≈øo in conception the ≈øeed may be choaked by over-abundance of the≈øe qualities; and on the other ≈øide, if tho≈øe parts in a woman ≈øhould be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate as in a man, it were impo≈ø≈øible ≈øhe ≈øhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or be a woman: Nor could ≈øhe breed that fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick blood which ingendereth milk, by which, as <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hypocrates</hi> affirm, the birth is nouri≈øhed while it remaineth in the mothers belly; neither could ≈øhe be beardle≈øs, or void of hair, if ≈øhe were overmuch inclining to hot and dry. Neverthele≈øs, all women are not cold and moi≈øt alike, there being of the≈øe qualities ≈øeveral degrees, ≈øome being cold and moi≈øt in the fir≈øt degree, ≈øome in the ≈øecond, ≈øome in the third, and in each of the≈øe they may conceive, if a man an≈øwer them in proportion of heat. As for the ≈øigns of the≈øe ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of coldne≈øs and moi≈øture in women, though hitherto they have not been taken notice of by any, yet it will be very requi≈øite in this place to con≈øider them according to the ≈øeveral effects, which each of the≈øe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees produceth. Fir≈øt, by the quick apprehen≈øion and acutene≈øs of wit in women, for if they be very witty and acute, they are to be judged cold and moi≈øt in the fir≈øt degree only; if very ≈øhallow and ≈øimple, in the third degree, but if they partake of a middle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59975:152"/>
between the≈øe two extreams, it ≈øignifieth that they are in the ≈øecond degree. Secondly, their Conditions; they being either cur≈øt, or good natured, according to the≈øe three degrees. Thirdly, their voice; which is either ≈øhrill, or big according as they are more or le≈øs cold and moi≈øt. Fourthly, their ≈øub≈øtance in fle≈øh; leanne≈øs being a ≈øign of little coldne≈øs and moi≈øture; gro≈øne≈øs or over much corpulency, of the redundance of tho≈øe qualities: to be meanly fle≈øhed, betokeneth the ≈øecond degree. Fifthly, the colour of their face; which is either white, or ≈øwarthy, as the≈øe qualities are inten≈øe or remi≈øs; of the ≈øecond degree is compo≈øed a fre≈øh and lively colour. Sixthly, their hair; which is al≈øo either much, or little, according to the exuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or defect of cold and moi≈øt. Seventhly, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øom form and proportion of body is the re≈øult of the middlemo≈øt degree; deformity ari≈øing from either Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.</p>
                     <p>Now from all the≈øe Signs it may be concluded, that tho≈øe women who are cold and moi≈øt in the ≈øecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, are of the perfecte≈øt temper, and in the be≈øt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as to their own proper nature, of bringing forth Children.</p>

What the corre≈øpondency ≈øhould be, which the man and wife ought to bear each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is expre≈ø≈øed by <hi>Hypocrates</hi> in the≈øe words. If the hot an≈øwer not the cold, and the dry the moi≈øt, with mea≈øure and quantity; that is, if there meet not in the Womb two Seeds, the one hot, the other cold, the one dry, the other moi≈øt, extended in equal degree, there can be no generation: For ≈øo marvellous a work as the formation of Man could not be perform'd, without a proportionable commixture of ≈øeeds, which could not be, if the mans ≈øeed and the womans were both of the ≈øame temperature. To exemplify what I have ≈øaid, it is to be concluded, that a woman who is wily, ill-condition'd, ≈øhrill-voiced, lean, ≈øwarthy-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, and deformed, (which are the ≈øigns of cold, and moi≈øt in the fir≈øt degree) may conceive by a man who is ignorant, good natured, ≈øweet voic'd, corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, having little hair, a well-coloured face, and a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome body, which are the ≈øigns of hot and dry in the fir≈øt degree; a woman cold and moi≈øt in the ≈øecond degree, in regard ≈øhe retaineth a mean in all tho≈øe ≈øigns above-mentioned is mo≈øt like to be fruitful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ≈øhe comes neare≈øt in proportion to men of each ≈øeveral temperature: But from the fir≈øt of the≈øe Unions or Conjoynings of man and woman, are mo≈øt likely to i≈ø≈øue the wi≈øe≈øt children, becau≈øe the dryne≈øs of the mother, correcteth and amendeth the defect of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

It is a thing very well worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation, that, whereas the right ≈øide of the reins, and the right te≈øticle, are naturally more hot and dry, and the left ≈øide of the reins with the left te≈øticle, more hot and moi≈øt, Nature ≈øeems to have intended that which at the beginning of the World is recorded in Hi≈øtory to have been very frequent; as namely, that a woman brought forth two Children at a birth, the one Male, the other Female, the right ≈øide which is hot and dry, being a≈ø≈øigned to the generation of Males<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> the left ≈øide which is cold and moi≈øt, to the generation of Females, and it ≈øeems to have been ≈øo ordained, to that end, that for every man there might be a wife: But after the Earth came to be well increa≈øed with people, it hapned as it appears, that this method and de≈øign of Nature was broken off, and now not only the double Child-bearing is very rare, but a far greater number of women are daily brought forth into the World than men: Whence it is to be gathered, that either Nature is grown weary, or el≈øe interrupted in her cour≈øe of working: However, ≈øince this defect of Nature is to be remedied with care and diligence, if men would imploy their ≈øerious con≈øiderations in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ≈øuch importance; there are ≈øix things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59975:154"/>
by tho≈øe that would obtain the accompli≈øhment of their de≈øire, in the de≈øign whereof this Chapter treats. The fir≈øt is, the eating tho≈øe ≈øorts of meats which are hot and dry, provided they have not tho≈øe qualities in too high an exce≈øs, le≈øt thereof be engenderd a man extreamly wily and malicious, and ≈øuch a one who≈øe actions may prove pernicious to the Common-wealth; but rather let tho≈øe viands be hot and dry in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate degree, ≈øuch as are Hens, Partridges, Turtles, Thru≈øhes, Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and tho≈øe roa≈øted. The ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing is the feeding ≈øo moderately, that the ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach may overcome and dige≈øt that meat which is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; for tho≈øe very ≈øorts of meat which are in their proper nature hot and dry, yet being eaten in ≈øo great a quantity, that the nature cannot dige≈øt them, they become cold and moi≈øt al≈øo, the immoderate drinking Wine is ab≈øolutely to be forbidden, there being no rawne≈øs which ≈øo much endamageth generation, as that of Wine, being ≈øo vaporous and ≈øubtle a Liquor. Whereupon a Law was anciently enacted in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Commonwealth, which prohibited the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried couple to ta≈øte of Wine that day they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the rights of the Marriage Bed. The third is, to u≈øe much exerci≈øe, which by fretting and con≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the exce≈ø≈øive moi≈øture of the Seed, heateth and dryeth the ≈øame; whereas ea≈øe, and overmuch delicacy breedeth coldne≈øs and moi≈øture in the Seed. And hence it comes to pa≈øs, that rich and great per≈øons that live at ea≈øe and feed high, have for the mo≈øt part Daughters: And <hi>Hypocrates</hi> reporteth that the principal per≈øons of the ancient <hi>Scythians,</hi> who were very effeminate and womani≈øh, mo≈øt commonly either begot Females, or el≈øe they proved either Eunuches, or Hermaphrodites: and being ignorant of the natural cau≈øe of this defect, he ≈øaith (and derides them for it)
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59975:154"/>
that they u≈øed to ≈øacrifice to their gods, imploring from them a remedy of that which was an effect of their mi≈ø-governance. The fourth diligence is, not to u≈øe the act of Generation untill the Seed be well concocted and ripened, it being convenient for ≈øeven or eight days before, to u≈øe tho≈øe meats which we have already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed, and ob≈øerving the ≈øame cour≈øe as Gardiners do with the Seeds which they would pre≈øerve; for they attend till they ripen, and clean≈øe, and wax dry, ≈øince if they ≈øhould pluck them from the ≈øtalk before they are deeply ≈øea≈øoned, and arrived to that point which is to be required, though they ≈øhould lye in the ground never ≈øo long, they would not grow at all. The fifth point, for a man to accompany with his Wife four or five days before her natural Cour≈øes, in regard the Child immediately ≈øtandeth in need of much food to nouri≈øh it. The ≈øixth and la≈øt point is to procure, that both the Seed of the Husband and Wife fall into the right ≈øide of the Womb, by which means it hapneth that Males are ingendred; the rea≈øon of which is, as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> affirmeth, that the right ≈øide of the Womb holdeth affinity in temperature with the Liver, the right ≈øide of the Reins, and the right Te≈øticle, which we have already delivered to be more hot, as the left ≈øide is more cold, by which Females are ingendered: To the≈øe things there is another con≈øideration to be added, which <hi>Galen</hi> hath al≈øo ob≈øerved, namely, that the Seed of each Te≈øticle, are of a different nature, for whereas that of the right Te≈øticle cometh out more hot, more ≈øpeedily, and in a le≈ø≈øer quantity, that of the left co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out more cold, more ≈ølowly, and in greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. What means are to be u≈øed for pre≈øerving the Childrens wit, after they are formed.</head>
                     <p>MAN is compounded of a ≈øub≈øtance ≈øo ≈øubject to alteration and corruption, that at the ≈øame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant in which he begins to be formed, he al≈øo begins to fade and decline; whereupon Nature hath provided, that in mans body there ≈øhould be four natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Attractive, Retentive, Concoctive, and Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive; the fir≈øt, concocting and altering the aliments which we eat, return to repair the ≈øub≈øtance that was lo≈øt, each ≈øucceeding in his place; So that it little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth to have ingendered a Child of the perfecte≈øt Seed, if we make no choice of the meats which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we feed upon: For the Creation being fini≈øhed, there remaineth not for the creature any part of the ≈øub≈øtance whereof it was compo≈øed. True it is, that the fir≈øt Seed, if it be well concocted, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth ≈øuch vertue, that dige≈øting, and altering the meats, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them (though bad and gro≈øs of them≈øelves) to turn to its own good temperature and ≈øub≈øtance; but yet we may ≈øo far forth u≈øe contrary meats, as the creature ≈øhall lo≈øe tho≈øe good qualities which it receiveth from the ≈øeed whereof it was made; therefore <hi>Plato</hi> ≈øaid, that one of the things which mo≈øt brought mans wit and his manners to ruine, was, his evil bringing up in diet: For which cau≈øe, he coun≈øelled that we ≈øhould give children delicate meats and drinks, and of good temperature, that, as they grow up, they may know to abandon evil, and embrace good; the rea≈øon whereof is very clear: For, ≈øince at the beginning the brain was made of delicate ≈øeed, and that this member is every day impairing and con≈øuming, and is to be repaired with meats which we eat; it followeth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59975:155"/>
that by u≈øing ≈øuch meats as are gro≈øs, and of evil temperature, the brains will become of the ≈øame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Therefore it will not ≈øuffice that the Child is born of good ≈øeed; but al≈øo that the meat which he eateth after he is born, be indued with the ≈øame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                     <p>The ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> were very curious in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; <hi>Galen,</hi> and other Greek Phy≈øicians, pre≈øcribed to tho≈øe parents who were de≈øirous of begetting wi≈øe children, to eat much Goats milk boyled, for about ≈øeven or eight days before Copulation; this meat being of a moderate ≈øub≈øtance, the heat exceeding not the cold, nor the moi≈øt the dry. The Greeks al≈øo u≈øed to extract out of the milk, the Chee≈øe and Whey, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gro≈ø≈øer parts of the Milk, and left the butter; which being of a more ≈øpairy ≈øub≈øtance, they gave their Children, mingling it with Honey. They al≈øo gave them Cracknels of white bread, of very delicate water, with Honey, and a little Salt. But yet, in this way of regiment and ordering of the diet, there ari≈øeth one great Inconvenience; namely, that children u≈øing ≈øuch kind of delicate meats, will not enjoy ≈øtrength ≈øufficient to re≈øi≈øt the injuries of the Air, or other occa≈øions which u≈øe to breed Maladies: And ≈øo by endeavouring that our Children may become wi≈øe, we ≈øhall cau≈øe them to become unhealthful, and ≈øhort-liv'd; Therefore it is to be con≈øidered, how things may be ≈øo ordered, that the advancing of Childrens wit by their diet and education, may not prove incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with the pre≈øervation of their health and ≈øtrength; which may be ea≈øily effected, if Parents will put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the≈øe Rules and Precepts which I ≈øhall pre≈øcribe. <hi>Hypocrates</hi> takes notice of eight things which make the fle≈øh plump and fat: The fir≈øt is, to be merry, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy content and ea≈øe of heart; the ≈øecond, to ≈øleep
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59975:156"/>
much; the third, to lie in a ≈øoft bed; the fourth, to fare well; the fifth, to be well furni≈øhed and apparelled; the ≈øixth, to ride much on hor≈øeback; the ≈øeventh, to have ones will, and not be cro≈ø≈øed in any thing; the eighth, to be much conver≈øant in all kind of Plays and pa≈øtimes, that yield contentment and delight. That this manner of life produceth the afore≈øaid effect, is mo≈øt true; but is likewi≈øe true, that it cau≈øeth the ≈øeed to be moi≈øt, and that the children engendred of that Seed, mu≈øt al≈øo abound with ≈øuperfluous moi≈øture, which both for the production of Wit, and the pre≈øervation of health, ought to be dried up; for as much as this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ≈øtifleth the operations of the rational ≈øoul, and al≈øo occa≈øioneth ≈øickne≈øs and ≈øhort life: So that it appears, that a good wit, and a ≈øound body, ari≈øe from one and the ≈øame quality, namely, dryne≈øs; whence it is to be ob≈øerved, that the ≈øame rules which we are to lay down for the making Children wi≈øe, will al≈øo be effectual for the making of them healthy and long lived.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, it behoveth for tho≈øe Children that are born of delicious Parents, who≈øe con≈øtitution mu≈øt therefore nece≈ø≈øarily con≈øi≈øt of more cold and moi≈øt than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, to be wa≈øhed as ≈øoon as they are born with hot ≈øalt water, which, according to the opinion of all Phy≈øitians, ≈øoaketh and drieth up the fle≈øh, ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Nerves, and by con≈øuming the ≈øuperfluous moi≈øture of the brain, increa≈øeth the wit, and freeth him from many dangerous Di≈øea≈øes; whereas a Bath of hot water that is fre≈øh, breeds (as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> affirmeth) five inconveniences; namely, the effeminating of the fle≈øh, weakne≈øs of the ≈øinews, dulne≈øs of the ≈øpirits, fluxes of the blood, and a nau≈øeating in the ≈øtomach: But tho≈øe that are born with exce≈ø≈øive dryne≈øs, are to be bathed in hot fre≈øh water, that the extremity of their temper may be corrected by a contrary quality. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59975:156"/>
why hot ≈øalt water is available for tho≈øe that are over moi≈øt, is, becau≈øe it ≈øtoppeth the pores of the skin, and of two extreams, it is more conducing to health to have a skin hard and ≈øomewhat clo≈øe, than thin and open.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øecond thing requi≈øite to be performed when the Child is new born, is to make him acquainted with the winds, and with change of air, and not to keep him lockt up in a Chamber, which much enfeebleth the ≈øtrength, and wa≈øteth the ≈øpirits; nothing being ≈øo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to a healthful kind of living, as to expo≈øe ones ≈øelf to all kind of winds and weathers, hot, moi≈øt, cold and dry; it is no wonder therefore that Shepherds of all men living enjoy the ≈øounde≈øt health, ≈øince they accu≈øtom them≈øelves to all the ≈øeveral qualities of the Air, and their nature is di≈ømayed at nothing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary we find that tho≈øe men that give them≈øelves to live deliciou≈øly, and to beware le≈øt the Sun, the Wind, the Evening, or the Cold, offend them, are within a ≈ømall time di≈øpatched with a Po≈øt-Letter to another World. So far were the ancient <hi>Germans</hi> from nicety in this point, that they u≈øe to dip their Children as ≈øoon as born, in a cold River.</p>
                     <p>The third thing nece≈ø≈øary to be performed, is to ≈øeek out a young Nur≈øe of temperature hot and dry, with which two qualities the much cold and moi≈øt will be corrected, which the Infant brought from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb; ≈øhe ≈øhould be innur'd to hardne≈øs and want, to lye on the bare ground, to eat little, and to go poorly clad in wet, drought, and heat, ≈øuch a one will yield a firm milk, as being acquainted with the alterations of the air, and the Child being brought up by her, will come to enjoy a great firmne≈øs of body. The cour≈øe then which is to be ob≈øerved with the Nur≈øe, is to take her into the Hou≈øe about four or five Months before the Childs birth, and to give her the ≈øame ≈øorts
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59975:157"/>
of meat to feed on, which the Mother u≈øeth to eat, that ≈øhe may have time to con≈øume the blood and bad humors, which ≈øhe hath gathered by the harmful meats ≈øhe u≈øed before, and al≈øo to the end that the Child may ≈øuck the like milk with that which relieved it in the Mothers belly, or at lea≈øt made of the ≈øame meats.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing requi≈øite to be ob≈øerved, is not to accu≈øtom the Child to ≈øleep in a ≈øoft bed, or to keep it over-warm in apparel, or give it too much meat, which are things that fatten and enlarge the Fle≈øh; whereas the re≈øtraint of them dimini≈øheth and dries it up, which drine≈øs increa≈øeth wit, and much availeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward long life, According to this Rule which I have pre≈øcribed, was He, who of all men living that ever the World had, was the wi≈øe≈øt brought up; for as ≈øoon as he was born, he began to be inur'd to cold and other alterations of the air; his fir≈øt bed was the Earth, his apparel coar≈øe; and a few days after, they went with him to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a place very hot, and the meat they gave him, was that which I have already mentioned to have been u≈øed by the ancient <hi>Greeks.</hi> Whereupon it is that the Prophet <hi>E≈øay</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>He ≈øhall eat butter and honey, that he may know to e≈øchew evil, and chu≈øe the good:</hi> For though he was very God, yet being al≈øo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man, he omitted not to make u≈øe of the ≈øame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural remedies as were u≈øed by the re≈øt of the ≈øons of men.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have ≈øhown what the qualities are, which the Brain ought to have, and what the ≈øub≈øtance; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proved according to the opinion of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> that drine≈øs maketh the wi≈øe≈øt ≈øoul; and that by age from the day of our birth, 'till that of our death, we ≈øtill acquire more and more dryne≈øs, and by con≈øequence more knowledge. We have al≈øo proved, that the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and delicate parts of the Brain are corrected by what we eat; for tho≈øe that always feed upon Beef and Pork, mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity have a Brain ≈øo gro≈øs and of ≈øuch evil

                     <p>As the u≈øe of the two Membranules that enwrap the Birth (whereof the fir≈øt is called <hi>Ambiens, Avicius, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, Aurela, Abcas, Abigas, Sela, Aligas,</hi> or the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature</hi> of the Conception; the latter <hi>Alanthoides, Bilis, A≈øcari, Secca, Involucrum</hi>) which hath been formerly delivered, is a thing of great con≈øequence, to be known and well con≈øidered; ≈øo likewi≈øe is the con≈øideration of the Umbilical Veins and Arteries a matter no le≈øs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.

eight days after, a certain ≈øanguinous matter drawn through the Navel, pa≈ø≈øeth all along through the whole Birth, and being pre-di≈øpo≈øed toward the formation of the members, fills up at that time the lineatures. The following days from the ninth to the fifteenth, this ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous juice is converted into Fle≈øh.

                     <head>CHAP. X. Whether there may be a mutation out of one Sex into another; and of Hermaphrodites.</head>
                     <p>BEfore any thing can be po≈øitively determined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this argument (≈øo much of uncertainty there is in it;) it will be convenient to recite what hath been delivered both as to the negative and the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, by Authors that have maintained each contrary opinion, <hi>Severinus Pinaeus,</hi> who holds the Negative, writes to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That the genital parts of both Sexes, are ≈øo unlike each other in ≈øub≈øtance much more in compo≈øition, ≈øituation figure, action, and u≈øe, that ≈øcarce any thing can be found more unlike, and by how much the more all other parts of the body (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Brea≈øts, which in women are more tumid, becau≈øe of their ≈øecondary u≈øe) have an exact re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; ≈øo much the more unlike are the genital parts of the one Sex, compared with tho≈øe of the other; and if their figure be thus different, much more is their u≈øe. True it is, indeed, that both are appointed for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but in a different manner; for women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the matter, but men the form: The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real appetite al≈øo proceeds from different cau≈øes; for in men it proceeds from a de≈øire of emi≈ø≈øion, in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from a de≈øire of repletion. In women al≈øo the chiefe≈øt of tho≈øe parts are concave, and apt to receive; but in men they are only porous, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ≈øolid.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe things con≈øidered, I cannot but wonder, ≈øaith he, how any one can imagine, that the Genital Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Female Birth ≈øhould be changed into tho≈øe that belong to Males; ≈øince by tho≈øe parts only the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59975:160"/>
and di≈øtinction of Sexes is made: Nor can I well impute the cau≈øe of this vulgar error to any thing, but a mi≈øtake of ≈øome not over-expert Midwives, who have been deceived by the evil conformation of the parts, which may have happened in ≈øome Male-births, to have had ≈øo ≈ømall a protru≈øion, as not to have been di≈øcerned; as appeared by the example of a Child Chri≈øtned at <hi>Paris,</hi> by the name of <hi>Joan,</hi> as if it had been a Girl, when as it proved afterwards a Boy: And on the contrary, the over-far exten≈øion of the Clitoris in female Births, may have occa≈øioned the like mi≈øtake. But notwith≈øtanding what hath been thus ≈øaid in the Negative, there have not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øome learned Phy≈øitians, who have firmly a≈ø≈øerted the affirmative part; of which number <hi>Galen</hi> him≈øelf is one. A man, ≈øaith he, is different from a woman in nothing el≈øe except in the having his genital mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers without his body: And this is certain, that if Nature having formed a man, would convert him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Woman, ≈øhe hath no other task to perform, but only to turn his genital members inward; and if a woman into a man, to do the contrary. And this, however held for a Fable, hath chanced many times in nature, as well while the Creature hath been in the Mothers Womb, as after the ≈øame hath been born: For divers times Nature hath made a Female Child, and ≈øhe hath ≈øo remained in her Mothers belly for the ≈øpace of one or two Months, and afterwards plenty of heat growing in the genital Members, upon ≈øome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion they have i≈ø≈øued forth, and the Child hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Male; but yet retaining ≈øome certain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtures unbefitting the Ma≈øculine Sex; as a ≈øhrill voice, womani≈øh actions, and the like. Contrariwi≈øe, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath often made a Male, and cold growing on, and turning the genitals inward, it hath become a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59975:160"/>
Female; yet ≈øtill retaining a manlike fa≈øhion, both in voice and ge≈øture.</p>
                     <p>Now to give an impartial judgment of the≈øe two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, I cannot but hold that the latter of them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a greater ≈øemblance of truth with it; for as to what <hi>Pinaeus</hi> affirms of the great difference of figure in the genital members of each, it will not be of ≈øo much force; if we con≈øider that the inver≈øion of them is that which chiefly occa≈øioneth this difference of form; the rea≈øon of which is evidently deduced from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natures of heat and cold; heat enlarging and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending all things, and cold retaining and clo≈øing them up.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the bu≈øine≈øs of Hermaphrodites, or tho≈øe that enjoy both Sexes in one per≈øon, many there are that will not afford any belief, or, at the lea≈øt, doubt whether or no there are any ≈øuch things in nature; but although there cannot be ≈øo apparent a rea≈øon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for this as for the mutation of Sexes; yet in this we may ≈øuffer our ≈øelves to be guided by the ≈øame <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium,</hi> as in the bu≈øine≈øs of Specters and Apparitions of Spirits; concerning which, although it hath puzled many learned men to find out, what ≈øhould be the true cau≈øes and rea≈øons, that ≈øuch things come to pa≈øs; yet it argues much indi≈øcretion not to give credit to them, both in regard Hi≈øtories have abounded with frequent examples of them in all ages; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo, con≈øidering the daily reports we have of ≈øuch things, both from the mouths and pens of ≈øerious and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it may be judged by ≈øome, to have been more decent that the≈øe things ≈øhould have been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Latin, than in the vulgar Tongue, that ≈øo the ≈øecrets of Nature might not have been pro≈øtituted to every unworthy Reader, that makes u≈øe of ≈øuch things,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59975:161"/>
only for a mockery, and a May-game, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote idle and la≈øcivious di≈øcour≈øe; yet fora≈ømuch as they are written for God's Glory, and the benefit and help of mankind, and intended only for the u≈øe of ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, pious, and di≈øcreet Matrons; and that the want of skill and knowledge in the≈øe mainly important Secrets, hath been the occa≈øion of very many mi≈øtakes, to the great mi≈øery oftentimes of Women in travail, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the poor Infant, the concealment of them had been much more inexcu≈øable, than the publi≈øhing can be.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the Year 1630. a young Lady whom I was wont to bring to bed, pa≈ø≈øing by my hou≈øe, came in to me, and told me, that ≈øhe was four Months gone, and that ≈øhe perceived the Infant to ≈øtir; about a Month after, ≈øhe came to ≈øee me, and told me that ≈øhe was in much pain, for that ≈øhe had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Infant to ≈øtir in two days, and that therefore ≈øhe believed that it was dead, by rea≈øon of a certain very great Fright which ≈øhe had had; for at the time that ≈øhe was frighted, ≈øhe perceived the Child to move, but after that never; and her belly began by little and little to wax le≈øs; and about three weeks after ≈øhe had that reflux of milk that Women u≈øe to have that lie in; when this was gone, ≈øhe had no grievance; yet ≈øeeing her often, and knowing her to be big with Child, ≈øhe asked me my advice, to know what ≈øhe ≈øhould do. Whereupon I asked her, if any ill vapours ro≈øe up into
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59975:180"/>
her mouth? ≈øhe told me no. If ≈øhe had not lo≈øt her appetite? ≈øhe an≈øwered, that ≈øhe never had a better in her life; her heart was light, her body in good temper, ≈øo that there was nothing that troubled her but an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion ≈øhe had, that the Child was dead: whereupon I made her try all means to make the Infant ≈øtir; but ≈øhe notwith≈øtanding felt nothing, only ≈øhe perceived that ≈øomething did heave a little upon the operation of the Remedies, which was nothing but the Matrix, which being now di≈øtempered and grown cold, did as it were an≈øwer the hot Remedies, te≈øtifying thereby ≈øome good which it received thereby. I advi≈øed her to be patient, and to wait Nature's lei≈øure, which is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough of it ≈øelf; telling her that I had ≈øeen an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant which had lain a long time in the womb without budging, which for all that was not dead, although you could not perceive in the woman any thing, but the ≈øigns of a dead Child. I had oftentimes brought the Lady to bed, and ≈øhe ≈øtill had very good Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and very ≈øound Children, of a good colour, ≈øo that I believing her to be of a ≈øound con≈øtitution, thought that if the Infant were dead, Nature, which was very ≈øtrong in her, would expel it in time convenient, and that ≈øhe ≈øhould not be forced, not having given any te≈øtimony of defect; re≈øolving al≈øo, when her Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was out, if then Nature ≈øhewed it ≈øelf weak, that we would con≈øult her Friends and Phy≈øicians. Many of her Friends told me, that they doubted that ≈øhe was deceived in thinking her ≈øelf to be with Child; to which I an≈øwered, that they might be confident that it was ≈øo. In brief, ≈øhe was brought to bed, ≈øixteen weeks after the fright which ≈øhe had. Now here ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth a great doubt, whether the Child died at the hour of her being ≈øcared, by rea≈øon that it did not move in all that time? A rea≈øon that the Child was not dead,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59975:180"/>
may be, becau≈øe that the Gentlewoman had not her milk till within three weeks after; and yet I cannot but think that it died at the ≈øame time; for certainly, by that fright the vital ≈øpirits were ravi≈øhed from it, and the blood of the Arteries retired to the heart of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not being di≈øtributed to the Infant, but at the good plea≈øure of Nature; the cour≈øe of which being ≈øtopped, it retired to its fir≈øt ≈øource, through which the Child ≈øuffering a ≈øuffocation, gave a violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and now, after the fright, was come to her ≈øelf, and that Nature would have returned to fini≈øh her work, ≈øhe was not deceived, becau≈øe the vital fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Infant were extinct; and, notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, the Mother not cea≈øing to re≈øtrain the men≈øtrual blood as ≈øhe was accu≈øtomed; that finding it ≈øelf ≈øtopped, and ≈øtill increa≈øing without that u≈øe made of it that was wont, it made a reflux to the Brea≈øts, which flowed down again in five or ≈øix days; for the Infant coming to decrea≈øe in the womb, now way was made for them, which came not down for all that, but in the Delivery and after; which was in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: At the end of the ≈øixteenth week after the fright, ≈øhe had pains in the night, ≈øhe thinking to endure them well enough 'till morning, in the morning cau≈øed me to be ≈øent for. I came to her, finding with her a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øician, and ≈øundry others of her acquaintance. The Phy≈øician that expected me, had ordered a Cly≈øter to give it her if I thought it to the purpo≈øe; I found her pale, cold, and yet in a ≈øweat, with ≈øo little pul≈øe, that I e≈øteemed her dead; I touched her, and found ≈øhe had been in Travail, which had been too long neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I called pre≈øently for a plain ≈øilver di≈øh, into which I ≈øqueez'd the juice of half a Citron, and ≈øet it upon a Chafing di≈øh of coals; being warmed, I cau≈øed her to take it; this re≈øtored Nature a little, and ≈øtirred up her
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59975:181"/>
pains, and then I a≈ø≈øi≈øted her; notwith≈øtanding ≈øome of the waters ran down: After her fir≈øt throw, the legs and thighs of the Child came forth: Now finding the Infant to be dead, and ≈øeeing that ≈øhe was troubled with no more throws, I was afraid of drawing it forth, for fear it might be rotten: I did give her a Cly≈øter without moving her, the force of which bringing the Child away, ≈øhe was delivered of a dead Infant, all over of a leaden colour, without any ill vapour; the Secondine ≈øound and fair as you ≈øhall ≈øee, her purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as clear as could be, and ≈øhe had as good and as happy a Lying in, as any woman in the World; all which time ≈øhe had not the appearance of any Milk at all. Hence we may admire the effects of Nature, which are wonderful! But in ≈øuch ca≈øes Women mu≈øt be ≈øure in due time and place; for if a Woman do re≈øi≈øt her pains, and doth not put her ≈øelf in a right po≈øture, ≈øhe runs a great hazard of her Life.</p>

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59975:181"/>
≈øo that the Infant was retired back again, which ≈øtifled the Mother, and provoked her vomiting. Upon which, I gave my advice, and though I thought my ≈øelf come a little too late, yet I re≈øolved to do what lay in the power of my Art; and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to give her a good ≈øtrong Cly≈øter to awaken Nature, and to bring the Infant lower, which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our hopes; afterwards to drink a ≈ømall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Rhubarb-water which ≈øtayed with her; a little after, I gave her the Yolk of an Egg, which ≈øtayed with her al≈øo, cau≈øing her to drink nothing but Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb-water; and at every hour's end, I gave her the Yolk of an Egg, which did al≈øo ≈øtay with her; by this time, Nature began to ≈øtrengthen it ≈øelf, and the pains of the Infant came again; and in le≈øs than two hours, after the Cly≈øter and other nouri≈øhment given, when I ≈øaw her pretty well, and that Nature ≈øtrove to expel the Infant, I gave her half a dram of Confection of <hi>Alkermes</hi> in a little Wine; and a little while after I cau≈øed her to take another Cly≈øter, into which I put a little <hi>Hiera,</hi> and a little <hi>Benedictum,</hi> which fini≈øhed the work; for ≈øhe was then delivered of a very lu≈øty Child, which lived about two days: I came thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout noon, and ≈øhe was brought to bed before nine at night.

                     <p>BEing called to a Woman in this Town, that thought her ≈øelf three months and a half gone, which is one of the Terms of time, wherein common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Moles and Fal≈øe-births are delivered; having
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59975:182"/>
then ≈øome lo≈øs of blood and pain, I was ≈øent for, and judged it to have been ≈øome imperfect Conception, and therefore I u≈øed all means to a≈ø≈øi≈øt her; yet could ≈øhe not expel it, for all the≈øe long pains: Whereupon finding ≈øome ≈øtrange apprehen≈øions in her, I wondered; for, in all the time of my Practice, I never knew ≈øuch a thing as that dangerous in my life. But I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found this apprehen≈øion to come from a certain accident that had happened to a Si≈øter of hers, who being with Child, carried it very well to the end of the ninth month; at the end of which ≈øhe began to be in pain, as if ≈øhe would have cried out: the pains were great and long, which they were not at all a≈øtoni≈øhed at, by rea≈øon that it was her fir≈øt Child, yet were not the≈øe pains accompanied with any ≈øigns of Labour, as, the opening the exterior orifice of the Womb: And they continued thus for the ≈øpace of two days and two nights. Many medicines were u≈øed to facilitate the birth, but to no purpo≈øe; and now ≈øhe felt not the Child ≈øtir any more. And now it was concluded, that ≈øhe had mi≈øtaken her time; and now being at re≈øt for four or five days, and growing weary of the City, ≈øhe went into the Country, and being returned without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice that ≈øhe had received any harm, ≈øhe was taken with the ≈øame pains as before, which continued a day and a night, and then cea≈øed as before. This was adjudged to be certain pains of the Colick; after this, ≈øhe endured one month longer in her former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate, which was now the eleventh month compleat; at the end of which ≈øhe felt ≈øome little pain like throws, which pre≈øently affected her heart; upon which ≈øhe was laid upon her bed, and they brought her Wine; but at the very in≈øtant ≈øhe died, without having any time to call for a≈ø≈øi≈øtance: Seeing her dead, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon the right ≈øide of her belly a very black

                     <head>Of the common opinion, that a Woman ≈øeven months gone, ought to walk very much; and of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that happen thereby.</head>
                     <p>IT is a common error among Midwives, which is not to be pa≈ø≈øed by, that a Woman with Child, when ≈øhe hath gone ≈øeven Months of her time, is to walk much: Upon a conceit that exerci≈øe is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for her; for that, they ≈øay, doth loo≈øen the Child from the reins, and facilitates the Birth. I confe≈øs, as to facilitating of the Birth, it may ≈øomething avail; only I mu≈øt add this al≈øo, that it is better to draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Child than to break it; and moreover it is better to be ≈øomething longer in Travail, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr two or three evils which ordinarily happen; the fir≈øt is, that the Child in the end of the ≈øeventh month, doth make certain endeavours to free it ≈øelf from the belly of the Mother; and without doubt his fir≈øt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is to turn him≈øelf in the belly of the Mother; for the Infant turns him≈øelf a good while before the time of Labour; and therefore, I ≈øay, Exerci≈øe is very dangerous: The fir≈øt rea≈øon is, becau≈øe by pu≈øhing downward the belly is dilated, and e≈øpecially in ≈øuch as carry their Children low; and be≈øides, oft times the head drags down all the body of the Womb, and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59975:183"/>
loo≈øens the ligaments in ≈øuch a ≈øort, that after Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very it can hardly be put into its place again. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, the Children having their heads between the bones of the Mother, by much walking of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they come to be brui≈øed, ≈øo that the Infants do many times dye, and no man is able to give a cau≈øe why; for the branches of veins which are for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment of the brain open in an in≈øtant, letting out the blood which is contained in them; and when the corruption is ingendered, there follows immediately Feavers, and corruption of the Infant: At other times, Women coming to ≈øit upon a hard ≈øeat, do brui≈øe the head of the Infant, which cau≈øes like accidents; and in all the≈øe accidents, none but the Midwife is to blame, unle≈øs the belly it ≈øelf be ≈øpoyled. This, they ≈øay, is the fault of the Nur≈øe, who did not apply remedies fit to re≈øtore the fault. I mu≈øt confe≈øs that remedies do much avail to the recovery of the afore≈øaid malady, and do much avail to the healing of that di≈øea≈øe; but, to re≈øtore it to ≈øuch an e≈øtate as it was in before, I ≈øay it is a thing impo≈ø≈øible for medicines to perform: For the skin which is once ≈øeparated, cannot be clo≈øed again without a ≈øcar. I would now not only blame tho≈øe that a≈ø≈øi≈øt them, but, by putting the actions of people before them, ≈øhew them where lies the fault, and what rea≈øon I have ≈øo to do: I mu≈øt confe≈øs that fal≈øe accu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have made the mo≈øt able Midwives timorous; for they lye liable to ≈øo many cau≈øes of detraction, that all that are either but indifferent good, or el≈øe not good, are all accu≈øed alike, if any thing fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øs with the Patient, as if they were the ab≈øolute cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of the evil, or that it lay ab≈øolutely in their power to hinder it. It happens al≈øo many times, that a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife worthy of that name, doth deliver a woman from death, and yet in the place of much prai≈øe, ≈øhe incurs
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59975:183"/>
many times much blame; ≈øo that they are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times con≈øtrained (to avoid the ≈øcandal) to adverti≈øe them of their ill procedures, and to give place to tho≈øe that know not how to do things with that ≈øweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and judgment. The fault is no where but in the ignorance, ≈øcandal, and ingratitude of Women toward tho≈øe of this Calling. Be≈øides, there are a company of young Women, that becau≈øe they have had one Child, do give them≈øelves a great deal of liberty to talk of the≈øe things. Cries one, I like not the≈øe Midwives that handle me; I will change mine, cries another, for that trick al≈øo; ≈øo that many out of a kind of fear have a greater de≈øire and will to be complacent than to do well; and ≈øo ≈øitting with their hands before them, entertain their Patients with di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe; who for all that feeling their pains, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained to thru≈øt forward, upon which the head of the Infant coming fir≈øt, for the mo≈øt part the womb ≈øerves for a <hi>Head-band,</hi> which comes forth before it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, might the Midwife be permitted to touch the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, they might put back the Womb, and prevent many accidents that happen in Lyings-in, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ≈øometimes to be a total relaxation of the <hi>Matrix</hi>; of which when the Women complain to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent and flattering Midwives, they reply; why, Mi≈øtre≈øs, you know I did not touch you; and be≈øides, I am not in fault if you have been touched: This is the fruit of their reproaches.

I excu≈øed the pa≈ø≈øion and impatience of friends, but I would not do any thing again≈øt my duty for complacency; a fault that is ≈øoon committed, but not ≈øo ea≈øily repented of; This Woman was pretty long, as mo≈øt Women are of their fir≈øt Children; in which time her husband, altogether impatient, and ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to doubt the report of the Midwives, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ≈øaid he, here is a Chirurgeon hard by, who may be ≈øent for to re≈øolve the doubt of the Midwives; he ≈øent for him ju≈øt about the hour that the Woman was to be brought to bed: The Chirurgeon when he came, ≈øaw that the Child was ready to come forth. The Midwives who had given way to the Chirurgeon, thinking to take their place again as ≈øoon as he had touched her, to make his report, were deceived; for he ≈øeeing the bu≈øine≈øs ready to be done, told her Husband that it was nece≈ø≈øary for him to operate, but that he would proceed with ≈øo much indu≈øtry, that he would not only bring forth a ≈øound and a lu≈øty child, but moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that he would render his wife al≈øo into a ≈øafe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Midwives when they would have ≈øpoken, were put to ≈øilence. The Gentlewoman was pre≈øently delivered, and he ≈øtayed but a little while to receive his reward: Thus the Midwives that had attended long, and all the while of the Travail, were di≈øpi≈øed, and put off; and the Chirurgeon extolled and prai≈øed, and well rewarded with ≈øeveral mo≈øt obliging and courteous invitations. About a year after, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained upon the former ≈øcore like a Prince; the hour of her Labour came again; and the Gentleman was gone to vi≈øit ≈øome of his friends, having ≈øuch a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Chirurgeon, that he ≈øet his mind at re≈øt for any danger. The Labour of this child was not like the Labour of the other child; for it came with the feet foremo≈øt; and when the whole body was come

forth, the head could not be got forth. He had brought with him no in≈øtruments, thinking that this Delivery would have been like the other; but ≈øeeing him≈øelf at a ≈øtand, he ≈øent to a Chirurgeon not far off for an I≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in the mean time, he ≈øent into the kitchen for a Ladle, with a hook at the end thereof, to draw forth the child. He drew it ≈øo well, that he drew away the life of the child: and without ≈øeeking any further for any body to ≈øaddle his hor≈øe, or bidding any body fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, he fled his wayes. This may be an in≈øtruction to tho≈øe that are ≈øo ready to entertain Mountebanks, and Empericks; than whom, there are no men more prodigal of the life of another for money.</p>

                     <p>I Was one day called to the Labour of a woman, which had good Deliveries of her Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, at their due time, although her Deliveries of Boys were always more difficult than tho≈øe of her Daughters; being come to her, I found her walking in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with her leggs bare, in a ≈øea≈øon that was not over-hot. I cau≈øed her to be put into her bed to warm her again, but ≈øhe would by no means endure it; although I prayed her, ≈øhe was angry with me, and told me, This was not the rule, to be con≈øtrained. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈øs and the Nur≈øe combined again≈øt me; the night approached; the waters being come down, I feared the ill ≈øucce≈øs of this bu≈øine≈øs, that her di≈øea≈øe would be irrecoverable by rea≈øon of her ≈øelf-will'dne≈øs. I de≈øired her husband to u≈øe his endeavour, but he could do no more with her than I: about midnight, I prayed her to go to bed again, and to warm her ≈øelf, and unle≈øs ≈øhe would do ≈øo, I could do nothing. She told me, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood nothing in re≈øpect of a certain Surgeon, who, when ≈øhe had ≈øuch a kind of Labour before, only toucht her with his finger, and delivered her; and that ≈øhe

would have him. I was content, and ≈øo ≈øhe ≈øent for him. He came very confidently, but his work was not at ≈øo ea≈øie a pa≈øs as formerly: he put a good large Table-Napkin before him, tru≈ø≈øing it up to his elbows, ≈øaying he was as able to deliver her as before. She would no more ≈øee me after his arrival: the Surgeon to whom I repre≈øented (after his arrival) all that I had under≈øtood and ≈øeen, and the fear which I had of her, told me that all would be well. At day break, a neighbour of mine calling me away, I de≈øired her Husband to let me go; but he was unwilling, unle≈øs I would promi≈øe to come again, which I did; and as ≈øoon as the door was open, one of the ≈øervants told me, another Midwife was ≈øent for. Her Husband de≈øired me again, that ≈øince the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon failed of his skill, I would u≈øe my skill; but it was too late, for the Chyrurgeon left them, and the Woman died.

                     <p>THere be two ≈øort of Nur≈øes which I have found: The one is of ≈øuch Women as are of an ill humor, or juice; which humors ≈øettle all in the milk, for that is the place where the≈øe fluxes di≈øcharge them≈øelves. The≈øe Women are in a better condition being Nur≈øes, than when they are not Nur≈øes; and being not Nur≈øes are ≈øubject to pains, ≈øometimes in the arms, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the ≈øhoulders, ≈øometimes in one of their legs or thighs; or el≈øe they are ≈øubject to the watring of the eyes, or ≈øwelling in the corner of the eye or no≈øe. The≈øe are good Nur≈øes, as long as Children are fat; but the fat is ≈øoft, and the Infants dull and ≈øotti≈øh, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no great ≈øigns of vivacity; coming to bear teeth, they are very ≈øickly, and do ordinarily die, by rea≈øon of the flux, that pu≈øheth out too great company of teeth at once. The Children that e≈øcape this, are more ill juic'd in their infancy, than are their Fathers and Mothers in their old Age. If the flux that afflicts them be ≈øalt, the milk is of a blacki≈øh and blewi≈øh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, if it be of Choler, it is more dangerous than the other, for that is more dangerous and venomous to the Children. There is another ≈øort of Nur≈øes more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than the≈øe I have now ≈øpoken of; who pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after they have Lain in (that is, three, or four, or five, or ≈øix months) are taken with their Purgations, a thing which never happens to good Nur≈øes: for this is the cour≈øe of Nature, that all the blood which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is dedicated to the nouri≈øhment of the Infant. This is cau≈øed by a moderate heat which is in their blood; and, to ≈øay true, as ≈øoon as ever this happens, the Infant mu≈øt be taken away, for they are more apt to conceive, than to nur≈øe; and if they continue Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59975:187"/>
they do but ruine the Children. This is but too much experimented, and I ≈øpeak this to ≈øave the lives of a great many Children, when ≈øeeing them ≈øuck I have di≈øcovered their want of milk; ≈øo that I may ≈øay, there dies a third part of the Children, for want of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care in this particular, which yet ≈øeem fat, and in good ca≈øe.</p>
                     <p>This is the cau≈øe of great Cholicks and windine≈ø≈øes in Children, which kills them in a moment; for the lea≈øt Feaver that takes them, carries them away. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides this, there are ≈øome who≈øe milk is ≈øo little, but withal ≈øo thick, that it ≈øticks upon the tongue, palate, and throat, which cau≈øes, as it were, a white canker, which is more and more heated by rea≈øon of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible drawing in vain; and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth all the throat, whereby they are hindred from ≈øucking. The≈øe Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes will milk after this, a drop or two out of their brea≈øts, crying, Look ye, the Child cares not for ≈øuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I never knew more abu≈øe in any thing, than in Nur≈øes: for let them make what excu≈øe they will, it is nothing but nece≈ø≈øity that reduceth them to be ≈øuch. Although the greate≈øt part do ≈øay, that it is to get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; yet when they have a Child, whether they have milk or no, yet they de≈øire not to part with it, no more than they do to drown them≈øelves; whereby the Parents are often deceived. And therefore the Mothers ought to have a great care, and to make it their bu≈øine≈øs to ≈øurprize the Nur≈øes at their own hou≈øes, that if there be any mi≈øcarriage, they may find it out. And indeed it is very rea≈øonable, that the cau≈øe of the≈øe poor creatures that cannot complain, ≈øhould not be neglected; and the≈øe She-murderers be made known, that they may not go unpuni≈øhed.</p>

                     <p>In the fir≈øt place therefore, I exhort thee to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and to leave nothing un≈øearched that may tend to the advantage of thy practice. And to this end, be always learning to the la≈øt day of thy life; which that thou maye≈øt not cea≈øe to do, be always humble; for tho≈øe that are proud and ob≈øtinate, never gain upon the hearts of tho≈øe that are knowing in ≈øecrets.

Be not negligent, but ≈øo increa≈øe thy Talent, that people may ≈øay, you are better than ever your Mother was: I mu≈øt tell thee, thou ha≈øt taken a matter of great importance into thy hand; and that in this Art there are two ways ea≈øie to take; the one to ≈øave thy credit, and the other to lo≈øe

it. Above all things, you mu≈øt beware (for any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure in the world) of adhering to one vice, ≈øuch as they are guilty of who give Remedies to cau≈øe Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for tho≈øe that do ill, and tho≈øe that ≈øeek a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable remedy, are wicked in a high degree. But it is a higher degree of wickedne≈øs for tho≈øe that are no way ingaged in the bu≈øine≈øs, for lucres ≈øake to kill both the body and ≈øoul of an Infant. This I do not ≈øpeak that thou ≈øhoulde≈øt refu≈øe to give Remedies upon ju≈øt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions: but to take heed how you be cheated by ≈øubtle per≈øons, who ≈øhall tell you fine ≈øtories of the di≈øea≈øes of their Wives, or Daughters, which they may ≈øay are very hone≈øt, hoping to get from you ≈øome Receipts to effect their wicked de≈øigns, ≈øend them to the Phy≈øici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for you may give them a lawful excu≈øe, in ≈øaying that ≈øuch matters do not belong to your charge.

to her in an hone≈øt place. You mu≈øt comfort her, if ≈øhe be afflicted, and put her in the right way, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her never to commit the like again; but to receive ≈øuch per≈øons into your hou≈øe, is but a means to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage evil: As the receivers of ≈øtollen goods are a means to encourage Thieves; even ≈øo, the Midwives that bring ≈øuch a ≈øtench to their hou≈øe, do a≈ø≈øi≈øt and abet the evil which they do, whil≈øt they know where to di≈øcharge them≈øelves of the like burthen again. At the fir≈øt when I took upon me this Calling, I took two into my hou≈øe, the one of Quality, the other of an ordinary condition; I ≈øaw them ≈øometimes in ≈øuch fits of de≈øpair, that I could hardly bring them out of them again. Tho≈øe from whom the evil came; upon who≈øe account I had received them, came now and then to ≈øee them, becau≈øe they brought them mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; I was continually fain to keep watch with them, for fear they ≈øhould do any evil in the hou≈øe: And I mu≈øt needs ≈øay, I had better have kept a herd of Swine. Such unre≈øts as the≈øe ought not to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brea≈øt of a Midwife; for, her mind ought to be free and at peace. Be≈øides that, a cu≈øtom of laying Women of an ill life, ≈øpoyls the reputation of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and oft times endangers the health al≈øo. To confirm which, I knew an hone≈øt under≈øtanding Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, that laid a Courtezan that ≈øeemed to ail nothing at all; but ≈øhe, having an inveterated Pox, gave it to the old Midwife upon her right hand, upon which there came a red <hi>Bubo</hi>; for all which, being unwilling to leave off her Calling, ≈øhe ≈øpoyled after that above thirty Hou≈øholds; for the Husbands got the Pox from their Wives, and the Children from their Mothers</p>
                     <p>Now let me tell thee, Daughter, that thou oughte≈øt not to take it ill to ≈øee the condition of Midwives de≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed; neither let this hinder thy Studies in the perfections of this Art, which are not to be comprehended by tho≈øe

that de≈øpi≈øe it. Neither be di≈ømayed if thou ≈øee≈øt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this condition, that do not de≈øerve to be; for this doth not at all dimini≈øh the honour of tho≈øe that are good: for it comes from hence to pa≈øs, becau≈øe they that receive them for mony, do as Stablers do, put the good and bad Hor≈øes together; the good Hor≈øes are in no danger to be hurt by the Jades, but the Jades are in hazard of being kickt and ≈øpoyled by the good Hor≈øes.</p>
                     <p>Never think of any think el≈øe but of doing well, and ≈øerving tho≈øe that ≈øhall call thee according to their own liking, if that which they de≈øire be not prejudicial to them, but if that which they de≈øire; be to their hurt, be ≈øure that thou di≈øcharge thy ≈øelf of them, and e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally excu≈øe thy ≈øelf to the a≈ø≈øi≈øtants, that thou may≈øt per≈øwade them to rea≈øon. A ≈øweet di≈øpo≈øition in a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife is much more commendable than a rigorous: the pain of Child-bearing is a very hard labour, which thou mu≈øt con≈øider, and accordingly conform thy ≈øelf to the humour of the Patient, knowing thy ≈øelf to be called to comfort and a≈ø≈øi≈øt her.</p>
                     <p>Mark well, entring into a hou≈øe, in what condition the Patient is; if the evil be at hand, you mu≈øt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage her, and prepare your ≈øelf with tho≈øe things that are nece≈ø≈øary; and fir≈øt you mu≈øt ≈øee that the Bed be well made for the woman that is to be brought to bed, and then to put on her a little ≈ømock, and wa≈øte-coat, and other linnen nece≈ø≈øary: And if ≈øhe be ≈øo opinionated, as that ≈øhe will not; tell her how much you do it for the better; and how great a pain it will be afterwards; content her though, <hi>for you mu≈øt make of a bad Market no more then you can.</hi> You ought to give order for things to be had from the Apothecaries with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent; or if ≈øhe be young, with the con≈øent of her friends. You mu≈øt take order al≈øo that ≈øome good broth be made for her to take, in the time of her Travail, if it ≈øhould chance to be long; and al≈øo two hours after her being
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59975:190"/>
brought to bed. Above all things I charge thee, that what ever bu≈øine≈øs thou mai≈øt have there, that thou go not about them too ha≈øtily. For there is nothing ≈øo nau≈øeous to be ≈øeen, as the improvident actions of over-bu≈øie women. Never be di≈ømayed if every thing go not well; for, fear di≈øorders the ≈øen≈øes; and a per≈øon that keeps her wits together, without ≈øuffering them to be ≈øcattered by fear, is capable of giving a≈ø≈øi≈øtance in weighty affairs, and e≈øpecially where things are done with lei≈øure; for in ≈øuch ca≈øes Nature helps marvellou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when we are mo≈øt at a ≈øtand. There is a great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of prudence, e≈øpecially in the age wherein we live. There is now no need of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> to render any thing good in it ≈øelf, bitter and di≈øagreeable to the ta≈øte. There are few Women now a days that do give that re≈øpect, or have that kindne≈øs for them as in former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; for then, when their Midwife died, they ≈øhewed a great deal of ≈øorrow, and prayed God that now they might have no more Children: which though it were not well done, yet it ≈øhewed their affection. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, Women u≈øe them as meer Hirelings.</p>
                     <p>There is a great deal of artifice to be u≈øed in the plea≈øing of our Women, e≈øpecially the young ones, who many times do make election of Men to bring them to bed. I blu≈øh to ≈øpeak of them, for I take it to be a great piece of impudence to have any recour≈øe unto them, unle≈øs it be in a ca≈øe of very great danger. I do approve it, I have approved it, and know that it ought to be done, ≈øo that it be concealed from the Woman all her life long; nor that ≈øhe ≈øee the Surgeon any more: for it is very inconvenient to Husbands, that (unle≈øs in ca≈øes of very great danger) ≈øuch things concerning their own Wives ≈øhould be communicated to any other men but them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>To this purpo≈øe ≈øhall I tell thee Daughter, that being called to the Labour of a Friend, where were none but
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59975:191"/>
2 or 3 of her acquaintance, they asked me what I thought of the Labour: to which I an≈øwered, that the Child did not come well, but that I would do the work with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of God, without danger to the Child, or to the Mother. They de≈øired me that I would let a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon ≈øee her: for their ≈øatisfaction, I con≈øented to it; provided that ≈øhe might not ≈øee him; for I was fearful, le≈øt ≈øhe ≈øhould die with apprehen≈øion and ≈øhame; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded her to ≈ølide down toward the feet of the bed, and darkned the Room on that ≈øide where he was to come; at the feet he touched her, and ≈øhe was brought to bed without any other a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, ≈øave that of God and Nature. Since the≈øe injuries have bin put in fa≈øhion, there have bin ob≈øerved greater hazards and dangers in lying in than before, which might be remedied by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons capable of their profe≈ø≈øion, if they might be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. But this Detraction is ≈øo much in reque≈øt, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ≈øome kind of people, there is much ado to make them believe the truth, and e≈øpecially where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get great advantage by ≈øo doing, and truly, Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable per≈øons which I have had the honour to ≈øerve, make other women ≈øeem mon≈øtrous to me. You ≈øhall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ≈øome hou≈øes, where there are certain per≈øons that hold ≈øuch fal≈øe lights to the Mi≈øtre≈øs of the Hou≈øe, that ≈øhe ≈øees quite contrary to that which is real; which per≈øons if they are not humoured, your bu≈øine≈øs will be there ≈øoon di≈øpatched. Take great heed of coming there, for it may chance to gain you nothing but a great deal of care. There are ≈øome Women that have no Children, at which they are very much troubled; which is ≈øo, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding that they might ea≈øily be helped, if they would tell an under≈øtanding Midwife where the defect lay.</p>
                     <p>As concerning tho≈øe, who are ≈øent for to lay Women in the Country, I mu≈øt ≈øay this, that as for tho≈øe that are not very well experimented, they may incur many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards by rea≈øon of their ignorance, and the multiplicity
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59975:191"/>
of accidents that may happen: And for tho≈øe that are knowing, to leave their Patients in the City, is a thing that may di≈øplea≈øe, and wrong many, and run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being no more entertained among them, to their own ruine; neither is there any certainty of a Woman that will run rambling into the Country. My la≈øt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is, that thou do well, and in ≈øo doing, fear nothing but God, that he may ble≈øs thee, and thy endeavours.</p>
