            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>M.

            <p>G. W. <hi>Thy Underſtanding being darkened, when Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was over thee, thou haſt gainſaid the Truth and People of the Lord; and I knew that that Light which thou oppoſedſt would riſe up in Judgment againſt thee: I have often with others laboured with thee, to bring thee to a Right Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>M.

            <p>G. W. [after ſome pauſe] <hi>I would have thee, if thou art able to ſpeak, to eaſe thy Conſcience as fully as thou canſt;</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97105:3"/>
               <hi>my Soul is affected to hear thee thus confeſs thy Evil, as the Lord hath given thee a Senſe of it; in Repentance, there is Mercy and Forgiveneſs; in Confeſſing &amp; Forſaking Sin, there is Mercy to be found with the Lord, who in the midſt of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remembers Mercy, that he may be feared.</hi> [The ſaid M.

            <p>
               <hi>M. Hide,</hi> I have DONE EVIL IN OPPOSING YOU IN YOUR PRAYERS; the Lord be merciful unto me; and as I havebeen an Inſtrument to turn many from God, the Lord raiſe up MANY INSTRUMENTS to turn many to him.</p>

O that you would conſider your lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End, and repent, you vain mortal Men; for you know not how ſoon that diſmal Trump may overtake any of you; <hi>Are ye ready? are ye prepared? have you the Wedding-garment? are you of them that have ſuffered with him, being dead and buried to Self-will, Pride, Envy, Revenge, and the Luſts of this ungodly World, and riſen with him in the Life, Glory and Rayment of the Reſurrection?</hi> If ſo, where are your Fruits? If you are not, (as ye are not I affirm
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97105:5"/>
in God's Name) then where's your Authority for theſe Evil Fruits you bring forth, <hi>ſcoffing, mocking, jangling, diſturbing and bawling againſt us, ſtirring up the Scum of the Multitude to abuſe us:</hi> Conſider before it be too late who is your Maſter in all theſe Things, and whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants you are, in whoſe Name and Errand you go, and what Spirit ſets you thus to work againſt ſo glorious a Principle, and ſo harmleſs a People, that not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with <hi>lifeleſs Worſhips, human Faiths,</hi> and <hi>meer tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Religions,</hi> cry to the God of Heaven to appear and operate in their Hearts, and teach them by his own holy Spirit, to be his Diſciples and Children, according to his Promiſe, yea, though it croſs the World's <hi>Life, Spirit, Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Faſhions;</hi> and therefore cannot lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſerve God in the <hi>Oldneſs of the Letter,</hi> by meer Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or after the Manner of the looſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of this World, only with outſide Performances, but in the <hi>Newneſs of the Spirit,</hi> in the <hi>Immediate Leadings and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. though they were never ſo much made a Reproach and By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, and be encompaſſed about with Loſs and Danger; I ſay, have a Care of reſiſting, reviling and diſturbing theſe poor People, theſe <hi>Believers,</hi> theſe <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors,</hi> theſe <hi>Followers</hi> and <hi>Children of the Light of Jeſus,</hi> begotten again of the everlaſting Day of Righteouſneſs, <hi>leſt you treaſure up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the righteous fierce Judgments of God, and your Portion be appointed you in that Day with the Workers of Iniquity forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as I warn you to forſake your vain, frothy, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and contentious Courſes; <hi>ſo do I exhort you in God's Fear to unfeigned Repentance, and invite you in Love to the</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97105:5"/>
               <hi>true Peace of Conſcience, even that Conſcience which is ſprinckled from Unbelief, Hatred, Malice and all Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is only obtained by an humble and ſincere walking in the Light of the Son of God,</hi> as 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. taking heed to, and not deſpiſing this holy and ſpiritual Appearance of <hi>Chriſt within,</hi> to dethrone <hi>Satan,</hi> and deſtroy Sin, and to bring in his own everlaſting Righteouſneſs, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom they only knew after the Fleſh, crying out, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son? this Fellow; and if thou art the Chriſt, or Son of God, ſhow us a Sign, and tell who ſmites thee, and come off from the Croſs, and ſave thy ſelf:</hi> I ſay, cavil not thus at the Light of Chriſt in your Conſciences, deſpiſe not his Sufficiency with your carnal Mind, neither turn his Grace, Mercy and Forbearance into a prophane Preſumption and bold tempting of the living God; for then very woful will your End be; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, read, ponder and meditate on the latter End of this poor Man! let his Caſe be both a <hi>VVarning</hi> and <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation</hi> to all that oppoſe the <hi>Light of Chriſt within,</hi> and <hi>the Children of it,</hi> that you may conſider your latter End, find Mercy and be ſaved; when I read the Narrative of his dying Condition, Oh my Heart was much broken before the Lord, and I could not but reverently magnifie his glorious Power, Mercy and Truth, that had wrought ſo ſtrange, ſo great, and ſo bleſſed a Work for his Names Defence, his Peoples Vindication, and I hope, for the poor Man's Soul too; O let him have the Glory forever; for who is like unto him in Heaven or in Earth, whoſe Goings are in the Deep, and whoſe Wayes are paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, but in his own time.</p>
            <p>And truly Pity roſe in my Soul towards all you whoſe Day is not over, &amp; a ſecret ſtrong Groan to God, that you might all ſee your Folly, and repent before you go hence and be no more ſeen.</p>

This Man I have known many Years, being One that he hath often oppoſed in publick Meetings; his main Stroak was againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt, the true Light, in lighting every Man that comes into the World, with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and ſaving Light;</hi> the Sufficiency and Univerſality of this to Salvation, he conſtantly and reſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, not furiouſly, madly and frothily, like outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mockers, as ſome ſtill too evidently and frequently ſhew themſelves againſt us, but with great external Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and Gravity, as well as Zeal, reaſoning after his Manner, and not bawling againſt us; <hi>nor was his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſcandalous,</hi> but honeſt and exemplary in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things towards Men, for ought that I ever heard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Inquiry: So that his preſent <hi>Convictions,</hi> as they were not the effect of any affrighting Diſcourſe, Inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations or Beſetments of ours in his Sickneſs, neither could they be interpreted to be any Trouble for a <hi>diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> Life, in which he might be thought to condemn himſelf <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>confuſedly,</hi> nor yet did his <hi>Remorſe</hi> only ariſe from the Way of his Opppoſing us, as if he ſtill retain'd his Judgment; but the very Ground of the whole Trouble, and Exerciſe of Spirit, for which he was willing to ſee any of us, and utter the foregoing pathetical Expreſſions, <hi>was his gainſaying us, the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Quakers, <hi>in the Way of our Faith and Worſhip,</hi> and ſo much his own Words teſtifie. Let all take heed of the <hi>reviling Thief</hi>'s State upon the Croſs, leaſt they enter not into the Paradiſe of God forever.</p>
            <p>And now, my dearly beloved Friends and Brethren, who have hearkned to the holy Reproofs of this inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Light of Jeſus in the Conſcience, and by it been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the Wickedneſs of this World, and taught
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97105:6"/>
in deep and heavenly things, and made through your cheerful Obedience, to partake in meaſure of the great Salvation of God, though it hath been through very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bitter Exerciſes, and deep Tribulations of Body and Spirit. O! what Cauſe have you to keep Covenant with the Lord, to abide in your heavenly Habitation, in <hi>a living faith, ſtedfaſt hope and conſtant Patience to the End,</hi> caſting your Care upon him, and commiting your Cauſe and Concerns to him, who is not only able, but willing and ready to ſuccour you, and maintain the Glory of his own famous honourable Name, deeply concern'd in you. O! let us dwell with him for ever, that his holy Spirit may more &amp; more enliven us, his Power ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us, and his great Wiſdom conduct us through the Work of our Day: 'Tis true <hi>That many are the Troubles of the Righteous,</hi> but bleſſed be our God forever, <hi>he will as certainly deliver out of them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though we want not the Evidence of his holy Spirit, that his own right Arm gathered us, and that we are his People bought by his Blood, redeemed by his Power, and made partakers of his divine Life; yet it ought to be no ſmall Evidence of the Lord's goodneſs; and therefore, both matter of Comfort and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, that he hath conſtrained a Teſtimony to his own bleſſed <hi>Light within,</hi> and us his poor diſpiſed People (that have believed in it, and above all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Earth, contended and Suffered for it) out of the Mouth of an old and conſtant Oppoſer of both, and that upon his dying Bed too, when no fears nor Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, no gains nor Temptations from men juſtly can be thought to have prevail'd upon him: But the powerful Workings only of that very Light he had ſo long reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97105:7"/>
this ſmit him in ſecret; this made his dying bed unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, &amp; proved its own ſufficiency upon him, by awakening his Conſcience opening his U<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>derſtanding, breaking his Heart, &amp; drawing very plain, tender &amp; ſincere Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his Mouth; O bleſſed be the Name of our God forever! who is a God, Glorious in Holineſs, fearful in praiſes, working Wonders for them that commit their cauſe to him.</p>
            <p>And whatever were his Provocations to us, I can ſay it, in the fear of God, my Heart was much more filled with Pity then diſpleaſure towards him, and this very repentance is both an effectual Anſwer of my Prayers, and a plain Accompliſhment of my Prophecy, with ſome more of my Brethren; for as I often earneſtly and more then ordinarily, of late deſired of the Lord, this poor Man's Convincement and Repentance, and that with an unuſual tenderneſs of Spirit, even when he was ſtrong in his Gain-ſaying; ſo have I frequently told him, in the Name of God, and preſence of many People, at our Meetings, (when he came on purpoſe to withſtand us) that God would plead with him, by his righteous Judgments; and that the time would come, he ſhould be forc'ſt to confeſs to the ſufficiency of that Light, he then oppoſed; and to acknowledge that God was with us, of a Truth, all which bleſſed be the Name of the Lord is fulfilled, by the Foregoing <hi>Nara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> where he confeſſeth himſelf a <hi>Saul,</hi> deſires forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, teſtifies to us, that we are the Lord's People, and prayes for our increaſe. Thus hath our God vindicated his glorious Name.</p>
            <p>Nor do I inſiſt on this ſo much, as if we had been hitherto barren of the like inſtances that might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97105:7"/>
us; for a great Volume would not contain what we could ſay of the <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>Dying</hi> Teſtimonies given by great and harſh Oppoſſers to this bleſſed Way of God we are turned unto: But foraſmuch as <hi>this</hi> Man was ſo lately, and ſo publickly a Gainſayer, and ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known of thoſe that frequent our Meetings to have been ſuch; And for that it was his own deſire as well as that the Caſe is extraordinary, and that the Lords Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and many mens Souls are concerned; Therefore is this publiſhed: And I pray God, with my whole Soul and Spirit, that it may be a Warning to all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, of what ſort ſoever, That they gainſay not themſelves into eternal Deſtruction (for none of their Weapons ſhall ever proſper, the Lord hath ſaid it,) But that they may turn unto the Light of Jeſus in their own Hearts, and follow the Reproofs and Inſtructions of it, <hi>whoſe Ways are Ways of Purity, and all his Paths are Peace;</hi> for he viſits the Creature, to lead out of Sin, which is the only cauſe of trouble: And my deſire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that we who have believed therein may keep Covenant, ſtand our Ground, and not again turn into folly. O! have a care of a ſlothfull Mind, that which can ſit at home and cenſure, but is not diligent in the work of the Lord; Let us go on and preſs forward, towards the Glorious Recompence, and this keeps in the univerſal Spirit, out of murmurings and grudgings, and herein ſhall we proſper and be preſerved forever; and let this be the Godly uſe we make of this great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation which the Lord hath now eminently laid upon us, to watch and perſevere that we may hold out to the end, and give no juſt occaſion to any to ſpeak evilly of this Bleſſed Way of the Lord that hath ſo ſignally been
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97105:8"/>
born witneſs to, even by ſuch as have ſpoken evilly of it when they come to Dye; As this Narrative (though briefly, yet fully) proves.</p>
            <p>And as to the Perſecution that now threatens, you know this, it comes all from the ſame Root, and he that drew a Teſtimony from this Oppoſer (and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as he confeſſeth he was) will in due time give wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his holy Way, and you his People; from the Conſciences of your Perſecutors, as you know full-well he hath frequently done in divers places of this Nation; therefore never heed it, neither be ye moved at it, but be of good cheer, for the ſhout of an Immortal King is amongſt us, who is the only <hi>Sacred Majeſty, dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, King, Prince</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and no mortal Man whatever; for he only can be Lord of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience who is <hi>greater</hi> then Conſcience, and <hi>Author</hi> of Conſcience; but that, no man is, becauſe Conſcience is the chiefeſt part that conſtitutes that man, therefore no man can be Lord of Conſcience; And be it known to all Powers on Earth it is this great Lord that hath reacht to your Souls, even <hi>Iſraels</hi> God; wherefore keep you with him, hearken to his holy Voice, and obey it diligently unto all Holineſs, and all ſhall go well with you in the end; <hi>Say unto the Righteous, it ſhall go well with them; but ſay unto the Wicked, it ſhall go ill with them;</hi> this God gave his Prophet in charge of old; and it ſtands true to our Day, and ſhall while a good and a bad Man live upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>You know, my Brethren, in whom you have believed, and have good Experience of his Power and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Call to mind his noble Acts, and valiant Deeds, his great Salvation in all Ages; how ſure, how ready,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97105:8"/>
how willing and how able he hath been to deliver our Anceſtors, and you know he is the ſame now at this Day, truſt there forever; for he is greater in you, then he that is in the World, and I know aſſuredly that all theſe Things ſhall work together for good, to them that keep in the Faith, <hi>The royal Faith, the victorious Faith, that Faith that ſtands all Tryals, and ſurmounts all Temptations, and through patient ſuffering triumphs over Rage, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the Grave: 'Tis this exceeding precious Faith, that makes the good Chriſtian, the good Man, the good Subject, and keeps Man's Conſcience void of Offence towards God and all Men;</hi> and as we keep it, of Right may we ſay, <hi>The Lord is our Light, whom ſhould we fear; The Lord is the Strength of our Life, of whom ſhould we be afraid?</hi> O! thoſe that flee before <hi>Informers,</hi> and run at the Sight of <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters</hi> (yea, though an Army of them) either never had or have departed from this <hi>Noble Faith,</hi> which is pure Confidence in God, and intire Reſignation to his divine Will; come what will come, Chriſt will not have one Coward in his ſpiritual Army: <hi>Fear not what man can do unto you,</hi> was a great Part of his Inſtruction to his Diſciples, the Pilgrim Preachers of his holy Goſpel to the World; but Conſulters with Fleſh and Blood, thoſe that uſe baſe Stratagems to ſave themſelves, that will not abide the Day, but ſlink from the ſhock of Sufferings, and hide in ſtormy times, they betray God's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Conſcience's Liberty, fling up the Cauſe, and bring a Spot upon conſcientious Separation; ſuch ſhall become an Abhorrence and utter Deteſtation in the Sight of the pure jealous God, and all good People.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, I hope that few or none of theſe will be found amongſt us; howbeit, theſe things may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97105:9"/>
for a winnowing, that many may be proved, that ſo their Integrity may be the better manifeſted; for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, holy and ſelf-denying people God will have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himſelf in: Bleſſed are they whoſe God is the Lord, and whoſe Truſt is in him forever; for they ſhall never be moved; into his bleſſed Care and Protection, with my ſelf, do I commit you all; and the Lord of Heaven and Earth preſerve us all in his holy Fear, Love and Patience to the End, <hi>Amen.</hi>
