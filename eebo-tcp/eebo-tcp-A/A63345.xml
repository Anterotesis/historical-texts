         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True
ACCOUNT
of the Taking of
Mr. CASTEERS, at TENDERTON in KENT,
And
Mr. LOBB, in ESSEX.</head>
            <head type="sub">Two Non-Conformiſt-Miniſters
Mention'd in His
Majeſties Declaration, &amp;c.
For Conſpiring the Death of the King, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Saints have been a long time looking for a Change, they
have been Preaching Woe and Judgments to the People, and
now it is come with a Witneſs. Beware of Popery, ſays <hi>Lobb;</hi>
the <hi>Phyliſtins</hi> are upon us, ſays <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and the Day of
Judgment is at hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſure it muſt be a Terrible Day for the Saints,
when they call for the Mountains and the Hills to cover them, and for
all their Innocence and Sanctification, none dare ſtand the Teſt of, <hi>Come
ye Bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sure theſe Sanctified Pretenders, for all their Aſſurance of Election,
are but meer <hi>Saduces,</hi> and can believe no Reſurrection in the next World,
that are ſo forward for an Inſurrection in this.</p>
            <p>But what is meant in the Stile of the Covenant, by Inſurrection, this
is but a Scandalous Epethite of the Abuſive Torys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to put the worſt of
Names upon the beſt Deſigns. In the Language of the Saints, this is
call'd no more then a Reformation. And Raiſing of Arms, no more,
then putting on the Helmet of Righteouſneſs for the Holy-Cauſe. In
which Sence, the higheſt of Treaſons is but Miſpriſion at beſt.</p>
            <p>Now if this Fallacy wou'd paſs upon <hi>Jack Ketch,</hi> as eaſily as it does
upon the Brethren, they wou'd ſwallow Halters, as faſt as they do Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
after a Treaſon-Lecture, and wou'd run the hazard of the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſo they cou'd paſs the Sentence of the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They flie from this, vainly hoping to eſcape the other, but Fears,
Doubts and Jealouſies, their old Friends, purſue them, and Guilt, more
terrible then Death it ſelf, follows the Bloody Regicide where e're he
goes, and for all their private Lurkings in ſecret Corners, Juſtice at laſt
finds them out, and brings the Traytor to his Juſt Reward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42362:2"/>
Thus that Arch Traytor, and Incendiary <hi>Caſteers,</hi> took his Refuge
at <hi>Tenderton,</hi> in the Wilds of <hi>Kent.</hi> Indeed his Brutal Deſigns, and
Bloodly Practices, Render'd him rather a Companion for <hi>Savage Beaſts,</hi>
then Men, and the Deſarts fitter for him, then Holy-ground to Tread
on, and <hi>Paddinton</hi> fitter then either.</p>
            <p>Having here found out a Place fit for his Reception at one <hi>Curtis</hi> his
Houſe, (one that valu'd the Life of a Brother, above the Safety of his
King, and had rather Conceal a Traytor, then Diſcover the Treaſon,)
he took up Sanctuary here, where the Mayor of <hi>Tenderton,</hi> and Coll.
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> coming to ſearch for Arms in his Houſe, as a Man Diſſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Government, they found the ſaid <hi>Caſteers</hi> in Bed, where he
lay in a very Violent Swet, without the help of a <hi>Bagnion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or <hi>Methre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,</hi>
finding him a Stranger, and in this Pickle of his own Souſe, they
asked him from whence he came, he anſwered faintly (by Reaſon of his
Swet) from <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and that Drinking the Waters there for a Time,
had thrown him into that Violent Fit. Then they Demanded his Name,
He told them, with ſome Hiſitation, his Name was <hi>William Swan.</hi> The
Reaſon that this Name came into his Mind, ſooner then any other, was,
that a little before he had been ſinging a <hi>Pſalm</hi> of Thanks-giving to his
Land-Lord, for his Deliverance, which (upon this Surprize, might be
the laſt before his Death) put him in Mind of the <hi>Swan.</hi> But his Tongue
Betraying him, and they finding by his Dialect, that he was a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi>
they asked him, if he knew Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> who anſwered, he did
very well, and that he was related to his Wife, but ſaid, he had not ſeen
him lately, he ſaid the ſame of Mr. <hi>Lobb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and being asked of the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
of the Arch-Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> He ſeem'd to Juſtifie it as a
Lawful Act. Then they asked him, what Country-Man he was, he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he was a <hi>Scotch-Man,</hi> and ſaid, he was Born in <hi>Cumberland.</hi> They
then asked him, whither he had been of any Univerſity, and of what
Foundation; he ſaid, he was of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but cou'd give no farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it.</p>
            <p>Finding him to waver in his Anſwers, and a <hi>Cargalike</hi> in his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
he was ſecured and carried to <hi>Tenderton</hi> that Night. Next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Examin'd upon the ſame particulars, he was ſo different from what he
had ſaid the Night before, that he had forgot his very Name, calling
himſelf now by the Name of <hi>William Moore,</hi> for to this black Devil, his
white <hi>Swan</hi> was Metamorphoſed in a Nights Time. At laſt applying
himſelf to Coll. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to ſpeak in his Behalf, he confeſſed himſelf to
be <hi>Caſteers</hi> upon which the Mayor and Officers ſet a ſtrong Guard on him,
and ſent him to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where being Examin'd before the Secretary,
he is Committed to the Cuſtody of the Meſſengers. We are ſince aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> another <hi>Non-Con-Blunderbus,</hi> is taken, by a Worthy
and Loyal, Gentleman, Captain <hi>Henry Goreing,</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and that the
Lord <hi>Grey</hi> is Secur'd at <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
