            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF THE Proceedings against the Pyrates, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>CAptain <hi>George Cusacke,</hi> sometimes called <hi>Dixon,</hi> and at other times <hi>Smith,</hi> with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Confederates have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained above six months Prisoners in the <hi>Marshalses</hi> in order to their Tryal, which at last was appointed to be on Thursday the seventh of <hi>Ian.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, at Justice-Hall in the <hi>Old-Bayley,</hi> as a place most convenient for that purpose; But this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain being it seems conscious of his own Merits, and apprehensive of the danger, on the Munday before in the Night time broke Prison, getting first down a Chimney into a lower Chamber, and then by a rope into a Garden, and so cleverly made his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, and could not be heard of till this very Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, just as the Court was going to sit; at which time diligent inquiry having been made all ways, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards promised for his Discovery; News came that there was notice of him at a certain House towards the upper end of <hi>Holbourn,</hi> where immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was taken in bed with a Woman, who was brought along with him forth with to the <hi>Old-Bayley,</hi> and was by some reported to be his Sister; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prisoners were brought over the Water with a strong guard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60346:3"/>The Court was held by special commission of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and Goal-Delivery, directed to Honourable persons of the Court of Admiralty, and several of his Majesties Justices of the Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> &amp;c. A silver Oar was born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge of the Admiralty, and three Anchors put up on a cloath above the Kings Arms, over the Bench.</p>
            <p>The Judge after the Commission read gave his charge to the grand Inquest in an excellent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, acquainting th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m with his Majesties right of Soveraignity over the Brittish Seas even to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shores of his Neighbours; that they have always been accounted the royal Chambers of our <hi>English</hi> Monarchs, whose Jurisdiction extends to punish all outrages, violencies, and offences whatsoever committed thereupon by any persons whether his Subjects or strangers upon Ships, persons, or goods of our own Nation, or others in Amity with us; Then he shewed the heiniousness of the crime of Pyracy, that it was against the Law of Nations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to commerce, and therefore particularly branded by our English Laws by being excepted out of the benefit of Clergy, allowed in other cases, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the offences he had to give them in charge as the subjects of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir enquiry at this time into things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the statute Law, and things contrary to th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> laws customes and usages of the Admiralty, on each of which he particularly enlarged, and amongst other things declared the Ceremony of the Flag to be our Kings indubitable right, whereby al Ships whatsoever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60346:3"/>
in those Seas are bound to strike to those of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties wherever they meet them, and that all that refuse so to do are severely punishable by the Laws and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of the Admiralty, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Immediately after this, six prisoners were brought to the Bar: <hi>viz. George Cusack, William Coundon, Gerrard Stack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Simon Harker, Henry Lovewell,</hi> and <hi>VVilliam Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingwood</hi>; who were indicted for that on the third Day of <hi>Iuly</hi> last past they Pyratically and feloniously did set upon a Ship call'd the <hi>Robert</hi> near a place call'd the <hi>Fly</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Holland,</hi> and by another indictment that they had feloniously stoln several goods out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ship, whose names to the <hi>Iurors</hi> was unknown. To both these Indictments they pleaded not guilty: But upon the Evidence the case appeared to be in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Crusacke</hi> and others of his company, having a design to rob this ship, and understanding the Master wanted Seamen, set two of their Confederates to offer their service to him, where they were entertained, and at last betray'd the ship into his hands, which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away, &amp;c. The Captain at first took some excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Jury not for any prejudice against any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men of them, but because they were Citizens, who did not, he said, understand Marine affairs, and that it was necessary Sea Captains and Masters of ships should have been empannel'd, upon which oca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he cryed out. We will be try'd my Lord by men of our own Trade. Which being understood in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sence made not only the Audience, but his fellow Prisoners to laugh heartily; But being over ruled in this, he next insisted on a Commission from the French King, which was read, but was found to be directed to another person; but he alledged it was his Kinsman,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60346:4"/>
who had the grant of a Commission at the same time, and that by mistake the Commissions were changed, and so his Kinsmans Commission sent to him from <hi>Calice</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where he paid a summ of money for it to the <hi>French</hi> resident, and that he not being able to read French could not perceive the error, but acted by it, not doubting but it had been his own, and that this Ship the <hi>Robert</hi> was never made any free ship of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but the owners were Dutch, and liv'd in <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and that they hop'd the Court would all<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w of his Commission, the Court told him the Commission was nothing worth, for if it had been directed to him (as it was not) there yet was no power given him thereby to seize ships of <hi>England</hi> as this was proved to be; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides they askt how he durst take a Comission from any forraign Prince directly contrary to the late trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and his Majesties Proclamation. To which he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his Commission bore date before that procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and besides insisted that whereas by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment he was charged with an offence committed <hi>Super altum Mare</hi> upon the Sea, this Ship was taken in one of the Dutch ports, and so not appertaining to the Jurisdiction of the English Admiralty, but this the witnesses refuted proving she was taken three Leagues out at Sea off from the <hi>Fly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This having taken up some time in debate, and all heard that the Prisoners could offer. Three more were brought to the Bar, viz. <hi>Michael Fitz-Gerrard, Morice Fitz-Gerrard,</hi> and <hi>Daniel Cokry,</hi> who together with the six others before named were afresh indicted on Two other indictments for taking Pyratically a Ship called the <hi>Ann</hi> laden with Deals from <hi>Norway,</hi> and man'd by <hi>Danes</hi> the Ship valued at six hundred pound the lading

            <p>This Mr. <hi>Cusacke,</hi> appeared to be a person of a clear courage, and good understanding: he pleaded very well for his life, but the matter was too foul to be wash't off with good words.</p>
            <p>There was likewise one Capt. <hi>Dela Mare</hi> of <hi>Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi> with <hi>Iohn King,</hi> and <hi>William Kendal,</hi> tryed for robbing a Scotch ship called the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> off of <hi>Harwich,</hi> and stealing several summs of Money and Goods, the Capt. shewed a <hi>French</hi> Commission, and that being at Sea in want of some Cordage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, he went on board this ship, and took some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, promising to pay for them, but as for Money he knew nothing of it, but told the Master at that time when he complained, that if he could find who had it, it should be restored. However, plain proof came in, that saw <hi>King</hi> take it out of the Chest, so he only was found <hi>Guilty,</hi> and the other two <hi>Acquitted</hi>

They had all the favour that was possible shewn them in their Tryal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they were strangers, an Interpreter was allow<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Five Young men were Indicted for a Riot and Rescue on the Sea, of which they acknowledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>guilty,</hi> and were fined 5<hi>l</hi>: a piece.</p>

               <hi>The court having withdrawn about an hour, returned to give Iudgement, which was performect in most grave and solid speeches, seting forth the nature and aggravations of their crimes, and ad<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Capt.</hi> Cusacke <hi>presented a petition, wherein he begged his life very pathetically, recounting his former services, and offering himself to the service of his Majesties gallies at</hi> Tangier, <hi>till by his future good demeanour and services he might wash off the stanes of his late ill actions, &amp;c. Most of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers presented petitions also, desiring mercy and favour of the court, who proceeded to give Iudgement. VVhich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Captain</hi> Cusacke <hi>and the seven others before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to be convicted for pyracy and Robbery was. That they should be hang'd till they were dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Ostenders,</hi> the Captain was fined four hundred sterling, and the other two fifty pound a piece; for their contempt. The Court declaring his Majesties extraordinary favour in this proceeding, since by contumelious speeches, and taking one of our ships they had justly merited capital punishment, and might have been prosecuted accordingly.</p>
