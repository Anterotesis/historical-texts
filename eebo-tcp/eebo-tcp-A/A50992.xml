            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>For Riches, when consider'd, are but Cares,</l>

               <l>In vain, alas! we build our <hi>Babel</hi> high;</l>

               </l>
               <l>As Life to Death inevitably flows,</l>
               <l>So all our Knowledge terminates in Woes.</l>
               <l>Well then—upon the whole what do we see</l>
               <l>Beneath the Cope of Heav'n, but <hi>Vanity?</hi>

               <l>In <hi>British</hi> Numbers (that abruptly flow</l>
               <l>As <hi>Albion</hi>'s Streams down craggy Mountains do)</l>
               <l>Lo, I attempt. And thou propitious <hi>Muse,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That did'st the wond'rous Secret first infuse</l>
               <l>Into his Breast, vouchsafe now to inspire</l>
               <l>My youthful Song with the same heav'nly Fire.</l>
               <l>Say what may tame the impetuous force of <hi>Love;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What pow'rful Charm the smiling <hi>Ill</hi> remove.</l>
               <l>Say how the Captive <hi>Youth</hi> himself may free,</l>
               <l>And dying <hi>Maid</hi> regain her Liberty;</l>
               <l>Or how th' untainted, e'er it be too late,</l>
               <l>May arm himself against a Lover's fate.</l>
               <l>But now, methinks, the <hi>fair Ones</hi> of our Isle</l>
               <l>Mock my vain Labour with a scornful Smile.</l>
               <l>'Tis true indeed, such pow'rful Charms they have,</l>
               <l>As wou'd the most averse to Love inslave;</l>
               <l>Make the cold <hi>Hermit</hi> glow with inward Fire,</l>
               <l>And in his Cell transporting Joys desire.</l>
               <l>More finish'd Beauties never were design'd</l>

               <l>Or take from Beauty all its promis'd Joy:</l>
               <l>I only wou'd suppress its Tyranny,</l>
               <l>And have it conquer without Cruelty.</l>
               <l>Beauty should like a blazing <hi>Comet</hi> rise,</l>
               <l>Excite our Wonder, and attract our Eyes;</l>
               <l>But then its Lustre never should dispence</l>
               <l>O're ev'ry Heart a baneful Influence.</l>
               <l>It grieves me when I see th' unwary Young,</l>
               <l>By <hi>Nature</hi> form'd all healthy, gay, and strong,</l>
               <l>Nourish a Viper in their tortur'd Breast,</l>
               <l>Which with incessant Gnawings break their Rest;</l>
               <l>See the fresh Roses from their Cheeks decay,</l>
               <l>And all their youthful Vigour pine away.</l>
               <l>Nay, the most daring, most Heroick Mind,</l>
               <l>Intangled in Love's Snares too oft we find:</l>
               <l>Whether 'tis caus'd by that more sprightly Heat,</l>
               <l>That does his boiling Spirits animate;</l>
               <l>Or whether <hi>Cupid</hi> takes more Pride t' inslave</l>
               <l>The gen'rous Souls and Courage of the Brave.</l>
               <l>When therefore the first Symptoms in your Breast</l>
               <l>Begin your wonted Quiet to molest,</l>
               <l>When Infant-sighs, like Unfledg'd winds, begin</l>
               <l>With gentle Breath to kindle Fire within;</l>
               <l>When springing warmth around your Heart does play,</l>
               <l>And a new Motion through your Blood convey;</l>
               <l>Then straight the Undermining-Foe surprize,</l>
               <l>And quell him, e're he can have time to rise.</l>

               <l>She takes no Sleep by Night, nor Rest by Day;</l>
               <l>But thinks it tedious vital Air to Breathe,</l>
               <l>And there appears no present Ease but Death;</l>

               <l>By slow degrees you must your Peace secure;</l>

               </opener>
               <p>THE way of <hi>Dedicating</hi> now most in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, seems to me to stand in as great need of a Reformation, as does our <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> For, as we take nothing to be True and Genuine <hi>Poetry,</hi> but what is Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Frothy, and has a wanton <hi>Air</hi> throughout it; so the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity seem to stand persuaded, That an <hi>Epistle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory</hi> loses its End quite, if not stuff'd up with gross and open Flattery, sufficient to call a Blush into any modest Reader's Cheek. But here it is a hard matter to judge Whether the <hi>Impudence</hi> of the Author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the <hi>Vanity</hi> of the Patron (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves all true that's said of him) does contribute most to carry on this notorious piece of Folly</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>(Sir)</hi> though our Early Friendship, and Intimate Acquaintance was the Reason that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaild most upon me in presenting this small <hi>Essay</hi> to You; yet, to speak truth, there was another Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive too, which made me the more desirous of it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48758:19"/>
and that was merely upon the account of running counter to the generality of <hi>Dedicating Poets,</hi> to try if a particular Example might have any small Influence in correcting the <hi>Poetical License</hi> they take up<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n such like occasions: For here I was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that I might come off without the least flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Glance,</hi> with one who (though young) has Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience enough to understand, that Personal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is not to be estimated by the fine Complements and Flourishes of a Fanciful <hi>Pen.</hi> And for my part, I think if our Poets go on at their <hi>old Rate</hi> but a little longer, we shall be apt to interpret Epistles of this sort as we do Dreams, by the contrary.</p>
               <p>The great Scandal that Poetry has of late been subject to, together with the respect I always had for it, gave occasion for the following <hi>Reflection.</hi> For as I was considering how much this <hi>Art</hi> was esteemed amongst our <hi>Forefathers,</hi> and how Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, nay, almost Sacre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Name</hi> of a Poet was then; Surely (thought I) the Former Honour, and the Present Disgrace the <hi>Muses</hi> lye under, could never depend on the different <hi>Capricio's</hi> of two divers Ages, but there must be some more <hi>reasonable</hi> Ground for this matter, which if once discovered, will give a very fair opportunity of restoring Verse to its <hi>Primitive</hi> Dignity. Some there are who suspect, That the want of <hi>Genius</hi> in our Age has given Poetry this <hi>deadly</hi> Wound: But they will soon find their Mistake, if (laying aside the blind Veneration we have for Antiquity) they compare the <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Moderns</hi> in any sort of Poetry, excepting the <hi>Epic.</hi> So that we must seek out for some other
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48758:19"/>
Cause more probable than the former. And what others may spy, I know not; but I think the great Difference lies here, That Poetry is now no longer the <hi>Fountain of Wisdom,</hi> the <hi>School of Virtue</hi>; it is no longer a fit Trainer up of Youth, a Bridler of the Passions and exorbitant Desires: But on the contrary, he is reckoned the Ablest Poet, that is most dextrous at conjuring up these <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> to disturb the Calm and Quiet of the Soul. And this (if I mistake not) is that which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd so great a <hi>Beauty,</hi> and cast an Odium on that most excellent Art, which was once the <hi>Pride of Conquerors, and Envy of Philosophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I have transiently remark'd in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Verses,</hi> will I doubt not) be dislik'd by many of our <hi>Rhiming Sparks</hi>; for take but the Liberty of Writing <hi>Immodestly</hi> from 'em, and you have quite dismounted them off their <hi>Pegasus</hi>; they are quite <hi>Tongue-tid</hi>; 'tis with them, as <hi>Horace</hi> says it was <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>What I have said against <hi>Love</hi> upon the Stage, I would not have apprehended so, as if I would have that <hi>Passion</hi> quite exploded; for I think it one of the fittest Passions for Poetry, and capable of very great Ornaments; but then I would have it very nicely and delicately handled; and what might give the least Offence to the severest Modesty, always cast in Shades; for it is then only that this Passion is not to be allow'd, when it goes beyond its bounds; and that is, when the Poet's Strokes are too <hi>bold,</hi> and his Colours too glaring.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48758:20"/>I was told (which I my self afterwards found to be true) that a great Part of my Design was already performd in the Preface to <hi>Prince Arthur.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that did not trouble me in the least, for I was very glad to see my self of the same Opinion with so eminent an Author; since I had laid a <hi>Rude Draught</hi> of my <hi>Reflection</hi> the last Summer, which I then shew'd several of my Acquaintaince. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the <hi>World</hi> may think this a <hi>Sham,</hi> and I am very willing to be thought indebted to so creditable a Person for what I have said.</p>
               <p>I shall make no Apology for the <hi>Tediousness</hi> of my Epistle, since you are too often guilty of the Contrary Vice in writing to</p>

               <l>But that our Follies we at large may see,</l>
               <l>Let's closely view our <hi>Modern Poesy.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What place so much debauched as our <hi>Stage,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which next the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> should correct the Age?</l>
               <l>What anciently <hi>Devotion</hi> did begin,</l>
               <l>Is now converted to the use of <hi>Sin</hi>;</l>
               <l>And on our Theatres we daily see</l>

                  <hi>Vice</hi> triumph o'er dejected <hi>Honesty.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But happy <hi>Athens!</hi> whose more decent Stage</l>
               <l>Was moraliz'd by <hi>Sophocles</hi> wise <hi>Rage:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who e're he did pretend to <hi>Poetry,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Search'd the grave Precepts of <hi>Philosophy</hi>;</l>
               <l>Hence 'twas he taught those Truths he learnt before,</l>
               <l>And practis'd those sound Rules his Writings bore:</l>
               <l>He doubly charm'd his <hi>Modest</hi> Audience,</l>
               <l>By good Example, and wise Eloquence.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Philosophers</hi> far short in teaching came;</l>
               <l>Their Naked <hi>Virtues</hi> maimed were, and lame.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Pearl</hi> they represented to the View</l>
               <l>Unpolish'd, as It naturally grew.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Poets</hi> put a Gloss on't, made it shine;</l>
               <l>Then 'twas embrac'd as somewhat more <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What er'st to the Rude People seem'd severe,</l>
               <l>In soothing Verse all-charming does appear;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48758:21"/>Gently it glides into their ravish'd Minds,</l>
               <l>For Pleasure still an easy Entrance finds;</l>
               <l>Few can the Suit, of what they like, remove,</l>
               <l>Or be averse, when Beauty wooe's, from Love.</l>
               <l>And now what weak Excuse, what vain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</l>
               <l>Can <hi>Christian Poets</hi> bring in their Defence?</l>
               <l>Shall <hi>Heathens</hi> teach by Nature's <hi>Glow-worm</hi> Light,</l>
               <l>What they neglect when <hi>Faith</hi> directs their Sight?</l>
               <l>Or are our Palates vitiated, and we</l>
               <l>Can relish nought but <hi>Vice</hi> in Poetry?</l>
               <l>Must They indulge the <hi>Ill,</hi> and sooth our Fate,</l>
               <l>Or else prevent it e're it be too late?</l>
               <l>If We are led away by strong Desire,</l>
               <l>Must They add <hi>Fuel</hi> to the raging <hi>Fire?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Not so did <hi>Orpheus</hi>; but with tuneful Voice,</l>
               <l>Taught <hi>Salvage Men</hi> that follow'd Nature's Choice,</l>
               <l>That wildly stray'd in shrubby Brakes all day,</l>
               <l>And herded with the common Beasts of Prey;</l>

               <l>Their Mossy Caves and Grotto's to forsake,</l>
               <l>And fitter <hi>Dwellings</hi> for themselves to make;</l>
               <l>And that in Learning <hi>Greece</hi> did so aspire,</l>
               <l>Was wholly owing to his Sacred Lyre.</l>
               <l>Then let some <hi>Champion</hi> for the Muses rise.</l>
               <l>Who dares be obstinately Good, and Wise;</l>

               </l>
               <l>And make It in its proper Channel run.</l>
               <l>He needs not fear his <hi>Bayes</hi> shall wither'd lye;</l>
               <l>Or that We shall despise his Poetry;</l>

               <l>Which to excuse, our Poets oftentimes</l>
               <l>Reply, They bring such Objects into view,</l>
               <l>To make us loathe those Passions we pursue.</l>
               <l>But this is False; They always raise <hi>Desire,</hi>

               <l>The Wiser Ancients did this Fault decline,</l>
               <l>And made their <hi>Tragedies</hi> more <hi>Masculine.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Each nervous Scene some Manlike Virtue taught,</l>

               <l>Their <hi>Heroes</hi> were more Stern, and fit for Wars,</l>
