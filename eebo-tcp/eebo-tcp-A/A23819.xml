            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Worſhipful
Sir THOMAS TREVOR Knight and
Baronet, and one of the Honorable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Knights of the BATH.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FOr as much as the <hi>Period of the Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy</hi>
came forth as the <hi>Firſt-Fruits</hi> of my
publick gratitude, I could not let this <hi>Appendix</hi>
walk abroad without your cogniſance; which I
am therefore willing my ſelf, &amp; any thing of mine
ſhould wear, becauſe one Tongue is too little to
tell the world what a Patron I have had, &amp; have;
and the good God grant I may long have.</p>
            <p>It is I confeſs an eaſie thing for me to ſay thus,
and ſeriouſly it were an ill thing in me to ſay leſs;
for the greateſt good that in this world I enjoy, it
came from your <hi>ſingle Heart</hi> and <hi>free Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after a Period, to talk of the Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,
may ſeem that I had done before I had
<pb facs="tcp:94516:3"/>
made an end. But truly ſpeaking: The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this Sermon, it is the ſurvey of that Guilt
which the Grand Conſpirators and their Abettors
acted and contracted before the other Sermons
could have a being: So that this is but a <hi>Label</hi>
to the Crown, and an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the ſad Story.
The Drift of this onely is, to knock at every
door, to ſee how much of this guilt may lie in
every boſom; not to upbraid any, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
all, ſo to examine, that our Penitence may
be proportionable to our Failings. For,</p>
            <p>Though He fell by <hi>Open Enimies,</hi> yet he was
wounded in the <hi>Houſe of his Friends.</hi> For whilſt
they ſtood a far off, the diligent in miſchief came
up cloſe; whilſt they were <hi>wary,</hi> the other were
<hi>working:</hi> ſo that a <hi>Non obſtans</hi> lieth at many a
door, and a <hi>Non manifeſtans</hi> at as many. And
rare is that Subject, who in no meaſure was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to this Sacred Perſon. Let the Diſcourſe
be your ſcrutiny; and the preſentation of it, a
freſh but a ſhort acknowledgment of his great
Obligations for abundant Kindneſſes heapt upon
(My moſt honored Patron!)</p>

            <p>THis following Diſcourſe it hath made no haſt
unto the Preſs; for it was preached firſt,
when firſt that ſad Day was made <hi>Rubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
(the Author then being in that <hi>Zoar</hi> wherein
the good God preſerved him for better times.) It
ſince hath been repeated in two Corporations, a <hi>City</hi>
and a <hi>Town;</hi> in the one it was cenſur'd thus, <hi>He
came hither to make us guilty of the KINGS
death!</hi> In the other, It were well to be <hi>preacht oft,</hi>
that men might become more ſenſible of their <hi>latent</hi>
guilt. Now I profeſs before the world, my intentions
when I by the mercies of God conceiv'd it, &amp; when
at any time by his aſſiſtance I was deliver'd of it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were to work upon my Auditory; and as far as
in me lay to <hi>prick</hi> the Heart, and wound that ſoul,
which either by <hi>Thought, Word</hi> or <hi>Deed</hi> had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
that <hi>Grand Conſpiracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For being I well know, <hi>Fruſtra praetereunt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
quem non abſolvit Conſcientia,</hi> that Laws
vainly paſs over and clear an Offender, whilſt yet
the guilt lieth upon the ſoul; my deſign was ever
to make thoſe who are conſcious, know, Though a
ſuppreſſing and <hi>ſtifling of evidence</hi> may carry
off a <hi>Malefactor;</hi> and a <hi>Pardon</hi> may preſerve
a <hi>Murtherer;</hi> though an <hi>Act of Indemnity</hi> may
<pb facs="tcp:94516:4"/>
clear an eſtate, and as to ſecular diſturbances and to
legal inflictions ſecure a man. Yet ſuch who before
God ſtand guilty of <hi>Intruſions, violent Detentions,
Sacrilege, Blood, Rebellion, Schiſm, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe
though they ſtand as <hi>recti in curia,</hi> diſcharged in all
Courts, freed from all legal moleſtations or vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
upbraiding; yet before their <hi>own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
(if not ſeared) can abſolve or ſpeak peace unto
them: they muſt repent them truly, and they muſt be
<hi>moſt heartily ſorrowful</hi> for all <hi>theſe Mis-doings!</hi>
yea if that recieved piece of Divinity be true, <hi>Non
dimittitur peccatum niſi reſtituatur oblatum,</hi> the
ſin is not remitted till the prey is reſtored; then,
whoever have <hi>wronged</hi> any, they muſt have <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi>
care, where they have wronged to reſtore; &amp;
where wrongs have been ſo highly acted, that more
than <hi>all</hi> will not do it; then the <hi>acknowledgment</hi>
muſt needs be great, and the anguiſhes of ſoul as
proportionable as may be, to the anguiſhes of thoſe
who periſhed by their default, and were not heard in
their moſt juſt complaints and ſaddeſt exigencies.</p>
            <p>In the following Diſcourſe you ſhall find that
good St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he became a <hi>Convert,</hi> &amp; was
now ſenſible of that far diſtant <hi>conſent</hi> which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears by looking to the <hi>raiment</hi> of thoſe who
<pb facs="tcp:94516:4"/>
ſtoned <hi>Stephen!</hi> (being for ought we know nor <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer,</hi>
nor <hi>witneſs,</hi> nor <hi>Executioner,</hi> nor <hi>Judge</hi>)
He was for this conſent ſo extremely humbled; that
he <hi>publickly</hi> confeſſed, (and with an holy indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the fact) ſaid, <hi>Ipſe ego, When the
bloud of the Martyr</hi> Stephen <hi>was ſhed, I alſo was
ſtanding by and conſenting to his death, and kept
the raiment of them who ſlew him,</hi> Acts 22. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Men, Brethren &amp; Fathers, before a great <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi>
he deplor'd his guilt. <hi>I was ſtanding by
and conſenting to his death! I kept the raiment
of them who ſlew him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am content in <hi>Charity</hi> to hope that God hath
toucht the ſouls of many who were then <hi>well pleaſ'd</hi>
when the bloud of our <hi>Regal Martyr</hi> was ſhed! &amp;
I will hope they may have bewail'd their guilt: But
it were much more <hi>conducing</hi> toward their Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
&amp; pardon of ſo great a crime, if they became as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, more <hi>publick Penitents:</hi> For that
ſuch who have <hi>openly</hi> ſlandered the Foot-ſteps of
Gods Annointed, and in publick Meetings reviled
and ſpoke againſt that holy one. And as for inſtance.
If any of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> of thoſe times, having zeal
proportion'd to his Intereſt, ſhould have been ſo <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly</hi>
wicked as to pray,—<hi>Lord now thou
<pb facs="tcp:94516:5"/>
haſt deſtroyed the Lyon, take away the Whelps alſo!</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch an one ought not <hi>as publickly</hi> to bewail his raſhneſs,
and as <hi>openly</hi> to retract ſuch an horrid ſaying, (then call'd
<hi>praying</hi>) I leave it to a <hi>Conſcience</hi> and to a <hi>Caſuiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following Sermon I may tell you, hath been importunately
deſired; and now many more may have it than did ſo. But I
ſhould wiſh none to give a <hi>peny</hi> for it, or to lay an <hi>eye</hi> upon it,
unleſs they will reſolve to make a <hi>conſcientious reflection</hi> on it.</p>
            <p>Sure I am it is not <hi>perſonal;</hi> and as ſure that few perſons
ſhall read it, but may find a <hi>ſhare</hi> in it, and take juſt occaſion,
either to ask Gods pardon for ſome omiſſion; or to give God
praiſe that made them ſo right hearted, as to be delivered from
that extenſive Guilt which <hi>few eſcaped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Sermon cannot poſſibly make any guilty who are not; but
poſſibly it may <hi>ſhew</hi> ſome to be ſo, who have not thought they
were. And therefore, whereas upon that ſolemn Day we are
taught to pray,
<q>Lay not the Guilt of this Innocent Blood, (the
ſhedding whereof, nothing but the Blood of thy Son
can expiate) lay it not to the Charge of thy People
of this Land, nor let it ever be required of us, or
our Poſterity—</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe (God ſo working) may occaſion that this
Prayer may be preferred with <hi>more ſenſe,</hi> heart and feeling
than before it hath been: which to his Glory may the good God
effect, it will glad and rejoyce the heart of</p>

            <p>Now concerning this Martyr ſome things are obviouſly

to be obſerved, before we can come exactly to the Text.
1. His <hi>Ordination,</hi> he was a perſon ſeparate from the people.

Orders; upon which <hi>Stephen</hi> being found a <hi>Man full of faith

obſerve, that albeit S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was a perſon of excellent

6. <hi>They ſet him before the Apoſtles, and when they had prayed,
they layed hands on him.</hi> So that though the people lookt
him up, <hi>v.</hi> 3. it was the Apoſtles who appointed him to
his Buſineſs; though the people found him out, it was
the Apoſtles who <hi>ſent him out. Manus ei impoſuerunt,</hi> it
was they that laid hands upon him! So that the firſt thing
obſervable concerning the Death of the glorious Martyr
is, he was an <hi>Ordained perſon,</hi> he was one who by Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Apoſtolical Hands and Prayer, was ſet apart and
deſigned for holy uſe. The Firſt Chriſtian Martyr was in
Apoſtolical Holy Orders.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Danger involved</hi> and bound up in this
profeſſion; for whereas <hi>before</hi> he liv'd ſecure and <hi>private,</hi>
as a Chriſtian or a <hi>Diſciple;</hi> now called to a <hi>publick</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and ſet apart for a peculiar and Holy uſe, he
was not long in his Office; for, for ought we read, his firſt
Sermon coſt him his life. 'Tis true indeed he was choſen
<pb facs="tcp:94516:6"/>
               <hi>to miniſter unto Widows; Acts</hi> 6. 1. yet by his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it appears he was not choſen to that Miniſtration
onely; for <hi>Stephen full of Faith and Power did great Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Miracles among the people: verſ.</hi> 8. yea, though
there was an whole Aſſembly, <hi>an whole Aſsembly of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines
againſt him, he held not his peace, ver.</hi> 9. but ſo he
diſputed, and ſo ſpake, that as the Text implies, <hi>They
diſpacht him for it. An Argument to me,</hi> That <hi>Holy Orders</hi>
are not onely <hi>Honos,</hi> but <hi>Onus;</hi> not onely an advance to
<hi>Honor,</hi> but an expoſe to <hi>Hazard,</hi> inſomuch that by how
much God is pleaſed to take a man <hi>nigher to himſelf,</hi> by ſo
much the more is he, than another, expoſ'd to the <hi>Hate of
the World,</hi> and bound to abide <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Danger</hi> for him.
For our Bleſſed Lord and Maſter, he whoſe Manhood of all
others was nigheſt in conjunction with the Deity, he was
(as I may ſay) therefore put into Holy Orders, therefore
made a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that through the <hi>Eternal Spirit, he might
offer himſelf to God: Heb.</hi> 9. 14. therefore was he made a
Prieſt, that he might be a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>And indeed, whereas Chriſtians in general are by St.
<hi>Peter</hi> called <hi>An Holy Prieſthood, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5. I know nothing
that this can more ſafely and ſeaſonably admoniſh than to
remember, if we are Prieſts, we muſt then ſacrifice, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
no leſs than <hi>our very ſelves</hi> to Gods glory! For ſo did
our pattern, <hi>ſo did our high Prieſt who is ſet before us;</hi> So did
St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who though a <hi>Deacon</hi> and one in the loweſt
ſtep of Holy Office, when he was put to it he declined not,
but to his Maſters and to his Kings glory, he ſo ſpake that
he died for it, For <hi>Saul was conſenting to his death!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, To come up to the Text, let us ſee and obſerve
what that <hi>particular Truth</hi> was, and what that very <hi>Speech</hi>
for which he was thus uſ'd; for the which the Jews cried
<pb facs="tcp:94516:7"/>
out, Run upon him, and ſtoned him to death: and you
ſhall find it was, onely for accuſing them, and ſharply ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
before them the Murther of their King. For, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.
52. you ſhall find theſe words, <hi>Which of the Prophets have
not your Fathers perſecuted, and they have ſlain them who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before of the coming of the just one, of whom yet have been
now the Betrayers and the Murtherers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When St. <hi>Stephen</hi> though full of the Holy Ghoſt, was ſo
bold as to tell the Rebellious Jews of their killing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and of their putting to death the <hi>Juſt one,</hi> it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
followeth <hi>v. 53. When they heard theſe things they were cut
to the heart, and they gnaſhed on him with their teeth.</hi> When
St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſo bold as to tell them how they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
trayed their King, and murthered the Lords Annointed!
When he was ſo bold, as to ſet their ſo horrid and ſo
bloody Rebellion before their eyes, no wonder if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to cut off him, who had thus <hi>cut</hi> them; <hi>to break his
head, who had broke their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is oft ſaid, Many a man loves the Treaſon, who hates
the Traitor. But here we have a Treaſon, which the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
themſelves endure not to hear on! For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts 5. 40. The Counſel</hi> of State for the time being;
even thoſe whoſe hands were imbrued in the blood of their
King, they call and command the Apoſtles, that they <hi>ſhould
not ſpeak in the Name of Jeſus.</hi> Jeſus the King of the Jews;
his Murtherers commanded that no mention be made of
him; command even his own Servants, even the nigheſt to
him, not to do any thing, no not to ſpeak <hi>in the Kings Name!</hi>
Yea, ſo did the memory of their Rebellion crucifie their
ſouls, that witneſs St. <hi>Stephen</hi> they were ready <hi>to ſlay</hi> and
to ſtone the Speaker: For, having nothing to anſwer in
Defenſe of their Rebellion, having nothing to anſwer for
<pb facs="tcp:94516:7"/>
their Murther of Gods Annointed! having nothing to
keep off that deadly ſtab which the charge of their killing
the juſt one gave unto their very ſouls, <hi>Acts 7. 57. They
stop their ears,</hi> but with wide open mouths they ran upon
him; and to ſtop that mouth whoſe truth <hi>cut their hearts,</hi>
for want of arguments ſo ſilenced him with ſtones, that he
died at their feet! of whoſe death the Holy Ghoſt is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to take notice, and to record not onely the <hi>Actors,</hi> but
a bare <hi>Conſenter</hi> alſo, in theſe words, <hi>And Saul was conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what talk I of the Murther of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> upon a day
ſolemnly ſet a part to be humbled for the Murther of a
<hi>King!</hi> my anſwer is, I find ſo nigh a conjunction between
<hi>Sacred Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Holy Order;</hi> between Prince and Prieſt;
between Gods annointed to be <hi>Kings,</hi> and Gods annointed
to be <hi>Prophets,</hi> that we can ſcarſe find the man who will
wrong the one, but if occaſion ſerve, he would do as much
for the other, and therefore we find them both equally
ſhielded in one verſe, <hi>Touch not mine Annointed, and do
my Prophets no harm, Pſalm</hi> 105. They who will <hi>harm</hi> the
Prophets, they will not ſtick to <hi>arm</hi> againſt the Annointed:
They who killed the <hi>Juſt one,</hi> they made nothing of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
his <hi>Meſſengers:</hi> and indeed, in order to this horrid
Murther, in order to the betraying of our Juſt one, and the
<hi>Lords Annointed,</hi> what was more previous than the ſtoning
of his Prophets, the <hi>ſequeſtring, ſilencing</hi> and depriving
from all comforts of this life, who ever durſt as did <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
magnifie the Lords Annointed, or did dare to ſay,
They were his <hi>Betrrayers</hi> or his <hi>Murtherers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, between <hi>Deacon</hi> and <hi>King</hi> there is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion:
Deacon the loweſt degree of <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and
King the ſuperexcellent for <hi>Majeſty:</hi> and yet the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:94516:8"/>
Kings who are ſometime called <hi>Gods,</hi> they are alſo ſtiled,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Gods Deacons too, that is, Gods
ſelected and peculiar Servants: and thus conſidered, St.
<hi>Stephen</hi> and our Soveraign may very well admit a Parallel:</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p>Was S. <hi>Stephen, Acts 6. 5. a man full of Faiih and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost:</hi> ſuch was our Soveraign. <hi>Full of Faith,</hi> for it was
in faith of a <hi>better,</hi> that he gave up his <hi>earthly</hi> Crown. <hi>Full
of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for the moſt envious cannot deny his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
and Solitudes</hi> to be the undoubted Breathings of
that <hi>Spirit!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was St. <hi>Stephen</hi> endowed with ſuch high parts and gifts
that <hi>v. 10. They were not able to reſiſt the Wiſdom, and the
Spirit by which he ſpoke?</hi> Even ſo was it with our Bleſſed
Soveraign, or elſe we had never heard of <hi>An Ordinance for
no Addreſſes;</hi> nor, as himſelf ſpeaks, had he been aſſailed
with <hi>Armies</hi> inſtead of <hi>Arguments:</hi> yea, when his curſed
Conſpirators, when thoſe who ſought his life, and thoſe
who in order to it had declared him <hi>A Fool,</hi> one <hi>unfit to
govern,</hi> when they had diveſted him of all counſel, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred
him from <hi>all Advice,</hi> when many, and the choiceſt
of the pack were ſent to him (as the <hi>Herodians</hi> to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to entrap and entangle him in his words:) they found
him ſo qualify'd, as the Book of God teſtifieth of S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,
That they were not able to reſiſt the Wiſdom, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
by which he ſpake:</hi> and therefore as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
with <hi>ſtones,</hi> becauſe they were not able to do it with
<hi>Arguments:</hi> Even ſo therefore was our Bleſſed Soveraign
not permitted to ſpeak againſt the <hi>High Court of Justice!</hi>
Therefore brought to his <hi>Scaffold,</hi> and therefore cut off;
becauſe they <hi>were not able to reſiſt his Wiſdom!</hi> becauſe they
found he was no leſs <hi>good</hi> than <hi>great,</hi> as they ſerved St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,
<pb facs="tcp:94516:8"/>
Acts</hi> 7. 58. even ſo they <hi>ran upon him and caſt him out
of the City.</hi> Yea, the very circumſtance of <hi>place,</hi> whence
thoſe came who did this deed, that relateth to St. <hi>Stephen</hi>
too: for the <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> that pack of Miſcreants
which were ſent to do this Villany, they came forth of St.
<hi>Stephens Chappel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now being in <hi>Stephens</hi> Martyrdom, the Spirit of God is
ſo ſevere, as to take notice not onely of thoſe (who as I
may ſay, <hi>ſealed</hi> and <hi>ſigned</hi> his death) not onely of thoſe who
ran upon him, and were the actors in this Murther: but
of a very <hi>Acceſſory,</hi> of a ſtander by, of one who gave no vote,
flung no <hi>ſtone,</hi> did no hurt: being the Spirit of God takes
notice of one who did onely <hi>look to the cloathing of thoſe
that stoned him, verſ.</hi> 58. One that did onely look on and
like the thing: certainly we ſhall find <hi>Conſenters</hi> as well
as <hi>Actors</hi> are mightily to be humbled for the ſin of <hi>this day;</hi>
Not onely they who <hi>plotted,</hi> and <hi>preached,</hi> and <hi>prepar'd</hi> the
Murther; but thoſe alſo who <hi>liked</hi> it when it was done:
Thoſe who by any complacency or <hi>after act,</hi> or ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
avowed the thing. All ſuch are guilty of the Horrid
Murther of this Day, or elſe vainly did the Holy Pen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what is our preſent Text,
<q>And Saul was conſenting to his death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In, and about theſe Words we ſhall conſider of theſe
three Propoſitions. Firſt, a man may be guilty of that
ſin in which he was no actor, by being onely as <hi>Saul</hi> here
ſtands recorded, <hi>A Conſenter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, a guilt may be <hi>poſtnate</hi> unto a fact, for after
the ſtoning of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> it is obſerv'd, and not before, that
<hi>Saul was conſenting to his death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94516:9"/>
Laſtly, Conſent may contract ſo <hi>deep a guilt,</hi> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
confeſſion and contrition, it may hale the vengeance
of an Actor upon the Conſenters head.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>A man may be guilty of that ſin &amp;c.</hi> Conſent it
is the conception, and the firſt quickning of every ſin; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
it is that which gives the firſt being to every iniquity,
inſomuch that he who conſenteth, though he never act fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is an actual ſinner before his God:
<q>Nam ſcelus intra ſe tantum qui cogitat ultum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore ſaid our Bleſſed Maſter, <hi>Matt. 5. 28. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
already with her in his heart.</hi> He who hath a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
a laſcivious and an adulterat reflection upon a beauty;
he who looks, and luſts, though he never exchange a word,
never touch, handle or come nigh the woman; even this
<hi>very conſent,</hi> this very complacencie it is <hi>Adultery</hi> in the
eye of the moſt pure: For, ſaith our Saviour, (the ſon of
a Virgin) <hi>he hath committed adultery with her already in his
heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as conſent in the <hi>Concupiſcible,</hi> even ſo conſent in
the <hi>Iraſcible</hi> it contracts a like guilt: For, as he is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer
who looketh and luſteth, though he never violate
the chaſtity of the woman: even ſo a man may be guilty
of <hi>Murther,</hi> and yet never draw bloud; a man may be a
Manſlayer, and yet never harm or hurt a perſon: For the
expreſs determination and words of St. <hi>John</hi> are, <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hateth his brother is a Murtherer. 1 Jo.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>Now if it be ſo, that conſent is the window that firſt
lets in the thief, conſent the paſs by which the Deſtroyer
entreth into our Souls; if it be ſo, that <hi>Conſent</hi> makes us
<pb facs="tcp:94516:9"/>
guilty even of the <hi>ſin of others;</hi> for, if Conſent abſtracted
from all outward Action makes the whole Man guilty; if
guilt takes its riſe, <hi>not from the Act,</hi> but from Conſent, it
is all a matter who Acts, for who ever conſenteth he is
alſo guilty.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of Time, when the Devil firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to bring ſin into the World, He took upon Him the
form of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> Gen. 3. in that he ſpake unto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
told Her, God meant nothing leſs than what He
ſaid, <hi>That they ſhould die;</hi> yea, rather they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as Gods; and all this, only to gain a <hi>Conſent;</hi> ſo
that it was conſent that brought <hi>Sin</hi> into the World, it
was <hi>Conſent</hi> that made <hi>Eve</hi> a ſinner; Conſent that made
Her guilty of the Devils Machination.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide; when our bleſſed Lord and Maſter
come to Deſtroy the works of the Devil; The Devil He
could gain no Conſent; and therefore though He ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, <hi>All the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of
them,</hi> yet ſaith our Saviour, John 14. 30. <hi>The Prince of this
world cometh, and hath Nothing in me.</hi> Let the Devil and
His Angels do all they can, they can get no ground, they
can have nothing in us, or any of us, but with conſent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſo that, of all things that are under our power; of
all the Talents committed to our charge, we ought to be
more choice of none than of this we have now in Hand,
<hi>Our Conſent:</hi> 'Tis this that makes us miſerable; This,
that makes us happy, it is this that maketh us virtuous,
and 'tis this that makes us vitious; 'Tis this, that makes
us God's, and 'tis this that makes us the Devils.</p>
            <p>'Twas <hi>Conſent,</hi> that made the <hi>Devils ſuggeſtion</hi> become
<hi>Eves ſin,</hi> it was conſent that made <hi>Eve's</hi> entiſement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Tranſgreſſion;</hi> and it is conſent that makes
<pb facs="tcp:94516:10"/>
every <hi>Tentation</hi> become our <hi>guilt;</hi> ſo that you ſee to very
great purpoſe it was here obſerved, that though <hi>Saul</hi> was
not an Actor, yet He was a <hi>Conſenter</hi> to his death.</p>
            <p>Whereas then the Buſineſs of <hi>this great Day</hi> is, to be
Humbled before the great God, for the <hi>fouleſt Murder</hi>
(except that of the Son of God) that was ever read on;
it concerns every of us to lay Hand upon the Heart and
as the Twelve did, (when their King and Maſter foretold
His Treachery) to ſay, <hi>Maſter, Is it I?</hi> Math. 26. 22. It
concerns every of us to conſider how far we were toward
the guilt of this great Crime; How far either by way of
<hi>Default</hi> or <hi>Conſent,</hi> we have drawn up, even to this Murther.</p>
            <p>1 Tim. 5. 22. <hi>Lay Hands ſuddenly on no Man; neither
be partaker of other Mens ſins.</hi> This exhortation of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
not only admoniſheth <hi>Timothy</hi> to take Heed of ſinning,
by an over-haſty, either <hi>Ordination</hi> or <hi>Abſolution:</hi> But
alſo to take heed that He become not a <hi>Party,</hi> or partaker
in other Mens ſins.</p>
            <p>Now the great ſins which we are <hi>this Day</hi> (or at this
Time) to recollect, it is the <hi>Murder of God's Anointed,</hi> the
betraying and butchering of our King; Now this, though
it was <hi>Paucorum Crimen,</hi> the abominable acting of ſome
few; yet it was <hi>Multorum Delictum,</hi> the Failance and the
ſin of too too many, and that upon theſe Accounts.</p>
            <p>1. In Reſpect of <hi>Acts Antecedent</hi> and going before.</p>
            <p>2. In Reſpect of <hi>Acts Conſequent</hi> and following after.</p>
            <p>Upon both which, we ſhall find, Conſent and Guilt, it
will riſe like a Land-Flood, and carry almoſt all afore it;
ſo that albeit, few were thoſe who <hi>waſhed</hi> their Hands in
His Blood, we ſhall find few alſo are thoſe who are not
<hi>beſprinkled</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then let us conſider what previous and antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb facs="tcp:94516:10"/>
Acts may involve a Guilt in this Murther: I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
only in Two:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A <hi>Provocation</hi> of our God.</item>
               <item>2. A <hi>Deſertion</hi> of God's Anointed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For both theſe are, as the School ſpeaks, <hi>Volitum in
Cauſa,</hi> a conſequential conſent, or a conſequential guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a <hi>Conſequential Conſent and guilt to do that
which provoketh God to inflict ſuch a Judgment:</hi> ſo that in
our provocation of God to permit this Murder, we have
contracted enough to call for our Tears: For, if gracious
and good Kings be the Bleſſings of God upon a People,
certainly the Removing of ſuch muſt needs be upon a
provocation, and nothing can be ſo, but our ſin.</p>
            <p>Amongſt us Men, we juſtly account Him a partaker,
who is a <hi>Provoker</hi> unto ſin; He that provokes a Man to
Anger, provokes a Man to Drunkenneſs, provokes a Man
to Steal, he is doubtleſs a partaker even in his ſin: Had
<hi>Job</hi> curſed upon the provocation and inſtigation of his
Wife, <hi>She,</hi> as well as He had been guilt: Not <hi>Amnon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but <hi>Jonadab</hi> who promoted and provoked was guilty
in his luſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. Now look what is the provoking
of a Man to ſin, proportionably the ſame, is the provoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our <hi>God to Judgment:</hi> A ſin undoubtedly, for only
ſin can do it, and ſin can do it, even to as ſad a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to permit the Murder of a good, and a precious
KING.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. When the Child gotten by <hi>David</hi> in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
was delivered, the Lord ſent him word, <hi>v.</hi> 14. That,
<hi>Becauſe thou hast given Occaſion to the Enemies of the Lord
to blaſpheme, the Child that is born unto Thee ſhall ſurely
die.</hi> The ſin of the Father it had an influence even upon
the death of the Child; becauſe Thou haſt given occaſion,
<pb facs="tcp:94516:11"/>
therefore ſhall the Child die. And even ſo, becauſe we
provoked the Lord, therefore did God ſuffer His Anointed
to be thus ſmitten. And indeed, the School very well
obſerves, there is <hi>Volitum in Cauſa,</hi> as well as <hi>Directe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarium:</hi>
There is an indirect conſent, and a conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
willing of a Thing, as well as a down-right, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
conſent, inſomuch that many a Man gladly and
willingly conſents unto the <hi>cauſe,</hi> who perfectly abhors
and abominates the <hi>effect;</hi> and yet where there is an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
coherence, He who directly wills the one, he doth
conſequentially will the other; As for inſtance, The <hi>Men
of the firſt World,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. They did directly will and
conſent unto thoſe abominations and wickedneſſes for
which God threatned, yea and reſolv'd to drown the world;
But as to the <hi>Drowning of the World,</hi> they gave no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
nor had no will; But, for as much as they willed that
which <hi>neceſſarily</hi> brought on the other, therefore, they
were <hi>Volitum in Cauſa,</hi> They were the conſequential wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of their own Ruine: For, their ſins provoked the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 20. Even ſo, the Men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> they had
no will to have had Them and Theirs deſtroyed with Fire
and Brimſtone: But, being they continued to <hi>Act</hi> and do
that, whoſe cry clamored to Heaven for vengeance, and
for <hi>this Vengeance:</hi> Therefore even they were <hi>Volitum in
Cauſa,</hi> they were the conſequential cauſe and provoker of
their own deſtruction: And this you ſhall find is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
even from the very language of God Himſelf, for the
Lord by his Prophet Rebuking <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Thus ſaith, <hi>Why will
you die, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Alas! <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no mind, no
will in the world to die; They would never have given
ſuffrage or conſent to their own death; And yet, for as
much as they <hi>willed</hi> that, which would infallibly bring
<pb facs="tcp:94516:11"/>
death upon them, God lays their death even to their own
charge, and makes their deſtruction an act of their own
will, ſaying, <hi>Why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as the Men of the old World, the <hi>Deluge;</hi> as the
Men of <hi>Sodom</hi> their <hi>Fire and Brimstone;</hi> and as <hi>Iſrael</hi> their
<hi>Deſtruction,</hi> ſo were all we the cauſe of the Kings death,
who continued <hi>to commit thoſe ſins,</hi> and to act thoſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes,
for which God was reſolved to deprive the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſo great an Happineſs.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. We read how <hi>Joſiah going out to Battel
was ſlain before Necho King of Egypt:</hi> Now <hi>Joſiah</hi> was ſo
good a King, ſo right-hearted toward his God, ſo Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and ſo zealous of his Honour, that it is generally
concluded, He was ſlain not for <hi>His own,</hi> but for the ſins
of <hi>His People,</hi> inſomuch that ſome conceive <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
made his Lamentations with Order unto him.</p>
            <p>That Soveraign, whoſe <hi>Murther</hi> we this Day Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate,
He was never ſo much <hi>Charls le Grand,</hi> as He was
<hi>le Bon.</hi> He was never ſo Great as he was Good, He was
(to ſay no more) as Gold tried in the Fire, exact and pure;
or, as <hi>Saul</hi> for <hi>height,</hi> even ſo, He for <hi>Piety</hi> was far above
his Brethren: and yet even He could not ſtand before His
Enemies! The Lord went not out with <hi>His Armies,</hi> He
fell, as did <hi>good Joſiah</hi> before the Uncircumcized: And
why ſo? Was it for want of <hi>Valour?</hi> or <hi>Prudence?</hi> or
Skill in <hi>Feates of War?</hi> No, He had all theſe! what then?
Truly it was, becauſe the <hi>Sins of His Party</hi> fought ſtronger
againſt Heaven, than their Armes could do againſt the
Rebels! The lowd <hi>Volly of Oaths</hi> diſcharged againſt God
Himſelf! The <hi>Drink Offerings</hi> of the Mighty! The <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
Plunders,</hi> and <hi>abominable Exactions</hi> done in his
Name! This made our King miſcarry, this prevented
<pb facs="tcp:94516:12"/>
God, from going out with our Hoſts; <hi>Theſe Achans</hi> ſo
troubled our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that as God the Son, <hi>King of the Jews,</hi>
was ſmitten, wounded and ſlain for the Tranſgreſſions of
<hi>His</hi> People; Even ſo the Tranſgreſſions of His People,
the ſin of his <hi>Three full, and flouriſhing Kingdoms,</hi> theſe
were the Provocations, and theſe a great cauſe, why God
took away ſo <hi>great</hi> a bleſſing, and delivered into <hi>Bloody
Hands</hi> ſo innocent a KING.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Sam. 12. 25, If ye ſhall do wickedly, ye ſhall be conſumed,
both ye and your King.</hi> It is not ſaid if <hi>ye</hi> and <hi>your King</hi> do
wickedly, then ſhall <hi>both</hi> be deſtroyed; but it is onely
ſaid, <hi>If ye ſhall do wickedly,</hi> yet <hi>both</hi> ye and your King ſhall
be conſumed.</p>
            <p>Whence it clearly appears to me, that the <hi>provocation
of a people,</hi> and the ſins of a Nation they may, and oft have
a great influence upon the <hi>death of a King,</hi> and that a King
may be taken away, not ſo much <hi>for his</hi> own, as <hi>for their</hi>
Tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>And therefore I beſeech you all in the name and fear of
God; if it onely be that you may live <hi>peaceably</hi> and <hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,</hi>
and every man ſit quietly under his own vine, and
comfortably eat the fruit of his <hi>own labours,</hi> let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
forbear any longer to provoke our God: Foraſmuch
as <hi>ſwearing,</hi> and <hi>whoring,</hi> and <hi>drinking, prophane</hi> and <hi>ungodly
Ryots;</hi> Foraſmuch as doing wickedly may again provoke
God to conſume both us and our King: let us upon this
day of ſolemn Humiliation and Faſting, for the <hi>glory of our
God,</hi> for the <hi>ſafety of our King,</hi> for that <hi>ſad ſhare</hi> which we
contributed toward this ſo foul a murther: let us ſow in
tears that we may reap in joy: let us henceforth abhor,
at leaſt <hi>thoſe ſins</hi> which gave the <hi>Rebellious</hi> an <hi>advantage!</hi>
thoſe ſins which gave occaſion to the <hi>Enimies of the Lord</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94516:12"/>
for to blaſpheme and to ſay, the Kings Friends they were
onely <hi>Libertines, Papiſts, Atheiſts, horrible Swearers, and
Blaſphemers, Enimies to God and the power of Godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech you for Gods ſake, that all who profeſs <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi>
may <hi>profeſs piety;</hi> that <hi>Fear God and honour the King</hi>
may be as cloſe in our hearts, as we find they ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Book of God; and then I am ſure we ſhall ever
prevent this firſt guilt, <hi>the provoking</hi> of God to take away,
or to permit the murther of our King.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>A ſecond conſequential Conſent,</hi> or <hi>previous</hi>
diſpoſition to the deſtruction of Gods Annointed, it was
<hi>The deſerting of him. Non obſtans,</hi> the not preventing, the
not bindring of it, whilſt yet it was in our power. And
this is an undoubted way of contracting guilt from the ſin
of others: he who <hi>hinders</hi> not what he may, and where
<hi>he is bound,</hi> doubtleſs he is <hi>volitum in cauſa,</hi> of what effect
followeth upon this culpable neglect. As for inſtance, he
who ſtands or ſits before <hi>a window,</hi> thorow which the wind
blows and the ſnow or rain beats, if he will neither <hi>remove</hi>
thence, nor pull to the <hi>cazement,</hi> he is undoubtedly a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter
to his own wetting, and a conſequential willer of
his own cold-taking: for he both might and ought to
have prevented it. That <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother,</hi> who by a
timely and ſeaſonable correction might have kept their
children from lewd and vile courſes, and have not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
it; ſuch parents they have <hi>a guilt</hi> even in their
tranſgreſſions, even in the miſdemeanors of <hi>ſuch children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. you ſhall find God threatens a judgment
upon old <hi>Eli, becauſe his ſons made themſelves vile, and he
restrained them not:</hi> becauſe old <hi>Eli</hi> hindred not when he
might, the Lord imputeth a portion of his ſons ſin even
unto him: Now to apply this to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94516:13"/>
Firſt, Had the people of this Nation kept cloſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly
to <hi>their Allegiance and their Oaths,</hi> there had
been no Riſing; had they kept thoſe <hi>cazements</hi> as they
were, cloſe ſhut, the Tempeſt of War and the Storms of
Blood had never broken in; yea, had they clapt them to,
when they <hi>firſt opened</hi> there had been an end. For, (to
ſpeak in the phraſe of our <hi>Royal Martyr</hi>) When the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of Rebellion</hi> firſt turn'd himſelf into an <hi>Angel of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi>
Whilſt yet the Religious Mask of the <hi>Godly Party</hi>
had but one <hi>Presbyterian Face</hi> to cover, the Vizard might
eaſily have been knockt off, before numerous Faces, and
many Factions appeared under at firſt but <hi>one godly Hood,</hi>
before the Prince of Darkneſs transformed himſelf into
an whole <hi>Firmament of New Lights,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> (in the right
ſenſe) might have been <hi>ſecur'd:</hi> For at firſt what <hi>Eliſha</hi>
ſaid to his Servant, was with us moſt true; <hi>There was more
for us than was againſt us,</hi> more for than againſt the King.
But with a <hi>Non Obstante;</hi> for not uſing the means and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
they had, for not preferring a publick and Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
before their own; by omitting the duty, which
Oaths and Allegiance obliged to, we <hi>betray'd</hi> our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
and by not reſtraining and <hi>Helping</hi> when we might,
we became <hi>Volitum in Cauſa,</hi> even upon this account conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially
guilty even of our Soveraign's Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We cannot but know, how it was the common Allarm
of every factious Trumpet, the Vulgar Theam of every</hi>
Rebellious <hi>Pulpit!</hi> Curſe ye Meroz, ſaith the Angel of the
Lord, curſe ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they
come not to the Help of the Lord, to the Help of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Mighty. <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 23.</p>
            <p>Now if our Adverſaries Judges (to ſpeak in their own
words, and out of one of their Catechiſms) <hi>Neuters are
<pb facs="tcp:94516:13"/>
Directly under that fearful Curſe, which the Angel of the
Lord denounced againſt Meroſh,</hi> Rom. <hi>pag.</hi> 7. I ſay then,
if they who came not out and defended <hi>their Rebellious
Cauſe;</hi> if the Mighty for not fighting againſt the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Cauſe of His <hi>Anointed,</hi> deſerved a Curſe, and
were (as they affirm) <hi>Directly</hi> under that <hi>fearful</hi> execration
which the Angel of the Lord denounced.</p>
            <p>Certainly then <hi>a fortiori;</hi> Thoſe who were wanting
in a far better Cauſe; Thoſe who <hi>deſerted</hi> their Soveraign,
thoſe who came not out to the Help of <hi>Him,</hi> whom by
the <hi>Oath of God</hi> they were bound to ſuccour, thoſe who
to ſave their own <hi>Penny,</hi> cared not to ſee him loſe his
<hi>Crown!</hi> Theſe for not uſing the power and means they
had, though they did not ſpill, they <hi>betray'd</hi> his blood;
and though they were not direct Conſenters, yet they were
direct <hi>strengthners</hi> of their Hands who did it.</p>
            <p>Now if it be ſo, That the Son of Man, when in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a <hi>King</hi> ſitting upon his Throne of rich Glory, He
ſhall paſs an <hi>everlaſting</hi> curſe upon the ſins of <hi>Omiſſion,</hi>
that is, upon ſuch who Reliev'd him not, no not in His
pooreſt Members: if for not ſeeding <hi>the Hungry,</hi> for not
<hi>cloathing the Naked,</hi> for not <hi>viſiting the impriſoned,</hi> if for
omitting <hi>Acts of Charity</hi> Chriſt ſhall Denounce the ſad
Sentence of everlaſting Fire; certainly then, Subjects o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<hi>Acts of Juſtice,</hi> Subjects not doing their bounden
duties, Subjects neglecting the King of Glory in his Chief,
and moſt <hi>immediate Deputy,</hi> the Lords anointed: they have
a great deal of cauſe to <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>grieve,</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
this <hi>Grand Omiſſion,</hi> and this great failing may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
to Them: For, he who hinders not when he <hi>may,</hi>
and when he is <hi>Bound,</hi> cannot but be guilty of the Blood
he might have ſaved, and of that ſin, which he both ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:94516:14"/>
and might have prevented. And therefore, whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<hi>our Provocations</hi> of God Almighty by our Perſonal
miſdoings, or the <hi>Omiſſion of our Duty</hi> by our not doing,
in both reſpects the moſt of us have been conſequential
Conſenters, and contradicted guilt enough <hi>to be this day</hi>
humbled, and beg Gods pardon, though not for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet for the ſlaughter of our King. And ſo I have done
with the firſt Propoſition, to wit, <hi>How a Man may be guilty
of that ſin in which he was no actor,</hi> by being (as you have
heard) a conſequential Conſenter to it. We ſhall now
therefore paſs to the Second.</p>
            <p>II. That is, to prove and ſhew, <hi>How a guilt may be
postnate unto a Fact,</hi> for after the ſtoning of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>
it is obſerved, and not before, <hi>That Saul was conſenting to
His Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt Verſe of the preceding Chapter it is written,
when St. <hi>Stephen</hi> had <hi>kneeled down and prayed</hi> for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
<hi>He fell aſleep,</hi> ſo that Dead he was before theſe
words were added, <hi>And Saul was conſenting, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Two Ways I ſhall obſerve how Guilt may come
in at the back Door, and be <hi>poſtnate</hi> unto the Fact. 1. By
<hi>applauding the Deed,</hi> by commending, liking and joying in
it. <hi>2dly.</hi> By <hi>partaking in the Advantages,</hi> and by a Tacit
Deſire rather the Act ſhould be done, than they want the
Benefit and the Reſt they have got by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He who applauds, commends, likes and joys in a foul
Tranſaction, he is a Conſenter to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qui laudat obſcoenum, perpetrat illud.</hi> He who praiſeth
a piece of obſcenity, he acts <hi>it,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Arabians.</hi> And
indeed <hi>Conſent</hi> and <hi>Commendation</hi> they are ſo nigh Related,
that we never heartily commend what we like not, and
ſo alike, are Conſent and Liking, that they are not eaſily
<pb facs="tcp:94516:14"/>
diſtinguiſhed; for as He who frowns, or turns his Ear
from a ſeeming witty piece of lewdneſs, in ſo doing checks
it; even ſo He who laughs, and ſmiles, and ſeems pleaſed
with it, ſo far as he is pleaſed, ſo far he is a Conſenter to
it. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns the impure Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques
even upon This account, that they were not onely
vile themſelves, but they alſo <hi>took pleaſure in them that did
ſuch things,</hi> Rom. 1. 32. And indeed St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſin here,
according to the Original, it ſeems onely a complacency
and a liking, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and therefore as in luſt, even ſo it
is in point of Blood; He who applauds the Murther, He
who <hi>is glad 'tis done,</hi> He who praiſes and honours <hi>the Doers
of it,</hi> (though he had no Hand in the doing of it) hath a
Conſenting Heart to the Deed done, and is in the Eye of
the Juſt God, <hi>Guilty of it!</hi> For indeed there is no Body
joys, and praiſes, and is glad to hear any Thing is done,
but if he durſt, even he himſelf would have done it. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<hi>Saul</hi> in my Text, though caſually he was onely a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter,
he could as willingly have been an <hi>Aider</hi> or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant
to St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s death.</p>
            <p>In the Caſe of King <hi>Ahab</hi> and poor <hi>Naboth,</hi> we do not
read that <hi>Ahab</hi> had any intelligence or inckling given him
of <hi>Jeſabel</hi>'s bloody deſign; all was acted and done, the
<hi>High Court of Iuſtice</hi> had ſped their villany, and diſpatcht
the Innocent before he knew it; and yet for all that, the
Prophet is ſent to arreſt and charge him guilty of plain
Murther, <hi>Occidisti, Thou haſt killed.</hi> Now I pray how
could he be guilty of a death <hi>he knew not of,</hi> of a Murder
done altogether unknown to him? Truly if you ſearch
the Story, you ſhall find it onely was by a <hi>poſtnate Conſent,</hi>
by a liking, and approving, and joying what <hi>Jeſabel</hi> had
done. There is a Story of one <hi>Lucius Carpentus</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:94516:15"/>
kill'd <hi>Nicanor,</hi> by running him thorow, his Page who
deadly hated him, after his Maſter had diſpatcht him, he
to ſhow his well-liking of the fact, thruſt in his Maſters
Sword deeper into the dead Heart. Now though the Page
could not poſsibly kill him again, yet he by <hi>thus doing,</hi> and
thus confirming and approving what his Maſter had done,
he became a Murtherer as well as his Maſter.</p>
            <p>It is very well known the Lord of Glory, Chriſt Jeſus
our <hi>Spiritual King,</hi> He can die no more, <hi>Death can have no
more Dominion over him,</hi> Heb. 6. 6. and yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaith, <hi>They who fall away,</hi> that is, ſuch as fall off
from the Faith of Him, <hi>They crucifie to themſelves the Son
of God afreſh:</hi> So that at this very day to ſay as the Jews
did and do, That Chriſt was an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> that He was a
<hi>Deceiver,</hi> that He was <hi>justly</hi> arraigned, condemned, and
crucified; This is by a <hi>poſtnate Conſent</hi> to render us guilty
of his Blood, and to crucifie aſreſh the Lord of Glory:
This is to Thruſt the <hi>Nails</hi> into his Hands and Feet again,
this is (as the Page did his Maſters Sword) to run the <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
Spear</hi> into his Heart again!</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Ahab</hi> by approving what <hi>Jeſabel</hi> had done;
The Page by confirming what his Maſter <hi>Carpentus</hi> had
acted, the Apoſtates by owning and commending what the
<hi>Jews</hi> did; Are all by poſtnate Conſents, guilty of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Murthers acted to their Hands; even ſo, of the cruel
and barbarous Murder of our King (our King of moſt
bleſſed and happy Memory) they muſt all be as was <hi>Saul</hi>
to the Death of <hi>Stephen, Conſenters;</hi> who either <hi>rejoyced</hi>
at his Death, <hi>applauded</hi> the deed, or ſo far countenance
the Villany, as to <hi>ſlaunder</hi> the Foot ſteps of Gods anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to juſtifie his arraignment! or who dared in their
Hearts to ſay He ſuffered as a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> a <hi>Traytor,</hi> and a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.</hi>

               <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 10. 3. The vulgar Latin thus renders it. <hi>Quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
laudatur peccator in Deſideriis Animae ſuae, &amp; iniquus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicitur,</hi>
&amp;c. Becauſe the ſinner is praiſed in the deſires
of his Soul, and the unjuſt Man is bleſſed, therefore is
God exaſperated.</p>
            <p>To call evil good, to praiſe the deſires of the wicked,
to bleſs the unjuſt, this is a ready way to contract a ſhare
in their Iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 22. When <hi>Herod</hi> making a <hi>blaſphemous Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
had the Peoples applauſe for it; this their praiſe was
a <hi>ſinful conſenting to,</hi> and an owning of his Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. The <hi>Jews</hi> being pleas'd that <hi>Herod</hi> killed <hi>James,</hi>
by this became involved in the blood of <hi>James:</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi>
in my Text, by <hi>Countenancing</hi> the Executioners, and ſuch
as did, became himſelf a guilty Conſenter to St. <hi>Stephens</hi>
Death.</p>
            <p>Thoſe then, who when our <hi>bleſſed King</hi> was Murthered,
ſtuck not to ſay, now was our <hi>Achan,</hi> the troubler of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
taken out of the way; thoſe who to blind the indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Villany, Perjury</hi> and <hi>Treaſon</hi> of thoſe deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who dared to Murder the Lords Anointed: Thoſe (I
ſay) who to palliate and juſtifie their abominations, laid
all the Blood and Guilt and miſchief upon the Innocent,
upon their ſuffering and Martyr'd King; thoſe who cryed
him down, as <hi>Caput Malignantium,</hi> the head of Tyranny!
but cryed up his Perſecutors as the <hi>Saints of the Earth!</hi>
Thoſe who laid <hi>His Honor</hi> in the Duſt, but advanced theirs
to the <hi>Higheſt Heavens,</hi> thoſe who did thus juſtifie the
wicked, trample upon and condemn the righteous; they
did more than <hi>Saul</hi> in my Text: for he only kept what
Cloaths they had; but theſe, they cloathed the Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with Majeſty and Honor, and therefore if <hi>Saul</hi> for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb facs="tcp:94516:16"/>
the Cloaths of the Executioners to lie at his feet
was a <hi>Conſenter</hi> to St. <hi>Stephens</hi> death: theſe who did dare

the Seed of the Rebellious, His <hi>Highneſs,</hi> the Joy of the

be deeper in guilt than was <hi>Saul,</hi> and therefore Conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
becauſe ſuch <hi>Countenancers</hi> of his death! amongſt us
Men, we doubt not for to ſay, he who <hi>really intends,</hi> but is

miſchief.</p>
            <p>Thoſe 40. who bound themſelves under a Curſe, not
to eat or drink till they had killed the Conſenter in my
Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 12. til they had killed <hi>Paul,</hi> though <hi>Paul</hi>
was reſcued, yet they were guilty; for they had already
committed Murther in their hearts. The Husbandmen

            </p>
            <p>After his Sentence and Condemnation, ſome (who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
were not at his Tryal) were at his Paſſion or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Now if they who gave No conſent toward his
death, did, whilſt yet dying, or dead, revile, mock or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
him, if they were in their number who when he was
dead, ſaid to <hi>Pilate,</hi> Sir, This Impoſtor, or this <hi>Deceiver,</hi>
ſaid thus or thus; This deriſion, this ſcornful joy, and this
reviling of him dead, made them alſo Conſenters, and
guilty of his death.</p>
            <p>Thoſe then, whoſe foul Hearts have yet an evil Eye,
thoſe who call Murtherers, Martyrs; and Unrighteous
Judges, The Beloved of the Lord! Thoſe who love to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and to hear Him Leſſened who was the greateſt Loſs
that ever Our Three Kingdoms ſuffered! Such, becauſe
they cannot waſh their Hands in innocence, they ought to
waſh their Hearts in penitence; for what Subject ſoever
doth not perfectly abhor, he is in ſome meaſure a liker, and
and ſo a kind of Conſenter to his death; either by applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Doers, or by a tacit commending, liking, and
joying in the deed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As by applauding the Actors, commending, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or joying in the Act, there is a culpable Conſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 26. even ſo by partaking in the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
in the Rapine and ill-gotten goods iſſuing from that
death, there is a ſinful and wicked Conſent involved. <hi>Cui
prodeſt ſcelus is fecit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. When <hi>Jeſabel</hi> had diſpatcht poor <hi>Naboth,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94516:17"/>
had <hi>Ahab</hi> abhorr'd the Vineyard, had <hi>Ahab</hi> took no poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
had not <hi>Ahab</hi> entred upon his Inheritance, we might
then have juſtly thought <hi>Naboths</hi> death had been wholly
<hi>Jeſabels,</hi> not at all his will. But when we find that he who
was Sick while <hi>Naboth</hi> lived, was inſtantly Recovered
when <hi>Naboth</hi> was dead; when we find how that <hi>Ahab</hi> as
to an Inheritance new fallen, haſtens to poſſeſs what Blood
and Murder gave him Title to: This is a clear demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
his content was full, and he muſt needs be a Conſenter
to his death.</p>
            <p>In the crucifying and murthering of the Son of God, the
firſt Motive to a Conſult or Conſent, it was the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>Matth. 21. 28. This is the Heir, let us kill him that the
Inheritance may be ours.</hi> Now as he who killeth for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
continues on him the guilt of that Blood ſo long
as he enjoyeth that Inheritance, that being the deſign and
complement of his Murther. Even ſo, <hi>Qui Ratum habet
factum,</hi> He who approves a Murder done in his Name, and
manifeſteth that approbation by ſharing in the prey, and
the advantages of that Murder, he by Ratification makes
the deed his own; and as oft as he makes a beneficial uſe
of that Blood, <hi>Blood toucheth Blood,</hi> and he is a Conſenter
in that Blood.</p>
            <p>Now the Murther which <hi>at This Time</hi> we are to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for, the execrable <hi>Beheading of Gods Anointed,</hi> it was
done in Our Name, the Curſed and Illegal Indictment it
was drawn up in the Name of <hi>The People of England.</hi> Now
if in Law, <hi>Qui ratum habet factum Mandanti aequiparatur.</hi>
If he who approves a miſchief done in his Name, and for
his Intereſt, is look'd upon as a Commander of it: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
then whoſoever hath not diſowned, or is ſo far from
diſowning, that he ſhall make a beneficial and glad uſe of
<pb facs="tcp:94516:17"/>
this Murther, he thereby ſo ratifies, that he owns the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and as <hi>Ahab</hi> at <hi>Naboths</hi> death, is very well pleaſed
and content the deed was done.</p>
            <p>Amongſt us men we cannot meaſure <hi>Intentions</hi> but only
by <hi>outward proofs;</hi> but the Seer of all Secrets, He who ſhall
judge the World even for the <hi>abstruſeſt Crimes,</hi> He ſhall
judge according to the Boſom, and the hidden Influence,
according to thoſe likings and thoughts of heart which we
have, but perchance fear or ſhame to diſcover.</p>
            <p>As for inſtance, They who would rather a King ſhould
loſe his <hi>Head,</hi> than they the <hi>Crown Land;</hi> loſe all His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and Honour, than they their preſent Juſticeſhip and
Power; they who would rather the Son of God ſhould be
crucified a freſh, than they part with their ſins: Such in
the ſight of our Juſt and All-ſeeing God, they are liable
to theſe deaths, and ſhall be ſadly accountable for the
guilt of them.</p>
            <p>It is not yet ſo long, but we may very well remember
thoſe who did this foul deed, they made it their work to
draw in as many Conſenters as poſſible. For, firſt there
was a <hi>Subſcription,</hi> then there was an <hi>Engagement,</hi> then a
<hi>Recognition,</hi> all tending to the Ratification of this Murther.
A Sanhedrim or Council there was of Forty, a Readmiſſion
to the Houſe; but none might have this Priviledge or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but he muſt firſt ſubſcribe; places of Truſt, Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
other mens good Livings, Promotions, and Offices
of profit, none might have without an <hi>Engagement againſt
King and Lords:</hi> Yea the Capital Head of this Miſchief,
He for whoſe Riſe the King was Ruin'd, muſt have a <hi>Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now put the Caſe thus. Suppoſe the <hi>Great Sultan,</hi> the
Grand Seignior, the Turk, had made a Conqueſt of this
<pb facs="tcp:94516:18"/>
Nation, and would admit no Man to any place of Truſt or
Profit, no, nor to enjoy his own, unleſs he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
that the <hi>Jews did well in putting their King and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
to Death!</hi> I beſeech you lay your hands upon
your hearts, and ſeriouſly judge, if this ſubſcription were
not (let the mental Reſervation be what it may) a ſenſible
Ratification, or a Conſenting to his Death.</p>
            <p>Now if ſo, how ſhall they avoid, the being at leaſt
ſeeming Conſenters to the death and blood of our dread
bleſſed Soveraign, who meerly to feed their ambition, and
to become what they were never Bred nor Born to, Lords
over their Brethren, and Controulers of all about them,
ſubſcribed the guilt, and greedily ſhared, either in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
authority, or revenue, which was all his; for if we
juſtly charge the <hi>Pope</hi> for being a guilty Conſenter to <hi>ſtews</hi>
and <hi>Brothel</hi>-houſes, becauſe he takes a <hi>Salary</hi> and <hi>Revenue</hi>
from them; or, if we juſtly ſay, they who eat of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
though they never come at the Shrine, are guilty
Conſenters to the <hi>Idolatry!</hi> certainly in like and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proportion, thoſe who have been partakers in any of
the <hi>Royal Ruines!</hi> Thoſe who have cemented their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
with the <hi>Kings Blood,</hi> and have ſecretly deprecated
and prayed againſt the Return of any of His; theſe, though
they may and have avoided the Law, they have yet a God
to reckon with, before whom ſuch a Conſenter ſhall not
dare to plead <hi>net guilty,</hi> but how deep in guilt that muſt
be our laſt conſiderable, in which I promiſed to ſhew.</p>
            <p>III. Conſent may contract ſo deep a guilt, that without
hearty confeſſion, and an unfeigned contrition, it may hale the
vengeance of an actor upon the Conſenters head.</p>
            <p>The Senſes, the Members, and all the Natural actions
and performances of the Body, they are indeterminately
<pb facs="tcp:94516:18"/>
conſidered indifferent; they are in themſelves nor good
nor evil, it is our conſent that makes them <hi>morally</hi> all
they are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 'Tis our conſent that makes our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, ſervants either to <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> or <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;</hi>
The eye of man it may be the inſtrument either
of admiration or of luſt; yea, the very heart it ſelf it
may be the ſeat, either of <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Uncharitableneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſo be then we would apprehend how our ſtate ſtands
in <hi>Foro Interno,</hi> in the Court of Conſcience and the eye
of God, we muſt begin at <hi>Heart,</hi> and look within.</p>
            <p>David <hi>a good King could tell us, he had Subjects, the</hi>
Words of whoſe Mouth were ſmoother than Butter, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.
21, <hi>even then, when</hi> Warr was at the Heart; <hi>their words
were</hi> ſmoother than Oil, <hi>yet</hi> were they drawn Swords.</p>
            <p>Men may appear, (and our Martyr'd King ſadly found
it ſo) like Saints and Angels, talking of nothing, but of
Reformation, Religion in Purity, and the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
when God knows within, their hearts were full of
malice; God not in all their thoughts, nor did they aim
at any thing more, than Intereſt and Deſtruction!</p>
            <p>Now albeit it ſo is, that Figg-leaves, and Sheeps cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may blind the Eyes of Men, God will not, God
cannot be ſo mocked! Look what we are at heart, look
what we are within, look what is conſented to agreed on
and concluded in the moſt ſecret <hi>Receſſes</hi> of the Soul, by
that God judgeth, and to that we ſhall ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Actus exterior nihil Malitiae addit interiori.</hi> The School
well obſerves, though the outward act may be the <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,</hi>
it cannot be the Author of any more miſchief than
what in the Soul is contrived and conſented to; ſo that
conſent is a compleat guilt, and therefore I have ſhewed
you, Conſent may make an Adulterer, and yet the body,
<pb facs="tcp:94516:19"/>
not touch a Woman; Malice may make a Murtherer,
and yet the hand do no Violence; Soul may be guilty of
the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and throw never a ſtone at him.</p>
            <p>The Point then is, how deep a guilt conſent may be,
and we ſhall find it deep enough to carry an impenitent
ſoul to eternal ſorrows. Pſal. 50. 18. <hi>When thou ſaweſt
a Thief then thou conſenteſt with him.</hi> To conſent but to a
piece of Theevery; it is guilt enough, yea guilt in ſuch a
meaſure, that it is numbred among thoſe ſins, for the
which God threatens to <hi>Tear in Pieces without Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:</hi>
Now if a conſent in theft may amount to this, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a conſent in blood, and that blood heightned by
the greateſt circumſtances incident to Blood, to wit, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and Innocence! A conſent (I ſay) in the ſhedding of
ſuch blood, it muſt needs be aggravated, and indeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be extenuated, but by the weakneſs, and the little mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of conſent.</p>
            <p>1 Epiſt. of St. <hi>John,</hi> ch. 3. v. 15. The beloved Diſciple
had no ſooner ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever hateth his Brother is a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer;</hi>
But then he immediately adds, and <hi>no Murtherer
hath Eternal Life abiding in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No Murtherer.</hi> A learned Neoterick well upon that
place obſerves Murther is committed—<hi>Non tantum occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
is Manu, ſed etiam odient is Animo</hi>—Homing n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> only by
the Hand, but by the Mind; ſo that even a <hi>mental Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer;</hi>
a conſenter, but no acter: a willer, but no doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>:

               <hi>it</hi> in the ſtate of damnation! a Perſon
in whom (he ſo continuing) the hope of Eternal Life is
not. Evidence enough that Conſent alone may involve in
a deep guilt.</p>
            <p>What then Remains? Truly this only, that where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Once</hi> was, <hi>Contrition</hi> may for ever be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94516:19"/>
               <hi>Saul</hi> in my Text, (whilſt yet <hi>Saul,</hi> whilſt yet a Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter)
he made nothing of conſenting, no not of putting
<hi>a Saint to Death.</hi> But when he became a Convert, one of
the firſt ſignal Teſtimonies he gives, is, the confeſſion of
his guilt contracted even at St. <hi>Stephens</hi> death.</p>
            <p>Acts 22. 20. <hi>Lord, when the Blood of thy Martyr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen
was ſhed, I alſo was ſtanding by and conſenting to his
Death, and kept the Rayment of them that ſlew him.</hi> When
of a <hi>Saul</hi> he became a <hi>Paul,</hi> when his Soul was ſoftened,
and his Heart changed, behold him <hi>Vir Dolorum,</hi> a Man of
Sorrows; a Man whoſe very Soul is troubled for looking
on, for ſtanding by, for conſenting, yea for that little coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
he gave in keeping the Rayment of them that ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him. How much then, in the Name of God, ought
every of us to be humbled and grieved for the Provocations
by which we have moved God to permit this Villany!
For our not doing in time what might have ſtopt this <hi>Blood!</hi>
For applauding the Doers! For liking the Deed! Or
when for our own Intereſt and Advantage we have ſecretly
rather wiſh'd it ſo than otherwiſe! Did Time or Place
ſerve, I might now do well to inforce this Argument from
a Bare Conſent, to ſuch a Full Conſent as includes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
Plotting, Counſelling, Commanding, Contributing
and Acting. For if a weak poſtnate and bare Conſent
may (as ye have heard) contract a guilt, certainly then as
Conſents have been heightned, ſo muſt needs the guilt.
Thoſe who have made it their work to prepare the way for
ſo foul a Murther, thoſe who preached and printed down
their King for a <hi>Mad-man</hi> or a <hi>Fool,</hi> comparing him to a
Pilot whoſe endeavour was to ſink his Ship, and to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
who planted his Ordinance againſt his own Army,
that ſo he might be (as he was) firſt diſarmed. Thoſe who
<pb facs="tcp:94516:20"/>
made it their work to run about with ſlanders, and ſpread
lying diſparagements throughout the Nation, onely to
weaken the Repute, and make their King deſpicable. Thoſe
who to ſave themſelves, laid all their own guilt upon his
ſhoulders. And thoſe, who when He had for peace-ſake
<hi>own'd the Debts which he never contracted,</hi> and was content
to preface a Treaty of Peace with his own Infamy: Thoſe
I ſay who took this advantage for a Confeſſion, and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all their cloſer Machinations of his Death upon this
Bottom.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and every of theſe, are Actors in ſo ſad a guilt,
that it behoves ſuch, not onely as did <hi>David</hi> (for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of a Subject onely) go mourning all the day long;
but they ought to do ſo all their lives long, praying and
praying again, yea they ought to importune others to pray
both with them and for them, that their foul Hearts may
happily be cleanſed in That KINGS Blood which is onely
able to waſh off This Kings Blood.</p>
            <p>In a word to cloſe all. It is obſerved of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that
after he became a Convert, and of the Right Side, after he
was truly ſenſible of the Diſhonour done to his King then
in glory; None of all his moſt Faithful Adherents out-did
him in Pains and Diligence for the Recovery and Advance
of the Glory of his Maſter: for now we find him at that
pitch, that he profeſſeth to value Nothing like to it, ſaying,
<hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory ſave in the Croſs of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6. 14. and, <hi>I determined not to know any
thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and Him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor.
2. 2.</p>
            <p>All then I ſhall add, is, That we alſo expreſs our Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, by a moſt loyal and double diligence,
that ſo our King who dyed a <hi>Martyr,</hi> may be found a
<pb facs="tcp:94516:20"/>
               <hi>Prophet</hi> alſo, for in thoſe excellent Meditations (fit to be
read and peruſed upon this Day) He tells his Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>His pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
Rebels, Thoſe that Repent of any Defects in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
toward him, them ſhould he find truly zealous to repay
with Intereſt their Loyalty and Love:</hi> and the good God
grant they may; and that not only they, but even all we,
duly conſidering whoſe Authority the King hath, may ſo
faithfully ſerve, and humbly obey him in God, and for God,
that God may be a God of peace to us, and to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
even from Generation to Generation!</p>
            <p>Theſe, O God, and all other Bleſſings in thy Wiſdom
known expedient even for our Eternal Welfare, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beg, even for His ſake who was a King murthered by
His Subjects, even Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous: To whom
with Thee and the Holy Ghoſt be all Honour and Glory
now and for ever. AMEN.</p>
