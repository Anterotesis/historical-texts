            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a few Years gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the World so
many-Books of His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and these have
been so much read and so well
received, that it seems he thinks
he is now so far possessed of the
esteem of the Age, that he may
venture to impose upon it the
falsest coyn that can be struck,
not doubting but that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60976:3"/>
name <hi>Varillas</hi> stampt upon it
will make it pass current, and
this being a time in which some
have thought that they might
doe whatsoever they pleased a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those of the Religion, he
it seems thinks he may likewise
say whatsoever he pleased against
them, that so there may be a
due proportion between the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
that he does them with
his pen, and those that others
make them feel with severer
tools, and perhaps he thought
the severities that are now exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
upon them, are so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to that tenderness with which
the humane Nature, not to say
the Christian Religion, is apt
to inspire all that are not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with such violent Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that they drown the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60976:3"/>
of our bowels towards the
miserable, that nothing could
divert the World from those
merciful inclinations but the
dressing up the first beginnings
of the Reformation in such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
representations as might
possess the Age with so much
fury against them, that none of
the miseries that they suffer,
might create the least Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for them.</p>
            <p>It is true, Princes have their
Prerogatives with which they
take great liberties as their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
passions are excited and
dextrously managed, the desire of
glory mixing with a heat of
blood, at one time can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a w<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, as terrible in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
as it was injustifiable
in its first beginnings, and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60976:4"/>
same ambition mixing with a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
disposition of mind,
and working upon colder Blood,
can at another time produce a
violation of Edicts that have been
solemnly sworn to, and often
confirmed, and accompany that
with a sequel of Severities, that
are more easily lamented than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
yet an humble regard to
the sublime character of a
Crown'd Head lays a restraint
on those Groans, which we
would rather stifle than give
them their full scope, least the
language of our Sorrows look like
an accusing of those, whom, after
all that our brethren have suffered
at their hands, we would still
force our selves to reverence, and
therfore we choose rather to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
our grief, than to vent it at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60976:4"/>
their cost. But small Scriblers,
who have set a price upon their
pens, and sacrifice our reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they may merite a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
at the hands of the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of our Brethrens suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
are not to look for such res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect:
he that fights against the
Laws of War ought to expect
no quarter when he is taken.</p>
            <p>A Historian that favours his
own side, is to be forgiven, thô
he puts a little too much life in
his colours, when he sets out
the best sides of his party, and
the worst of those from whom
he disfers: and if he but slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touches the failings of his
Friends, and severely aggravates
those of the other side, thô in
this he departs from the laws of
an exact Historian, yet this biass
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60976:5"/>
is so natural, that if it lessens the
credit of the Writer, yet it does
not blacken him, but if he has
no regard either to truth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
if he gives his imagination
a full scope to invent, and his pen
all the liberties of foul language,
he ought not to think it strange,
if others take some pains to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him to the World. And thô
their Conscience and Religion
obliges them to take other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
with relation to Truth, and
their Breeding engages them to a
strict modesty of Stile, yet if the
things that are said are as severe as
they are true, and as wounding
as they may appear soft, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what a Zeal for Truth,
and an Indignation at so much ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managed
injustice draws from
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60976:5"/>
It is not to be denied that Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> has an art of writing that
is entertaining he pretends to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
many Secrets to give pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Men to the life, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terweave
the Histories that he
relates with a thread of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
that is very agreable, only
this appears to be overdone, and
those who have had much prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
in humane Affairs see that
the conduct of the World is not
so steady and so regular a thing as
he loves to represent it, unlookt
for Accidents, the caprices of
some Tempers, the secrets of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and Jealousies, with other
particular Passions are the true
sources of almost all that is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
in the World; even Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
it self does not always govern
Mankind, but Humour and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60976:6"/>
have their turns, and oft
times the largest share in humane
affairs. So that I ever thought that
his books had too much of the air
of a Romance, and seemed too fine
to be true. He does indeed now
and then, to maintain his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his Reader's mind, vouch
some letter or narrative, but he
neither tells whither it is in Print,
or in Manuscript, or where he had
it, and where others may find it: so
this way of Citation looked suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
yet I could not easily take up
such hard thoughts of him as to
imagine, that all this was his own
Invention: but being in <hi>Paris</hi> last
Summer, I had the good fortune
to become acquainted with some
men of great probity, and that had
particularly applied themselves to
examine the History of France
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60976:6"/>
with great exactness; they were
of the Church of Rome, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to have no other dislike at
<hi>Mr. Varillas,</hi> but that which was
occasioned by the liberty, that he
had given himself, to writ his
own Imaginations for true Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
they assured me there was no
regard to be had to any thing that
he writ, that he had gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
many little stories, which
he knit together as he pleased, and
that without any good Authority:
and they told me that the greatest
number of the pieces he cited
were to be found now here but in
his own fancy. In a word, they
spoke of all his books with a
sharpness of stile, and a degree
of contempt, that I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat,
least I seem to come too near
his forms of speech, which are the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60976:7"/>
worst Patterns that one can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>I found he was generally so
much decried in <hi>Paris,</hi> that he
has reason to say in his Preface,
<hi>that when the Archbishop of</hi> Paris
<hi>thought on him, all the World had
abandoned him,</hi> for I did not find
any Man under a more universal
Contempt than he was, and the
esteem in which his Works were
held in Forreign Parts far beyond
what was paied them in <hi>France,</hi>
was imputed to his Method of
Writing, that wants none of the
beauties of History except that of
Truth, and to the Ignorance in
which Strangers live as to the
Particulars of their History. It is
true, at last he has found a Patron
and a Pension, and now he has
given us an Essay of his Merits;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60976:7"/>
but if this Work is examined se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,
he will very probably soon
lose his appointments; since mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
Pens are seldom paied
longer than they can be useful.
Here one finds so much occasion
for censure, that whereas in other
Books one must run up and down
to find matter for a Critical Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
here it occurs so copiously
that a Man must take care not to
surfeit his Reader with too much
of it; and therefore must choose
out the more remarkable Errours
and there are even so many of
these, that it is to be feared that
the World will not think him
not his Writings worth the time
and the pains that must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Maimbourg</hi> has set a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
to the World, that thô few
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60976:8"/>
wil care to imitate, yet it has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
so much with the present
Age, that it is no light indication
of its degeneracy, when surch
books are so much read and sold,
in which the Writer seems to
have so broken loose from all the
common measures either of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
or shame, that one would
wonder of what composition he
were made, if they did not know
that he has lived 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years the in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
Order: for as he has no regard
to truth, or likelyhood in what
he writs, so he seems to be proof
against the evidentest discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of his prevarications that
are possible; and when they are
laid open in a manner capable
of making any man besides
himself to blush, he neither
has the conscience to confess
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60976:8"/>
his errours, nor the sense of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to justify himself: but he
finds out still new matter to writ
on, and a new stock of <hi>Champaigne</hi>
wine, as I have been told, that
he has oft said, to make his blood
boil till he has spoild an other piece
of History; and he thinks a scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
period or two in a Preface is
enough to carry off all the shame
to which his errours ought to
condemn him. He has also the
Impudence to dedicate his books
to the King, and the world is
still willing to be cosened by him.
This trade has succeeded so well
with him, that it seems Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
vies with him in it, and as he
has the chaster stile, and the more
natural way of misleading his
Reader, so he has resolved not to
be behind him in a bold quality
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60976:9"/>
that I love not to set down by its
proper Name. But thô Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
has the art to refine upon the
pattern that Mr. <hi>Maimbourg</hi> set
him, yet Mr. <hi>Maimbourg</hi> is the
Author of the Invention, and
therefore he deserves the better
Pension.</p>
            <p>History is a sort of Trade in
which false Coyn and false
Weights are more criminal than
in other Matters; because the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
may go further and run lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
thô these Authors colour
their copper too slightly to make
it keep its credit long. If Men
think there are degrees of Lying,
then certainly those that are the
most loudly told, that wound the
deepest, that are told with the
best grace, and that are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Posterity under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60976:9"/>
colours of Truth, have the
blackest Guilt; but some Men
have arrived at equal degrees in
hardning their Consciences and
in steeling their Forheads, and
are without the reach either of
inward Remorses or publick Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries;
so that as <hi>Augustus</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
there was a charm in the
Pillour of a Roman, that died
hugely indebted, since without
an extraordinary saporiferous
composition he could not fancy
how such a Man could sleep se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely;
so if humane Nature did
not often produce some very irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Individuals, a Man that
feels the Authority that Truth
and Modesty have ever a pure
mind, can not easily imagine by
what secret others can quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
those Inclinations which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60976:10"/>
he finds are so prevalent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
But I will now by Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las's</hi>
leave take the liberty to set
before him some of his most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
errours, and thô I do
not expect much sincerity from
himself, yet I hope the world
will be juster than he has shewed
himself to be.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> begins his History
with a view of the progress of that
which he calls Heresy, in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
stile, setting, forth what
effects it was to produce, as if he
were foretelling what was to fall
out, and that for 11. pages (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Impression of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)</hi>
this has so little of the air of
a Historian, and is so full of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of a Declaimer, that it looks
liker the strain of a heated
and angry Fryer, than of a grave
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60976:10"/>
and serious Writer of History,
who ought to be always in cold
blood, and ought not to let the
heats of a vitious Rhetorick
transport him. But this is so
like one of the forced raptures of
some Missionary, that one would
think it was writ either by one
of them, or for one of them. It
is much a safer thing to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
concerning matters that are
past, than concerning those that
are to come, and one is less in
danger of committing errours;
yet when heat enters into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of History, and meets with
so vast a deal of Ignorance as
is that of Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if it carries him into great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had gathered the
History of the last Age out of any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60976:11"/>
Books or out of those Letters tha<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
he so often vouches,<note place="margin">pag. 5.</note> he could
not have said that <hi>Edward th<gap reason="illegible: in margin" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
6th's</hi> Tutor or Governour was
the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
since there is not any one Book
writ concerning that Time, that
does not shew the contrary. The
Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> was his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and for the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
thô the last two
Years of that Reign, in which
that King was past the Age of
Tutelage, he bore the chief sway
of affairs, yet he had neither the
Character of the King's Tutor or
Governour, nor any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
but only that of a Privy
Councellour, that was much
considered by him, and he at his
Death professed that he had been
always a Catholick in his Heart,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60976:11"/>
so that his pretending to be of the
Reformed Religion to serve his
interests, shews that he belongs
no more to our Church, than the
now forced Converts belong to
that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the same page he says that
<hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> did by
her Bastard Brother's persuasions
marry a single Gentleman, and
on the Margent he gives his
Name <hi>Henry d' Arley;</hi> this is a
new proof how little he knows
the Books of the last Age. This
<hi>Henry</hi> whom he calls <hi>d' Arley</hi>
was <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darly,</hi> eldest Son
to the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> which was
one of the chief Families of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and a Branch of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Stewarts.</hi> It is true it
came off from it before the
Crown came into it by Mariage,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60976:12"/>
yet the Grandfather of this <hi>Henry</hi>
had matched with one that was
very near the Crown, and Cosen
German to K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 4th's and
Sister to <hi>Hamilton</hi> Earl; of, <hi>Aran</hi>
this <hi>Lord Darly's</hi> Mother was also
Uterine Sister to K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 5.
being the Daughter to the Queen
Dowager of <hi>Scotland</hi> that was K.
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's Sister, who by her
second mariage with the Earl of
<hi>Angus (Dowglass)</hi> had Lady <hi>Isabel
Dowglass,</hi> who was bred in the
Court of <hi>England,</hi> and whom K.
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8. maried to the Earl of
<hi>Lennox,</hi> that had by her this Lord
<hi>Darly,</hi> who as he was the Queen
of <hi>Scotland's</hi> Cosin German, was
also the next Heir to the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> after her, and might
have been a dangerous Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
to her in that Succession, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60976:12"/>
been born and bred in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
so that this mariage was
so far from making her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
to her Subjects, that it
was considered as the wisest act
of her life: and Mr. <hi>Var.</hi> could not
Imagine any thing more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the Earl of <hi>Morny's</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
than to make him the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of so wise a choice. It is no
wonder to see Mr. <hi>Var.</hi> make so
bold with meaner persons, when
he takes so much liberty wiht the
Royal Family of <hi>England,</hi> as to
stain their descent, for which if the
consideration of the Crowns they
wear, did not restrain him, yet the
particular regard to the King that
now reigns, ought to have taught
him so much respect as not to
have ventured to blot his Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon
so far as to call his Great
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60976:13"/>
Grandfather a single Gentleman
and if he had payd the respect he
owed to the Memory of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Princess, he had no<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
enlarged so much on her Story,
but I know what is due to the
Memory of a crowned Head,
even when it is laid in ashes, and
thô he makes an easy weakness
to be her prevailing Character,
upon which he would discharge
all her Misfortunes, this Picture
is so different from the Truth that
she was certainly one of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest
and highest spirited Women
that ever lived.</p>
            <p>But it seems Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has
pretended to some Pension from
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
for the disappointment he
has resolved to debase the Race
all he can. Here he affords our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60976:13"/>
Kings the honour to be descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at least from a Gentleman,<note place="margin">Lib. 9.</note>
thô one of the ordin ariest sort;<note place="margin">Pag. 249.</note>
but upon another occasion he
is not so liberal, for in his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he says that <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th had
reasons to desire the mariage
of his Bastard Son the Duke of
<hi>Richmond</hi> with his Daughter
<hi>Mary,</hi> that were too well known,
for libels had been spread over all
<hi>Europe,</hi> reproaching him that his
Great Grandfather was not a
Gentleman, but that by his credit
at Court, and by the vast riches
that he had acquired, he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
leave to marry a Daughter
of the Family of the <hi>Plantaganets,</hi>
that was then 16. degrees distant
from the Crown, and yet by that
means his Grand-child came to
reign; upon which he makes a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60976:14"/>
long speculation concerning the
King's Reflections on that matter,
and the reasons that restrained
him from writing on that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as if it were an ordinary
thing for Princes to become their
own Heralds. He also tells us
how he comforted himself by
the remembrance of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Arbaces</hi> K. of <hi>Persia,</hi> that was
the Son of a Locksmith, whose
Posterity had reigned so long, and
with so much glory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he says he designed to marry
his Natural Son and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
together. Here is such a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Impertinencies, that it is
not easy to know at what one is
to begin, and if there were but
this one period, it is enough to let
the World see, how incapable
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is of writing History.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60976:14"/>
I shall not in this place shew the
falsehood of that Imputation on
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, that he designed
this incestuous Match, for that
will come in more property
upon another occasion; only if his
Birth was defective on his Great
Grandfathers side, it was an odd
method for the correcting of it, to
think of adding a new blot, and
of bringing a Bastard into the 5th
Succession; so the reason is as foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
as the matter of fact is false,
and the Ignorance that Mr. <hi>Var.</hi>
shews here is the more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because this matter belongs
to the most extraordinary transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that is in the whole French
History, in which he pretends to
be so conversant. I need not say
any more to prove the <hi>Tudors</hi> to
be Gentlemen, but to tell that they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60976:15"/>
are Welshmen, of the Race of the
Ancient Britons, who do all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the highest Birth of any
in the English Nation, and do
run up their Pedigrees to <hi>Iulius
Cesar's</hi> time; among whom is the
Race of the the Ap <hi>Theodore's</hi>
or the Sons of <hi>Theodore,</hi> that by a
corruption of some Ages were
called <hi>Tudors:</hi> but knows
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> so little of the <hi>French</hi>
History, as to have forgot that the
Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> that was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th of <hi>England,</hi>
in whose right both <hi>Henry</hi> the
5th, and her son <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth
were crowned Kings of <hi>France</hi>
in <hi>Paris,</hi> did after King <hi>Henry</hi> the
5th's death marry <hi>Owen Tudor,</hi>
by whom she had 3. Sons the two
eldest were made the Earls of
<hi>Richmont</hi> and <hi>Pembroke,</hi> being
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60976:15"/>
the Kings Uterine Brothers, and
the next heirs to that Title, that
he claimed to the Crown of
<hi>France,</hi> in the right of his Mother
(which I am far from thinking
was a good one.) This being the
case, it was no extraordinary thing
for a man of the Earl of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont's</hi>
rank to marry a Lady that
was then at such a distance from
the Crown, thô it was only in
the 6th and not the 16th degree;
but I do not insist on this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may be only the fault of
the Printer, and I will not descend
to a doubtful fault, when I have
such material ones in my way. I
know there are a sort of men that
are much more ashamed when
their Ignorance is discovered, than
when their other vices are laid
open, since degenerate minds are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60976:16"/>
more jealous of the reputation
of their understanding, than of
their honour. And as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
is very like to be of this temper,
so if a simpathy with Mr. <hi>Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
has not wrought him up
to the like pitch of assurance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
such discoveries as these ought to
affect him a little; and here a
man is apt to lose his patience,
when he finds such a Scribler
pretend to defame the Noblest
blood in the world.</p>
            <p>There is nothing else in the
first Prophetick <hi>Rhapsody</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to our matters, so I was
inclined to go from hence to a
more particular enquiry into our
English affairs,<note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> only the Ignorance
that he discovers in the next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph
is so surprising that I will
bestow a short remark on it. He
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60976:16"/>
says, that the Switzers were so
prevailed on by this pretext, that
their separating themselves from
the Roman Communion was the
best expedient to preserve them
from falling under the Dominion
of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> (thô it
is certain they were then in no
sort of fear of that) that the four
chief Cantons were seduced in
less than a years time; but that
the seven little Cantons conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the belief of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the two midle sised
Cantons tollerated equally both
the Religions.</p>
            <p>One would have thought that
a man that had pretended to the
name of a Historian, would have
at least begun his studies with
some small tast of Cosmography,
and would have taken some
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60976:17"/>
pains to know the Map; and as
the <hi>Switzers</hi> are in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of <hi>France,</hi> so they have
been so long the Allies of that
Crown, that the Ignorance of
the Importance of the Cantons
is a fault in one that pretends to
be such an illuminated Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
that deserves a worse cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
than I think fit to give it.
To reckon <hi>Basle</hi> and <hi>Shaff hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi>
among the great Cantons,
and <hi>Lucern</hi> among the small
Cantons, <hi>Solohern</hi> and <hi>Fribourg</hi>
being also so considerable that
some reckon them with the great
Cantons; and to put <hi>Glaris</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peuzel</hi>
in a superiour order to
them that are among the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
of the least is such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of errours that it is not
easy to imagine how he had the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60976:17"/>
luck to fetch in so many into
one period. But this is not all the
Ignorance that is in it; for whereas
he pretends, that the four Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
that received the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did it in less than a year,
this is so false that <hi>Zwinglius</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
begun to preach the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the year 1519. the
whole matter was examined in a
course of several years, and at last
<hi>Zurich</hi> received the Reformation
in the year 1525. <hi>Bern</hi> three years
after in the year 1528. and <hi>Basle</hi>
a year after in the year 1529. as for
<hi>Schaff house</hi> I must confess my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but there was at least 10
years interval in this matter; and
if <hi>Lucern</hi> is not so much in his
favour, because it is the Residence
of the Spanish Ambassadour, yet
I cannot imagine what has
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60976:18"/>
made him degrade <hi>Solohern</hi> into
the number of the small Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
which is the Residence
of the French Ambassadour,
and is reckoned by many among
the greater. But it is likely that
he knew nothing of all this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
except by report, and perhaps
he thought the period would
run smoother to range the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
thus in the great, in the
small, and the midle-sised Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
and that it would also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on the Reformation as a
precipitated change to say that
4 Cantons turnd in one year.</p>
            <p>But thô Impertinence is a
fault scarce to be named, when
one has so many of a more cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
nature in his way, yet such
as are more signal and more
advantageously situated for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60976:18"/>
Reader's eye deserve to be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our passage, with the
scorn that they deserve. Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
begins his 3. book which
opens the progress of <hi>Luther's</hi>
affairs with a Preamble of 38. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
in which he sets out the state
of <hi>Europe</hi> at that time, so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously
and with so little judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he bestows 14. pages
on the Conquests that <hi>Selim</hi> the
Turk had made, and on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
of the Mamelucks. This
whole tedious ramble signifies
nothing to <hi>Luther's</hi> matters; but
in short it was a secret to swell the
Volume, and to raise the price
of the book, as well as it must
lessen the price of the Author,
who shews, how little he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
where he ought to
place his digressions. What no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60976:19"/>
does that view of every
State of <hi>Europe</hi> give the world,
that doe any way prepare the
Readers mind; for what was to
come after, unless it be that Mr.
<hi>Var.</hi> being to present a piece of as
arrant Poëtry as any that ever pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
the Stage, he thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to fill it at first with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Actors, and to make a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
thô none of them were
to act any part in his Play? But
since he will needs be writing, thô
he understands not the common-Elements,
I will take the pains for
once to instruct him a little how
he ought to have made this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction,
since he it seems was
resolved to begin with one.</p>
            <p>He ought then to have open'd
the State of <hi>Europe</hi> with Relation
to Religion and Learning; he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60976:19"/>
to have shewed what scandals
the Popes and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
had given, what was the State
of the secular Clergy, the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Irregularity, and vices of the
Bishops, and Curates; what were
the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isorders and dissolutions of
the Monastick Orders, both of
those that were endowed and of
the Mendicants. He ought to
have shewed in what sort of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
they imploied their time, and
with what sort of Sermons they
entertained the People: and to
this he ought to have added some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the State of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of <hi>Europe;</hi> and of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of Learning that were
then arising. He ought to have
shewed the different Interests, in
which the several Nations of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
were engaged, after the times
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60976:20"/>
of the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and
<hi>Basle;</hi> and to this he might have
added the State of the Courts of
<hi>Europe</hi> with Relation to Religion,
upon all which he might have
found matter for a long, and a
much more pertinent Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And to conclude, he ought
to have told the Dispositions, in
which the Peoples minds were,
as to those matters: and if he
would needs make a vain shew
of his faculty of telling of tales,
he might have set out the State of
the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, after the
Treaty at the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi>
and of its effects; of the ruine of
those Churches; and of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as well as misery to which
they were reduced by the rigour
of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> yoke. It is true
this was not a necessary prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60976:20"/>
to the bringing <hi>Luther</hi> on
the Stage, but it had been much
less impertinent, than a long
recital of <hi>Sultan Selim's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</p>
            <p>But I am caried too far, and
hereafter I will confine my self
to that, which does more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
belong to me. He begins
that part of his Advertisement,
that relates to the affairs of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
with a sort of an Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegme
worthy of him: <hi>he says, it
is without comparison more difficult
to be exactly true in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
than in other matters; since in
those others, it is only Interest and
Passion that make Men lie; but in
matters of Religion Conscience does so
entirely conquer all the powers of the
Soul, and reduces them to such a Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
that it forces a man to write, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60976:21"/>
which it dictates, without troubling
himself to examine whither it is
true or false.</hi> Here is such a view
of his Notion of Religion, that
how false soever this proposition
is in it self, yet it gives us a true light
of his Ideas of Religion. Good God
shall that principle, which does
elevate, and illuminate our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
be considered as a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful
depravation of them,
than that which flows either
from Interest or Passion? shall
that which is the Image of the
God of Truth, and that reduces
the Soul to a chast purity of Spirit,
be made the Author of the ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of all our powers, and the
emancipating us from all scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losity
concerning truth or false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
this perhaps is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi> Religion,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60976:21"/>
thô those that know him well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
me, that Religion makes very
little impression on him; and if
that is true, then his Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegme
fails in himself, since the
Interest of a Pension, and the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of making himself accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the present time, have as
entirely freed him from all regard
to Truth, as ever any false Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Religion did an enraged
Zealot. It is matter of horrour to
see Religion, and Conscience set
up as the violentest Corrupters of
Truth: but we know out of
what school this has sprung, and
it seems Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has so devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself to the Order of the
Jesuites, that he is resolved to
speak aloud, that which they
more prudently think fit to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
in secret, and indeed if we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60976:22"/>
may judge of him by this chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
that he gives of Religion, we
must conclude him to be entirely
possessed with it, since never Man
seem'd to be less solicitous, than
he is, concerning the truth, or
falsehood of the things, that ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>avers.</p>
            <p>He accuses me of favouring
my own side too much, and that
if I confess some of King <hi>Henry's</hi>
faults, it is only that I may have
an occasion to excuse the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<hi>Cranmer.</hi> This is some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation,
as if he had read my
Book, but I doe not believe he has
done it: for thô I have no great
opinion either of his Vertue, or of
his Understanding; yet I doe not
think, he is so forsaken of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-sense,
and of all regard to his
reputation, as to have adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60976:22"/>
to have advanced so many
notorious falsehoods, if he had
seen upon what Authentical
grounds I had so exposed them,
that I doe not think it possible
even for Mr. <hi>Maimbourg</hi> himself
after all his 50 years Noviciat, to
arrive at a confidence able to
maintain them any longer, if he
had once read my Book, and
what I had writ was at least so
important, that he ought to have
weakned the credit of my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
by some more evident
proofs, than that of saying barely,
that I was extreamly partial
to my own side. My book was
so much read, and so favourably
spoken of in <hi>France</hi> these three
Years past, that in common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
he ought to have alledged
somewhat, to have justified his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60976:23"/>
Censure; but this manner of
writing was more easy, as well
as more imperious. And if a large
Volume of History supported
with the most Authentick proofs,
that has ever yet perhaps accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
any Book of that sort, is
to be thus shaken off, it is a vain
thing to write Books for Men of
Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi> temper.</p>
            <p>This had been more pertinent,
if he had voucht for it a report,
which was so spread over <hi>Paris,</hi>
that I had received advices of it
from several hands, of a design
in which, as was reported, a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man
was engaged that has
many excellent qualities, to which
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> seems to be a great
Stranger, for he has both great
application, and much sincerity.
He has searcht with great exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60976:23"/>
that vast Collection of Mss.
that relate to the last Age, which
are laid up in the King's Library,
and he had found so many things
relating to <hi>England,</hi> that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to publish a Volume of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires
relating to our Affairs: he
had also said, that in some things
he would enlarge himself more
copiously than I had done, and
that in other things he must differ
from me. Matters generally grow
bigger by being oft told, so this
was given out as a design to write
a Counter-History, which should
overthrow all the credit that my
Work had got. But upon my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>Paris,</hi> I found some sincere
enquirers into truth, and who
by consequence are Men that
have no value for Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi>
who intended to bring us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60976:24"/>
that we might in an amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner reason the matter be
foresome of our common Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and both of us seemed to be so
well disposed to sacrifice all to
truth, that two Persons of such
Eminence, that they can receive
no honour by the most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
Characters that I can
give them, who were Mr. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venot</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Auzont,</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us a meeting in the King's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
and in their presence. In
which the Abbot as he discovered
a vast memory, great exactness
and much sincerity, so he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that he had no exceptions
to the main parts of my History;
he mentioned some things of less
moment, in all which I gave not
only our two learned Arbiters,
but even himself full satisfaction, so
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60976:24"/>
that I quickly perceived I had to
doe with a man of honour. He
insisted most on the judgment
of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> against K. <hi>Henry's</hi>
Mariage, which is not in their
Registers. But I was certainly
informed by a Dr. of the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne</hi>
that their Registers are
extreamly defective, and that
many of their Books are lost. He
alledged a letter to K. <hi>Henry</hi> that
he had seen, telling him, that it
was to be feared that he might
be displeased with the decision
of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and that it might
doe him more hurt than good,
which Letter bearing s after
the decision that I have printed,
does not seem to agree with it.
To this I answered, that all the
other decisions of Universities
being given simply in the King's
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60976:25"/>
favours, and that of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi>
bearing only, that the Majority
had declared for him, this left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blot
upon the matter, since when
the opposition is inconsiderable,
decisions are given in the Name
of the whole Body; but the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Majority imported,
that there was a great opposition
made, which, thô it was not
supported by a number equal to
the other, yet was so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as to lessen very much the
credit of the Decision. To this
I added, that K. <hi>Henry's</hi> printing
this the Year after it was given,
and none ever accusing that
piece of Forgery, Card. <hi>Pool</hi> on
the contrary acknowledging
that he was in <hi>Paris</hi> when it was
obtained, these were undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Evidences of its genuinness,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60976:25"/>
to which he answered by a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
acknowledgment, that he had
seen another Letter, in which
the detail of the whole Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> is set down;
and, as I remember, there were
but one or two more than the
Majority, that opined on the
King's side; but the rest were in
different Classes. Some suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their opinions: others, thô
they condemned the Mariage,
yet did not think it could be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
since it was once made:
and some were positively of the
Pope's side. In end, after some
hours discours, in which all the
Company was fully satisfied with
the Answers that I gave, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that as he had seen many
more Letters relating to that
matter than I had done, so if I
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60976:26"/>
thought fit, he would furnish me
with a Volume of Authentical
proofs for what I had writ, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than that which I had already
printed. And these were the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the French Ambassadours,
that were in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's
Court, that are in the King's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary;
but I did not stay long
enough in <hi>Paris</hi> to procure this.</p>
            <p>Now what those Letters of
Cardinal <hi>Bellays</hi> are, upon which
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> pretends to found
his Relation, I cannot imagine.
For as he came not to act in this
matter till the last step of it; so
his Letters cannot carry any long
Series of this affair in them, and
they must be far from giving
those long excursions, into which
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> always delights to
wonder. And, as I remember,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60976:26"/>
I was in particular told, that
those Letters were in the King's
Library, and so, since all that
was there, agreed with my His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
this must pass among those
hardy Citations of Authors, that
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is apt to make, to
give credit to his Inventions.</p>
            <p>He flourishes a little to shew
some small reading, but he is as
unhappy in that, as in other
things. He mentions <hi>Cambden,</hi>
as having writ the History of that
Revolution with some more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
than he is pleased to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me; but he says, he does so
constantly favour the <hi>Calvinists,</hi>
in prejudice of those that he calls
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> that one needs only
read the first page, that turns up
to him, in any part of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to be convinced of it. This
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60976:27"/>
is a very good proof that Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
never opened any one page
of <hi>Cambden;</hi> Since he does not
write of that Revolution. For he
begins his History with Q. <hi>Elisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's</hi>
Reign, and says no more
of what went before her time,
than what amounts to a very
short hint of her Birth and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a general Introduction
into her Reign; and that History
is writ with so much judgment
and impartiality, that as it acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Author the friendship
and esteem of that eminent His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian
Mr. <hi>du Thou;</hi> so he after
<hi>Cambden's</hi> Death published the
second Volume, from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
that the Author had
sent him. If the discovery of a
great many Rebellions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
against the Person of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60976:27"/>
that famous Queen is that, which
disgusts Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> at that His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
it is because his Religion has
so enslaved his Conscience, that
he is so little concerned in Truth
or Falsehood, as not to be able to
endure one of the gravest Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that this Age has produced,
because he could not avoid the
Recital of those many Crimes,
that some of the Men of Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas's</hi>
principles as to Religion
were not afraid to commit. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this he mentions another of
our Historians, whom he calls
Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> and to make his
Reader know that he is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the History of his Life,
he tells us he was afterwards a
Bishop; but this is one of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of his invention, for thô we
had a Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> that was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60976:28"/>
Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and that died
about 30 years ago; yet he writ
no History. By the Character
that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> gives this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Author, that he was
more moderate than <hi>Cambden,</hi>
I fancy he is mistaken in the
Name, and that he would say
Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> thô this Name and
<hi>Morton</hi> have no affinity; but <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
was no Bishop: it is true, Dr.
<hi>Heylin</hi> has writ so moderately,
that some have been severe upon
him for it; but I will make no
other Reflections on this, unless
it be to shew the slightness of Mr.
<hi>Varillas's</hi> way of writing, who it
is likely had heard one talk at the
same time both concerning Dr.
<hi>Morton</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and he
in his assuming way, pretends
upon this to give a Character of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60976:28"/>
that History, putting the Name
<hi>Morton</hi> for <hi>Heylin;</hi> but he never
read a Word of Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> thô
in his daring way, he pretends to
give his Character; and repents
himself of the praise of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he had given in prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>Cambden,</hi> and sets it out
as an artifice, since whereas
<hi>Cambden</hi> blames always the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Catholicks without any
mitigations, <hi>Morton</hi> in blaming
them counterfeits some pity for
them, that is to say, he had some
degrees of Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi> Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Religion. But Dr. <hi>Heylin's</hi>
History being writ only in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
and it having never been
translated either into Latin or
French, Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> cannot give
a Character of it from his own
knowledg.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:60976:29"/>
From our side he goes to the
Writers of the Roman side, and
begins with another essay of his
exactness to his principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
For he says, <hi>Sanders</hi> writ
so violently, that it vvas no vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if the Protestants caried their
revenge so far, as to force him to
die of hunger, in the Mountains of
the North of <hi>England,</hi> to vvhich
he had retired. Here are only
three capital Errours: for 1. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders's</hi>
Book, concerning the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Schisme, vvas not published
till after his Death, so that this
could give no occasion for so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
a revenge. 2. <hi>Sanders</hi> did not
die in the North of <hi>England,</hi> but
in <hi>Ireland. 3. Sanders</hi> vvas sent over
by the Pope to raise and conduct
a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for vvhich
he had immediate povvers from
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60976:29"/>
the Pope. He was so active, that
he brought an Army together,
which was defeated by the
Queen's Forces: and upon that
he fled into a Wood, where he
was, some days after, found dead.
So that having received no
Wounds, it was believed he died
of Hunger. This being the state
of that affair, as it is related of
all sides, is not Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> a very
creditable Author, who has the
brow to report it as he does? For
the Character that he gives of
<hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> it is so embroiled,
that I do not think it worth the
vvhile to examine it. It is enough
to say that <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> is a Jesuite,
that is to say, a Man true to Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> his Character of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and his History is nothing
but <hi>Sanders</hi> drest up in another
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60976:30"/>
Method. I speak of that which
is in Latin, for the Spanish, I
have never seen it. For <hi>Lesley</hi> he
is generally a grave and wise
Writer, but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> names
him, because some body had told
him, that one of such a name had
writ of those matters, otherwise
he had never cited him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to English Affairs, which
he scarce ever mentions, but as
they happned to be intermixt
with the Scotsh.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to depend upon Cardinal
<hi>Bellay's</hi> Letters, and so he thinks
here is enough to settle, in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his Reader, a firm beleef of
all that he intends to write; but
let him tell the World where
they are to be found, since the
printed Volume contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60976:30"/>
of the matters, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to cite from him. And since
I have printed so many of the
Original Letters of that Time,
and have told the Reader where
they are to be found, I will expect
the like from him, otherwise let
him cite them as long as he will,
I will take the liberty to tell him
that I do not believe him. And I
think, that by this time I have
given him sufficient reasons for
excusing my Incredulity, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that he gives us upon his
own word. Here is enough
for a preliminary. But I am
affraid I grow heavy to my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and that by this time he
is so fully satisfied concerning
the principles both of Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las's</hi>
Religion, and his morals, that
he begins to lose patience, when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60976:31"/>
he sees how far I am like to carry
him in a more copious discovery.
But there are a sort of men, that
must be severely repressed: and
there are some times, in which
even a fool is to be answered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his folly. Yet I will
so far manage my Reader, as not to
overcharge him too much: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as to many of those Political
digressions, that Mr. <hi>Var.</hi> makes
upon the Interest of <hi>England,
France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> I will pass them
quite over, as the whipped cream
that he sets before his Reader.
Some of them are not unpleasant,
if they were proposed as conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which might perhaps
have had their weight: but his
averring them confidently is not
to be excused, they might pass in
a kind of a Book of Politicks as a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60976:31"/>
refining upon the actions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but this way of writing is
by no means to be allowed in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
since it is without any sort
of evidence, and History ought
to relate things as we find they
really were designed, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted;
and not as we imagine
they ought or might have been.
I am now entring upon a subject,
in which it will be much more
easy for me to say too much, than
too little: for Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
so many Errours, that thô
I am resolved to let lesser matters
pass unregarded, yet I find so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in my way, which require a
discovery, that I am engaged in
a task as ingrateful to my self, as
it must be severe upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>1. He begins with an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">p. 226.</note>
that all the rest of <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clef's</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60976:32"/>
Heresy were so entirely
rooted out of <hi>England,</hi> that the
whole Nation, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one single Person, was of
the same Religion during the
Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am not now near the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of that time, but in my
History I have shewed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's Reign,
that in the year 1511. which was
but two years after <hi>Henry</hi> the
7th's Death, there remain yet in
the Registers of the See of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
the Processes of 41 Persons,
of whom 7 were condemned for
Hereticks, and delivered to the
Secular Arm, and the rest had
the weakness to abjure: and
from this hint one must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had no
knowledg of our Affairs; but he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60976:32"/>
thought the Period was rounder,
and the air of writing was more
assuming, when he asserted that
the whole Nation, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
one single Person, was
of the same Religion. The Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
objected to those Persons,
shew, that the Reformation
found a disposition in the Nation,
to receive it by the Doctrines
which were entertained by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in it: For the chief of them
are, that the Sacrement of the
Altar was not Christ's Body, but
material Bread: That Images
ought not to be worshipped:
That Pilgrimages were neither
necessary nor profitable: and that
we ought not to address our
Prayers to Saints, but only to
God.</p>
            <p>But since this may be thought
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60976:33"/>
only a flourish of Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi>
Pen, I go to other matters, in
which it cannot be denied that
a greater exactness was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>
               <q>2. He lays down for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to all that was to come
after,<note place="margin">228. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> that P. <hi>Arthur</hi> was very
unhealthy, when he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
That he was recovering
out of a great Disease, of which
he died 5 Months after. It is
true, he does acknowledg,
that three Words in the Bull,
that was granted for the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Marriage, seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that this Marriage was
consummated: yet he takes the
Word of the other Historians,
and repeats this of P. <hi>Arthur's</hi>
ill Health so often, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
it seems, by that means
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60976:33"/>
to make his Reader swallow it
down easily.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here he had writ a little more
artificially, if he had set over
against this, on the Margent some
citation of a Letter, or Recital,
vvhich vvould have cost him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and have been full as true,
as his other citations are. Many
Witnesses that vvere examined
upon Oath, deposed before the
Legates, vvhen this matter vvas
examined, that P. <hi>Arthur</hi> vvas
of a good Complexion, vigorous
and robust, when he vvas mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
that he bedded vvith his
Princess every night: and the
Decay of vvhich he died, vvas
ascribed to his too early Mariage.
And of this Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> takes some
notice, vvithout reflecting on
the consequence, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60976:34"/>
might naturally draw from
it;<note place="margin">240.</note> for he says, K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th
delayed the marrying of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Son 6 years after he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Bull, and that the
Death of his eldest Son made him
apprehend the loss of his second
Son; if he married him so young.
And thô he intervveaves a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
reflection, according to his
vvay, that is to say impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and says, if this fear vvas not
altogether just; yet since K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the 7th had no other Son, it
vvas not altogether unreasonable.
But it is obvious that this is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impertinent, if P. <hi>Arthur's</hi>
Mariage vvent no further than a
publick Ceremony. But there are
other circumstances that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvv
this, as much as a thing
that is of its nature secret, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60976:34"/>
of being disproved. It is said
by our Historians, who writ at
that time, that the Spanish Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
took proofs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of the Mariage. And
in the Bull of dispensation, for the
subsequent Mariage, this was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
supposed as a thing that was
perhaps done. But thô our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

took this upon trust, or he was
in a fit of his Religion, which
was so violent, that it made him
not only take no care of what he
said, whither it was true or false;
but made him advance a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
falsehood. For whereas in
the Preamble of the Bull of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
for the younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60976:35"/>
it is set forth, that P. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi>
and the Princess had been
lawfully married, and had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
consummated their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
where the matter of fact
is set down in a dubious manner,
he makes that the Dispensation
had allowed their Mariage, even
thô the former had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated.
And as the Words
that he cites are not the Words
of the Bull, so they give a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
notion of the matter; since
as he gives the Words, they seem
only to be a clause put in, to make
the Bull more unquestionable;
whereas in truth they are a part
of the matter of fact represented
to the Pope. And thô this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
way of representing this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact, that is in the Bull,
was all that could be decently
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60976:35"/>
said upon this case, yet it seems
the Spaniards, who knew the
Mariage was consummated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to set the matter past dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
for they either procured at
that time a Breve, of the same
date with the Bull, or they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
one afterwards, in which
in the Preamble this matter is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
without any <hi>perhaps,</hi> or
other limiting Word, it being
positively set forth, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was consummated. If Mr.
<hi>Varillas's</hi> Religion sets him at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
from the scrupulosity of
writing truth, yet that profound
Policy, to which he always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
should oblige him to take
a little care, that the falsehoods
that he advances, may not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
discovered.</p>
            <p>3. <q>He says,<note place="margin">p. 232.</note> 
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60976:36"/>
was 12. year old, when his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
died; and that his Father
had designed him for the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was taken up by the
Writers of the last Age, to make
the Parallel between <hi>Iulian</hi> the
Emperour and him seem to
agree: that as <hi>Iulian</hi> had been
a Reader in the Church; so King
<hi>Henry</hi> should be represented as
an <hi>Abbot</hi> with a little band. But
as King <hi>Henry</hi> was not 12 year
old, when his Brother died, for he
wanted some Months of 11: and
as at that Age young Princes,
considering the respect that is
payed to them in their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have seldome been found far
advanced in Learning; so it does
not appear, that he had then any
other Education different from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60976:36"/>
what was given his Brother,
who understood Latin, and some
of the beginnings of Learning.
Learning was then in great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
his Children to study, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to raise their Authority the
higher by that means, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to amuse them with Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that they might not think
of pretending to the Crown du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Life, since the undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Title to it resting in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their Mother, it had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
upon them by her Death,
thô they did not think fit to
claim their Right.</p>
            <p>
               <q>4. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that when K.
<hi>Henry</hi> the 7th intended to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his younger Son to <hi>P. Arthur's</hi>
Widdow, the Privy Council
of <hi>England</hi> approuved it the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60976:37"/>
more easily, because of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution
that had been taken to
hinder the consummation of
the former Mariage: and to
confirm this, he cites on the
Margent the Petition, that the
Parliament of <hi>England</hi> offered
upon this matter to P. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
the 6th.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But as the Depositions are yet
extant of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
that was then a Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and of two others, that
there was no precaution used to
hinder the consummation; so
<hi>Warham,</hi> that was at that time
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the second Mariage, as
being neither honourable, nor
well-pleasing to God, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
did afterwards depose upon
Oath. The Parliament took no
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60976:37"/>
cognisance of the matter, nor
did it make any address to the
Pope; so that this citation is to
be considered as an effect of Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Varillas</hi> his notion of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>5. He runs out,<note place="margin">p. 235.</note> in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
into a long speculation
concerning the different inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> that
made the Spaniards go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and forwards, in the
agreeing to the Match, that
was proposed for P. <hi>Henry</hi> and
the Princess; whom by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
affectation he calls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Duke of <hi>York:</hi> and makes
the Princesse's Parents repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, the
danger of his Son's growing
weary of the Princess, since he
was 4 year younger than she
was, and that in order to the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60976:38"/>
procuring of a dissolution of the
Mariage from the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> he might pretend that
his Father had forced him to
marry her, whenever he should
grow weary of her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All the other Writers of that
time put K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th's desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this second Mariage meerly
on his covetousness, which made
him equally unwilling to repay
the Portion, or to send a great
jointure yearly after the Princess:
and the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was too
great a Match to be so uneasily
admitted by the King and Queen
of <hi>Spain.</hi> He whom he calls by
the Title of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
was indeed only Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
for some Months after his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Death, during which
time it was supposed, that the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60976:38"/>
Princess might be with child by
his Brother; which proves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
exception, that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that the first Mariage
was consummated. But when
there was no more reason to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that, then he carried
the Title, that belongs to the
Heir apparent of our Crown.
But it seems the King and Queen
of <hi>Spain</hi> were more easily satisfied
in this matter, than Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
would make us believe they
were: for two years after the
Bull was granted, when P. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
came to be of Age, he instead
of entring into any engagement
to marry the Princess, made a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
protestation in the hands of
the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> by
which he recalled the consent
that he had given during his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60976:39"/>
and declared that he
would never marry her. But it is
very likely Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had never
heard of this, thô the instrument
of that Protestation was not only
mentioned, but printed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Writers of that Age:
and it is confessed by <hi>Sanders</hi>
himself, who, after all Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas's</hi>
flourish with his Letters,
is his only Author. And for this
foresight, that he thinks he may
justly ascribe to the King and
Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> because they are
represented by the Writers of
that time, to have had an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Sagacity, the reason
that he makes them give, shews
it was a contrivance of his own:
since a moral force, such as the
Authority of a Father, was never
so much as pretended to be a just
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60976:39"/>
ground to annul a Mariage, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it was made and consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
otherwise most of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
that have been made,
might have been dissolved.</p>
            <p>
               <q>6. He adds to this another
speculation,<note place="margin">p. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>6.</note> that is worthy of
him, he pretends that the King
and Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th had
acquired the Crown of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and by consequence had
a right to dispose of it at his
pleasure; upon which the
Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> was afraid,
least he should have disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Son, and given the
Crown to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
that was then at <hi>Brussels,</hi> and
was preparing an Invasion of
<hi>England,</hi> from which they did
not know, but K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60976:40"/>
might save himself, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Suffolk</hi> his Successour, and
that upon those fears they were
unwilling to consent to the
Match.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is such a mixture of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
that it is not easy to tell which
of them is the most remarkable.
This Doctrine of the Crown of
<hi>England's</hi> being alienable at the
King's pleasure, might have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
well with those, that some
years ago thought to have shut
out the next Heir, and yet even
these did not pretend that it
could have been done by the
King alone. But here is a new
Theory of Politicks, for which
we are sure Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> can cite
no Authorities from the Laws
and Constitutions of <hi>England.</hi>
K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th had indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60976:40"/>
the Crown, by defeating
that Tyrant and Usurper <hi>Richard</hi>
the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: but as he pretended to be
Heir of the <hi>Lancastrian</hi> Race him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so by marrying to the Heir
of the House of <hi>York,</hi> that was
the right Heir, he by a conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Titles, made the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sure. But this gave him no
right to alienate the Crown at
his pleasure, and to fancy, that
a King might be induced to give
away his Crown from his own
Son, to the Person in the World
that he hated most, and whom
at his Death he ordered his Son
never to forgive; who, by the
way, was not Duke but only
Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> is a Dream better
becoming so slight a brain as is
that of Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> than the
consummated wisdome of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60976:41"/>
King and Queen of <hi>Spain.</hi> But
thus it falls out when a Library
Keeper turns Statesman; and
when from being a teller of tales,
he will turn a Writer of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which he composes out of
his own Imaginations, he must
needs fall into childish errours.
When do Kings fall under those
weaknesses, as to disinherit an
only Son, to cover them from a
remote fear: and a very remote
one it was; for the Archduke
needed at that time the assistance
of <hi>England</hi> against <hi>France</hi> too
much, to be in a condition to
raise a Civil War in <hi>England,</hi> and
to support a competition to the
Crown, which could have no
other effect, as to him, but to
give <hi>France</hi> an opportunity, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the distractions of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60976:41"/>
to come and destroy him. In
short, here is a Vision of a poor-spirited
Pedant, which is too
much considered, when it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and laught at.</p>
            <p>
               <q>7. He pretends to enter into
the reasons that were alledged
at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 237<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> both for and against
the granting of the Bull; but at
last he concludes, that Pope
<hi>Alexander</hi> the 6th would not
consent to it; that he might
not give occasion to accuse him,
of having broken the Discipline
of the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But here is such a false repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> at
that time, and in particular of
P. <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6th, that since
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> will needs write Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
I must put him in mind
of one Rule; that as Painters
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60976:42"/>
shew their Judgment and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
in that which is in one
Word called <hi>le Costume,</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Air, Manners, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
of the Ages and Scenes to
which their Pieces belong; so
Poets, when they bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Names into their Plays,
they may clothe them with what
Characters they please; but if
they represent Men, whose His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
are known, they must not
confound Characters, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
a <hi>Nero</hi> as a grave Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
or as a good natured Prince;
nor a <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> as a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Stage-player, or as a bloody
Tyrant. And therefore, thô Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> may shew his pretended
discoveries, concerning Men that
are less known, yet when he
brings in an <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6th
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60976:42"/>
on the Stage, it is too bold a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Poetry, to lay a strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Conscience, or a sense of
Honour to his charge: and thô
there is one part of this Period
true, that there had never been
any dispensation of this sort for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
granted, to serve as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
for it: yet that exactness,
in which he represents the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
that the Divines of <hi>Rome</hi>
made concerning this matter,
agrees ill with the State of the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time; and
a Painter may as justly represent
the old Romans in Pantalaons,
and with Hats in their hands.</p>
            <p>
               <q>8. He says,<note place="margin">p. 240, 24<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th
was preparing all things for the
Mariage of his Son, to the
Princess, when he died. And
a little before that he had said,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60976:43"/>
that her Parents sacrificed the
Interest of their Family to the
satisfaction of the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
by consenting to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Match with the Heir of the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> was no very
costly Sacrifice: and for his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
concerning the design of
marrying her to the Duke of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria,</hi>
and by that means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi>
it does so ill agree with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi>
that since there is no proof
brought of this, I must look on it
as one of those Imaginations,
with which Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> loves to
entertain his Readers. But for
K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, he was so far
from making any preparations
for the Mariage,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orison.</note> that one of the
Writers of that Age assures us,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60976:43"/>
that at his Death he charged his
Son to break it, apprehending
perhaps a return of a new civil
War, upon the issue of a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <q>9. He gives us a new tast of
his unskilfulness in ordering his
Scenes.<note place="margin">p. 244.</note> He had found that
when <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's Divorce
came to be started, there was
some discourse of a Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and <hi>Francis</hi> the first's
Sister, afterwards the Queen
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and therefore he
thought a proposition for her,
might come in before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
as a pretty ornament to
his Fable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the silence of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of that Time, which I have
seen, is a much better evidence
against it, than his pretended
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60976:44"/>
negotiation of Mr. <hi>de Piennes</hi> is
for it, to which no credit is due.
It is well known that in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives
of <hi>Venice</hi> there are Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
laid up of all the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Ambassadours,
and Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> having perhaps
heard of this, he fancied it would
have a good grace, to cite such
Recitals as to French Affairs, thô
all that know the State of <hi>France,</hi>
know, that this has not been
the practice of that Court. But
as there is no proof to shew that
there was any such Proposition
made at that Time, so the State
of K. <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th's Court dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
extreamly from it, in which
the Count of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Francis</hi> the first, and his
Sister, were not so favourable,
as to give us reason to think that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60976:44"/>
pains was taken to raise that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to the Throne of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>10. He tells us,<note place="margin">p. 245.</note> that King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th calling a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the beginning of his
Reign, they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bound in point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to oblige to execute his
Father's Orders, relating to
his Mariage; who had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made it the chief Article of
his Testament, and charged
his Son to do it upon his last
Blessing; but had laid the same
charge on the Men of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Credit in <hi>England,</hi> as he
spoke his last Words to them:
upon which the Parliament
being careful to maintain this
Authority, to which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
over their Master,
did oblige him, by repeated
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60976:45"/>
Remonstrances to marry the
Princess.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here he goes to show how
implacably he is set against the
Crown of <hi>England:</hi> formerly he
had debased their Birth, but he
thought that was not enough;
now he will degrade them of
their Dignity, and give the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
a Superiority over them.
But it is a fatal thing for an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Man to write History: for
if Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> could have so much
as opened our Book of Statutes,
he would have found, that the
first Parliament, that K. <hi>Henry</hi>
the 8th held, was assembled the
21. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1510. almost 8.
Months after the Mariage,
which was celebrated six Weeks
after he came to the Crown, in
which time, if Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60976:45"/>
understood any thing of our
Constitutions, he would have
known, that it was impossible
for a Parliament to have met,
since there must be 40. Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Summonds and a Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Parliament; so that if the
new King had summoned one,
the Day after his Father's Death,
it could not have met sooner, than
the day before the Mariage.</p>
            <p>
               <q>11. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Queen bore
five Children, the first three,
Sons, and the other two, Girls;
but the eldest Son lived only 9
Months, the other two Sons,
and the eldest Girl, died imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after they were born,
only the youngest, that was
born the 8 of <hi>February</hi> 1515,
was longer lived.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has a peculiar ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60976:46"/>
of committing more Errours
in one single Period, than any
Writer of the Age: and here he
has given a good essay of his art;
for the Queen bore only three
Children, the first was a Son,
born the 1. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> that died
the 22 of <hi>February</hi> thereafter,
which was not two full Months,
much less 9 Months: the second
Son died not immediatly, but
about a Fourtnight after he
was born: and the Daughter,
afterwards Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> was born
the 9th of <hi>February</hi> 1516. So that
thô by chance he has hit the
Month right, yet he is mistaken,
both as to the Year, and the Day
of the Month. So unadvised a
thing it is for an ignorant Writer,
to deliver matters of fact so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly:
for thô this may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60976:46"/>
others, that are as ignorant
as himself, by an appearance of
exactness; yet it lays him too open
to those, that can find the leisure
and the patience, to expose him:
and the last is no easy matter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>12. He runs out into a very
copious account of K. <hi>Henry's</hi>
Disorders,<note place="margin">p. 246.</note> and dresses up Q.
<hi>Katherine's</hi> Devotions in a very
sublime strain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It does not appear, that in all
that time he had any other Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
but <hi>Elisabeth Blunt:</hi> and
during all that while, he had the
highest Panigyriques made him
by all the Clergy of <hi>Europe,</hi> upon
his Zeal for Religion and Piety;
possible so, that if we did not live
in an Age, in which Flattery has
broke loose from all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
of Decency, they would
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60976:47"/>
appear very extravagant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations;
and if the sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Flattery were not rather a
just prejudice against a Prince,
which give a character of a swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Ambition, and an imperious
Tyranny, that must be courted
by such abject methods, so that
it is hard, whither we ought to
think worse of the Flaterers, or
the Flatered, we would be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to judge very advantageously
of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications,
and other fawning
Addresses that were made him.
As for Q. <hi>Katherine,</hi> it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that she was indeed a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and devout Woman; but
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> being more accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to Legends, than to true
Histories, could not set out this,
without a considerable addition
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60976:47"/>
of his own: for the half of it is
not mentioned by any Author,
that ever I saw, nor by any quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by himself: but a Poët must
adorn his matter, and if he has
not judgment, he overdoes it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>13. He says,<note place="margin">p. 248.</note> the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to marry his natural Son
the Duke of <hi>Richmont,</hi> to his
Daughter <hi>Mary;</hi> upon which
he makes that long digression,
concerning the Names of the
Race of <hi>Tudors,</hi> that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
considered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When a Man affirms a thing,
that is so notoriously injurious to
the Memory of a Prince, he ought
at least to give some sort of proof
of its truth: for thô in the acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi> Religious Fits,
he does not think fit to trouble
himself with those inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60976:48"/>
matters of Truth and False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
yet all the World is not of
his mind, and some colours of
Truth are at least lookt for. It is
true, a Negative is not easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
so a bold Affirmer fancies,
he has some advantages; but in
this case it is quite otherwise, for
the whole series of the Original
Instructions, Messages and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that passed between <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> in that matter, are
still extant, in all which there is
not the least tittle, relating to
this Proposition. And there are
some things of such indecency,
that nothing but a temper like
Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi> can bring them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
For when K. <hi>Henry</hi> was
pretending a scruple of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
at his own marrying
his Brother's Wise, it is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60976:48"/>
that he would have
asked a Dispensation for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in a much nearer Degree.
For <hi>Sanders,</hi> that is Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las's</hi>
Author, says, that both
Propositions were made at the
same time. There were many
Libels printed against K. <hi>Henry,</hi>
about that time; but the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
and the best writ, was
that of Cardinal <hi>Pools,</hi> in which
it is visible, that he spares nothing
that he could alledg with any
colour of Truth; yet he says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this matter, thô it had
more weight in it to discover the
King's Hypocrisy, in pretending
to scruples of Conscience, than
all the other things he alledges:
and I never could find any other
Author for this Story, before <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
whose Book was printed 60
years after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:60976:49"/>
               <q>14. He gives another essay
of his skill in History,<note place="margin">P. 250.</note> and that
he is equally ignorant of the
Histories of all Kingdomes,
when he represents to us the
endeavours of the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for the obtaining of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with the Princes <hi>Mary,</hi>
in favours of his Son, upon
whose Person he bestows a kind
dash of his Pen, and he enters
into a speculation of the danger,
that King <hi>Henry</hi> apprehended
from this Proposition; and that
if he had rejected it, the King
and Prince of <hi>Scotland</hi> might
have addressed themselves for it
to the Parliament, and that the
Parliament would have raised a
general Rebellion, rather than
have suffered King <hi>Henry</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:60976:49"/>
The dislike that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
has conceived against the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> seems deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rooted in him; for it returns ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often. Here he represents for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes complaining to
Parliaments, when the Kings
do not accept of Propositions for
their Children; as if our Princes
were less at liberty in the disposal
of their Children, than the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
of their Subjects are: but he
knows our Constitution as little
as he does the History of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
otherwise he could not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as
pretending to the Mariage of the
Princess <hi>Mary</hi> for his Son;
since K. <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth, that
had married King <hi>Henry's</hi> Sister,
was kill'd at the Battel of <hi>Flod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun</hi>
the 2 <hi>September</hi> 1513, above
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60976:50"/>
three years before the Princess
was born, he left an infant Son,
between whom and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
a Treaty of a Mariage was
once proposed, but no progress
was made in it, for K. <hi>Henry</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
it. And he had always
his Parliaments so subject to him,
to apprehend any of those vain
Schemes, with which Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
would possess his Reader.
There are many that make no
great progress in History, but yet
know somewhat of the Death
of Kings, and that carry some
small measure of Chronology in
their Head. Yet since Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
has not yet got so far, he had
best buy some common Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Tables, and have them
always before him, when he
writes; and this will at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60976:50"/>
him from such childish Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>
               <q>15. He tells us,<note place="margin">p. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1.</note> that there
were many Pretenders to the
young Princess; and to make a
full Period, he tells us, that all
the Souverains of <hi>Europe</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her, both the Emperour,
the Kings of <hi>France, Spain</hi> and
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and so he gives us a
fantastical speculation of King
<hi>Henry's</hi> balancing those Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
one against another.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But since for a round Periods
sake he will needs split <hi>Charles</hi>
the 5th in two, and name both
the Emperour and the K. of <hi>Spain</hi>
as two Pretenders, he might
have as well subdivided him into
the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Castile,
Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> and the very
Titular Kingdome of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:60976:51"/>
might have come in for its share.</p>
            <p>
               <q>16 He tells us that thô the
match of <hi>Scotland</hi> was the most
for the Interest of the Nation;<note place="margin">P. 252.</note> yet
King <hi>Henry</hi> was so angry with
his Nephew the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for taking part against him,
in his last war with <hi>France,</hi>
that he resolved never to give
him his Daughter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> will see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the necessity of purchasing a
Chronological Table; for thô that
will cost him some money, which
as I am told, goes very near his
heart; yet it will preserve him
from some scurvy errours, they
may spoil the sale of his books:
for any one of those Tables, even
the worst and cheepest, would
have shewed him, that it was not
his Nephew that took part with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60976:51"/>
               <hi>France</hi> against him; but his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew's
Father: for King <hi>Iames</hi>
the 4th, that was King <hi>Henry's</hi>
Brother-in-Law, made war on
that occasion, and was killed in it,
leaving an Infant Son behind him;
but it is pleasant to see the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of this Scribler, that makes
in one place King <hi>Iames</hi> the 4th
to court the Princess for his Son,
thô he died several years before
she was born, and then makes
King <hi>Iames</hi> the 5th to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
war with his Uncle, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Father's life, and while
himself was an Infant.</p>
            <p>
               <q>17. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Emperour
came, and pretended the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to the Princess, and upon
that he sets down a large nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
that he had with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Wolsey.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:60976:52"/>
But he shews here an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th's Life,
thô he pretends to have made
more than ordinary discoveries
concerning his Affairs, that
proves, that he has studied all
History alike ill. He reckons up
the series of the Propositions for
the Princess quite wrong; for
she was first contracted to the
Dolphin the 9 <hi>November</hi> 1518,
by a Treaty yet extant, then
<hi>Charles</hi> the 5th came into <hi>England</hi>
in Person, and contracted a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with her at <hi>Windsor</hi> the 22
of <hi>Iune 1522;</hi> after that there
was a Proposition made for the
King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that was soon
let fall; and last of all there was
a Treaty set on foot, for the King
of <hi>France</hi> then a Widdower, or
for his second Son the Duke of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60976:52"/>
               <hi>Orleans,</hi> it being left to <hi>Francis's</hi>
option to determine that: and so
remarkable a passage, as <hi>Charles</hi>
the 5th's coming to <hi>England</hi> in
person, was unhappily unknown
to Mr. <hi>Varillas;</hi> otherwise he
would have dressed up a mighty
Scene of Politicks to adorn it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>18 He gives us the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
and the History of Card.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  <hi>Wolsey,</hi> with his ordinary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
in which truth comes
very seldome in for an ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
he tells us how he was Bp.
of <hi>Tournay,</hi> or rather Oeconome
of that See, and how many
journeys he made between
<hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>London;</hi> and that
he being enriched at <hi>Tournay,</hi>
he got the Bishoprick of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi>
after that, upon the Bp. of
<hi>Winchester's</hi> death, he had that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60976:53"/>
See, from that he was raised
to be Archbishop of <hi>York;</hi> then
he was made Chancellour of
<hi>England,</hi> then Cardinal and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
<hi>à Latere,</hi> and last of all, he
was made Chief Minister of
State; and to shew our Author's
deep Judgment, this last Article
seemed so doubtful a point to
him, that he must needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
a proofe on it, and he sends
us to P. <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th's Register,
thô the advancements that he
had already reckoned up, may
well make this pass without
a more particular Proof; nor is
P. <hi>Leo's</hi> Register a place likely
to find it in.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a great deal to let his
Reader see, how entirely he was
possessed with the History of
that time; since he could run
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60976:53"/>
out so far with the Character
and History of that Minister; but
for the strain, in which he sets
out his Character, one must see,
it is only Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi> fancy: for
how came he to know Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Wolsey's</hi> air and manner of
deportment, even in the smallest
thing. I that have seen much
more of him in his Letters, Dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Instructions than Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> can pretend to have done,
dare not goe so far, because I
have not arrived at Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
his pitch of Religion; but if his
character is no truer than the
History that he gives of <hi>Wolsey,</hi>
I know what name is due to it.
He was made Bishop of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi>
in <hi>October,</hi> and Bp. or <hi>Lincoln</hi>
in the <hi>March</hi> thereafter, or rather
in <hi>February,</hi> for the Temporalty
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60976:54"/>
was given him the 4th of <hi>March,</hi>
which is always restored after
the Consecration, so that here
was not time enough to make
such journies between <hi>Tournay</hi>
and <hi>London,</hi> nor to enrich himself
with the former: he had not <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
but 15 years after that; but
he was made Archbishop of
<hi>York</hi> two year after he had <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln;</hi>
he was also made Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Legate, before he was
made Chancelour; for <hi>Warham</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was
Chancelour while he was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
and had some disputes with
him, touching his legative power;
upon which he obtained that
Dignity, for puting an end to all
disputes; and in stead of his being
last of all Minister of State, he
was first of all Minister of State,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60976:54"/>
while he was only the Lord <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner,</hi>
and all his other digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
came upon him, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
effects of that Confidence
and favour into which the King
had received him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>19. He cannot assent to some
Historians,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that imagine he
was the Confident of K. <hi>Henry's</hi>
Pleasures, since he thinks, if that
had been true, he could not
have been so cheated after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as he was.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a Demonstration that
he never read my History, into
which I have put, besides other
Evidences of his being on the
secret of <hi>Anne Boleyn's</hi> matter,
two letters, that she writ to him,
which are undeniable proofs
of it. But as for the long Story
into with he runs out, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60976:55"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th's Intrigues
with him, and his way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to him, in the stile of Son
and Cousin, for which he cites
on the Margent the Emperour's
Letters to <hi>Wolsey,</hi> that lie in his
fancy, that is the greatest Library
in the World, but the hardest to
be come at, all this is so loosely
writ, that it is plain Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
had no light to direct him in it,
since he says not a word of the
most important circumstance
of it, which was the Emperour's
coming in person to <hi>England,</hi>
which was beleeved to have
been done chiefly to gain <hi>Wolsey</hi>
entirely, and in which it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that he had all the success
that he had wisht for.</p>
            <p>
               <q>20. He says,<note place="margin">p. 257.</note> 
                  <hi>Wolsey</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated
from the Emperour,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60976:55"/>
engaged the King of <hi>France,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was set at liberty, to treat
for a Match between the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin
and the Princess of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
upon which they were
contracted with great Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficency;
but that was not
enough, for the Cardinal's
malice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have formerly shewed, that
the proposition of a Mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Dauphin and the
Princess was in the year 1518,
long before <hi>Francis</hi> the first's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment;
but the Treaty set
on foot after his Liberty, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for himself, or his second
Son, and this sort of a Treaty
being somewhat extraordinary,
where the alternative lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Father and the Son
for the same Lady, Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60976:56"/>
shews his great ignorance of the
Affairs of that Time, since he
says nothing of it; for this would
have given him occasion enough
to have entertained his Reader
with many Visions and Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <q>21. He says,<note place="margin">p. 258.</note> that <hi>Wolsey</hi>
dealt with <hi>Longland</hi> the King's
Confessour, to possess him
with scruples concerning the
lawfulness of his Mariage, that
<hi>Longland</hi> refused to do it, but
engaged <hi>Wolsey</hi> to begin, and
he promised to fortify the scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that the Cardinal should
infuse into the King's mind.
Upon which the Cardinal did
open the matter to the King,
and the King being shaken by
his proposition, laid the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before his Confessour,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60976:56"/>
who seconded the Cardinal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this he has taken the liberty
to depart from <hi>Sanders,</hi> thô he is
the Author whom he generally
copies; but it is easy to pretend
to tell secrets, but not so easy to
prove them. The King himself
did afterwards in publick not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny this, but affirmed that
<hi>Wolsey</hi> had opposed his scruples
all he could, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had opened them in Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to <hi>Longland,</hi> and the King
himself said to <hi>Grineus,</hi> that he
was disquieted with those scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ever from the year 1529,
which was three years before the
matter was made publick.</p>
            <p>
               <q>22. He says,<note place="margin">p. 259.</note> the King upon
that consulted the Divines of
<hi>England,</hi> concerning the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of the Mariage, and that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60976:57"/>
all those that were Men of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity
and disinteressed, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the affirmative; but
some that did aspire, or that
were corrupted, thought it
doubtful, others, who were
very few in number, affirmed
it was unlawful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is so false, that all the
Bishops of <hi>England, Fisher</hi> only
excepted, declared under their
Hands and Seals, that they
thought the Mariage unlawful.</p>
            <p>
               <q>23. He gives a Character of
<hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 260.</note> in which he takes
up the common Reports of her
ill shape, her yellow colour,
her gag tooth, her Lump un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her chin, and her hand
with six fingers: but because
all this agrees ill to the Mistress
of a King, he, to soften that,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60976:57"/>
adds a long Character of her
Wit, her Air and Humour, in
which he lays her charms, and
here he takes all the licences of
a Poët, as well as of a Painter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But as several of her Pictures,
yet extant, shew the folly of those
Stories, concerning her Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
so the other particulars of
this Picture are for most part
fetcht out of that Repository of
false History, that lies in Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas's</hi>
Imagination.</p>
            <p>
               <q>24. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the English
Historians, and some other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
agree to those things,
and for his Vouchers he cites
on the Margent, <hi>Sanders, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badeneira</hi>
and <hi>Remond;</hi> but they
add many other particulars,
thô they differ concerning
them, and thô he will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60976:58"/>
them to be true; yet he
thinks it worth the while to set
them down. They say, that
<hi>Anne Boleyn's</hi> true Father was
not known: that she was born
in <hi>England,</hi> while he was Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
in <hi>France:</hi> that <hi>Henry</hi>
the 8th, being in love with the
Mother, had sent away her
Husband, that so he might sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
his Appetites more freely;
but that he soon quited the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for her eldest Daughter
<hi>Mary:</hi> that Sr. <hi>Thomas Boleyn</hi>
at his return to <hi>England,</hi> finding
his Wife with Child, begun a
Sute against her, but that the
King forced him to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to his Wife, and to own the
Child that she bore some time
after, who was <hi>Anne Boleyn:</hi>
that this Daughter at the Age
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60976:58"/>
of 15, was dishonoured by two
of her Father's Domesticks,
upon which she was sent to
<hi>France,</hi> where she was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a Prostitute, that she went
by the Name of the English
Hackney: that she was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
subject of Raillery: that
she became a Lutheran, thô
she made still profession of the
other Religion. He says, others
make her pass for a Heroïne,
that cannot be enough com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
yet he acknowledges
there are not Authentical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
left, to discover their
imposture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a way of writing, that
agrees well with Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi>
other Qualities: he was here in
a cold fit, and so his Religion did
not operate so strong, as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60976:59"/>
him quite from all regard
to truth, only it produces one
start, that is sufficiently extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
for he accuses all that is
said in favours of <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi> of
imposture, thô at the same time
he acknowledges, there are not
Authentick Evidences to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it; but how then came he
to know, that those Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
were Impostures? He
answers that in the beginning
of this Paragraph, and cites in
general the Historians of <hi>England</hi>
and other Catholick Writers:
and for the Historians of <hi>England</hi>
he gives us <hi>Sanders</hi> alone, thô he
can hardly make a plural out of
him, unless he splits him into
three or four subdivisions, as he
had done <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th, when
he reckoned up the Emperour
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60976:59"/>
and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> as two of
the Pretenders to the Princess
<hi>Mary.</hi> But thô I have in my His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
demonstrated the falsehood
of all this Legend so evidently,
that I had perhaps wearied my
Reader, by prooving that too
copiously, yet since I see that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can croud so much impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> alone, as
might serve even the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Jesuites, and that he is
resolved to keep up the credit of
the blackest falsehoods, as the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preserves still in
her Breviary a great many Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
with Prayers and Anthems,
relating to them, that are now by
the consent of learned Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
as Fables, I must again
lay open this matter, thô I
thought I had so fully confuted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60976:60"/>
those Lies, that even a Pension
could not have engaged a Man to
support them any more.</p>
            <p>It may seem enough to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Mind, that <hi>Sanders</hi> was
the first, that ever published
those Stories, above 50 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Anne Boleyn's</hi> Death: that
thô Card. <hi>Pool,</hi> and the other
Writers of that Time, had left
nothing unsaid, that could blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
K. <hi>Henry;</hi> yet none of them
had brow enough to assert <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders's</hi>
Fictions: and that after
<hi>Anne Boleyn's</hi> Tragical Fall,
when her Misfortunes had made
it a fashionable thing to blacken
her, yet these impostures were
reserved for <hi>Sanders,</hi> and for an
Age, in which he and many
others of his Church were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on many Rebellions and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60976:60"/>
Conspiracies against Q. <hi>Elisabeth,</hi>
they were so powerfully acted by
Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi> Spirit of Religion,
thô they had not the folly to own
it, as he has done, as to give
themselves the liberty to say the
foulest things against the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without giving themselves
the trouble to enquire, whither
they were true or false: and the
things here advanced are of such
a nature, that either they must
be evidently true, or they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
false; for an Embassy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France</hi> of such a continuance,
a Sute moved upon Sr. <hi>Tho. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn's</hi>
return, were publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and must have lien open to
a discovery. The whole Recital
is impossible, as it is told; for if
she was born after Sr. <hi>Tho. Boleyn</hi>
return'd from an Embassy, to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60976:61"/>
which King <hi>Henry</hi> had sent him,
that he might enjoy his Wife,
and in which he staid two years,
as <hi>Sanders</hi> says; then since King
<hi>Henry</hi> came to the Crown in the
year 1509, she must be born in
the year 1511, and then the 15th
year of her Age will fall in the
year 1526, and it being certain
that the King began to court her
in the year 1527, here is not
time enough for her Leudness
and her long stay in <hi>France.</hi> But it
is certain that she was born in the
year 1507, two years before K.
<hi>Henry</hi> came to the Crown, and
when he was but 14 years old,
and that at 7 years old she went
over to <hi>France</hi> with K. <hi>Henry's</hi>
Sister, when she was married to
<hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th; and thô upon
that King's Death the Queen
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60976:61"/>
Dowager of <hi>France</hi> came soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
back into <hi>England,</hi> yet <hi>Anne
Boleyn</hi> staid still in <hi>France,</hi> and
was in the service of <hi>Claud Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis's</hi>
the first's Queen, and after
her Death the King's Sister, the
Dutchess of <hi>Alençon,</hi> took her
into her service, and these two
Princesses were so celebrated for
their Vertue, that this alone is
enough to shew, that she was
then under no infamy, since she
was of their Family. She was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Maid of Honour to our Queen
<hi>Katherine,</hi> who, even by Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas's</hi>
Character, was of too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
a Vertue to admit a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prostitute to that degree of
Honour. So that here is more
than enough to discredit all those
Calumnies.</p>
            <p>
               <q>25. He says,<note place="margin">P. 261.</note> thô there is not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60976:62"/>
Evidence enough in the former
Reports, yet there is a certain
proof for K. <hi>Henry's</hi> disorders
with the Elder of the two Sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>Mary Boleyn,</hi> since in the
demand, that K. <hi>Henry</hi> made
for a permission to marry <hi>Anne,</hi>
he confessed his disorders with
her Sister, and offered to do
Pennance for them: and to
vouch for this, he cites King
<hi>Henry's</hi> Petition to P. <hi>Clement</hi>
the 7th.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> shews, how
little he understands the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that he has, to maintain his
Assertions, since there is an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
for this last, that has
more appearance of truth in it,
than all his other Citations put
together, thô his ignorance made
him incapable of finding it out.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60976:62"/>
For Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> in his Book
against K. <hi>Henry,</hi> objects this to
him, and this has a fair appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
whereas the Petition,
that he cites, is a Dream of his
own, that was never before
heard of. But thô I have said
more for the honour of Cardinal
<hi>Pool,</hi> than all the Panegiricks
that have been given him,
amount to, yet I am very well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that in this particular he
was abused by Reports, to which
he gave too easy a belief: for as
all the Original Instructions and
Dispatches, that were made
upon that Affair, are yet extant,
in which there is not one Word
relating to this matter; so it is
plain, that the Affair was never
so far advanced, as to demand a
permission for a second Mariage,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60976:63"/>
since that could never be so much
as asked, till the first was dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and that not being gained,
there was not room made for it.
If the King had given such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
against himself, as to have
put such a Confession in a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Pope, is it to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
that the Popes would
not have discovered this in some
Authentical manner, and even
have put it in the Thundering
Bull, that was afterwards pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
against him? for this alone
proved his Hypocrisy of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
scruples of Conscience at
his Mariage beyond exception;
and if the King acted in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without any regard to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
it is unreasonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
him as so strictly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious,
and that he would
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60976:63"/>
have confessed so scandalous a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and so to have put himself
in the power of those, of whom
he could not be well assured.</p>
            <p>
               <q> 26. He gives us a long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Wolsey's</hi> design,<note place="margin">p. 263, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the King to marry the
Dutchess of <hi>Alençon.</hi> Of the
Bishop of <hi>Tarke's</hi> being sent over
to bring the English Princess in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi> upon her being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
to the Dauphin. And
of <hi>Wolsey's</hi> prevailing with him,
to let that Proposition fall, and
to set on another, for a Mariage
between the King of <hi>England</hi>
and the Dutchess of <hi>Alençon.</hi>
And that the Bp. of <hi>Tarke</hi> was
cheated by <hi>Wolsey;</hi> and being
in the interests of the Dutchess
of <hi>Alençon,</hi> he demanded a
publick Audience of the King,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60976:64"/>
in the presence of the Council,
in which he imployed all his
Eloquence to persuade him to
divorce his Queen, and to
marry the most Christian
King's Sister.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In all this matter Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is
only the Copier of <hi>Sanders,</hi> yet
he cannot tell another Man's Lie,
without mixing some additions
of his own; for the Bp. of <hi>Tarke's</hi>
being sent over, to demand the
Princess, is one of the fruits of
his own Religion. But thô a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of a Priest, such as <hi>Sanders,</hi>
had told so improbable a Story;
yet it ill became a Man, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to know Courts, and the
Negotiations of Ambassadours,
as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> does, to assert such
improbabilities, as that an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
sent express to demand
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60976:64"/>
a Princess for his Master's Son,
which was the greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that <hi>France</hi> could have possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
hoped for, should be so far
wrought on by the Minister of
the Court, to which he was
sent, as not only to let all this fall;
but to make a new Proposition
for the illegitimating of the young
Princess, and for offering his
Master's Sister to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and
all this without any Instructions
from his Master, and thereby
exposing the Dutchess of <hi>Alençon</hi>
to the scorn of being rejected, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
she was so publickly offered to
the King of <hi>England;</hi> thô every
Body knows, that the first offers
of Princesses are made in secret.
And after all this, that the Bishop
of <hi>Tarke,</hi> who not only excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Instructions, but acted
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60976:65"/>
contrary to them in so important
a matter, was neither recalled,
nor disgraced; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he was afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
to be a Cardinal by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
of the Court of
<hi>France;</hi> and he being a Cardinal,
and seeing afterwards how he
was abused, if we may believe
this Fable, is it to be supposed,
that he, either out of his own
Zeal for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or
by the Accusations that naturally
such a Proposition, begun by
him, must have brought on him,
would not have told all this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
afterwards? In short, as
this Relation contains many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
in it, that are not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Forms of our Court,
such as his demanding an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in the presence of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60976:65"/>
Council (for it seems, as Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
set our Parliaments above
our Kings, he will make the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Council equal to them) so the
whole is so contrary to all the
Methods of Ambassadours, that
this would scarce pass, if it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the transactions of the
Courts of <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Iapan;</hi> but it
is so gross an imposition on such
as know the Methods of the
Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
presumed too much on the
credulity of his Readers, when
he thought that this could be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:
and <hi>si non è vero, il è ben
trovato,</hi> is so necessary a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
for a Man to maintain,
that would have his Books sell
well, which I am told is Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas's</hi>
chief Design, that he had
best find out some Judge of his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60976:66"/>
Pieces, that has a true Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
since it is plain, that
he has not sence enough himself
to make a right Judgment in such
matters.</p>
            <p>
               <q>27. He says,<note place="margin">P. 266.</note> when Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Wolsey</hi> went over into <hi>France</hi>
he caried a Commission to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
the Universities of <hi>France,</hi>
touching the King's Divorce;
but that the change of Affairs
in <hi>Italy,</hi> made the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
him; who was strangely
surprised, when he found that
the King had no thoughts of
marrying the Dutchess of <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon,</hi>
and that he was become
so much in love with <hi>Anne Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn,</hi>
that he was resolved to
marry her on any Terms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is an unfortunate thing for a
Man, to have heard too much,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60976:66"/>
and to have read too little of His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory:
for as the one gives him
much confidence, so the other
exposes him to many Errours.
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had heard, that K.
<hi>Henry</hi> had consulted many Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities;
but not knowing
where to place this, he fancied,
that it must be the first step in the
whole Matter. But he knew
not, that this was not thought
on, till after a Sute of above two
Years continuance, in which the
King saw, how he was deluded
by the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and upon
that, he took the other Method
of consulting the Universities.
All his speculations concerning
Card. <hi>Wolsey,</hi> are built on the
common Mistake, that supposes
him ignorant of the King's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60976:67"/>
of which I have sufficiently
demonstrated.</p>
            <p>
               <q>28. He tells us,<note place="margin">p. 278.</note> that Card.
<hi>Wolsey</hi> having once several Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
to dine with them, the
King knowing of it, went to
them after Dinner, and made
a Writing to be read to them,
that set forth the Reasons
against his Mariage: the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
did not approve it quite;
yet they were so complying, as
to say, that if those things were
true, his scruples were well
grounded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was too important a
thing, not be made appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
by some of his pretended
Vouchers, thô it is most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false; for a Resolution, signed
by all the Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Fisher,</hi> was produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60976:67"/>
the Legates, to shew how
well the King's scruples were
grounded.</p>
            <p>
               <q>29. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
acted more steadily, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to give the King an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
proof of his Mistresses
Lewdness; for Sr. <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi>
that had obtained of her the last
favours, was willing to let the
King know it; and so being of
the Privy Councel, he not only
owned the matter to the rest of
that Board, but was content
to let the King know it; and
when he found that the King
would not believe it, he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make the King himself
an Eye-witness to their Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
but thô the Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
made this bold Proposition
to the King, he was so far from
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60976:68"/>
hearkning to it, that <hi>Wiat</hi> was
disgraced upon it, and by this
means the Mistress was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from such dangerous Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
for the future.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such a Story as this might
have passed from a <hi>Sanders,</hi> that
knew the World little; but in
earnest, it seems the fits of Mr.
<hi>Varillas's</hi> Religion are strong even
to Extasy, since they make him
write as extravagantly of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs, as if he had passed
his whole Life in a Desert. A
Man that knows what humane
Nature is, cannot think that
<hi>Wiat</hi> would have either so far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied
Mrs. <hi>Boleyn,</hi> or exposed
himself, as to have made such a
Discovery; it being more natural
for a Man, that was assured of a
young Lady's Favour, to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60976:68"/>
to her Elevation, since that
must have raised himself, than to
contrive her Ruin. And K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
whose imperious temper
gave him a particular Disposition
to Jealousy, must have been of
different composition from all
the rest of Mankind, if he could
have rejected a Discovery of this
nature. And when the secrets of
Jealousies are opened to Princes,
it is too gross, even for a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
to make the Discoverer
to begin with the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
and to procure a Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from them, to acquaint the
King with them. But as <hi>Wiat</hi>
does not appear to have been a
Privy Councelour, till near the
end of K. <hi>Henry's</hi> Reign; so it is
plain enough, he was never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced,
but continued to be still
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60976:69"/>
imploied by the King in some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Embassies, to the end of
his Life.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi>
endeavoured, thô in vain, to
engage Sr. <hi>Thomas More</hi> to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociate
her Affair; but he being
proof against all corruption,
<hi>Gardiner,</hi> that was a Canonist,
was made Secretary of State,
and was sent to <hi>Rome</hi> with My-Lord
<hi>Brian,</hi> who scandalised
all <hi>Rome</hi> with his lewd beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
and had the impudence
to assure the Pope, that the
Queen desired to be divorced,
that so she might retire into a
Monastery. And made other
offers of great advantage to the
Pope, in case he would allow
the Divorce.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> cannot say too
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60976:69"/>
much in Sr. <hi>Thomas More's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation;
but since he was a
Man of so much Sincerity, it is
certain, that he approved of the
Divorce: for in a Letter, that
his own Family printed among
his other Works, in Q. <hi>Mary's</hi>
Reign, he, writing to <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
owns, that he had approved of
the Divorce, and that he had
great hopes of the King's success
in it, as long as it was prosecuted
in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the defects that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be in the Bull; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that most of the Universities
and of the learned Men of <hi>Europe</hi>
had given their Opinions in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of the Divorce, four years
after it was first moved, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then Chancellour, went
down to the House of Commons
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60976:70"/>
and made those Decisions to be
read there, and upon that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the Members of Parliament
to report in their Countries, that
which they had heard and seen;
and added these very Words,
<hi>and then all Men will openly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that the King has not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
this Matter for his Will and
Pleasure, but only for the discharge
of his Conscience.</hi> Upon <hi>Wolsey's</hi>
Disgrace, he was made Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
and continued in that
high trust almost three years;
which is an evident sign that he
did not then oppose the Divorce;
nor did he grow disgusted of the
Court, till he saw that the King
was upon the point of breaking
with the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that he
would have liked the Divorce,
if the Pope could have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60976:70"/>
with to allow it; but he
did not approve of the King's
procuring it another way. Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> is no happier in the other
parts of this Article: for <hi>Gardiner</hi>
was not sent first to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate
this matter. <hi>Knight</hi> that
was Secretary of State, was first
imploied; and <hi>Gardiner</hi> was not
made Secretary of State, till near
the end of this Negotiation: nor
was he ever sent to <hi>Rome</hi> with
<hi>Brian:</hi> nor was <hi>Brian</hi> a Lord, but
only a Knight; and it was a year
after this Sute was first begun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Brian</hi> was imploied in it; so
that he could carry no such delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Message to the Pope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Queen's desiring the
Divorce. And for this pretension
of the Queen's desiring to retire
to a Monastery, it was never
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60976:71"/>
made use of by the English Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours.
It was on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
a notion of the Pope's, who
thought, that if that could be
put in her Head, it would be
the easiest Method of getting out
of this uneasy matter: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ordered his Legate Card.
<hi>Campegio,</hi> to advise the Queen
to it. And for the scandals of
<hi>Brian's</hi> Life, they must have been
very great, if they gave offence
at <hi>Rome</hi> at that time: but as I can
not answer much for <hi>Brian,</hi> so I
will not trouble my self to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
him; but he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
him more indecently at
<hi>Rome,</hi> than <hi>Campegio</hi> did in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
when he came over Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
who scandalised even the
Court with his lewd behaviour.</p>
            <p>
               <q>31. He says,<note place="margin">p. 272.</note> the Pope was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60976:71"/>
sensible of his obligations to the
King, and resolved to do all he
could to gratify him, and so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>Cajetan</hi> to examine the
matter, who did it in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
after the Method of the
Schools. And here he gives us
an abstract of his Book. He laid
this down for a Maxime, that
the High-Priest under the N.
Testament had no less Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
than the High-Priest had
under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> who
had power to allow of such
Mariages, to good ends and in
good Circumstances; and that
the end of this Mariage was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
that the Crowns of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
and <hi>Spain</hi> being united,
might send their Fleets to block
up <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And that by
this Mariage, as <hi>Italy</hi> was to be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60976:72"/>
set at Peace, so K. <hi>Henry</hi> was
diverted from marrying into
Families suspect of Heresy: and
that therefore the Pope could
not grant a Dispensation for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling
it. And with his usual
Confidence, he cites on the
Margent <hi>Cajetan's</hi> Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And this, he says, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the Pope in his Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not to grant the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
for breaking the Mariage
upon any Terms whatsoever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have given such Authentick
Demonstrations of the Falsehood
of this Particular, that I am sure
the strongest Fit of Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi>
Religion can not resist them. For
the Pope, upon the first Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
franckly granted the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
and only consulted
with some Cardinals about the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60976:72"/>
Methods of doing it: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he sent one over to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and promised, that he
would do, not only all that he
could grant either in Law or Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
but every thing else that he
could grant out of that plenitude
of Power, with which he was
vested in the King's favour. The
Pope also proposed a Method,
that perhaps would have
brought the matter to an easier is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
which was, that if the
King was satisfied in his own
Conscience concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
in which he did not think
that there was a Doctor in the
whole World, that could judg
so well as himself, then he might
put away his Queen, and marry
another, and then the Pope
would confirm all. For the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60976:73"/>
Pope thought, it would be
easier for him to confirm it,
when it was once done, than to
give Authority to do it: and in
short, the Pope made the King
still believe, that he would do
it, till by that means he brought
the Emperour to grant him all
he desired. And as for <hi>Cajetan's</hi>
opinion, I am now in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
where I cannot find his
Works, so I cannot be so positive
in this matter; but as far as my
Memory serves me, <hi>Cajetan</hi> writ
nothing with relation to this
matter: but only in the body of
his School-Divinity, that he had
published long before this Sute
began, he had set on foot a new
Opinion, touching the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of marrying in near De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
which the Church by a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60976:73"/>
constant Tradition had in all
Times lookt on as Moral Laws;
whereas he asserted, they were
only Positive Precepts, that did
not bind under the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and by consequence,
that there was no Law now
against Mariages in those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
but the Law of the
Church, with which the Pope
might dispense. In all the Books
that I have seen, that were writ
for the Queen's Cause, <hi>Cajetan's</hi>
Authority is brought, as a thing
already abroad in the World, and
not as a Consultation writ upon
this Occasion: and by what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
of that Cardinal's Life,
it is said, that in his reasonings
with <hi>Luther</hi> he had found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so defective in the knowledg
of the Scripture, that whereas
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60976:74"/>
formerly he had given himself
wholly to the Study of School-Divinity,
he after that gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
entirely to the Study of the
Scripture, in which, making
allowances for his Ignorance of
the Original Tongues, he suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to admiration. But thô I
cannot procure a Sight of his
Treatise concerning the Degrees
of Mariage, the Idea that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of his solide way of writing,
makes me conclude, that he
was not capable of writing in so
trifling a manner, as Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
represents the Matter. For
what Man of sense could say, that
the Highpriest under the Jewish
Religion could dispense with a
Brother's marrying his Brother's
Widdow, in some cases: in case
that a Brother died without
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60976:74"/>
Children, his Brother, or the
next of Kin, might have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Widdow, by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
that the Law gave,
and not by a Dispensation of the
Highpriest. And for the Ends
that he pretends of those two
Princes, going to block up <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
with their Fleets, a
Man must be ignorant in History
to the Degree of Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> to
imagine this, since as the Kings
of those Times had no Royal
Fleets, but were forced to hire
Merchant Vessels, when they
had occasion for them; so the
blocking up of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was
too bold a project for those Days,
and does not seem to have been
so much as once thought on. And
for the other Ends that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
thô the procuring such a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60976:75"/>
Peace to <hi>Italy,</hi> as was for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Popes, was a thing
for which they would have sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
any thing; yet this differs
much from P. <hi>Iulius</hi> the second's
Character, who granted the
Dispensation, since his whole
Reign was a continued Imbroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Italy.</hi> Nor does it appear
that K. <hi>Henry's</hi> Mariage could
have any influence on the Peace
of <hi>Italy,</hi> unless it were very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.
And as for the other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
alledged for the Mariage,
that it diverted K. <hi>Henry</hi> from
marrying into Families suspect of
Heresy, this is too great a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Costume;</hi> for it seems
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had the present State
of <hi>Europe</hi> in his Head, when he
writ it: but <hi>Cajetan</hi> could not
write this, for in the year 1503
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60976:75"/>
there were no Families in <hi>Europe</hi>
suspect of Heresy: so that all this
reasoning, that is here entitled
to <hi>Cajetan,</hi> is a mass of Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las's</hi>
crude Imaginations, which
doe equally discover both his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
and his want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <q>32. He accuses Mr. <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 274.</note>
for saying a thing, that
was no way probable, when
he affirms, that Card. <hi>Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi>
caried over to <hi>England</hi> a
Bull annulling the Mariage,
which he was allowed to shew
both to the King and to Card.
<hi>Wolsey,</hi> but that this was only
an artifice to procure him the
more credit for drawing out
the Process into a great length.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But when a Writer rejects
what he finds affirmed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60976:76"/>
that lived in the Time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which he writs, he
ought at least to give some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to justify his being of another
mind; since it is a little too bold
for any Man, of a temper more
modest than that of Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi>
to deny a matter of fact, meerly
because he thinks it is no way
probable: but it is not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
but evidently true, as I
have made it appear beyond all
possibility of contradiction: for
after that <hi>Campegio</hi> had, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Instructions, shewed
the Bull, both to the King and
to <hi>Wolsey,</hi> great endeavours were
used at <hi>Rome</hi> to procure an Order
for his shewing it to some of the
King's Ministers; but the Pope
could not be prevailed on so far:
and I have printed an Original
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60976:76"/>
Letter of <hi>Iohn Castalis,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a long conference that he
had with the Pope on this head;
by which it appears, that the
only consideration that the Pope
had before his Eyes in this whole
matter, was the Emperour's
Greatness, and his Fears of being
ruined, if he had made any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
steps in that Affair.</p>
            <p>
               <q>33. He says,<note place="margin">p. 277.</note> that the Queen
having thrown her self at the
King's Feet, and made a very
moving Speech, the King was
so far melted with it, that he
said, he was contented to refer
the matter to be judged by the
Pope in Person, upon which
she went out instantly, that so
the King might not have time
to recal that, which perhaps
he had said a little too suddenly:
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60976:77"/>
and that she always claimed
this Promise, thô the King had
no regard to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a new Fit of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
for it seems <hi>Sanders</hi> felt not
those vigorous motions, that
were necessary to furnish out his
Scenes: and therefore, thô Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> adds no Discovery as to
matters of fact, beyond what
<hi>Sanders</hi> had made, yet he has
the more copious Inventions of
the two. But he does not place
his contrivances judiciously, for
it is much safer to dress up the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the Cabinet, than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Courts of Judicature with
such garnishings: and as that
was the most solemn Trial, that
ever <hi>England</hi> saw, in which a
King and Queen appeared as
Delinquents, to be tried for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60976:77"/>
so the matter is not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
related by those that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that Time, or soon after it;
but the Journals of the Court are
yet in being, and by all these it
appears, that as soon as the
Queen made that moving
Speech, she immediatly rise and
went out, without staying for
one Word of Answer. And in all
that long Sute that followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
for obliging the King
to carry on the Sute at <hi>Rome,</hi> that
depended for three years, this
offer of the King's, if it had any
other being but that which Mr.
<hi>Varillas's</hi> Fiction gives it, would
have been certainly alledged,
for obliging the King to continue
the Process at <hi>Rome;</hi> but it was
never so much as mentioned, so
the honour of it belongs to Mr.
<hi>Varillas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:60976:78"/>
               <q>34. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that in the
Process, as the King's Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
produced a Letter, that
Card. <hi>Hadrian</hi> had writ at the
time of the granting the Bull
for the Mariage, that he had
heard P. <hi>Iulius</hi> the second say,
that he could not grant it, the
Queen's Advocates produced
likewise a Letter of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi>
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
him, that thô he had not
granted the Bull as soon as it
was demanded, that was not
out of any intention to refuse it;
but that he had only waited for
a favourable conjuncture, that
so he might doe it the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is of no consequence;
but some Men get into ill habits,
that engage them, even when
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60976:78"/>
there is no advantage to tell Lies.
The whole Journals of this Sute
mention neither the one nor the
other of these matters: there is
somewhat like the second, of
which some, it seems, had in
discours given Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> a dark
Hint, and he resolved to garnish
it up the best he could. There
was a Breve of P. <hi>Iulius's</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but not writ to the King of
<hi>England,</hi> for it was addressed to
the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
believed to be forged in
<hi>Spain.</hi> It was conceived in the
very Words of the Bull for the
Mariage, and was of the same
date, and the only difference
between it and the Bull was,
that whereas the Bull mentioned
the Queen's Mariage with P. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi>
as having been perhaps
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60976:79"/>
consuminated, this spoke of the
consummation of that Mariage
less doubtfully, and without a
<hi>perhaps:</hi> and the inference that
was made upon this was, that
the Spaniards foreseeing that the
consummation of P. <hi>Arthur's</hi>
Mariage would be proved, he
forged this Breve, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that the Pope was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of that as of a thing certain,
thô it was decent in the publick
Bull to mention it doubtfully. But
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> shews how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a thing it is to write History
upon flying Reports, helped up
a little with the dull Invention of
an ill Poet.</p>
            <p>
               <q>35. He runs out into a high
commendation of the Zeal and
Fidelity that some of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Bishops,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60976:79"/>
to be the Queen's Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,
shewed in pleading her
Cause.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in this he shews, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
he understands the common
forms of Law: for since the
Queen declined the Court, and
appealed to the Pope, there
was no more occasion given to
her Advocates, to speak to the
merits of her Cause. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he pretends, that this was
done, not only by Bp. <hi>Fisher,</hi>
but by the Bishops of <hi>London,
Bath</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> that was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
since all the Bishops had
signed a Writing, which was
produced before the Legates, in
which they all declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the Lawfulness of
the Mariage.</p>
            <p>
               <q>36. He says, the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60976:80"/>
the Cause, to be heard
before himself, on this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that the King had by
Word of Mouth consented to
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a flight of our Author's,
to colour that shameful secret:
for when the Emperour had
agreed to put <hi>Florence</hi> into the
hands of the <hi>Medici,</hi> the Pope
who had seemed to favour the
King's cause till that time, did
then admit of the Queen's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal:
and thô he had signed a
formal Promise, never to recal
the Cause, yet he being as little a
Slave to his Word, as Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
is to Truth, broke his faith.
But he never so much as once
pretended this consent of the
King's.</p>
            <p>
               <q>37. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Wolsey</hi> being
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60976:80"/>
disgraced, was sent to <hi>York,</hi>
where he languished some
time, being reduced almost to
Beggary.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This comes in as a dash of his
Pen, to set out K. <hi>Henry's</hi> Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
but one of <hi>Wolsey's</hi> Domes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
that writ his Life, tells
us, in how great State he went
to <hi>York,</hi> with a Train of 160
Horse, and an Equipage of 72
Carts following him with his
Houshold-stuf; for the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
him not only his Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
of <hi>York,</hi> but also his
Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester,</hi> which
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> fancies he took from
him: and it was impossible for
a Man, that had those two great
Benefices, to be reduced to any
degrees of Want.</p>
            <p>

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:60976:81"/>
raised <hi>Cranmer</hi> to the Dignity
of chief Minister of State, who
was one of the profligatest Men
of <hi>England,</hi> that had nothing
of Christianity in him, but the
outward appearances, being
ambitious, voluptuous, bold,
turbulent and capable of all
sorts of Intrigues. He had stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
long in <hi>Germany,</hi> where
he was infected with Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,
thô he did not outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profess it. He took a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
in <hi>Germany,</hi> whom he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
married by the King's
permission. He had been Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
long in the Family of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn,</hi>
so when the See of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
fell vacant, <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi>
presented him.</q>

            <p>The Fit here is extream hot
and long, and shews, how en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60976:81"/>
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> was subdued by
it, since it is hardly possible for a
Man to spit out more Venome
and Falsehood at once. <hi>Cranmer</hi>
was never in the Affairs of State,
much less chief Minister. And
any Ignorance less than Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas's</hi>
would have found, that
<hi>Cromwel</hi> succeeded <hi>Wolsey</hi> in the
Ministry. As for <hi>Cranmers</hi> Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as he had passed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of his Life in a secret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,
so he was in <hi>Germany</hi>
when the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> fell
vacant, and when he understood
that the King intended to raise
him to that Dignity, he excused
himself all he could, and delaied
his Return to <hi>England</hi> some
Months, that so the King might
have time given him to change
his Mind. He was so far from
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60976:82"/>
being turbulent and hardy, and
from being a Man of Intrigues,
that his plain Simplicity made
him to be despised by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
till they found that there
was a wise Conduct under all
that Mildness and Slowness. And
it was this simplicity, and his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
himself out of all Intrigues,
that preserved him in K. <hi>Henry's</hi>
esteem. He never went to study in
<hi>Germany,</hi> but was sent into <hi>Italy</hi>
and <hi>Germany</hi> to reason with the
learned Men in the Universities
concerning the King's Divorce.
He married a Wife in <hi>Germany,</hi>
and was so far from obtaining
the King's Permission to marry
her, that upon a severe Law,
that was afterwards made
against the Mariage of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
he sent her into <hi>Germany</hi> for
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60976:82"/>
some time, yet he franckly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his Mariage to the King,
when he questioned him upon it,
and there was never the least im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
laid upon his Chastity,
except this of his Mariage,
which we think none at all. He
was never Chaplain in the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn</hi>
Family, but lived private in
<hi>Cambridg,</hi> when the King came
to hear of him, and to imploy
him in the Prosecution of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.
And so far was he from
being presented by <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi>
upon the Vacancy of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
that he was then in <hi>Germany.</hi>
And now it appears what a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has, of making
as much Falsehood go into one
Period, as would serve another
to scatter up and down a whole

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60976:83"/>
that has this secret, and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has learnt
it to perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <q>39. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<hi>Cranmer</hi> upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he would pronounce
the Sentence of Divorce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their Majesties of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
in case that the Pope ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
their contested Mariage:
and thus by a way so uncanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
he was made Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There was no occasion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
any such Promise of
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> for he had openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his opinion, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was incestuous and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
so that his Judgment was
already known. But Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
shews how little he knew our
matters, when he says, that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60976:83"/>
               <hi>Cranmer</hi> was made Archbishop
in an uncanonical way; for as
he was chosen by the Chapter of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> so he had his Bull
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and how little soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
this is Canonical according
to the Canons of the Ancient
Church, yet Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has no
reason to except to the Uncano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicalness
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>40. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he was instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by another Artifice, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
required to swear the Oath
to the Pope, he had a Notary
by him, who attested, that he
took this Oath against his Will,
and that he would not keep it
to the prejudice of the King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He made no Protestation, that
he took that Oath against his
Will; but he repeated a Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
twice at the high Altar,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60976:84"/>
that he intended not by that
Oath to the Pope, to oblige
himself to any thing, that was
contrary to the Law of God, to
the King's Prerogative, or to the
Laws of the Land, nor to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by it from proposing or
consenting to any thing, that
might concern the Reformation
of the Christian Faith, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
or the Prerogatives of the
King and Kingdome. This is a
different thing from protesting,
that he took the Oath against his
Will, which as it had been ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
in it self, so was very far
contrary to that native Singleness
of Heart, in which he always
acted.</p>
            <p>
               <q>41. He says,<note place="margin">P. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>2.</note> there was an
ancient Law against the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60976:84"/>
of <hi>England's</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a forreign Jurisdiction, upon
which the King raised a Sute
against his Clergy, for owning
the Pope's Jurisdiction, in that
which was a mixt Court, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
both to the Temporal and
the Spiritual. And he adds,
that the Clergy had an easy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this Charge, since that
Law had no regard to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Authority.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Matters of Law are things of
too delicate a nature for so slight
a Man as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> to look into
them. He represents this as one
single Law, that was very old,
and that related only to Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
whereas if he had known
any thing of our Laws, he would
have seen, that there was a vast
number of Laws made in the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60976:85"/>
Reigns of many of our Kings,
such as <hi>Edward</hi> the first, <hi>Edward</hi>
the third, <hi>Richard</hi> the second,
<hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, and <hi>Henry</hi> the
5th, all relating to this matter,
and these Laws were made in
express Words against all that
brought Bulls and Provisions
from <hi>Rome</hi> to Ecclesiastical Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices.</p>
            <p>
               <q>42. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the motions of
the Clergy in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
could not but be feeble,
since they had two such trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
Heads, as <hi>Cranmer</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
<hi>Lee</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> so they
made a submission to the King,
but he would not receive it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they would acknowledg,
that he had the same Authority
over the Ecclesiastical Body,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60976:85"/>
that he had over his other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
and thus, without thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on what they did, they
furnished the King with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of calling himself, Head
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cranmer</hi> was so little concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this matter, that it was
past two years before he was
Archbishop, while <hi>Warham</hi> was
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> for
the Submission was made in
<hi>March</hi> 1531, and he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
in <hi>March</hi> 1533. And
<hi>Lee</hi> of <hi>York</hi> was so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to it, that he strugled
long against it, after <hi>Warham</hi>
and his Synode had past it. And
whereas he pretends, that the
King drew his pretence, to be
Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
from a general acknowledgment
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60976:86"/>
that they had made of the King's
Authority over Churchmen, this
is so far from true, that the whole
Clergy, even his admired <hi>Fisher</hi>
not excepted, did in the Title of
the Submission, to which they
all set their hands, call the King
in so many formal Words, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Head of the Church and
Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> in so far as
was agreable to the Law of
Christ: and this was done du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>More's</hi> Ministry, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Chancellour 15 Months
after this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>43. He says,<note place="margin">P<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 283.</note> that upon
<hi>More's</hi> laying down his Office,
the King gave the Seals to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churchman, that was no

whose name was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dley,</hi>
on whom he bestows a

character, thô he knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andley</hi> was no Churchman,
but a common Lawyer as <hi>More</hi>
was, that had been Chancellour
before him, and the Gentlemen
of that Robe being raised upon
Merit, and not by their Birth,
his low Extraction was no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
matter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>44. He says,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the King fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the Pope was ofraid,
that he should contract a secret
Mariage with <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to do it, on design to do
the Pope a Spite; so the Day
being set, one <hi>Polland</hi> a Priest,
being appointed to do the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
demanded the Pope's Bull
for the Mariage, which he was
made believe that the King
had procured; but the King
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60976:87"/>
swore to him, that he had it in
his Closet, and that nothing
made him not go immediatly to
fetch it, but his unwillingness
to retard that Action.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is so ill told, that Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
ought to have imploied a
little of his Religious Zeal, to
make it more plausible; for it
was then so well understood,
that the Pope was entirely
united to the Emperour, that
<hi>Polland Lee</hi> could not imagine
there was any Bull granted; and
he was all his Life of too comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Temper, to need such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
to oblige him to do any
thing, that might serve to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
him. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
the King here too much like
a private Gentleman, that keeps
his Papers in his own Closet,

               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:60976:87"/>

               </gap>nd by the concurring Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of almost all the Greek and
Latin Fathers, both Ancient
and Modern, and by the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doctrines both of School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Canonists and Casuists;
and if Tradition was the true Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder
of Scripture, and the
sure Conveyance of Doctrine,
the Mariage was certainly inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous;
so that according to the
fundamental Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Mariage
was unlawful: and by the same
Authorities it was also proved,
that the Pope's Dispensation
could not make void the Law of
God, and that the Clergy of
<hi>England</hi> were the proper Judges
of what fell out in <hi>England.</hi> This
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60976:88"/>
being the State of that Matter,
and almost all the Universities of
<hi>Europe,</hi> that of <hi>Bologna</hi> it self not
excepted, thô it was the Pope's
own Town, having declared in
the King's Favours, it was no
wonder, if <hi>Cranmer,</hi> upon such
Grounds, proceeded to give
Sentence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>47. He dresses up a Speech
for Card.<note place="margin">p. 286.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellay,</hi> all out of his
own Fancy; but one thing is
remarkable: he makes the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
represent to the King,
that if he went to separate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the Communion of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> either he
would succeed in it, or not; if
he succeeded in it, besides that
he put himself in a state of
Damnation, there would be
no place found that would be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60976:88"/>
safe for his sacred Person, against
the attempts of zealous Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
who would endeavour
to kill him, that they might
preserve their ancient Religion;
and if he succeeded not, he
might be assured, that he
would lose both his Crown and
his Life in a general Revolt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is now in a Fit of
Religion of another sort, for as
there are hot and cold Fits of
Agues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so if some of his Fits make
him forget the obligations of
speaking truth, this makes him
speak out a Truth indeed, but of
that nature, that if he had been
long practised in the Secrets of
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
Order, he would have
known, that thô during the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
of a King, a Cardinal <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:60976:89"/>
might speak it boldly, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the confusions of a Civil
War, the whole <hi>Sorbonne</hi> might
declare in Favours of it, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such a Reign, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Conjuncture, it was to be
denied boldly. And one would
not have thought, that at this
time a <hi>Clement</hi> or a <hi>Ravilliae</hi>
would have had no worse cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
but that of zealous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.
So we have now an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
notion of a zealous Catholick
from Mr. <hi>Varillas:</hi> he does not
trouble himself to examine what
he says, whither it is true or false,
nor will he stick at any Crime,
if it may tend to preserve his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
And if a Prince goes about
to change his Religion, and to
depart from the Communion of
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> he must at first
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60976:89"/>
look for a general Revolt, which
must end in his Deprivation and
Death, and if that fails, there
is a reserve of zealous Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
who will pursue him into
every corner, and never give
over, till they have sacrificed him
to the interest of their Religion.
This is the severest thing that the
greatest Ennemy to their Church
could possibly object to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
yet Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has so little judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to put it in the Mouth
of a Cardinal. But it is but lately
that he has got his Pension, and
he has not past a long Noviciat,
or perhaps he is now too old to
learn the refayings, that his Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
Mr. <hi>Maimbourg</hi> would have
taught him, who in such a Reign
as this is in <hi>France,</hi> must dress up
their Religion as a Doctrine, all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60976:90"/>
made up of Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
But perhaps some had
told Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> that the late
Articles of the Clergy lookt like
the beginning of a Separation
from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> so that
he thought, it was fit to let the
King know his Danger, if he
went a step further, either in
that Matter, or in a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion, of which there
has been so much noise made
lately in <hi>France,</hi> thô it is visible
that this has been set on foot,
meerly to deceive those, that had
a mind to cosen themselves by the
hopes of some Amendments, to
make Shipwrack of their Faith
and of a good Conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <q>48. He makes the Hopes,<note place="margin">p. 287.</note>
that the Cardinal <hi>Bellay</hi> had of
succeeding in his Negotiation,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60976:90"/>
to be chiefly founded on the
King's being weary of <hi>Anne
Boleyn,</hi> and his becoming in
love with <hi>Iane Seimour;</hi> and
that therefore he concluded
that time, and a little Patience
might infallibly dispose him to
return back again to Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He makes here strange Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
in the matters of Love,
since he fancies, that the King's
falling in love with a new Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
might dispose him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to his old and abandoned
Queen. The thing is also so false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
timed, that it was two years
and almost a half after this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there appeared any begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
either of the King's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60976:92"/>
true Account of this last Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
of the Cardinal <hi>de Bellay</hi> is
that at <hi>Marseilles:</hi> the Pope had
promised to <hi>Francis</hi> the first, that
if K. <hi>Henry</hi> would submit the
matter to him, and send a Proxy
to <hi>Rome,</hi> he would judg in his
favours against the Queen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knew that his cause was
just and good; and the Cardinal
was sent over to induce the King
to make his Submission; but the
King would not upon verbal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
make so great a step, yet he
promised that, if Assurances
were sent him, that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and binding, he would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that send a Submission in full
form to <hi>Rome,</hi> and when the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
procured these from the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the King did send
over the Submission. So that Mr.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60976:92"/>
               <hi>Varillas</hi> having supprest the true
Account of this Negotiation, he
thought he must make it up with
somewhat of his own Invention:
and as all Liquors drawn out of a
musty Barrel tast of the Calk; so
there are so many characters that
belong to Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi> imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it is hard for him to
venture on inventing, without
discovering, that he has full as
little Judgment as he has Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>
               <q>49. He lays the blame of the
slowness of the Courier,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> on the
care that the Emperour's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
had taken, to stop the
passages.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this was a ridiculous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation:
for there being a Day
set for the Courier's Return, he
hapned only to come two Days
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60976:93"/>
after his time, and it being in the
Winter, in which the Sea was to
be twice past, there is no need to
run to any other speculation for a
slowness of two Days in such a
Voyage, and at such a Season; but
it is often observed of those, that
have contracted ill habits, as lying
in particular, that their naughty
<hi>customes</hi> return upon them, even
when there is no provocation ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them, to tempt them to
them; so Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has given
himself such a liberty, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weave
his own Fancies with all
the Transactions that he relates,
that he cannot let the flightest
thing pass without bringing in a
stroak of his Politicks to adorn it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>50. He says,<note place="margin">P. 288.</note> the Pope having
past Sentence against the King,
the King did upon that hold a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60976:93"/>
Parliament on the 24 of <hi>April,</hi>
1534, in which he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be acknowledged su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Head of the Churches
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and got
his former Mariage to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and his second to be
confirmed, upon which Q. <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi>
died of Grief.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In such publick things Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
should be wiser than to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on the giving of Dates, for it
is at least two to one that he gives
them wrong. The Parliament,
that past all these Laws, sate
down on the 15th of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
and was prorogued on the 29th
of <hi>March,</hi> and Sentence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
against the King at <hi>Rome</hi> the
23 of <hi>March:</hi> for the truth is, the
King did not expect sincere dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60976:94"/>
therefore he looking on this last
Proposition as a Delusion, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him from passing the Acts,
that he had projected for this Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
resolved to go on with his
Design, knowing that if the Pope
would grant him that which he
desired, it would not be uneasy
for him to get those Acts repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Q. <hi>Katherine</hi> lived two years
after this; so that, thô the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
which this gave her, did
very likely shorten her Days, yet
it was too Poetical, to make her
just to die at the end of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>
               <q>51. He says,<note place="margin">p. 289.</note> that the King
upon the first informations of
<hi>Anne Boleyn's</hi> Disorders, would
not believe them; but at last he
found such proofs, as fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him, upon which he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60976:94"/>
waited, till he found a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
to let his Jealousy
break out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It agrees ill with what he had
said before, that K. <hi>Henry</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
weary of <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> to
make him now so uneasy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ill of her; for nothing dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
so much to Jealousy, as a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
already conceived, which
naturally inclines one to think ill
of a Person whom he does not
love; but it is certain K. <hi>Henry</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pretended, that he saw any
thing, that was dishonourable in
her: and the ridiculous Tale of
the Tilling at <hi>Greenwich</hi> was a ly
too ill contrived, to be again taken
up; for the Queen's dropping a
Handkerchief, was a favour of
too publick a nature, and is not at
all credible, considering that she
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60976:95"/>
found the King's affections were
straying from her. And even that
was too slight a matter, to have
wrought her ruin, thô it had been
true.</p>
            <p>
               <q>52. He says,<note place="margin">p. 250.</note> her own Father
was one of her Judges, but thô
she made a cunning Defence,
yet she was condemned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with four of her Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and after that she went to
meet Death, with more of
fierceness, than of a true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Soul, and she died as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
in all the Maximes of the
Stoical Philosophy, as if she had
studied them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This assertion of her Father's
being one of her Judges, has past
so current, that I have no reason
to charge Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I my self yeelded to the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60976:95"/>
of Writers; yet having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
a sight of the Original Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of her Process, I found it was
a falsehood, and in the end of my
first Volume I had corrected the
Errour in which I had fallen: so I
must at least conclude, that Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> never read any History.
The Queen had a strange Plea,
for there was not one Witness
brought against her, so that she
was condemned meerly upon
Testimonies that were brought
in writing, which is expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our Law. As for her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
at her Death, it was far
from being Stoïcal, for it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too cheerful; and the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the Tower, who knew
her Behaviour better than any
Person whatsoever, gives a very
different representation of it, for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60976:96"/>
in his Letter to Court he tells of
her great Devotion, of her cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and of the protestations
that she made of her innocence
the Morning before she died,
when she received the Sacre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
adding, that her Almoner
was still with her, and had been
with her ever since two a clock
after Midnight. And he also says,
that she had much Joy and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in her Death. And as all this
is very far from the Maximes of
the Stoical Philosophy, so it
seems Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> understands
very little what they were, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
if he had remembred what
a picture he had made of <hi>Anne
Boleyn,</hi> he must have known, that
the amourous disposition that he
had fastned on her, agreed very
ill with a Stoical Unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60976:96"/>
and equality of Temper. But
this he thought was a pretty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of one of the Scenes of his
Piece.</p>
            <p>And now being as weary of
this ungrateful Imployment, as
any Reader, or as even Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
himself must needs be, I find
my self at great ease, being no
more obliged to turn over so very
ill a Book. And since in the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
of one of the shortest of the
ten Books, of which that Work
consists, I have found so many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Errours, in most of which
there is a complication of divers
Mistakes in the same Period; to
how much publick shame must
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> be exposed, if those,
who are concerned, examine the
other Books, as I have done this.
I expect no other Justice from
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60976:97"/>
himself, but that he will reckon
all this scorn, that such a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
must bring upon him, as a
meritorious Suffering at the
hands of Hereticks, and that he
will use it as an Argument to raise
his Pension. But it will be a great
happiness if others can learn, thô
at his cost, to write with more
Truth and greater Caution.</p>
            <p>The design of all revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is, to heighten in us those
Seeds of Probity, Vertue and
Gentleness, that are in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and I will not stick to say,
that it were better for Mankind,
that there were no revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at all in being, and that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature should be left to it
self, than that there were such a
sort of a revealed Religion recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that overthrows all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60976:97"/>
of Morality, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of making Men sincere,
teaches them to be false, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of inspiring them with Love
and Mercy, enflames them with
Rage and Cruelty, and it is likely,
that M. <hi>Varillas</hi> will easily find
out, what that Society is, of
which I mean. For he deserves
well to be at least one of the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brothers
of the Order, if not to fill
up Mr. <hi>Maimbourg's</hi> room, and
then the Order will not lose by
the change much of a quality,
that has been believed to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
an essential ingredient in its
Constitution, which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to a very pleasant Passage,
that, as I was told, fell out at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miens</hi>
within these 20 years.</p>
            <p>All the Companies of Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:60976:98"/>
choose a Saint for their Patron,
and the many new invented
Trades have put some Bishops to
hard shifts to give proper Saints,
which has produced some very
ridiculous Patronages, for the
Cooks have the Assumption for
their Feast, because the two first
Sillables <hi>assum</hi> signifies roasted;
and when the Needle-makers at
<hi>Paris</hi> asked of the Cardinal <hi>Gondy</hi>
a Patron, he could not easily find
out a Saint that had any relation
to their Trade, but he advised
them to take All-Saints, for it
could not be thought, but that
some one or other of the Saints
had made Needles; but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Amiens</hi> gave <hi>Ignatius Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yola</hi>
to be the Patron of the Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
now the Word <hi>emballeur,</hi>
as it signifies a Packer, it passes
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60976:98"/>
also for a Trepan; so the Packers
being satisfied with the Bishop's
nomination, had <hi>Ignatius</hi> up on his
Day in a Procession, upon which
the Jesuites were offended, to see
their Patron pretended to by such
a Company of Mechanicks, and
sued the Packers upon it, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
themselves upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Bishop's naming
him to them, and when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
was asked why he had given
him for their Patron, he alluding
to the other signification of the
Word <hi>emballeur</hi> said, that he had
observed that all the <hi>emballeurs</hi> of
<hi>Europe</hi> were under that Saint's
Patronage. But it is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to infer from hence, that Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> has a just claim to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
for thô he seems to have
very good inclinations, yet he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60976:99"/>
wants the address that is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to recommend him to so refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a Society, and to a perfection
in it, that cost Mr. <hi>Maimbourg</hi> a
whole Jubily for a Novitiat; for
thô seven years is enough to learn
an ordinary Trade, yet 50 is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to furnish a Man with a
sufficient stock of Impudence for
so hardy an Imployment.</p>

            <p>I Have at last found Card. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan's</hi>

confirmed in that, which was
only a conjecture, when I writ

for it is hard even to guess wrong,
when it is in contradiction to Mr.

such manifest Characters of his

that I could not so much as doubt
of the Imposture, yet I was not
positive, till I had taken some
pains to find out <hi>Cajetan's</hi> Works,
and there I saw my conjectures
were well grounded.<note place="margin">2da 2dae quaest. 15 Art. 9.</note> That Vo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lume
in which he delivers his
opinion in the matter of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60976:100"/>
of the Levitical Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the degrees of Mariage,
was writ long before this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of K. <hi>Henry's</hi> was started;
for it is dedicated to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the
tenth. And instead of all those
impertinencies, with which
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> calumniates him,
and of which none less ignorant
than himself, is capable, all
that <hi>Cajetan</hi> says is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that those degrees were
moral, and of eternal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he in his Commentary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
himself of another Mind,
but takes a very backward Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to prove it, yet such as was
sutable enough to the blindness
of the time in which he writ;
for he proves that they are not
Moral, only because the Pope
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60976:100"/>
dispenced with them, who
could not dispence with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

her former Mariage with the

he might justify the practises of
the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by what he says concerning
it, that it was considered at
<hi>Rome</hi> as an undoubted Truth,
that the Queen's first Mariage
with Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated:
and so it is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparent, how impudent Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> is in the abstract, that he
charges on Cardinal <hi>Cajetan's</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:60976:101"/>
Memory, it was far from his way
of reasoning, to talk of Fleets
blocking up <hi>Constantinople;</hi> but
Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> who knows little
of the past Time, and fancies
that matters went formerly as
they go now, had perhaps the
low Estate in which the Ottho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire is at present, or the
Bombarding of <hi>Genoa</hi> in his Eye,
when he thought of the sending
Fleets against <hi>Constantinople</hi> above
180 year ago; but this speculation
was as much out of <hi>Cajetan's</hi>
way, as it is sutable to Mr. <hi>Varillas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 250 he says, King
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth had opposed
the Mariage of his Sister to the
King of <hi>Scotland</hi> with so much
violence, that it brought on him
several Fits of an Ague. But that
Mariage being made in <hi>August</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:60976:101"/>
1502, the young Prince was not
then 11 years old, and this is too
early even for a Poët to make mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of State to have gone so deep
into his thoughts, as that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
his Health. But as the
Legends of Saints represent them
in Extasies, before they have past
their Childhood, so Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
thought it sutable to the rest of his
Poëm, to represent K. <hi>Henry</hi> even
in his Infancy as transported with
the violence of impetuous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
But I am afraid I lay too
much to his charge, since I do not
believe that he had examined the
History of his Life so Critically,
as to know even his Age; but it is
a sad thing for an ignorant Man,
not to have a Chronological Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
always before him.</p>
