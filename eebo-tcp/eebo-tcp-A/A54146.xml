            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVEre ſome as <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as they boaſt themſelves to be,
'twould ſave us all the Labour we beſtow in rendring
<hi>Perſecution</hi> ſo <hi>unchriſtian,</hi> as it moſt truly is: Nay
were they thoſe men of Reaſon they Character themſelves, and
what the <hi>Civil Law</hi> ſtiles good <hi>Citizens,</hi> it had been needleſs
for us to tell them, that neither can any external Coercive Power
convince the underſtanding of the pooreſt <hi>Idiot,</hi> nor Fines
and Priſons be judg'd fit, and adequate Penalties for Faults pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intellectual; as well as that they are deſtructive of all civil
Government.</p>
            <p>But we need not run ſo far as beyond the Seas, to fetch the ſence
of the <hi>Codes, Inſtitutes,</hi> and <hi>Digeſts,</hi> out of the <hi>Corpus Civile</hi> to
adjudge ſuch practices, incongruous with the good of civil ſociety,
ſince our own good, old, admirable <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have made
ſuch excellent proviſion for its <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> that if they were but
thought as fit to be executed by this preſent Age, as they were lightly
judg'd neceſſary to be made by our careful Anceſtors: We know
how great a <hi>Stroak</hi> they would give ſuch, as venture to lead away
our Property in <hi>Triumph</hi> (as our juſt Forfeiture) for only Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
our God in a differing Way, from that which is more generally
Profeſt and Eſtabliſht.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is moſt truly lamentable, That above others (who
have been found in ſo Un-natural and Anti-chriſtian an Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
thoſe, that by their own frequent Practices and voluminous
<hi>Appologies,</hi> have defended a <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Papacy)</hi>
ſhould now become ſuch earneſt Perſecuters for it, not conſidering,
that the Enaction of ſuch Laws, as reſtrain Perſons from the
free Exerciſe of their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> is
but a knotting Whip cord to laſh their own <hi>Poſterity;</hi> whom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98352:5"/>
they can never promiſe to be conformed to a <hi>national Religion.</hi>
Nay, ſince Mankind is ſubject to ſuch Mutability, they
can't enſure themſelves, from being taken by ſome Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that are eſteem'd Hetrodox, and conſequently ketch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Snares of their own providing. And that men thus ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to change, and no wayes certain of their own Belief to be
the moſt infallible,) as by their multiply'd Conceſsions, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear)
to enact any Religion, or prohibit Perſons from the free
Exerciſe of theirs, ſounds harſh in the Ears of all modeſt and
unbya'ſt men. We are bold to ſay <hi>our Proteſtant Anceſtors</hi>
thought of nothing leſs, then to be ſucceeded by <hi>Perſons Vain-glorious
of their Reformation,</hi> and yet <hi>Adverſaries to Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conſcience; for to People in their Wits, it ſeems a
Paradox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not that we are ſo ignorant, as to think is within the reach of
humane Power to fetter Conſcience, or to reſtrain its Liberty</hi> ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken: <hi>But that plain Engliſh, of Liberty of Conſcience, we
would be underſtood to mean, is this; namely,</hi> The Free and
Uninterrupted Exerciſe of our Conſciences, in that Way of
Worſhip, we are moſt clearly perſwaded, God requires us
to ſerve him in (without endangering our undoubted Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
of Engliſh Freedoms) which being matter, of FAITH,
we Sin if we omit, and they can't do leſs, that ſhall endeavour
it.</p>
            <p>To tell us, we are <hi>Obſtinate</hi> and <hi>Enemies to Government,</hi>
are but thoſe Groundleſs <hi>Phraſes,</hi> the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> were not a
little peſtered with; but as they ſaid, ſo ſay we, The being call'd
<hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> does not conclude us ſo; and hitherto we have not
been detected of that <hi>Fact,</hi> which only juſtifies, ſuch Crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But however free we can approve our ſelves of Actions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
of the Civil Government; 'tis moſt certain we have not
ſuffered a little, as <hi>Criminals,</hi> and therefore have been far
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98352:5"/>
from being free from Sufferings; indeed, in ſome reſpect, Horrid
Plunders: <hi>Widdows</hi> have loſt their <hi>Cows, Orphans their Beds,
and Labourers their Tools.</hi> A Tragedy ſo ſaid, that methinks
it ſhould obliege them to do in <hi>England,</hi> as they did at <hi>Athens;</hi>
when they had ſacrificed their Divine <hi>Socrates</hi> to the ſottiſh
fury of their lewd and <hi>commical</hi> Multitude, they ſo regreeted their
haſty Murder, that not only the Memorial of <hi>Socrates was</hi> moſt
venerable with them, but his Enemies they eſteemed ſo much
theirs, that none would Trade or hold the leaſt Commere with
them; for which ſome turned their own Executioners, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other Warrant then their own Guilt, Hang'd themſelves.
How neer a kin the wretched Mercenary Informers of our Age are to
thoſe, the great reſemblance that is betwixt their Actions mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
ſhews.</p>
            <p>And we are bold to ſay, the grand <hi>Fomenters</hi> of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are no better Friends to the Engliſh State, then were
<hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> of old to that of <hi>Athens,</hi> the
Caſe being ſo nearly the ſame, as that they did not more
bitterly envy the Reputation of <hi>Socrates</hi> amongſt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians
for his grave and religious Lectures</hi> (thereby giving the
<hi>Youth</hi> a diverſion from frequenting their <hi>Plays)</hi> then ſome now
emulate the true <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> for his Pious Life, and great
Induſtry.</p>
            <p>And as that famous <hi>Commonwealth</hi> was noted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
and the moſt obſerving Perſons of it, dated its decay
from that illegal and ingrateful Carriage towards <hi>Socrates</hi> (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
their dreadful Plagues, with other multiply'd Diſaſters) So
is it not leſs worthy Obſervation, that <hi>Heaven</hi> hath not been
wholly wanting to ſcourge this Land, for, as well as their <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi>
to the <hi>Conſcientious,</hi> as their other multiply'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.</p>
            <p>And when we ſeriouſly conſider the dreadful Judgments that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98352:6"/>
now impend the <hi>Nation</hi> (by reaſon of the <hi>Robbery, Violence,</hi> and
unwonted <hi>Oppreſſion;</hi> that almoſt everywhere, have not only been
committed, upon the <hi>Poor,</hi> the <hi>Widdow,</hi> and the <hi>Fatherleſs;</hi> but
moſt tenaciouſly juſtified, and the <hi>Actors</hi> manifeſtly encourag'd) in
meer pitty, and concern, for the everlaſting welfare of ſuch as have
not quite ſinn'd away their <hi>Viſitation</hi> (for ſome have) we once more
bring to publique view, our Reaſons againſt <hi>Perſecution,</hi> backt
with the plaineſt Inſtances, both of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
If but one may be perſwaded, to deſiſt from making any farther
progreſs in ſuch an <hi>Anti-proteſtant, and truly Anti-chriſtian
Path,</hi> as that of perſecuting honeſt and vertuous Engliſh men, for on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worſhipping the God that made them, in the Way they judge moſt
acceptable with him.</p>
            <p>But if thoſe, who ought to think themſelves oblieg'd to weigh theſe
affairs with the greateſt deliberation, <hi>will obſtinately cloſe their
Eyes, to theſe laſt Remonſtrances;</hi> and ſlightly over-look the
<hi>pinching Caſe of ſo many thouſand Families,</hi> that are by theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
expoſ'd for Prey, to the unſatiable appetites of a <hi>Villanous
Crew of broken Informers</hi> (doubing themſelves with that delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Apprehenſion of pleaſing God, or at leaſt of profiting the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
(whilſt they greatly diſpleaſe the one, and evidently ruin the
other) as certain as ever the <hi>Lord God Almighty deſtroy'd</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>and lay'd waſte</hi> Gomorah, by the conſuming Flames of his juſt
Indignation; will he haſten to make deſolate this wanton Land, and
not leave an Hiding-place for the <hi>Oppreſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let no man therefore think himſelf too bigg to be admoniſh'd, nor
put too ſlight a value upon the <hi>Lives, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of
ſo many thouſand free-born Engliſh Families, Embarqu't in that
one concern of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> It will become him better
to reflect upon his own Mortality, and not forget his Breath is in his
Noſtrils, and that every Action of his Life the everlaſting God will
bring to Judgment, and him for them.</p>

Reſtraint,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> though not with that ſcope of <hi>Reaſon</hi>
(nor conſequently <hi>Pleaſure</hi> to the Readers) being by other
contingent diſappointments, limitted to a narrow ſtint.</p>

               <head>The Tearms explained, and the Queſtion
ſtated.</head>
               <p>Firſt, By <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> we underſtand not only a
meer <hi>Liberty of the Mind,</hi> in believing or disbelieving this
or that Principle or Doctrine, <hi>but the Exerciſe of our ſelves
in a viſible Way of Worſhip, upon our believing it to be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly
required at our hands, that if we neglect it for Fear or
Favour of any Mortal Man, we Sin, and incur divine Wrath:</hi>
Yet we would be ſo underſtood to extend and juſtifie the
lawfulneſs of our ſo meeting to Worſhip God, as not to
contrive, or abet any Contrivance diſtructive of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Laws of the Land, tending to matters of an
external nature, directly, or indirectly; but ſo far only,
as it may refer to religious Matters, and a Life to come,
and conſequently wholly independent of the ſecular
affairs of this, wherein we are ſuppos'd to Tranſgreſs.</p>

Secondly, By Impoſition, Reſtraint, and Perſecution,
we don't only mean, the ſtrict requiring of us to believe this
to be true, or that to be falſe; and upon refuſal, to incur
the Penalties enacted in ſuch Caſes; but by thoſe tearms we
mean thus much, any coerſive let or hindrance to us, from
meeting together to perform thoſe Religious Exerciſes which
are according to our Faith and Perſwaſion.</p>

               <head>The Queſtion ſtated.</head>
               <p>For Proof of the aforeſaid Tearms thus given, we ſingly
ſtate the Queſtion thus.</p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Impoſition, Reſtraint,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> upon
perſons for Exerciſing ſuch a Liberty of Conſcience, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expreſſed, and ſo circumſtantiated, be not to impeach the
Honour of God, the Meekneſs of the Chriſtian Religion, the
Authority of Scripture, the Priviledge of Nature, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of common Reaſon, the Well-being of Government,
and Apprehenſions of the greateſt Perſonages of former and
latter Ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Then we ſay that</hi> Impoſition, Reſtraint, and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>for matters relating to Conſcience,</hi> directly Invade di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Prerogative, and Diveſt the Almighty of a Due, proper
to none beſides himſelf. <hi>And this we prove by theſe five Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Firſt, If we do allow the honour of our Creation, due to
God only, and that no other beſides himſelf has endow'd us
with thoſe excellent Gifts of <hi>Underſtanding, Reaſon, Judgment,</hi>
and <hi>Faith,</hi> and conſequently that he only is the Object as well
as Author, both of our <hi>Faith, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> then whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhall interpoſe their Authority to enact <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi>
in a way that ſeems not to us congruous with what he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98352:9"/>
to us, to be <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> (whoſe alone property
it is to do it) or to reſtrain us from what we are perſwaded; is
our <hi>indiſpenſible duty,</hi> they evidently uſurp this Authority and
invade his incommunicable right of Government over Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
<hi>For the Inſpiration of the Almighty gives underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
And Faith is the Gift of God, ſays the divine Writ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Secondly, ſuch Magiſterial determinations carry an evident
claim to that infallibility,</hi> which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have been hitherto
ſo jealous of owning, that to avoid the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they have deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to all, but God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Either they have forſook their old Plea, or if not, we deſire
to know when, and where they were inveſted with that divine
excellency, and that <hi>Impoſition, Reſtraint,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> were
deem'd by God ever the Fruits of his Spirit: However, that
it ſelf were not ſufficient; for unleſs it appear as well to us,
that they have it, as to them who have it, we cannot believe it
upon any convincing Evidence, but by Tradition only; an
<hi>Anti-Proteſtant way of believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thirdly, It enthrones man as King over Conſcience, the alone
juſt claim and Priviledge of his Creator, whoſe Thoughts are not as
mens Thoughts,</hi> but has reſerv'd to himſelf, <hi>that Empire</hi> from all
the <hi>Caeſars</hi> on Earth; for if men in reference to Souls, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
things appertaining to this and to'ther World, ſhall be
ſubject to their Fellow-Creatures, what follows? but that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
(however he got it) has all, Gods ſhare, and his own too;
and being lord of both, <hi>both are Caeſars, and nothing Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, It defeats the Work of his Grace, and the inviſible
Opperation of his eternal Spirit, which can alone beget Faith, and is
only to be obey'd, in and about Religion and Worſhip, and attributes
mens conformity to outward force &amp; corporal puniſhments. <hi>A Faith
ſubject to as many revolutions as the powers that enact it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>Fiftly</hi> and laſtly, <hi>Such perſons aſſume the Judgment of the
great Tribunal unto themſelves;</hi> for to whomſoever men are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98352:10"/>
impoſedly or reſtrictively ſubject and accountable in matters
of Faith, Worſhip and Conſcience; in them alone muſt the
power of judgement reſide; but it is equally true that God
ſhall judge all by Jeſus Chriſt, and that no man is ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his fellow Creatures, as to be impos'd upon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd,
or perſecuted for any matter of Conſcience what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>Thus and in many more particulars are men accuſtom'd
to entrench upon <hi>divine Property, to gratifie particular Intereſts
in the world</hi> (and at beſt) through a miſguided apprehenſion,
to imagine <hi>they do God good ſervice,</hi> that where they cannot
give Faith, <hi>they will uſe force,</hi> which kind of Sacrifice is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs unreaſonable, then the other is abominable: <hi>God

            <p>THe next great evil which attends <hi>externall</hi> force in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>worſhip, is no leſs then the overthrow of the
whole Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and this we will briefly evidence
in theſe four particulars. 1. Firſt, <hi>that there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more remote from the nature</hi> 2. Secondly, <hi>the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi>
3. Thirdly, <hi>the promotion.</hi> 4 Fourthly, <hi>the Rewards of
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Firſt, it is the priviledge of the Chriſtian Faith above
the dark ſuggeſtions of ancient and modern ſuperſtious
Traditions, to carry with it a moſt ſelf evidencing verity,
which ever was ſufficient to proſelite believers, <hi>without the
weak Auxilaries of external power;</hi> The ſon of God, <hi>and great
Example of the world,</hi> was ſo far from calling his Father's om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98352:10"/>
in <hi>legions of Angels</hi> to his defence, <hi>that he at once
repeal'd all Acts of force, and defin'd unto us the nature of his
Religion</hi> in this one great ſaying of his, <hi>MY KINGDOM
IS NOT OF THIS WORLD.</hi> It was ſpiritual, not
carnall, accompanied with weapons, as heavenly as its
own nature, and deſign'd for the good and ſalvation of
the ſoul, and not the injury and deſtruction of the body:
no <hi>Goals, Fines, Exiles</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>ſound reaſon, clear truth, and
a ſtrict life.</hi> In ſhort, the Chriſtian Religion intreats all, but
compells none.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, that <hi>Reſtraint and Perſecution overturn the
practiſe of it;</hi> I need go no further then the allow'd <hi>Martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies</hi>
of ſeveral ages, of which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> claim a ſhare;
begin with <hi>Abel</hi> go down to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and
then to the meek example of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf; How
patiently devoted was he, to undergo the contradictions of
men? and ſo far from perſecuting any, that he would <hi>not
ſo much as revile his Perſecutors,</hi> but pray'd for them; thus
liv'd his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the true Chriſtians, of the firſt three
hundred years: Nor are the famous Stories of our firſt
Reformers ſilent in the matter; witneſs the Chriſtian
practiſes of the <hi>Waldenſes, Lollards, Huſsites, Lutherans,</hi>
and our noble <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who as became the true followers
of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>enacted and confirm'd their Religion,
with their own blood, and not with the blood of their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, <hi>Reſtraint and Perſecution obſtructs the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> for if ſuch as reſtraint, confeſs
themſelves <hi>miſerable ſinners, and altogether imperfect,</hi> it
either followes, that they never deſire to be better, or that
they ſhould incourage ſuch as may be capable of further
informing and reforming them; they condemn the Papiſts
for enco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ening the Scriptures and their Worſhip in an
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98352:11"/>
unknown tongue, and yet are guilty themſelves of the ſame
kind of fact.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, <hi>they prevent many of eternal Rewards,</hi> for where
any are Religious for fear, and that of men, 'tis ſlaviſh; and
the recompence, of ſuch Religion is condemnation, not peace:
beſides, 'tis man that is ſerv'd, who having no <hi>power</hi> but
what is <hi>temporary,</hi> his reward muſt needs be ſo too; he that
impoſes a duty, or reſtrains from one, muſt reward; but becauſe
no man can reward for ſuch Duties, no man can or ought
to impoſe them, or reſtrain from them. So that we conclude
<hi>impoſition, reſtraint,</hi> and <hi>perſecution,</hi> are deſtructive, of the
Chriſtian Religion, in the nature, practice, promotion and
rewards of it, <hi>which are Eternall.</hi>

be Impo'd upon, or Reſtrain'd, in matters of</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?
<hi>Whether ſuch Practices become the Goſpel, or</hi> are ſutable

<hi>Whether thoſe, who are herein guilty, do to us,</hi> as they would

            <p>What if any were once ſevere to you; many are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd

            <p>
               <hi>WE further ſay, That</hi> Impoſition, Reſtraint, and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are alſo deſtructive of the great <hi>Priviledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Principle of Reaſon.</hi> Of Nature in three Inſtances:</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, If God Almighty has made of one <hi>Blood all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
as himſelf has declar'd, and that he has given them both
Sences <hi>Corporal</hi> and <hi>Intellectual,</hi> to diſcern things and their
differences, ſo as to aſſert or deny from Evidences and
Reaſons proper to each; then where any Enacts the Belief
or Disbelief of any thing upon the reſt, or Reſtrains any
from the Exerciſe of their Faith <hi>to them indiſpenſible,</hi> ſuch
<hi>Exalts himſelf beyond his Bounds, Enſlaves his Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Invades their Right of Liberty, and ſo pervert the whole
order of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Secondly, <hi>Mankind</hi> is hereby rob'd of the uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of that <hi>inſtinct</hi> of a <hi>Diety,</hi> which is ſo natural to him, that
he can be no more without it, and <hi>be,</hi> then he can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the moſt eſſential Part of himſelf; For to what ſerves
that <hi>divine Principle</hi> in the univerſallity of Mankind, if men
be reſtricted by the Preſcriptions of ſome Individuals? But
if the excellent Nature of it, <hi>inclines men to God,</hi> not Man;
<hi>if the Power of Accuſing and Excuſing be committed to it; if
the troubled Thoughts and ſad Afflictions of Forlorn and Dying
men, make their tendency that a way only,</hi> (as being hopeleſs
of all other Relief and Succour from any external Power or
Command) What ſhall we ſay? but that ſuch as invallid
the Authority of this Heavenly Inſtinct, <hi>(as Impoſition and

3. <hi>All natural Affection is deſtroy'd;</hi> for thoſe who have ſo
little tenderneſs, as to perſecute men that cannot for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſake yield them compliance, manifeſtly act injuriouſly
to their Fellow-Creatures, and conſequently are Enemies to
Nature; for Nature being one in all, <hi>ſuch as ruin thoſe who
are equally intitled with themſelves to Nature, ruin it in them,</hi> as
in Liberty, Property, &amp;c. <hi>and ſo bring the ſtate of Nature to the
ſtate of War, the great</hi> Leviathan <hi>of the times, as ignorantly
as boldly does aſſert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But ſecondly, We alſo prove them deſtructive of
the noble Principle of Reaſon, and that in theſe eight Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, In <hi>that thoſe who Impoſe or Reſtrain are uncertain of
the truth and juſtifiableneſs of their actions in either</hi> of this, their
own Diſcourſes and Confeſſions are <hi>pregnant Inſtances,</hi> where
they tell us, that <hi>They do not pretend to be infallible, only they
humbly conceive 'tis thus, or it is not.</hi> Since then they are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and fallible, how can they impoſe upon, or reſtrain others
whom they are ſo far from aſſuring, as they are not able to do
ſo much for themſelves? <hi>What is this, but to impoſe an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Faith upon Certain Penalties?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As he that Acts Doubtfully is Damn'd, ſo Faith in all

4. Where men are limitted in Matters of Religion, there
the Rewards which are entail'd on the free acts of men, are
quite overthrown; and ſuch as ſuperceed that <hi>Grand Charter</hi>
of Liberty of Conſcience, fruſtrate all hopes of Recompence,
<hi>by rendring the Actions of men unavoidable:</hi> But thoſe think
perhaps, <hi>They do not deſtroy all Freedom, becauſe they uſe ſo much
of their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, They ſubvert all true <hi>Religion;</hi> for where
men believe not becauſe it is <hi>True,</hi> but becauſe they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to do ſo, there they will unbelieve, not becauſe 'tis
<hi>Falſe,</hi> but ſo commanded by their <hi>Superiors,</hi> whoſe Authority
their <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> obliege them rather to obey, then
diſpute.</p>
            <p>6. Sixthly, They Delude, or rather Compel people out of
their eternal Rewards; for where men are commanded to act
in reference to Religion, and can neither be ſecur'd of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
nor yet ſav'd harmleſs from puniſhments; their ſo acting
and believing diſpriviledges them forever of that Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
which is provided for the <hi>Faithful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, Men have their Liberty and Choice in
external matters; they are not compelled to <hi>Marry this Perſon,
to Converſe with that, to Buy here, to Eat there, nor to Sleep
yonder;</hi> yet if men had Power to Impoſe or Reſtrain in any
thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one would think it ſhould be in ſuch exteriour Matters;
but that this Liberty ſhould be unqueſtion'd, and that of the
<hi>Mind Deſtroy'd</hi> iſſues here, <hi>that it does not Unbruit us,</hi> but
Unman us; for take away <hi>Underſtanding, Reaſon, Judgment,</hi>
and <hi>Faith,</hi> and like <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> let us go Graze with the
Beaſts of the Field.</p>
            <p>8. Eightly and laſtly, That <hi>which moſt of all blackens the
Buſineſs is PERSECUTION;</hi> for though it is very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to require <hi>Faith,</hi> where men cannot chuſe but doubt,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98352:14"/>
yet after all, to puniſh them for Diſobedience, 'tis Cruelty in
the abſtract; for we demand, <hi>Shall men Suffer for not doing when
they cannot do?</hi> Muſt they be Perſecuted here if they do not
go againſt their Conſcience, and puniſhed hereafter if they
do? But neither is this all; for that part that is yet moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
and that gives the cleareſt ſight of <hi>Perſecution,</hi>
is ſtill behind, namely, <hi>The monſtrous Arguments they have to
Convince an Heretick with:</hi> Not thoſe of old, as Spiritual as
the Chriſtian Religion, which <hi>were to Admoniſh, Warn, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Reject;</hi> but ſuch as were imploy'd by the Perſecuting <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Heathens</hi> againſt the great <hi>Example</hi> of the World, and
ſuch as follow'd him, aud by the inhuman <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt our
firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> as <hi>Clubbs, Staves, Stocks, Pillories, Priſons,
Dungeons, Exiles, &amp;c.</hi> in a word, <hi>Ruin</hi> to <hi>whole Families, as
if it were not ſo much their Deſign to Convince the Soul, as to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, There ought to be an <hi>Adequation</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
betwixt all Ends, and the means to them, but in
this caſe there can be none imaginable; <hi>the End is the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of our Judgments and Underſtandings to the acts of ſuch as
require it,</hi> the Means are <hi>Fines and Impriſonments (and bloody
Knocks to boot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now what Proportion or Aſſimulation theſe bear, let the</hi>
Sober judge: <hi>The Underſtanding can never be convinc'd, nor
properly ſubmit, but by ſuch Arguments,</hi> as are Rational, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive,
and Sutable to its own Nature; <hi>ſomething that can</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
its Doubts, Anſwer its Objections, Enervate its Propoſitions,
<hi>but to imagine</hi> thoſe Barbarous Newgate Inſtruments of <hi>Clubbs,
Fines, Priſons, &amp;c.</hi> with that whole Troop of external and dumb
Materials of force ſhould be fit Arguments to convince the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi>
ſcatter its ſcruples, &amp; finally, convert it to their Religion
<hi>is altogether irrational, cruel, and impoſſible. Force may make
an Hipocrite;</hi> 'tis Faith grounded upon knowledge, &amp; conſent that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98352:14"/>
makes a Chriſtian. <hi>And to conclude, as we can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
the honour of our Conformity (only due to Truth) by
a baſe and timorous Hypocriſie to any external Violence
under Heaven, ſo muſt we needs ſay,</hi> unreaſonable are thoſe
<hi>Impoſers,</hi> who ſecure not the <hi>Impoſed</hi> or <hi>Reſtrained</hi> from what
may occur to them, upon their account; and most inhuman are thoſe
<hi>Perſecutors</hi> that puniſh men for not obeying them though to their
utter ruin.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WE next urge, that</hi> Force <hi>in matters relating</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
carry a plain Contradiction to <hi>Government</hi> in
the Nature, Execution, and End of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Government we underſtand,</hi> an external Order of Juſtice
or the right and prudent Diſciplining of any Society, by juſt Laws,
either in the Relaxation, or Execution of them.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt it carries a Contradiction to Government in the
Nature of it, which is <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and that in three Reſpects.</p>
            <p>1. It is the firſt Leſſon that great <hi>Synteriſis,</hi> ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
by <hi>Phyloſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phers</hi> and <hi>Civilians,</hi> learns Mankind, <hi>to do as
one would be done to,</hi> ſince he that gives, what he would not
take, or takes what he would not give, only ſhews care for
himſelf, but neither <hi>Kindneſs</hi> nor <hi>Juſtice</hi> for another.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, <hi>The juſt Nature of Government lies in a
fair and equal Retribution;</hi> but what can be more unequal,
then that men ſhould be rated <hi>more then their Proportion,</hi>
to anſwer the Neceſſities of Government, and yet that
they ſhould not only receive <hi>no Protection from it,</hi> but by it
be diſſeiz'd of their dear <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Properties;</hi> we ſay to
be compell'd to pay that Power, that exerts it ſelf to ruin
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98352:15"/>
thoſe that pay it, or that any ſhould be requir'd to enrich
thoſe, that ruin them, is hard, and unequal, and therefore
contrary to the juſt Nature of Government. <hi>If we muſt be
Contributaries, to the maintenance of it, we are entituled to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, It <hi>is the Juſtice of Government to proportion
Penalties to the Crime committed.</hi> Now granting our Diſſent
to be a Fault, yet the infliction of a Corporal or External
Puniſhment, for a meer mental Error (and that not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
too) is Unreaſonable and Inadequate, as well as
againſt particular directions of the <hi>Scriptures, Tit</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11.
For as Corporal Penalties cannot convince the <hi>Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</hi>
ſo neither can then be commenſurate Puniſhments,
for Faults purely <hi>Intellectual:</hi> And for the <hi>Goverment</hi> of
this World to intermed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e with what belongs to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Another,</hi> and which can have no ill Aſpect
or Influence upon it, <hi>ſhews more of Invaſion then Right and
Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It carries a Contradition to Government
in the Execution of it, which is Prudence, and that in theſe
Inſtances.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the Caſe is this, That there is no <hi>Republick</hi>
ſo great, no <hi>Empire</hi> ſo vaſt, but the Laws of them are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable
into theſe two <hi>Series</hi> or Heads, <hi>Of Laws Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
which are Indiſpenſible and Immutable: And Laws Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,
which are Temporary and Alterable:</hi> And as it is <hi>Juſtice</hi>
and <hi>Prudence</hi> to be punctual in the Execution of the former,
ſo by Circumſtances it may be neither, to Execute the latter,
<hi>they being ſuited to the preſent Conveniency and Emergency of
State;</hi> as the Prohibiting of Cattle out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was judg'd
of advantage to the Farmers of <hi>England,</hi> yet a Murrin would
make it the good of the whole, that the Law ſhould be broke,
or at leaſt the Execution of it ſuſpended. That the Law
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98352:15"/>
of <hi>Reſtraint</hi> in point of Conſcience is of this number; we may
further manifeſt, <hi>and the imprudence of thinking otherwiſe:</hi>
For, firſt, if the ſaying were as true as 'tis falſe; <hi>No Biſhop,
no King,</hi> (which admits of various readings; <hi>As no decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Clergy, or no Perſecution, no King,</hi> we ſhould be as ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
as ſome would have us: but the confidence of their
Aſſertion, and the impollicy of ſuch as believe it, makes us
to ſay, that a greater injury cannot be done to the preſent
Government. For if ſuch Laws and Eſtabliſhments are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental;
they are as immutable as mankind it ſelf; but
that they are as alterable as the Conjectures and Opinions of
Governors have been, is evident; <hi>ſince the ſame funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
indiſpenſable Laws and Pollicy of theſe Kingdoms have
ſtill remain'd, through all variety of oppoſite Ruling Opinions
and Judgments,</hi> and disjoynt from them all. Therefore to
admit ſuch a fixation to temporary Laws, muſt needs be
highly imprudent, and deſtructive of the eſſential parts of
the Government of theſe Countries.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, That ſince there has been a time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance,
and that with no ill ſucceſs to publick Affairs,
it cannot be prudence to diſcontinue it, unleſs it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
before to give it, <hi>and ſuch little deſerve it that
think ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Diſſenters not being conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of any juſt Forfeiture of that Favour, are as well
griev'd in their Reſentments of this Alteration, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
did oblige them to very gratefull Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, this muſt be done to gratifie all, or the
greateſt Part, or but ſome few only; it is a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all are pleaſed with it; that the greateſt Number is
not, <hi>the empty publick Auditories will ſpeak:</hi> In ſhort,
how ſhould either be, when ſix Parties are ſacrificed to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98352:16"/>
ſeventh; that this cannot be Prudence, <hi>common Maxims</hi> and
<hi>Obſervations</hi> prove.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Fifthly, It ſtrikes fatally at</hi> Proteſtant-ſincerity; <hi>for will
the</hi> Papiſts <hi>ſay,</hi> Did Proteſtants exclaim againſt us, for Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and are they now the Men themſelves? Was it an Inſtance of
Weakneſs in our Religion, and is't become a Demonſtration in
theirs? Have they tranſmuted it from Antichriſtian in us, to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
in themſelves? Let Perſecutors anſwer.</p>
            <p>6. Sixthly, <hi>It is not only an Example, but an Incentive to
the</hi> Romaniſts, <hi>to Perſecute the Reformed Religion abroad;</hi> for
when they ſee their Actions <hi>(once void of all Excuſe)</hi> now
defended by the Example of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that once accus'd
them (but now themſelves) doubtleſs they will revive their
<hi>Cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, <hi>It overturns the very Ground of the</hi> Proteſtants
<hi>Retreat from</hi> Rome; for if men muſt be Reſtrain'd upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Prudential Conſiderations, for the Exerciſe of their
Conſcience in <hi>England;</hi> why not the ſame in <hi>France, Holland,
Germany, Conſtantinople, &amp;c.</hi> where matters of State may
equally be pleaded? This makes Religion, State-pollicy;
and Faith and Worſhip, ſubſervient to the Humors and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of Superiors: Such Doctrine would have prevented
our Anceſtors Retreat; and We wiſh it be not the beginning of
a Back-march; for Some think it ſhrewdly to be ſuſpected,
where <hi>Religion</hi> is ſuited to the <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience to
it's Conveniency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Eighthly, <hi>Vice</hi> is incourag'd; for if <hi>Licentious Perſons</hi>
ſee Men of Vertue moleſted for Aſſembling with a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Purpoſe to Reverence and Worſhip God, and That are
otherwiſe moſt ſerviceable to the Common-Wealth, they
may and will inferr, it is better for them to be as they are
ſince not to be <hi>demur,</hi> as they call it, is half way to that kind of
Accompliſhment, which procures Preferment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98352:16"/>
9. Ninthly, For ſuch perſons as are ſo poor ſpirited as to
truckle under ſuch Reſtraints; What Conqueſt is there over
them? that before were Conſcientious men, and now Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites;
who ſo forward to be aveng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of them, that brought
this <hi>Guilt</hi> upon them, as they themſelves? And how can the
<hi>Impoſers</hi> be ſecure of their Friendſhip, whom they have taught
to change with the Times?</p>
            <p>10. Tenthly, Such Laws are ſo far from benefiting the
Country, that the Execution of them will be the aſſured
ruin of it, in the Revenues, and conſequently in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of it; For where there is a decay of Families, there will
be of Trade; ſo of Wealth, and in the end of Strength and
Power; and if both kinds of Relief fail; <hi>Men, the Prop of
Republiques; Money, the Stay of Monarchies; this as requiring
Mercenaries, that as needing</hi> Freemen (farewell the Intereſt
of <hi>England;</hi> 'tis true, the Prieſts get (though that's but
for a time) <hi>but the King and People loſe;</hi> as the event will
ſhew.</p>
            <p>11. Eleventhly, It ever was the prudence of wiſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of Obliege their people; but what comes ſhorter of
of it then Perſecution? What's dearer to them then the
Liberty of their Conſcience? What cannot they better
ſpare then it? Their Peace conſiſts in the enjoyment of
it: And he that by Compliance has loſt it, carries his
Penalty with him, and is his own Priſon. Surely ſuch Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
muſt render the Government Uneaſie, and beget
a great Diſreſpect to the Governours, in the Hearts of the
people.</p>
            <p>12. Twelfthly, But that which concludes our prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
part, ſhall be this, That after all their Pains and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
to ſtretch men to their Meaſure, they never will be
able to accompliſh their End: And if he be an unwiſe Man,
hat provides Means where he deſigns no End, how neer is be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98352:17"/>
kin to him that propoſes an end inobtainable. Experience
has told us. 1. How <hi>Invective</hi> it has made the <hi>Impos'd.</hi> 2.
What <hi>Diſtractions</hi> have inſued ſuch <hi>Attempts.</hi> 3. What
<hi>Reproach</hi> has follow'd to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of it have us'd a coercive Power upon Conſcience.
And laſtly, That <hi>Force</hi> never yet made, either a <hi>Good Chriſtian</hi>
or a <hi>Good Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly and Laſtly, Since the proceedings we argue
againſt, are prov'd ſo deſtructive to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and
<hi>Prudence</hi> of Government, we ought the leſs to wonder
that they ſhould hold the ſame malignity againſt the End of
it, which is <hi>Felicity,</hi> ſince the Wonder would be to find it
otherwiſe; and this is evident from theſe three brief Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, <hi>Peace</hi> (the End of War and Government, and
its great Happineſs too) has been, is, and yet will be broken
by the frequent Tumultuary Diſturbances, that enſue
the Diſquieting our Meetings, and the Eſtreeting Fines
upon our Goods and Eſtates. And what theſe things
may iſſue in, concerneth the Civil Magiſtrate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, <hi>Plenty</hi> (another great End of Government)
will be converted into <hi>Poverty</hi> by the Deſtruction of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſand Families as refuſe Compliance and Conformity,
and that not only to the <hi>Sufferers,</hi> but influentially to all, the
<hi>reſt;</hi> a Demonſtration of which we have in all thoſe Places
where the late Act has been any thing conſiderably put in
Execution. Beſides, how great Provocation ſuch Incharity
and Cruel Uſage, as ſtripping <hi>Widdows, Fatherleſs,</hi> and
<hi>Poor of their very Neceſſaries for human Life, meerly upon an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Faith or Worſhip, muſt needs be to the Juſt and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Lord of Heaven and Earth;</hi> Scriptures, and plenty of
other Stories plainly ſhew us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98352:17"/>
3. Thirdly, <hi>Unity</hi> (not the leaſt but greateſt End of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is loſt) for by ſeeking an Unity of Opinion (by the
wayes intended) the Unity requiſit to uphold us, as a <hi>Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi>
will be quite deſtroy'd. And ſuch as relinquiſh <hi>that,</hi> to get
the <hi>other</hi> (beſides that they are Unwiſe) <hi>will infallibly loſe
both in the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, We ſay, that 'tis unreaſonable we ſhould not he
entertain'd as men, becauſe ſome think we are not as <hi>Good
Chriſtians</hi> as they pretend to wiſh us; or that we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> who never broke the
Laws that gave them to us: What can be harder, then to take
that from us by a Law, which the great indulgence and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude
of our Anceſtors took ſo much pains to intail upon us
by Law; An. 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. ſtat 3. alſo ſtat. 20. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cap. 1.

3. 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> cap. 7.</p>
            <p>And we are perſwaded, that no Temporary Subſequential
Law whatever, to our Fundamental Rights (as this of Force
on Conſcience is) can invalid ſo eſſential a part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as an <hi>Engliſh Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property:</hi> Nor that it's
in the power of any on Earth, to deprive us of them, till we
have firſt done it our ſelves, <hi>by ſuch Enormious Facts, as thoſe
very Laws prohibit,</hi> and make our Forfeiture of that benefit
we ſhould otherwiſe receive by them; for theſe being ſuch
<hi>Cardinal</hi> and <hi>Fundamental Points of Engliſh Law-Doctrine,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually,
and by the collective body of the People agreed
to; and on which as the moſt ſolid Baſis, our <hi>Secondary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
Power,</hi> as well as Executive is built; it ſeems moſt
rational that the <hi>Superſtructure</hi> cannot quarrel or invalid its
own Foundation, without manifeſtly endangering its own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
the <hi>Effect</hi> is ever leſs noble then the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Gift</hi> then
the <hi>Giver,</hi> and the <hi>Superſtructure</hi> then the <hi>Foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98352:18"/>
               <hi>The ſingle</hi> Queſtion <hi>to be reſolved in the caſe, briefly
will be this,</hi> Whether any viſible Authority (being founded in
its primitive Inſtitution upon thoſe Fundamental Laws, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
preſerve the People in all their juſt Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges)
may invalidate all, or any of the ſaid Laws, without
an implicit ſhaking of its own Foundation, and a clear overthrow
of its own Conſtitution of Government, and ſo reduce them
to their <hi>Statu quo prius,</hi> or firſt Principles: The Reſolution is
every mans, at his own pleaſure. Read <hi>Hen. 3. 9. 14. 29. 25
Ed 3. Book Juſtit.</hi> 2. 19. 50, 51.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who intend us no Share or Intereſt in the Laws of
<hi>England,</hi> as they relate to civil Matters, unleſs we corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond
with them in Points of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> muſt do
two things: Firſt, It will lie heavy on their parts to
prove, <hi>That the Ancient Compact and Original of our Laws,</hi>
carries that <hi>Proviſo</hi> with it; elſe we are manifeſtly diſeized of
our <hi>Free-Cuſtoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They are to prove the Reaſonableneſs of ſuch
Proceedings to our Underſtandings, that we may not be
concluded by a Law, we know not how to underſtand; for
if I take the matter rightly (as I think I do) we muſt not Buy
or Sell unleſs of this or that Perſwaſion in Religion; not
conſidering civil Society was in the World before the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Profeſsion; Men,</hi> as ſuch, and in Affairs peculiarly
relative of them, in an external and civil capacity, have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
many Ages, under great variety of Religious Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
and therefore not ſo dependent on them as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Variation or Revolution with them. What ſhall
we ſay then? but that ſome will not that we ſhould <hi>Live,
Breath, and Commerce as men,</hi> becauſe we are not ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del'd
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> as they coercively would have us; they might
with as much Juſtice and Reputation to themſelves forbid us
to look or ſee unleſs our Eyes were <hi>Grey, Black, Brown, Blew,</hi>

be objected againſt out of pure Reputation, let it be in ſome
other matter then what the <hi>Papiſts objected againſt the firſt

is but a meer begging of the Queſtion; for doubtleſs the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> ſaid the ſame to you, and all that you can ſay to us:
Your beſt Plea was, Conſcience upon Principles, the moſt
evident and rational to you: Do not we the like? What if
you think our Reaſons thick, and our ground of Separation
miſtaken? Did not the <hi>Papiſts</hi> harbour the ſame Thoughts of
you? You perſwaded as few of them, as we of you: Were
you therefore in the Wrong? No more are we: It was not
what they thought of you, or enacted againſt you, that
concluded you: And why ſhould your Apprehenſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
us? If you have the way of giving Faith beyond
what they had, and have the faculty of Perſwaſion, evidence
as much; but if you are as deſtitute of both, as they were
to you; why ſhould <hi>Fines and Priſons,</hi> once us'd by them
againſt you, <hi>and by you exclaimed againſt, as Unchriſtian Wayes
of reclaiming Hereticks</hi> (ſuppoſing your ſelves to be ſuch) be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98352:19"/>
employ'd by you as rational, Chriſtian, and Convincing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us? To ſay we deſerve them more, is to ſuppoſe your
ſelves in the Right, and we in the Wrong, which proves
nothing. Beſides, the Queſtion is not barely this, whether
<hi>Hereticks</hi> or no <hi>Hereticks;</hi> but whether an <hi>Heretick ſhould be
Perſecuted into a diſclaiming of his Error;</hi> your old Arguments
run thus, as I well remember.</p>
               <p>1. Error is a Miſtake in the Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>2. This is for want of a better Illumination.</p>
               <p>3. This Error can never be diſlodged, but by Reaſon and
Perſwaſion, as what are moſt ſuitable to the Intellect of
man.</p>
               <p>4. Fines, Goals, Exiles, Gibbets, &amp;c. are no Convincing
Arguments to the moſt erring Underſtanding in the World, being
ſlaviſh and bruitiſh.</p>
               <p>5. This way of Force makes, inſtead of an honeſt Diſſenter, but
an Hypocritical Conformiſt; then whom nothing is more deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God and man.</p>
               <p>This being the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Plea, we are not to be
diſliked by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for following their own avow'd
<hi>Maxims</hi> and <hi>Axioms of Conſcience in defence of its own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>

that the true cauſe of all that <hi>perplext Diſturbance,</hi> which was
amongſt the <hi>Homouſians</hi> &amp; <hi>Arrians</hi> of old, &amp; among us of later

not Tollerating others to live the Freemen God made them, in

               <p>And were there once but an Hearty <hi>Tolleration</hi> eſtabliſht,
'twould be a Demonſtration of the truth of this Aſſertion. On
this Ground, <hi>Empire</hi> ſtands ſafe; on the other, it ſeems more

               <p>But theſe are only the popular Devices of ſome to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

               <p>
                  <hi>Object</hi> 5. But what need you take this Pains to prove Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conſcience Reaſonable and Neceſſary, when none queſtions it;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98352:20"/>
all that is required is, That you meet but four more then your own
Families; and can you not be contented with that? Your Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to a Law, ſo favourable, brings ſuffering upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is no need of anſwering the former part of the
Objection; 'Tis too apparent throughout the Land, that <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conſcience,</hi> as we have ſtated it, has been ſeverely proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
and therefore not ſo franckly injoyed: The latter part,
I anſwer thus, If the words <hi>Lawful</hi> or <hi>Unlawful,</hi> may bear their
ſignification from the nature of the things they ſtand for,
then we conceive <hi>that a Meeting of Four Thouſand is no more
Unlawful,</hi> then a Meeting of Four; for <hi>Number ſingly conſider'd
criminates no Aſſembly:</hi> but the reaſon of their Aſſembling; the
Poſture in which; and the Matter tranſacted, with the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
thereof.</p>
               <p>Now if thoſe things are taken for granted, to be things diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible
<hi>(as appears by the allowance of Four beſides every Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)</hi>
certainly the <hi>Number</hi> can never render it <hi>Unlawful;</hi> ſo that
the Queſtion will be this, <hi>Whether if Four met to worſhip God,
be an Allowable Meeting, Four Thouſand met with the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
be not an Allowable Meeting?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſo plain a Caſe, that the Matter in the Queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 6. But the Law forbids it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the enacting <hi>any-thing</hi> can make <hi>it</hi> lawful, we
have done; but if an Act ſo made by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
was never eſteem'd ſo by a true <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> and if the
nature of the matter will not bear it; and laſtly, that we are
as much commanded by God to meet Four thouſand as Four;
we muſt deſire to be excuſed, if we forbear not the aſſembling
of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 7. But the reaſon of the prohibition of the number
is <hi>(for you ſee they allow all that can be ſaid to Four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
to be to ſaid the Family and Four)</hi> that Tumults may ariſe,
and Plots may be made, and the like Inconveniences happen to the
Goverment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Great Aſſemblies are ſo far from being injurious,
that they are the moſt inoffenſive; for, Firſt, They are
<hi>open,</hi> expoſed to the view of all, which of all things <hi>Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are the ſhyeſt of;</hi> but how fair an opportunity 'twere, for
men ſo principled, to do it in thoſe allowed Meetings of but
four beſides the Family, is eaſie to gueſs, when we conſider,
<hi>that few make the beſt and cloſeſt Council; and next, that ſuch
an Aſſembly is the moſt private and clandeſtine, and ſo fitted
for Miſchief and Surprize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Such Aſſemblies, are not only publique and
large, but they are frequented, as well by thoſe that are not
of their Way, as of their own; from whence it follows,
that we have the greateſt reaſon to be cautious and wiſe in
our Behaviour, <hi>ſince the more there be at our Meetings, the
more Witneſſes are againſt us, if we ſhould ſay or act any thing
that may be prejudicial to the Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, For theſe ſeveral years none could ever obſerve
ſuch an ill uſe made of that <hi>Freedom,</hi> or ſuch wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
to follow ſuch <hi>Aſſemblies;</hi> and therefore it is high
Incharity to proceed ſo ſeverely upon meer <hi>Suppoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we ſhall add ſeveral Authorities and Teſtimonies
for further confirmation of our ſenſe of the matter, and to let
<hi>Impoſers</hi> ſee, that we are not the only <hi>Perſons,</hi> who have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded

            <p>A Brief Collection of the Sence and Practice of the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
Wiſeſt,</hi> and <hi>Learnedſt Common-Wealths, Kingdoms,
and particular Perſons</hi> of their Times, concerning <hi>Force upon
Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Firſt, Though the <hi>Jews</hi> above all people had the moſt
to ſay for <hi>Impoſition</hi> and <hi>Reſtraint</hi> within their own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
having their Religion inſtituted by ſo many ſignal
Proofs of Divine Original, it being deliver'd to them by
the Hand of God himſelf, yet ſuch was their indulgence to
<hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that if they held the common receiv'd <hi>Noachical
Principles</hi> tending to the acknowledgment of <hi>one God,</hi> and
a <hi>juſt Life,</hi> they had the Free Exerciſe of their diſtinct
Modes or Wayes of Worſhip, which were numerous.
Of this their own <hi>Rabbies</hi> are Witneſſes, and <hi>Grotius</hi> out of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, as ſtrict as they
were, not only had Thirty Thouſand <hi>Godds</hi> (if <hi>Varro</hi> may be
credited) but almoſt every Family of any note, had its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Sacra,</hi> or peculiar Way of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was the ſence of that grave, exemplary
Common-wealths man, <hi>Cato,</hi> in <hi>Saluſt,</hi> that among other
things which ruin any Government <hi>want of Freedom of Speech,</hi>
or mens being oblieged to humor Times <hi>is a great one;</hi> which
we find made good by the <hi>

            <p>4. <hi>Fourthly, Livy</hi> tells us, It was a Wonder that <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi>
Army, conſiſting of <hi>divers Nations, divers Humors,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98352:22"/>

live 13 years from their own Country under his Command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſo much as once mutining, either againſt their General, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

Marqueſs, Virgilio Malvetzy</hi> gives the Reaſon of, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>that the difference of their Opinion, Tongues, and Cuſtoms,
was the reaſon of their Preſervation and Conquest;</hi> For ſaid
he, 'Twas impoſſible ſo many contrary Spirits ſhould Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,
and if any ſhould have done it, 'twas in the <hi>Generals</hi>
power to make the greater Party by his equal hand; they
owing him more of Reverence, then they did of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to one an another: This, ſays he, ſome impute to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
but how great ſoever he was, I give it to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Humors in the Army. For (adds he) Romes
<hi>Army was ever leſs given to Mutining when joyned with
the Provincial Auxilaries, then when intirely Roman;</hi> thus
much and more, in his publique Diſcourſes upon <hi>Cornelius
Tacitus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The ſame, beſt <hi>Statiſt</hi> of his Time, <hi>C.
Tacitus,</hi> tells us in the Caſe of <hi>Cremtius,</hi> That it had been
the intereſt of <hi>Tiberius</hi> not to have puniſhed him, in as much
as Curioſity is begotten by Reſtriction of Liberty to Write
or Speak, which never miſt of Proſelites.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Sixthly, Juſt. Martin.</hi> I will forbear to quote, in leſs
then this, two whole Apollogies, dedicated to <hi>Adrian</hi> and
<hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> as I take it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, Tertullian ad ſcapulum,</hi> that learned and juditious

good and example of all.</hi> But if after all we have ſaid,
this ſhort Diſcourſe ſhould not be credited, nor anſwer'd in
any of its ſober Reaſons, and Requeſts; but Sufferings ſhould
be the preſent Lot of our Inheritance from this Generation,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98352:27"/>
be it known to them all, <hi>THAT MEET WE MUST,
&amp; MEET, we cannot but encourage all to do (whatever Hardſhip
we ſuſtain in Gods Name, &amp; Authority, who is Lord of Hoſts and
King of Kings; at the revelation of whoſe Righteous Judgments
and Glorious Tribunal, Mortal Men ſhall render an Account of the
Deeds done in the Body;</hi> and whatever the Apprehenſions of
ſuch may be, concerning this Diſcourſe, 'twas writ in Love,
and from a true ſenſe of the preſent State of things: and
<hi>TIME,</hi> and the <hi>EVENT</hi> will vindicate <hi>it</hi> from Untruth. In
the mean while, 'tis matter of great Satisfaction to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
that he has ſo plainly cleared his Conſcience, <hi>in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Liberty of other Mens,</hi> and publickly born his honeſt
Teſtimony for God, <hi>not out of Seaſon to his POOR COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRY.</hi>

            <head type="sub">A few brief Obſervations upon the late Act,
and the uſual Tearms of Acts of this Nature.</head>
            <q>
               <p>That which we have to ſay, relates, either to
the Tearms of the <hi>Act,</hi> or the Application of
them to us.</p>
               <p>As to the Tearms of the Act, they are theſe, <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Conventicles, Seditious Sectaries,</hi> and <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
under Colour or Pretence of Religion,</hi> P. 1.</p>
            </q>
            <p>1 <hi>SEditious, from</hi> Sedition, <hi>imports as much as</hi>
Turbulent, Contentious, Factious, which ſowes
Strife, and Debate, and hazards the Civil Peace of
the Government.</p>
            <p>2. Conventicle, <hi>is a diminutive private Aſſembly, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and contriving Evil to particular Perſons, or the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in generall,</hi> ſee Lamb. p. 173. In <hi>Tertullians</hi> ſenſe
it is <hi>an Aſſembly of immedeſt and unclean Perſons,</hi> at
leaſt it was ſo taken in thoſe dayes, and objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Chriſtians as their practiſe, whom he defends.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:98352:28"/>
3. <hi>Sectaries,</hi> muſt be ſuch as disjoyn or diſ-member
themſelves from the body of Truth, and confeſs to a ſtrange
and untrue opinion. If any Subject of this Realm being
16 years of age or upwards, ſhall be preſent at any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
Conventicle or pretence of Religion <hi>&amp;c. which
can ſignifie no more then thus much,</hi> that true it is ſome
may meet and aſſemble to Worſhip God, and upon a religious
account, that are diſsenters, <hi>ſuch we cenſure not, but
thoſe</hi> who under colour or pretence of any exerciſe of Religion
<hi>conſpire &amp;c. they are to be ſuſpected and Proſecuted.
This being the true explanation of the tearms of the
Act; we proceed to ſhow how unreaſonably they are applyed
to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Words are but ſo many intelligible Marks, and
Characters ſet and employ'd, to inform us of each others
conceptions, and therein of the nature of thoſe things they
ſtand for; Now becauſe we take the Act to mean what
it ſpeaks, and that the Law concludes no man guilty
upon conjectures, but from the detection of ſome fault;
we affirm our ſelves altogether unconcern'd in that word
<hi>Seditious,</hi> becauſe 'twas never our practiſe in words, or
actions to diſturb the Government; <hi>or ſuggeſt Principles
that might hatch Conſpiracies, or feed the vulgar with
diſaffection to their Rulers;</hi> but before the Kings coming
in, at his coming in, and ever ſince, notwithſtanding our
frequent ſuffering, <hi>we have made it our buſineſs to heal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſities,
Preach forgiveneſs and Charity amongſt men,</hi>
and that they would by an hearty repentance turn to
God, rather then hunt after revenge upon one another:
therefore we aſſert we have not done one thing that may
be prov'd <hi>Seditious</hi> in the ſenſe above mention'd.</p>
            <p>2. That we are Strangers to <hi>Conventicles</hi> is moſt evident,
for where the parts that render it ſuch, are wanting, there
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98352:29"/>
can be no <hi>Conventicle;</hi> but that they are in our Aſſemblies,
appears.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe our Meetings are not Small. 2. Neither are
they private or Clandeſtine; but in the view of all People.</hi>
3. Nor are they riotous, liſcentious, or otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt,
or immorall; but on purpoſe to diſwade per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
from ſuch impieties; ſo that we are clear in the
Interpretation of the Law. 13 <hi>H. 5. cap.</hi> 8. 19. and
19. <hi>H. 7. cap.</hi> 13. and in the ſenſe of the famous Father
<hi>Tertullian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Sectaries,</hi> is a word, that whoſoever has but confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough to conceit himſelf in the Right, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
wants none to ſuppoſe the contrary in the
wrong, and ſo to call him a <hi>Sectary;</hi> but this is but a
meer begging of the Queſtion; For to ſay thoſe are
<hi>Sectaries,</hi> do's not conclude them ſuch, nor does the Act
ſpeak ſo plainly of <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> but granting it did,
yet they muſt be <hi>Seditious Ones,</hi> or elſe all will be
in vain; where we may obſerve, that purely to be
a <hi>Sectary,</hi> is not what the Act ſtrikes at, but to be
a <hi>Seditious One:</hi> for a man may differ in judgement
about matters of Faith, from the national Religion,
and yet correſpond with the Government in matters civil:
ſo that ACT upon the whole, aims not at <hi>Sectaries</hi> ſimply,
but they muſt be ſuch as are Enemies to the civil conſtitution
to be rendred <hi>Seditious Ones,</hi> from which we have ſufficiently
clear'd our ſelves.</p>
            <p>4. That we meet under Colour and Pretence, and not really to
Worſhip God; <hi>we deny, and none can prove. 'Twere high In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charity
to affirm poſitively,</hi> This, or that People meet only
under a Colour of Religion; <hi>yet unleſs the Act had ſo expres'd
it ſelf, we conceive their Authority lame and imperfect that
Perſecute us by it. It will help but little to ſay,</hi> The King,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98352:29"/>
Lords and Commons, by the following words, in other manner
then acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rding to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
meant, that ſuch meet under a Pretence th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t did not conform
to that Worſhip; <hi>ſince the precedent words ſay,</hi> under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
or Pretence of any Exerciſe of Religion in other manner,
&amp;c. <hi>So that they are only ſtruck ar, who are not ſincere
Diſſenters, but that are ſuch, with Deſign to carry on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj <hi>But may ſome ſay,</hi> 'Tis granted, you have very evidently
evaded the Force of the Act, ſo far as relates to theſe recited Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions;
but what if a Bill be ready, for an Explanatory and
Supplementory Act to the former, wherein this Scope for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will not be found, becauſe your Meetings will be abſolutely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
Seditious, Riotous, and Unlawful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which we Anſwer,</hi> That as the granting of the firſt,
which none reaſonably can deny, is a manifeſt Impeachment
of ſuch as have violently proſecuted people for being preſent
at Religious Aſſemblies (almoſt to their utter Undoing) ſo
ſhall we as eaſily anſwer the ſecond, which amounts to the
force of an Objection, and briefly thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is not more impoſſible for <hi>Mankind</hi> to preſerve,
their <hi>Society</hi> without <hi>Speech,</hi> then it is abſolutely requiſit that
the <hi>Speech be regular and certain.</hi> For, if what we call a <hi>Man,</hi>
a <hi>Lion,</hi> a <hi>Whale</hi> to day, we ſhould call a <hi>Woman,</hi> a <hi>Dog,</hi> a
<hi>Sprat</hi> to morrow; there would be ſuch Uncertainty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
as it would be altogether impoſſible to preſerve Speech
or Language intelligible.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is not in the power of all the men in the <hi>World
to reconcile an abſolute Contradiction, to convert the nature of
Light into that of Darkneſs, nor to enact a thing to be that which
it is not;</hi> but that Thoſe endeavour to do, who think of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98352:30"/>
our Religious Meetings <hi>Routs</hi> and <hi>Riots;</hi> for firſt they
offer Violence to our common Propriety of Language, it
being the firſt time that ever a Religious and Peaceable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
would be enacted a Rout or Riot: <hi>Nature, Reaſon,
the Law of the Land, and common Practice, and Obſervation,</hi>
give a clear contrary definition of a <hi>Rout and Riot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They endeavour to reconcile Contradictions;
<hi>for they would have a thing that which by nature it cannot be;</hi> for
that which is <hi>Peaceable</hi> cannot be <hi>Riotous,</hi> and what is <hi>Religious</hi>
can never be <hi>Seditious.</hi> For any to ſay our <hi>Meetings are not

for that is properly a Religious Aſſembly where Perſons are co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with a real purpoſe of Worſhipping God, by Prayer, or
otherwiſe, let the Perſons met be eſteem'd Doctrinally Orthodox,
or not.</hi> Can any be ſo Ignorant, or ſo Malitiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
we do not Aſſemble to Worſhip God, to the beſt of our
Underſtanding? If they think otherwiſe, they muſt, and
do aſſume unto themſelves a Power beyond the Arrogancy
of the <hi>POPE</hi> himſelf, that never yet adventur'd to tell man
his Thoughts, nor the Purpoſes and Intents of his Heart, which
he, or they muſt do, that definitively judge our Aſſemblies,
<hi>void of Sword or Staff, Drum or Musket, Tumult or Violence,
and circumſtantiated with all the Tokens of Chriſtian Devotion,</hi>
a Rout or a Riot. And truly, If <hi>Proteſtants deny the Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of thoſe Acts or Edicts, which were contriv'd and execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſame Tearms</hi> (namely, Scruple of Conſcience) <hi>refuſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with their Laws of Reſtraint.</hi> And as the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
were no whit daunted at the Black Characters the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi>
faſtened on them, neither thought their <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> in

repreſenting them ſuch; no more are we ſurpriz'd or ſcar'd

either do not know us, <hi>or would not that others ſhould:</hi> For we
are not ſo eaſily to be Brav'd, Menac'd, or Perſecuted out
of our <hi>Senſe, Reaſon, and Priviledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay, <hi>LOSERS have leave to Speak,</hi> at leaſt, we take
it; none being greater <hi>Loſers,</hi> then ſuch as for Diſſenting from

            <p>To Conclude, we ſay, and by it let our Intentions in
our whole diſcourſe be meaſur'd, that we have not defin'd any
<hi>Diſſenters,</hi> whoſe <hi>quarrell</hi> or <hi>diſſent</hi> is rather <hi>Civill</hi> and <hi>Polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi>
