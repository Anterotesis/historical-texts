         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT</hi> Honorable Lords, you
may not possiblie be ignorant
of the late-bred broyles not
long since brewed &amp; broached
at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> by meanes of
<hi>Sommers</hi> his supposed <hi>posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
and <hi>dispossession:</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
those selfesame broyles
being eftsoones reuiued since,
and now also (by what priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
we wotte not) so publikely reported in <hi>Print,</hi> as their
flying rumours doe mightilie ouer-runne the whole <hi>Realme,</hi>
yea, euen to the vttermost borders thereof. We two, did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
assure our selues that the holie regard of <hi>Religion;</hi>
of loyall obedience to her Maiesties Princely prerogatiue: of
the publike peace of the <hi>Church:</hi> of due reuerence to her
Maiesties positiue Lawes: of dutifull submission to the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue
sentence of Iustice: of common humanitie towards the
persons of men: yea, and of a carefull continuance of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
reputations; woulde something haue restrained, if not
<pb facs="tcp:25312:3"/>
vtterly inhibited the parties (especially conuicted) from the
vntimely attempting of any such vnorderly course, as now (by
their newly published <hi>Pamphletes</hi>) they haue most vnduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
blazed abroad. And therefore, the Christian care of
that their hoped moderate cariage, hath caused vs hitherto
euen purposely to suppresse this folowing <hi>Treatise,</hi> which
(almost three yeeres since) we had euen carefully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ompyled, as
a christian counter-checke to al such vnwoonted occurrents:
yea, and this our former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suppressing thereof, proceeded (we
assure you) from a felow-like feare of procuring vntimely
disgrace, and of adding affliction to the <hi>principall parties</hi>
themselues. Esteeming it much better, to burie our prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
labours in the graue of forgetfulnes: then (by any their
needlesse publishing) to procure a present disturbance, or to
hatch a subsequent broyle in the <hi>Church,</hi> by pestering the
same with such impertinent, obscure and needlesse paradoxes,
as in their books are broched abroad. Howbeit, perceiuing the
<hi>principall parties,</hi> with other their <hi>vnder-hand fauorites</hi>
(as it were in a setled pertinacie) not onely to hold all those
their former <hi>phantasticall</hi> toies with tooth and naile, but
(which more is) thus preposterously, and (perhaps also with
the secret support of their <hi>vnder-hand Fauorites</hi>) thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifully
to pursue the same with such publike disgrace of
<hi>publike persons,</hi> notwithstanding any the precedent <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaunds,</hi>
or definitiue determinations of <hi>publike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:</hi>
we verily thought, and our owne conscience did witnes
against vs in the presence of <hi>God:</hi> that we might iustly be
deemed too too irreligious towards the Lord: disloyall to her
Maiesties Princely prerogatiue: ouer-much carelesse of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
peace: exceeding remisse concerning the positiue Lawes
of our land: most derogatorious to the definitiue sentence of
iustice: monstrous inhumane towards the persons of men:
yea, altogither carelesse of our honest reputations: if that
light, which the Lord in mercie (we hope) hath reuealed
<pb facs="tcp:25312:3"/>
vnto vs,<note place="margin">Math. 5. 11.</note> should now any longer <hi>Lie buried vnder a bushell,
and not rather be set on a candlesticke, for the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning
of all in the house</hi> concerning these intricate and
hidden mysteries. More especially now at this present, when
the fearefull infection of those their factious proceedings, so
vniuersally, and so dangerously ouer spreadeth it selfe: not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to the <hi>fretting Gangrena,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Experienced <hi>Antiquaries</hi> (right honorable Lords) doe
verie well know, to what dangerous heads such si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
haue (by carelesse negligence) growen in continuance
of time: and therefore, euen the verie <hi>primarie appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of euerie such fearefull occurrent, would be the more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie
and more wisely nipt in the head, yea, and the streaming
courses thereof the more heedfully intercepted and stopped in
time, for feare of ouerflowing the yoong buds of our holy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
For these speciall respects wee haue now proffered
our labours to publike view, and doe verie humblie impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
your Honors patronage, and fauourable <hi>protection</hi> for them:
so farre foorth especially as they fully accord with the
infallible truth of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>We protest (right Honorable Lords) that we our selues
(in penning this <hi>Treatise</hi>) did euen purposely resolue with
our soules, to banish all partiall and priuate respects from out
of our brests: as may (by the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>method</hi> thereof)
verie plainely appeere to any <hi>indifferent Reader.</hi> Yea wee
wholie deuoted our selues, to penne onely such speciall points
as other <hi>writers</hi> report and record in their seuerall workes;
and which in our owne consciences (before the presence of
<hi>God</hi>) we are hitherto perswaded are vndoubtedly true: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
with all our harts to be better and more fully informed
(wherein we haply may erre) by the holie endeuours of such
as the <hi>Lord</hi> hath in mercie enlightened with a more syncere
and sanctified knowledge concerning these points. The spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
motiues for our thus dedicating to your good Honors, all
<pb facs="tcp:25312:4"/>
ioyntly togither this published Treatise: are these that folow
in order.</p>
            <p>1 First, your <hi>wisedomes</hi> hauing heretofore, very orderlie
enquired, into, and <hi>iudicially</hi> determined the vndoubted
truth of those the aforesaid <hi>occurrents:</hi> we verily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
our selues, that as you are therefore the most able, so
would you be also the more willing, to approoue, or disprooue of
our labors herein, according to those your former proceedings,
and the holy directions of the eternall <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 The <hi>aduerse parties</hi> themselues, hauing (partly by their
published <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> and partly also, by their <hi>priuate so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitours</hi>)
verie often, and earnestly laboured, either all, or
the most of your Honors to some fauourable regard of their
languishing cause: wee in like manner (esteeming your
<hi>wisedomes</hi> the most <hi>competent Iudges</hi> heerein) do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
referre <hi>the due triall of our trauels,</hi> much rather to
your Honors, then to any her Maiesties high <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
in <hi>Ecclesiasticall causes:</hi> partly, because, they (being
themselues esteemed but <hi>parties herein,</hi> and openly challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of <hi>vnequall proceedings</hi>) might haply be deemed by the
<hi>aduerse part</hi> but <hi>incompetent Iudges:</hi> and partly, for that
your good Honors especially, being euerie way free from such
<hi>exception,</hi> may therefore, become the more willing to heare
and determine the truth of these matters.</p>
            <p>3 Moreouer, considering eftsoones with our selues, that,
those often, and <hi>earnest solicitings of parties</hi> on both sides
(they arguing especially the controuerted causes with such
flat <hi>oppositions</hi>) might haply but breed in your Honorable
breasts, some scruple of conscience about the vndoubted truth
of such <hi>intricate questions:</hi> we did therefore account it our
bounden dutie, to yeeld your good Honors our holiest supplies,
for the better enlightning of your present <hi>iudgements</hi> in
the hidden <hi>mysteries</hi> of those <hi>cloudie occurrents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 Lastly, your good Honors next vnder her <hi>supereminent
<pb facs="tcp:25312:4"/>
highnes,</hi> enioying a <hi>primarie subordinate power</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>authenticall</hi> hearing and determining of such and
so shamefull disorders as do daily discouer themselues in those
disordered persons, who seeke (in such a malcontented <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>)

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Christian <hi>Reader,</hi> we doe (in this
following <hi>treatise</hi>) present to thy pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
consideration, our priuat opinion
concerning the vndoubted <hi>possession</hi>
and <hi>dispossession</hi> of <hi>Diuels.</hi> Assuring our
selues to gaine foorthwith thy holy
approbation heerein: so farre foorth
especially, as thou perceiuest the same
to fall foorth pat in euerie point with
the infallible truth of the Lord. The originall occasion of this
our lately attempted enterprise: did <hi>primarily</hi> proceed from
those late <hi>vnwoonted occurrents</hi> which accidentally fell foorth
in our countrey, about the supposed <hi>possession</hi> and <hi>dispossession</hi>
of <hi>Sommers.</hi> An <hi>accident</hi> (we doe freely confesse) no lesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
knowen throughout the whole land then diuersly
entertayned, according to the variable &amp; diuers affections of
men. The maine <hi>argument</hi> of the <hi>treatise</hi> it selfe, is a matter
(we assure thee) not rashly resolued vpon, but seriously held
and maintayned (by the one of vs especially) for many yeeres
past: as fiue hundred yet liuing are able to witnes, and the
other of vs also (in an <hi>experimented</hi> knowledge) both can and
doth testifie the same by these presents. For the verie first
newes of this newly supposed rare <hi>accident,</hi> recalling vs both
afresh to some serious consideration of our former set <hi>studies:</hi>
did so diuersly affect our <hi>mindes</hi> with a diuerse and contrarie
<hi>iudgement</hi> (the one verie constantly <hi>auouching,</hi> the other no
lesse confidently <hi>impugning</hi> that falsely pretended <hi>action</hi>) as
we both became resolute (with tooth and nayle) to trie forth
the certaine <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>vntruth</hi> at the least, of our sundrie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
concerning the matter in <hi>question.</hi> Yea, and (which more
is) we so deepely deuoted our selues to the timely support of
<pb facs="tcp:25312:6"/>
those our seuerall <hi>opinions:</hi> as no one labour (how loathsome
soeuer) was yrkesome vnto vs, which tended that way, but in
the least shew of appearance. For what one <hi>Librarie</hi> was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ransackt,
or learned <hi>brother</hi> vnconferred withall wheresoeuer
we came: to further vs both in those seuerall points we seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
held? What one iourney was refused, or present toyle
vnattempted, to trie foorth the sound truth of such flying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
as ranne all abroad: and all this for the more enabling,
and the better furnishing of vs to that our former determined
skirmish? What sundrie and often <hi>recourses</hi> the one to the
other? What <hi>entercourse</hi> of writings? What mutuall
<hi>conferences?</hi> What hot disputes? What <hi>arguings?</hi> What <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerings?</hi>
What <hi>replies,</hi> and <hi>reioynders:</hi> or euer we could fitly
accord about the seuerall <hi>questions</hi> propounded betweene vs?
And (which is more to be considered) the <hi>contention</hi> it selfe
concerning these <hi>matters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 15. 37. 38.</note> it became no lesse violent then that
betweene <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> about the hauing of <hi>Iohn Marke</hi>
in their companie: in so much as we eftsoones departed asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the one from the other. Howbeit that onely wise God,
who turneth the infirmities of his <hi>seruants</hi> to the furtherance
of his glorie, he did so moderate our <hi>mindes</hi> concerning the
<hi>action</hi> in hande, as wee both of vs fully resolued to stande
fast to our <hi>tacklings:</hi> and thereupon also (by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
couenant) did foorthwith conclude to continue
this newly attempted <hi>controuersie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> vntill (by the verie sway of
<hi>truth</hi>) the one be enforced, <hi>dare manus,</hi> to hold foorth the <hi>hand,</hi>
and submit to the other. And herein also we found euerie
hower, the fauorable assistance of <hi>Gods holy spirit</hi> for the time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suggesting of many strange and vnwoonted <hi>matters,</hi> which
haue not hetherto beene vsually heard of concerning the
<hi>question</hi> it selfe. With these many <hi>meditations</hi> and seuerall
<hi>conferences</hi> we were wholy taken vp, till the verie <hi>truth</hi> it selfe
(as we verily beleeue) began (after many debatings and bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerings)
to breake foorth like the <hi>sunne</hi> in his strength,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 10. 11.</note>
Whereupon also, we eftsoones began to <hi>speake both of vs but
one and the selfesame things:</hi> and (which more is) being now
knit together in one <hi>minde</hi> and one <hi>iudgement</hi> concerning
these seuerall matters, we determined foorthwith to put
downe in writing, whatsoeuer had deliberately passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
vs. Purposing withall to vse the priuate contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:25312:6"/>
of these our <hi>primarie labours;</hi> as a prouoking sharpe <hi>

to pricke vs eftsoones an ende vnto the timely vndertaking
of the like priuate conference, in some other <hi>matters</hi> else of
like waightie importance. That (being by this meanes seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
quite from all secular cares) we might the more freely
imploy our whole <hi>mindes</hi> to such secret <hi>meditations</hi> as should
further the timely discharge of our seuerall <hi>duties.</hi> Perceiuing
moreouer by the timely dispatch of this one intricate <hi>matter:</hi>
that two <hi>conscionable ministers</hi> conioyning their studies (being
both of them industrious &amp; bent wholy in hart,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>to search and to
find forth wisedome by althings that are done vnder heauen</hi>) might
(by such mutuall endeuours) verie easily accomplish many
profitable <hi>workes</hi> for themselues and some others. Howbeit,
for the putting ouer of these our priuate labours to the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
veiw of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reasons for the hetherto sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of this present treatis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that (we assure thee) was neuer in our
thoughts at the first: no, we did fully resolue to keepe these
our <hi>conferences,</hi> from the sight of all others, saue onely our
selues, for these following <hi>reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, we were greatly discouraged from the <hi>publication</hi>
hereof in an onely regard of our proper <hi>imperfections,</hi> for the
skilfull determining of such intricate doubts: acknowledging
our manifold wants to be such &amp; so great, as we were mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afraid to put the due trial of our skil vpon <hi>termes.</hi> And for
this cause we durst not attempt the tendring of our owne, but
hourely expected from some others of more <hi>maturity; a booke
better ballanced,</hi> for the timely encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tring with such late bred
<hi>broiles</hi> as concerned especially those vnwonted occurrents.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our said purpose for publishing this <hi>treatise,</hi> was
also eftsoones nipt in the head; by often recounting the <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled
nicenesse</hi> of this present age: wherein, nothing almost,
is now pleasing to any (especially the <hi>curious companions</hi>) but
that which (being euery way concluded first in <hi>scholasticall
forme</hi>) is also, very finely florished ouer with a <hi>Ciceronian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</hi>
And therefore perceiuing these our labors to come short
of such reckoning: we verely perswaded our selues, that, this
<hi>plaine coine of ours,</hi> would hardly passe with those <hi>cinicall censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi>
for currant good <hi>paiment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>maturity</hi> and ripenesse of many <hi>ministers,</hi> and
others among whom we conuerse: was not the least stoppage
vnto vs. For, we are not ignorant, that men (now a daies) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:25312:7"/>
very acute in conceite, &amp; too too much ready (with <hi>eagle-like
eies</hi>) to prie exactly into any thing publisht in <hi>print:</hi> are
euery way able, and apt enough also to <hi>censure</hi> (so sharply as
may be) the <hi>published labours</hi> of others, how lazy or <hi>leaden-hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
soeuer in laying foorth their owne proper <hi>talents</hi> to the
greatest aduantage.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, our <hi>compassionable care to profit,</hi> and our exceeding
great <hi>loathenesse to preiudice the parties</hi> them selues, or to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate
(with the waight of one finger) the present afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those whom this <hi>treatise</hi> of ours more especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes:
hath hitherto forestalled our purpose from publishing
our present labours. Being in very great feare that these our
<hi>pretious balmes</hi> (how soueraine soeuer) <hi>would rather breake their
heads,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm. 141. 5. Luc. 10. 34.</note> 
               <hi>then bind vp their bleeding wounds:</hi> the <hi>physicall composition</hi>
of our <hi>oile</hi> and our <hi>wine,</hi> it is so <hi>vntoothsome a triacle</hi> to their
<hi>distempered humour,</hi> and vnsauory tast.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we haue thus long been held back from making our
<hi>conferences</hi> common to others, in an especiall regard of that
<hi>christian conceit</hi> which we haue hitherto had of their christian
<hi>conformity</hi> to a more dexterity: together with the needlesnes
(as we thought) in publishing any other new <hi>matter</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this argument. Both, because <hi>authority</hi> it selfe had seised
vpon them long since: and for that also the <hi>printed report</hi> of the
<hi>commissioners iudiciall proceedings against them,</hi> might (as we ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
thought) haue been fully sufficient (for many respects) to
quiet their <hi>passionate spirits,</hi> and to calme the turbulent <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests</hi>
arising from thence. For, if <hi>the good man of God</hi> (he hauing
a far better <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>calling</hi> then these men,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 15. 13. 14.</note> to persist and
hold out in his purpose attempted) did notwithstanding, very
duetifully submit to <hi>Amaziah his princely commaund</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>his silencing:</hi> we verily perswaded our selues, that <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ene
Elizabeths authenticall commission concerning ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and causes,</hi> (in due regard of <hi>their dueties to God and her
Maiesty</hi>) might haue enioined them, both to lay their hand
on their mouth, and to put a present end to their further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
in a practise especially so directly opposite to her
<hi>princely prerogatiue</hi> so <hi>authentically debated,</hi> and the same so <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially
also determined.</hi> Loe, these (in effect) were the <hi>maine
reasons</hi> them selues which hetherto with held vs both, from
profering our labours to the publique <hi>veiw</hi> of the <hi>world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:25312:7"/>
If happely it seeme strang vnto any, that we should now so
suddainely desist from such a determined purpose; it may
please them to consider afresh, that, for as much as some <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours</hi>
(notwithstanding their palpable crimes) <hi>in a mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
humour,</hi> doe couertly vndermine and nibble in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
the honourable credit of her <hi>Maiesties high commission:</hi>
therefore <hi>busie must needs haue a band.</hi> And, in that onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
(besides the importunities of such as haue eftsoones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately
perused the <hi>worke</hi>) we also our owne selues <hi>haue had
our latter cogitations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reasons, for the now publishing of this present treatise.</note> concerning some seasonable manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof at this present, and that more especially for these
following reasons.</p>
            <p>First, our harty true <hi>zeale</hi> to the glory of <hi>God,</hi> the same also
entermingled eftsoones with some christian care for many
poore ignorant soules, as also, with an vnfained loue of that
<hi>truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul. in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logetico.</note> 
               <hi>quae nihil veretur nisi absco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di,</hi> which <hi>feareth</hi> nothing more
deepely, then <hi>to be fearefully entombed in the gulph of forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi>
doe, euen peremptorily prouoke vs both, to proceede
<hi>recto pectore,</hi> with all integrity and vprightnesse of hart, in the
now publishing of this our entended <hi>enterprize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we are so much the more willingly drawen to
exhibit our <hi>trauels</hi> to publique vew: by how much we do now
very plainely perceiue, that, <hi>our Antagonists printed opinion,</hi>
concerning the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of such <hi>supernaturall</hi> and <hi>miraculous
operations</hi> in these daies of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> doth fearefully shake,
and very shrewdly vndermine the certeinty and <hi>vndoubted
assurance of that sacred religion</hi> which we all iointly professe.
For, if our said <hi>religion</hi> standeth perpetually in need to bee
eftsoones confirmed afresh, by the <hi>extraordinary seale</hi> of any
such <hi>extraordinary or miraculous actions?</hi> How then should we
certainely know when the vndoubted assurance thereof is
certainely and sufficiently confirmed vnto vs? Sith that thing
which eftsoones admitteth such <hi>essentiall supplies:</hi> doth impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiuely
import some manner of imperfection, in some shew
at the least.</p>
            <p>Thridly, we were also the rather perswaded thereto, in an
especiall regard of that <hi>fearfull effect</hi> which must necessarily
succeed so absurd a conceit. For this their pestilent opinion
which concerneth the <hi>working of miracles in these daies of the
Gospell,</hi> what doth it else (in effect) but iniuriously put vpon
<pb facs="tcp:25312:8"/>
               <hi>faithfull professors,</hi>

               <note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 9. 10.</note> to whom the vnwoonted accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such <hi>lying signes and woonders</hi> (by the speciall permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of God) doth <hi>peculiarly and properly appertaine</hi> from time
to time. And therefore, that any true professour of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
should now appropriate that selfe same <hi>power</hi> to himselfe
which onely is proper to <hi>Antichrist:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

point, the one is not apparantly discerned from the
other.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we were now the more forward that way, because
this their <hi>pestiferous opinion,</hi> doth offer directly a verie shrewd
checke to such other verie <hi>reuerend Preachers,</hi> as either cannot

<hi>humour,</hi> all their <hi>exceptions</hi> (how virulent soeuer) they

            <p>
               <hi>Their exceptions against our persons,</hi> they must respectiuelie
concerne, either our <hi>skill in learning:</hi> or, <hi>our cariage of life.</hi>
Touching any our <hi>great skill of learning,</hi> we both know, and do
freely confesse (as before) that we are (euen in our owne eies)
<hi>minimi Apostolorum,</hi> the verie <hi>last</hi> and the <hi>least of ten thousand:</hi>

such <hi>publike writing,</hi> the more able our aduersaries are (with

            </p>
            <p>As for our carriage of life, their <hi>exceptions</hi> that way, they
must haue a more speciall relation, either to our <hi>precedent:</hi> or
to our <hi>now present practises at least.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>precedent practises</hi> (when they were at the woorst) they
were none other then those that doe ordinarily attend vpon
the <hi>corrupt nature of men:</hi> and therfore howsoeuer they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

               <hi>expose our

this day,</hi> and bestow some present <hi>new blessing vpon vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching any our now <hi>present practises</hi> (howsoeuer the
<hi>common calumniatours</hi> of men may happely measure the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of our steps,</hi> by their owne <hi>proper footings,</hi> and so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reache
vs a large inch at the least) we doe here in the honour
of <hi>Gods</hi> holy name (with the protestation of our harts) very
freely acknowledge, that, albeit we our owne selues do know
more by our selues then all the world else: yet (we praise our
good God) we do (at this present) know nothing by our selues
that may make vs afraid to <hi>confront the very holiest of them all
to their face;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 4.</note> though (notwithstanding all this) <hi>we are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
iustified in the presence of him who iudgeth the hart.</hi> In the
meane time, we thinke it some part of <hi>brotherly duety,</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne
all those our <hi>calumnious accusers</hi> of this; namely, that if
they still make it their speciall glory to vndergo the <hi>gung-far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
office,</hi> or if they doe still take a singular pleasure to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
and raking in euery mans <hi>channel</hi> euen vp to their <hi>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes:</hi>
may happily (in the end) defile their <hi>faire fingers,</hi>
and procure a foule sauour to their owne proper <hi>persons.</hi> And
therefore we do frendly aduise them, to desist from those <hi>cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion-like
courses in time:</hi> or if (because <hi>antiquum obtinet Crito</hi>)
their tatling toongs must needs he tampring that way in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
at least: then, let them begin first (as we say) <hi>ab ipso lare,</hi>

like to the slouenly <hi>barber,</hi> who (being to to curious in cutting,

            <p>Their <hi>exceptions</hi> more especially concerning our <hi>cause,</hi> they
are such as respect either the <hi>matter</hi> it selfe, or our <hi>manner</hi> of
handling the same.</p>
            <p>The <hi>matter</hi> it selfe whatsoeuer, we doe freely offer to their
<hi>publike view</hi> and are verie well willing the <hi>truth</hi> thereof; be
tried downe to the <hi>branne.</hi> In the triall whereof, if happely it
fall foorth to be either <hi>hay,</hi> or <hi>straw,</hi> or <hi>stubble,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 12. 13.</note> and so by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
become vtterly vnfit for <hi>the building in hand:</hi> we are
content that the same be foorth with reiected of all, as a <hi>roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
rapsody</hi> vnworthy the reading.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>our manner of handling the cause,</hi> their <hi>exceptions</hi>
that way must necessarily be such as concerne the very <hi>forme
it selfe:</hi> or our <hi>order in following the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First for the <hi>forme it selfe,</hi> the same (you see) is <hi>Dialogicall:</hi>
the which forme (we are sure) is no lesse <hi>ancient</hi> then <hi>authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
approoued of all, and therefore we know no one <hi>reason</hi> as
yet, why we also our selues may not iustly challenge the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge</hi>
thereof if we please. If any may happily imagine we
<pb facs="tcp:25312:11"/>
haue purposely propounded to our selues this <hi>dialogizing</hi>
manner of dealing of a very set purpose: to the end, that by
such a <hi>prosopopoeia,</hi> or faining of <hi>persons,</hi> we might gaine greater
liberty to propound what seemeth good to our selues, and to
girde at whose <hi>persons</hi> we please: our answere is this, that, the
<hi>speakers</hi> produced in this present <hi>discourse,</hi> they are such as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
concerne the <hi>matters in question:</hi> and therefore, no
man may iustly be offended therat, but he only that is tainted
with those erronious <hi>absurdities,</hi> which vnder that name, are
so couertly touched. Neither may any be iustly greeued, that
we haue put downe manie moe <hi>obiections,</hi> then <hi>our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
woulde euer haue made: for therein, we haue rather <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,</hi>
then <hi>foundered</hi> the free passage of their <hi>cause</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.
Yea, much more for mannaging their <hi>cause,</hi> is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by vs, then hath hitherto beene heard from themselues,
or from any their <hi>fauorites:</hi> although wee haue purposely
<hi>ploughed with their hey four</hi> from time to time,<note place="margin">Iudg. 14. 18.</note> that we might
be the more readie <hi>in reading their riddle.</hi> And therefore, they
haue no reason to be grieued against vs for any thing, vnlesse
happily for this: namely, for that (to spare them a labour) we
haue framed them their <hi>answere</hi> aforehand, and buttoned vp
their lips, or euer they begin to speake.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for <hi>our order in folowing the cause:</hi> we wotte not well
what to <hi>answere,</hi> before wee heare what they <hi>obiect.</hi> In the
meane time, this we plainely protest; that if we haue beene to
<hi>briefe:</hi> it was because we principally effected thy ease. If we
haue been too <hi>tedious:</hi> the more was our toile. If we haue been
<hi>to soft:</hi> it was in regard of thy holy sinceritie. If we haue beene
something <hi>too sharpe:</hi> it was in respect of the <hi>parties</hi> vnsauerie
taste. If we haue beene <hi>to milde:</hi> it was purposely done to
breake (<hi>with Goates bloud</hi>) their <hi>Adamant harts.</hi> If we haue
beene <hi>too bitter:</hi> that bitternes proceedes not from our <hi>maner
of handling,</hi> but is onely in the <hi>bad matter of their humour, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the same.</hi> If we haue beene <hi>too remisse in our answers:</hi>
it was, because we found themselues <hi>ouer retchlesse in all their
replies.</hi> If we haue beene <hi>too rough in reproouing:</hi> it was onelie,
because <hi>experience</hi> hath taught vs, that <hi>the restie dull Iade, doth
stand in most neede of the roughest rider of all, to curry his coate.</hi>
Briefly,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 22.</note> 
               <hi>whatsoeuer we haue beene:</hi> for their owne, and thy sake
we haue <hi>beene the same,</hi> as knoweth best the searcher of all
<pb facs="tcp:25312:11"/>
harts. For as we haue set downe nothing but that, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>God</hi>) we are hitherto perswaded is true: so haue we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
with all our endeuors, to drawe thee and them to the
timely participation thereof. And therefore, let <hi>matter</hi> and
<hi>maner</hi> be what it will be: let vs finde this effect, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
no fauour at all in their <hi>answere.</hi> Onely, this is all we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
for the present: namely, that the <hi>Answerer</hi> would put
downe his owne name to his <hi>answere:</hi> that so, we our selues in
<hi>replying,</hi> and they in <hi>impugning,</hi> may mutually know our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Antagonists,</hi> which we holde a verie dutifull, an vpright,
and honest proceeding. Otherwise, wee may iustly imagine,
that they do either distrust their owne cause: or stand in some
feare of discredit concerning the same. This course (gentle
<hi>Reader</hi>) if haply our <hi>night-birds</hi> refuse, and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
will couertly flutter their wings, and keepe a vengeable
coyle in <hi>Conuenticles</hi> and corners, like <hi>the Owle in an Iuie bush
that dares not endure the birdes of the day:</hi> then (for thy further
satisfaction heerein) do thou eftsoones propound to the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
themselues and their <hi>fauorites</hi> whatsoeuer, these folowing
<hi>Queres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Let it first be enquired,<note place="margin">Queres, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the publike priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing Bookes.</note> whether our gratious <hi>Queene
Elizabeth</hi> hath absolute authoritie from God (for the
timely preuenting of <hi>errours,</hi> of <hi>schismes,</hi> and of <hi>facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as also, for the happie continuance of <hi>publike
peace</hi>) to establish in any her princely <hi>Dominions</hi> an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niforme
order; that, no one <hi>Booke, Pamphlet,</hi> or <hi>Paper</hi>
whatsoeuer shall be publisht in <hi>Print,</hi> before the same
be exactly reuiewed by some <hi>speciall persons</hi> deputed
thereunto, and haue also a <hi>publike priuiledge</hi> from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their hands for such publike passage?</p>
            <p>2 Whether all true harted subiects (euen in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
towards <hi>God</hi> and her Maiestie) be not very strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
bound to a precise obseruation of such an <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
order:</hi> and that therefore, when any <hi>erronious
or offensiue opinion</hi> shall passe from the <hi>Presse</hi> with <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
priuiledge;</hi> whether the partie himselfe who espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and desireth presently to encounter therewith, be
<pb facs="tcp:25312:12"/>
not (before he shall publikelie proceed to such <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
encounter</hi>) bound in conscience and dutie, first to
<hi>intimate that errour to publike authoritie:</hi> that by such
<hi>intimation,</hi> either the <hi>author of the errour</hi> may be made
to <hi>retract</hi> it, or the <hi>partie enforming,</hi> at least may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a <hi>speciall Commission</hi> for some orderly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the publike confutation thereof.</p>
            <p>3 Lastly, whether such, &amp; so many Bookes, pamphlets,
or papers whatsoeuer, as heeretofore, or heereafter do
couertly passe vnderhand from the <hi>Presse</hi> in a <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
course:</hi> be not (in an especiall regard of that <hi>authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
order</hi>) verie highly <hi>displeasing to God,</hi> and greatly
<hi>derogatorious to her Maiesties prerogatiue royall,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all <hi>persons</hi> and <hi>causes in Christ:</hi> and whether
those <hi>Bookes, pamphlets,</hi> or <hi>papers</hi> so disorderly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
abroad, are not (for such vndutifull disorder) to
be iustly esteemed of all true harted <hi>subiects,</hi> such <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
libels</hi> as doe <hi>insolently encounter with,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<hi>vndermine her Maiesties princely preheminence:</hi>
and that therefore, the verie <hi>authors</hi> themselues, they
are to be reputed and punished as <hi>pestiferous Libellours
against publike authoritie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the maine parties them selues, or the <hi>malcontented
papists,</hi> whom (as <hi>miracle-mongers</hi>) we haue throughout our
whole <hi>treatise</hi> euen purposly matched togither, and endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
(with one and the selfesame stone) to beat downe for ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
<hi>blacke-birds</hi> both at a clap. When as they (we say) or
any one of them all haue fully resolued thy <hi>minde</hi> concerning
these <hi>Quaeres:</hi> then let them (in Gods holy name) verie free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceed in their <hi>answere</hi> and spare not.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, if (in an onely distrust of their <hi>cause</hi>) they shall
yet couer their <hi>weaknes,</hi> and excuse their not <hi>answering</hi> for
want of <hi>authoritie:</hi> it shall be their best, either humbly to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselues to her Maiestie, or all ioyntly togither (with
the proscribed <hi>Apollonits</hi> before <hi>Apollo his golden tables</hi>) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
pitifully to bewaile the irrecouerable subuersion of their

            <p>These things thus dispatched in order, it followeth now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
fitly in place to vnfold vnto thee the whole platforme ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
throughout the whole worke.</p>
            <p>First, therefore we haue <hi>alphabetically</hi> put downe the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
names of the seuerall <hi>authors,</hi> whose seuerall authorities
are purposely by vs produced: to the ende that whosoeuer
will, may (by knowing their names) make diligent inquirie
into all the <hi>quotations,</hi> and see whether we of our selues haue
propounded any one point, which some others of <hi>antiquitie</hi>
haue not before vs directly pointed vnto.</p>
            <p>Then next, we haue placed in order the <hi>seuerall arguments</hi>
of eche seuerall <hi>Dialogue:</hi> to the ende that such and so many
good <hi>soules</hi> as (being perswaded of <hi>some points</hi>) are yet verie
doubtfull concerning some other: might (if they please not
to peruse the whole) make their speciall choice of that which
they chiefly affect.</p>
            <p>In like manner, we haue <hi>methodically</hi> prefixed before the
maine <hi>treatise</hi> it selfe, a briefe <hi>Analysis</hi> or summarie <hi>resolution</hi>
of al the whole <hi>tractate:</hi> and al this of very set purpose to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to thy view (at a blush) the whole bodie of the <hi>Booke,</hi>
and the verie strict <hi>order</hi> it selfe, which (albeit the whole be
deuided into <hi>Dialogicall Discourses</hi>) we haue precisely obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
throughout the whole worke.</p>
            <p>After all this, we haue put downe the <hi>maine discourse</hi> in a
<hi>Dialogicall forme,</hi> and purposely produced sixe such seuerall
<hi>speakers</hi> therein, as should by their seuerall <hi>significant names,</hi>
supply whatsoeuer might tend to the timely effecting of an
absolute <hi>tractate</hi> concerning such matters.</p>
            <p>For first, <hi>Philologus</hi> signifieth <hi>a Louer of talke:</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
such <hi>persons</hi> as trudge to and fro; tatling these newes
without any regard or due search into the soundnes thereof.</p>
            <p>Then next <hi>Pneumatomachus,</hi> signifieth a <hi>fighter</hi> or <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
against the essentiall being of Spirits:</hi> and representeth
those <hi>Swinish Saduces</hi> of old, and those <hi>godles Atheistes</hi> now in
our daies, who hold there are neither <hi>Spirits nor Diuels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:25312:13"/>
Then thirdly, <hi>Lycanthropus,</hi> signifieth a man <hi>essentially trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to a wolfe:</hi> and representeth such <hi>persons</hi> as do hold (with
tooth and naile) the <hi>transformation</hi> of <hi>diuels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then fourthly, <hi>Exorcistes</hi> signifieth a <hi>coniurour</hi> or <hi>caster
foorth of spirits and diuels:</hi> and representeth those <hi>persons</hi> that
doe hold (in these daies of the <hi>Gospel</hi>) a <hi>real, or actual possession of
diuels</hi> at the least.</p>
            <p>Then fiftly, <hi>Physiologus</hi> signifieth <hi>a discourser of natures se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes,</hi>
or a <hi>naturall philosopher:</hi> and representeth such <hi>persons</hi> as
(by the onely <hi>light of reason</hi>) are able to discouer the grose and
palpable <hi>absurdities,</hi> ensuing such <hi>phantastical &amp; absurd opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then lastly, <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> signifieth one of an <hi>approoued or
vpright iudgement:</hi> and representeth all such <hi>illumined diuines</hi>
and others, as are able by the sway of <hi>reason,</hi> the authority of
<hi>writers,</hi> and plaine euidence of <hi>scripture to censure the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and very soundly to set downe the infallible truth. Al these
are introduced as <hi>actours</hi> in these our <hi>discourses:</hi> the which also
we haue purposely deuided into eleuen <hi>seuerall dialogues.</hi>
And this, partly, for an ease to thy <hi>memory</hi> by auoiding that
intricate, that endlesse and tedious toile, which otherwise
would haue wearied thy <hi>spirits:</hi> if (without intermission) thou
haddest been intirely tied to the whole <hi>treatise</hi> it selfe. And
partly also, to point foorth vnto thee the <hi>principall matters</hi>
which are principally handled throughout the whole <hi>work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, we haue in the end of the <hi>booke, summarily</hi> also an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
a <hi>table</hi> of all the <hi>principall points,</hi> the <hi>speciall matters,</hi> the
<hi>seuerall syllogismes,</hi> and the <hi>sundry expositions</hi> of such places of
<hi>scripture,</hi> as are any way pertinent to the maine purpose it
selfe: that, by the onely <hi>direction</hi> thereof, thou maist find forth
(with a trice) whatsoeuer thou wishest to see concerning such
rare and vnwonted <hi>occurrents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now (gentle <hi>Reader</hi>) least happily the curious sort
should cry out and say, <hi>Quid de pusillis tam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>magna prooemia?
What needs so great a cry for so little wool?</hi> we will therefore no
longer withhold thee from the <hi>treatise</hi> it selfe. Beseeching the
<hi>God of peace, to giue thee peace alwaies, by all meanes. Grace be
with all them that loue the Lord Iesus to their immortality. Euen
so:</hi> come Lord Iesu. <hi>So be it:</hi> Amen.</p>

who very confidently auoucheth, that there are neither <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
nor <hi>Diuels</hi> at all. Which being so: howe should there be
a <hi>reall</hi> possession of <hi>Diuels</hi> in any?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philologus.</speaker>
               <p>Verie true: for <hi>Diuels</hi> must first <hi>be,</hi> before they can haue a
<hi>reall</hi> possession in men. But, <hi>Pneumatomachus</hi> he holds (I am
sure) no such opinion: vnlesse it be for <hi>argument</hi> sake.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pneumatomachus.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I am verie confident therein I assure you. And about
that point, my neighbour <hi>Lycanthropus</hi> and my selfe: haue held
a hot <hi>dispute</hi> all the way we haue come. But, being neither of
vs satisfied with the others <hi>reply,</hi> we iointly concluded to refer
the whole decision of these <hi>controuersies,</hi> to maister <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus</hi>
his determination: promising each other, to rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
herein, vpon his resolute <hi>iudgement,</hi> and thereupon, we
are now trauelling towards the Iland of <hi>Eirtwab,</hi> for that selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
purpose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philologus.</speaker>
               <p>Such conferences I assure you are both-commendable and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25312:18"/>
comfortable, especially in trauell: for they do sharpen the
<hi>witte,</hi> delight the <hi>minde,</hi> and make the <hi>iourney</hi> seeme short
and sweete. And herein withal, you are woorthie great praise,
both because you doe passe foorth the time in profitable talke
as you trauell: and for that also (being loth to loose the fruite
of your <hi>conference,</hi> you doe so friendly and so freely, referre
your selues to the <hi>iudgement</hi> of such as are able, and willing
to determine your doubts. Howbeit, our meeting is wrought
(I perceiue) by the speciall <hi>prouidence</hi> of God. For this I dare
tell you for truth, that maister <hi>Orthodoxus,</hi> he is not euen now
in the Iland of <hi>Eirtwab,</hi> but newly remooued into the <hi>confines</hi>
of <hi>Eibrad:</hi> entending this <hi>winter</hi> to soiourne there, with
one maister <hi>Physiologus</hi> his faithfull friend, of very purpose to
conferre with the <hi>Exorcist</hi> himselfe that cast foorth the <hi>spirite,</hi>
for the benefite of which <hi>conference,</hi> I also am now trauelling
thether my selfe. And therefore if it please you, I shal not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be glad of your companies: but will verie carefully conduct
you the way.</p>

               <p>Withall my hart. And (to my remembrance) they were
eftsoones vpon him in this following order.
<list>
                     <item>1 There seemed to runne along his legge,<note place="margin">These passions are apparant in Dorel his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</note> and thence into
his toe, belly, throat, toong, cheeke, eie, and other parts, a
lumpe sometimes bigger, or lesser then an egge, being soft.</item>
                     <item>2 The lumpe being in his legge, it was heauie, and inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
like yron.</item>
                     <item>3 He had such extraordinarie strength, that sometimes
three, fower, fiue, sixe or moe, were scarse able to rule him.</item>
                     <item>4 When fower or fiue struggled with him, so as they were
wearied, he did not sweate, pant, or change colour.</item>
                     <item>5 He wallowed, gnashed with his teeth, stared with his eies,
and foamed at his mouth excessiuely: hauing neither eat nor
drunke all the day before.</item>
                     <item>6 There seemed to runne vnder the couerlet where he lay,
as it were kitlings: to the number of fower or fiue.</item>
                     <item>7 His face and his mouth were fearfully distorted: one lip
towards one eare, and the other lippe towards the other
eare.</item>
                     <item>8 His face was turned directly backward, not moouing his
bodie at all.</item>
                     <item>9 His necke doubled vnder him.</item>
                     <item>10 His bodie doubled, his head betweene his legges, sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
plucked round, like a round browne loafe: he was cast vp
like a ball from the bed, three or fower times togither halfe a
yard high.</item>
                     <item>11 Being cast into the fire, where he lay sometimes against
the wals and yron barres in the chimney with great violence:
he receiued no appearance of hurt at all.</item>
                     <item>12 His bodie seemed to be extended to the height of the
tallest man: when once he endeuoured to hang himselfe.</item>
                     <item>13 He told of diuers things done in his absence, without no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
giuen by any person.</item>
                     <item>14 There were strange speeches vttered by him in his fits,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25312:19"/>
in a strange voice: as, that he was his, that he was God, Christ,
and a king, that he made baptisme. I will vse <hi>William Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
his toong and members for three daies, <hi>Ego sum rex, ego
sum Deus.</hi> That there was no God, that he was king and
prince of darkenes. And, in saying the Lords Prayer, he could
not say, <hi>Lead vs not into temptation,</hi> but, <hi>Lead vs into temptation.</hi>
Also, before Maister <hi>Darel</hi> had seene him, he said <hi>Darel</hi> comes,
<hi>Darel</hi> comes, he will haue me out, but, I will come againe: for,
<hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> are iolly townes for me.</item>
                     <item>15 Being recouered out of his fits, he knew not what he
had said or done.</item>
                     <item>16 In his fits, strange smels were in the place where he lay:
sometimes like brimstone, sometimes verie sweete.</item>
                     <item>17 There was a strange knocking perceiued about his bed
in his fits: both his hands and feete being held vnmooueable.</item>
                     <item>18 He did cry hideously, sometimes like a bul, beare, swine:
and in a small voice impossible to be counterfeited.</item>
                     <item>19 His legs would be crooked with his fals, and remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible.</item>
                     <item>20 He spake in a continued speech, his mouth being wide
open, his toong drawen into his throat: neither his lips nor
chaps moouing.</item>
                     <item>21 He spake a quarter of an hower, his mouth being shut
close.</item>
                     <item>22 In his fits, his pulses and temples did not beat: he lay for
dead, and as cold as yce.</item>
                     <item>23 His eie was blacke, and changed colour in his fits.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>These, and sundrie other passions, at sundrie times appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in him, which I remember not nowe: but these which I
haue tolde you, are certeinly reported by sundrie persons of

               <p>The persons reporting these newes may be of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt

               <speaker>Pneumatomachus.</speaker>
               <p>I do hartily reioyce to heare of that newes: being euen toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and tyred out with the newfangled newes of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<hi>Lycanthropus.</hi> But what three persons are those, that

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philologus.</speaker>
               <p>If I be not fowlie deceiued it is maister <hi>Orthodoxus,</hi> maister
<hi>Physiologus,</hi> and the <hi>Exorcist</hi> also himselfe, who cast out the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell:</hi>
they are euen the same. This falleth foorth pat for our

               <speaker>Philologus.</speaker>
               <p>Good sir? we are euen now (I hope) at the furthest. For
our comming into these quarters, is (vpon speciall occasion)
to conferre with your selfe and the rest of this companie,
about the maruelous woonders befallen at <hi>Mahgnitton</hi> of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Nay not so: for, neither is the matter it selfe so secret, nor

where we may haue the benefit of the running streame to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
our eies and sences, and (in so solitarie a place) verie

               <p>O Lord our God, the fountaine of life, the welspring of grace, and
the onely infuser of all spirituall knowledge: Behold vs here at this

deare father, that, as thou hast ordeined him to be the true light

which lightneth euerie one that comes into the world: so, he may
gratiously enlighten our harts, who do naturally sit here in darkenes,
and in the shadow of death. Remooue from our grosse and sencelesse
soules, al those palpable cloudes of ignorance, errour and vnbeleefe,
which seeke to foreclose our sauing knowledge in Iesus Christ. Pluck
(we pray thee) from our vncircumcized eies, those thicke and fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
seales of naturall corruption, which doe (at this present) so fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
dimme, and dazel our darke vnderstandings, as, we are vtterly

grant we beseech thee yet further, that, this our entended confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Well: now (in Gods name) declare briefly and plainly
what you desire to know concerning the possessed man at
<hi>Mahgnitton?</hi>

               <p>First sir (or euer you enter vpon the perticular discourse of
the possessed himselfe) our desire is, to heare whether there be
any <hi>spirits</hi> or <hi>Diuels</hi> to <hi>possesse</hi> men at all: the rather, because
there is one in our companie,<note place="margin">Act. 23, 8.</note> who, verie confidently auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
that, there are neither <hi>Angels</hi> nor <hi>Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Who is he? and what is his name?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pneumatomachus.</speaker>
               <p>I am the man if it please you: and my name is <hi>Pneumato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus.</hi>

               <p>Your <hi>name</hi> was geuen I suppose: to expresse your <hi>nature.</hi>
For, <hi>Pneumatomachus,</hi> is as much to say, as a <hi>despiter</hi> of <hi>spirits:</hi>
or rather, it signifieth one, who flatly opposeth himselfe to the
essentiall <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> of God. Howbeit (by that time
Maister <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> hath fully confuted your fowle and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
errours) I doubt not, but, you will, both be ashamed of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25312:21"/>
your grosse vnderstanding, and desirous to exchange your
odious <hi>name.</hi>

               <p>Because they were essentially <hi>created</hi> of God. For the Lord

<hi>Spirits,</hi> they being such excellent <hi>creatures</hi> of God: we neede
not to doubt of their essentiall being. The rather, because
euery creature else (how contemptible soeuer) being once

of some certeine places of Scripture. Both which saide false
grounds, albeit I could and might well relate them my selfe:
yet (because the first is rather <hi>Philosophical</hi> then <hi>Diuine</hi>) I do

               <p>Was not your name also purposely giuen, to purport vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs your proper nature? For, <hi>Physiologus</hi> (you say) is your
name: which (vnlesse I be fowly deceaued) is as much to say;
as a babler or pratler of naturall <hi>Philosophie:</hi> or, it signifieth
rather some notable discourser of naturall causes. I hope you
are none of those cogging companions of whom the <hi>Apostle</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing lesse. For the man (I assure you) is both a sound
<hi>Philosopher:</hi> and a sincere <hi>Diuine:</hi> Neither would I haue you
once to imagine, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth there purposely oppose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

but reprooueth rather, that false and counterfeit <hi>Philosophie,</hi>
which (hauing onely an appearance of truth, and not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of truth it selfe) is cunningly foisted in by cogging
companions, to spoile and deceiue mens mindes of the truth
indeed. For otherwaies, all true <hi>Philosophie</hi> is the speciall gift
of God, and a principall helpe to <hi>Diuinitie:</hi> so far foorth espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
as she is made a submissiue <hi>Moderatour</hi> in <hi>naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
and not a <hi>commaunding Mistres</hi> ouer <hi>Diuinitie.</hi> Then I
assure you, shee comes in her naturall kinde: and thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
is he that hath a true insight into her, according to that old

               </p>
               <p>Now then, such a <hi>Philosopher</hi> is this, and therefore, be bold

the first ground of your errour.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>The first <hi>ground</hi> of this (as of all <hi>errours</hi> else whatsoeuer)
doth vndoubtedly arise (as you heard) from the naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of your proper minde. And, this may more plainely
appeare, if I first shew you what the <hi>Minde</hi> is: and then, tell
you how the same is corrupted. The <hi>Minde,</hi> is that reasonable
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25312:24"/>
                  <hi>facultie</hi> or power of the <hi>soule;</hi> whereby the <hi>naturall</hi> man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth,
knoweth, and discerneth all <hi>intelligible things.</hi> By
which wordes it is plaine, that, the proper <hi>ende</hi> and <hi>office</hi> of
the <hi>Minde,</hi> is especially to perceiue, to know, and discerne
things. And, this <hi>office</hi> also it accomplisheth by the helpe of
no bodily <hi>Organon,</hi> but onely by it selfe alone: vnlesse haply
the <hi>senses</hi> doe sometime assist the <hi>intellectiue</hi> vertue therein.
The <hi>Minde</hi> therefore it differeth (you see) from the <hi>Will.</hi> For,
the <hi>Minde,</hi> onely perceiueth and knoweth a thing: the <hi>Will,</hi> it
maketh free choice, either to pursue, or eschew the thing that
is knowen. Now then, the <hi>Minde</hi> (in a meere <hi>naturall</hi> man) is
easily corrupted by reason of the <hi>phantasie,</hi> through whose on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
helpe, the aforesaide knowledge of things <hi>intelligible</hi> is
conueyed and offered vnto it. For, the <hi>phantasie,</hi> it being that
<hi>interiour sensitiue</hi> knowledge which (by the middle <hi>ventricle</hi>
of the braine) receiueth into it selfe a verie deepe impression
of the sundrie kinds of <hi>sensible</hi> things either present, or absent,
and labouring also to draw foorth from those seuerall kinds of
<hi>sensible</hi> things, the like <hi>sensible</hi> kindes in <hi>conceit:</hi> it cannot
otherwise possibly be, but that the said <hi>phantasie</hi> (not being
able to transcend beyond the <hi>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iect</hi> affoords. And, hereby also it
commeth to passe, that, the <hi>minde</hi> eftsoones is deceiued in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing,
knowing, and discerning aright of euerie intelligible
thing: more especially, if the said <hi>phantasie</hi> at any time ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth
to draw foorth from some <hi>sensible</hi> things, an <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie

or <hi>minde</hi> (being mightily misled by the <hi>phantasie</hi>)
must needs be deceiued in perceiuing and discerning such a

(I assure you) from a carelesse misconstruing of some such

places of scripture, as doe attribute to God, and to <hi>spirits</hi> a
<hi>corporall forme:</hi> as <hi>eies, eares, hands, feete, bodies, wings</hi> and such

you doe rashlie conclude, that <hi>spirites</hi> and <hi>Diuels</hi> must
necessarily be euen such as your selfe by those places suppose:
or none at all. But now, because you your owne selfe (with your <hi>corporall eies</hi>) did yet neuer behold any such <hi>corporall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels</hi>
as you by those Scriptures haue grossely imagined:

I must tell you for truth, that, those scriptures which attribute
to God, and <hi>spirites,</hi> a <hi>corporall forme,</hi> as <hi>eies, eares, hands, feete,

but must rather be <hi>metaphorically,</hi> and <hi>spiritually</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode

               <p>Surely good sir, I should soone be perswaded to that which

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pneumatomachus.</speaker>
               <p>This, namely, for that <hi>Moses</hi> in the historie of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(entreating compendiouslie of all those workes of God
which in sixe daies before the <hi>Saboth</hi> were perfectly finished)
maketh no mention at all of the <hi>creation</hi> of <hi>Angels, spirits,</hi> or

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Thus you reason. There is in the historie of <hi>Moses</hi> no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

There is in the hystorie of <hi>Moses</hi> no expresse mention of the

            <sp>

where <hi>Dauid</hi> (inuiting and sommoning all sorts of people to

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pneumatomachus.</speaker>
               <p>How first by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themselues?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> declare, that they were vndoubtedly <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
all within the sixe daies: as to alleage one or two out of
many.<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 6.</note> First <hi>Dauid</hi> he saith, <hi>By the word of the Lord were the
heauens made: and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</hi>
Againe,<note place="margin">Reuel. 10. 6.</note> the <hi>Angel</hi> in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> sweareth by the Lord, <hi>Who
created the heauen, and the things that are therein, and the earth,
and the things that are therein, and the sea, and the things that are
therein.</hi> In both which places you see, howe the holie Ghost
(speaking of the <hi>creation</hi> of all things) doth first set downe the
<hi>continents</hi> themselues, namely the <hi>heauens,</hi> the <hi>earth,</hi> and
the <hi>sea:</hi> and then next, the things contained in them. Shewing
by this selfesame order, that the <hi>heauens,</hi> the <hi>earth,</hi> and the <hi>sea,</hi>
were first <hi>created</hi> themselues: and then the <hi>creatures</hi> contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them. But the <hi>heauens,</hi> the <hi>earth,</hi> and the <hi>sea,</hi> were all of
them <hi>created</hi> within the sixe daies: and therefore also the <hi>hoste
of heauen,</hi> and all the <hi>creatures</hi> in the <hi>earth,</hi> and the <hi>sea,</hi> were
euerie of them <hi>created</hi> within the sixe daies.<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 1. 2.</note> For <hi>Moses</hi> saith
flatly, that euen in those sixe daies, all the workes of the Lord
were fully finished: and that God ceased the seauenth daie
from all his labours. Thus then you see it plainly demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by sundry places of Scripture: that the <hi>Angels</hi> also were
all <hi>created</hi> within the workes of those sixe daies creation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pneumatomachus.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and howe prooue you the same by probable <hi>reasons?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>I proue it thus.<note place="margin">Patricius lib. de essentia, &amp; ente.</note> 1. The <hi>Angels</hi> they are either <hi>created,</hi> or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created:
but not <hi>vncreated:</hi> therefore <hi>created.</hi> They cannot
possiblie be <hi>vncreated substances:</hi> for then, they should also be
<hi>infinite.</hi> Howbeit, <hi>Angels</hi> they are <hi>finite creatures,</hi> for their <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are <hi>finite:</hi> yea, and then also their <hi>power,</hi> it is <hi>finite.</hi> But if
they be of a <hi>finite power,</hi> then also of a <hi>circumscriptible essence.</hi>
Moreouer, it shall plainely appeere anon in place conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that <hi>Angels</hi> are <hi>finite creatures,</hi> and definitiuely also in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:25312:29"/>
some certeine place: which thing can not possible accord to
any <hi>vncreated essence</hi> at all. And therefore <hi>Angels</hi> they are not
<hi>vncreated substances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Secondly I prooue it thus. If <hi>Angels</hi> be <hi>vncreated,</hi> then
are they <hi>eternall:</hi> but not <hi>eternall,</hi> therefore, not <hi>vncreated.</hi>
That they are not <hi>eternall</hi> it is verie apparant. For, then should
they be such as haue neither <hi>beginning,</hi> nor <hi>end</hi> of their <hi>essence:</hi>
as also, their <hi>essence</hi> or <hi>nature</hi> it selfe, should then be such, as
hath nothing in it either <hi>first,</hi> or <hi>last.</hi> But this agreeth onely
to God himselfe, and not to any <hi>creature</hi> in <hi>heauen,</hi> or in <hi>earth.</hi>
And therefore if there be <hi>Angels</hi> then were they <hi>created;</hi> and
if <hi>created,</hi> then <hi>created</hi> no doubt within the sixe daies as was
shewed before. And thus much for the proofe of this point, by
probable <hi>reasons.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 10.</note> Now the <hi>earth (Moses</hi> saith)

               <p>Verie true. And therefore (hauing first remooued the olde
rubbish which ouerturned the rule of your <hi>reason</hi>) it commeth
now verie fitly in place, to shew further vnto you, that, the
<hi>Angels</hi> of God (whether <hi>good</hi> or <hi>euill</hi>) are truely <hi>essentiall</hi> and
<hi>substantiall spirits:</hi> as may plainely appeere by these following
<hi>reasons,</hi> &amp; first, from their sundry <hi>names</hi> attributed vnto them
thus:</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Names,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hieronimus Zanchius, de operibus Dei, lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> they are the <hi>signes</hi> and <hi>notions</hi> of things. Which
<hi>names,</hi> when they signifie any thing, properly <hi>subsisting</hi> of it
selfe: then, that thing also it selfe is a <hi>substance</hi> no doubt. But
the <hi>Angels,</hi> they are set forth by sundry <hi>names,</hi> which do signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<hi>substances.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 25. 41.</note> For, first they be called <hi>Angels,</hi> that is to say, <hi>mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers:</hi>
but, a <hi>messenger,</hi> or a <hi>minister</hi> appointed, cannot but be
a <hi>subsistance.</hi> Also, they are called <gap reason="foreign">

vndoubtedly a <hi>substance.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 3. 2.</note> Briefly, they be called <hi>Satan,</hi> that is
an <hi>aduersarie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 4. 1. 5.</note> also <hi>Diuels,</hi> that is <hi>accusors</hi> also, <hi>strong armed men,</hi>
also the God of this <hi>world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 11. 21.</note> the <hi>princes</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> of the <hi>ayre,</hi> the

old <hi>serpent,</hi> &amp; so forth. All which seueral <hi>names,</hi> do vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signifie a thing <hi>subsisting;</hi>

proceedeth an <hi>action:</hi> and therefore, there are <hi>essentiall spirits</hi>
and <hi>Diuels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Againe, if <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels</hi> were onely but the secret <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>affections</hi> of men, then vndoubtedly, so many famous
<hi>actions</hi> as the Scriptures record, and the same also externally
to the outward <hi>senses,</hi> could in no wise accord vnto them: but
the <hi>consequent</hi> is false, for the Scriptures apparantly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>trope,</hi> doe celebrate their <hi>office,</hi> and record their sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
<hi>actions,</hi> namely, that they <hi>stand</hi> before God, <hi>serue</hi> him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
his precepts and iudgements, that they doe daily, <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
tempt, torment, circumuent, and seeke to deuoure</hi> vs, and so
foorth. But, how should these, or any one of these <hi>actions,</hi> be
possibly performed of such as are not in (deed) true <hi>substances?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 Againe, <hi>things created</hi> in them <hi>selues</hi> and not in an other
<hi>subiect,</hi> yea, and so, as they <hi>subsist</hi> of them <hi>selues alone,</hi> those
<hi>things</hi> vndoubtly haue a true <hi>subsistance.</hi> But, <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels,</hi>
they are so <hi>created</hi> (no doubt) as they <hi>subsist</hi> in <hi>them selues,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they <hi>inherent,</hi> or <hi>inexistent,</hi> in any other <hi>subiect</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:25312:30"/>
and therefore <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels,</hi> they haue vndoubtedly
a true <hi>subsistance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 Againe, whatsoeuer <hi>liuing creature</hi> is endued with <hi>reason,
vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> that must needs be some <hi>thing of it selfe
subsisting:</hi> but, <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels,</hi> they are <hi>liuing creatures</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with <hi>reason, vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>will:</hi> and therefore, <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things</hi>
(no doubt) of <hi>themselues subsisting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 Againe, nothing can possiblie <hi>persist</hi> in the <hi>truth,</hi> nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can <hi>fall</hi> from their <hi>first estate,</hi> vnlesse the same be some
<hi>essence subsisting of it selfe,</hi> and <hi>pertaker</hi> also of <hi>vnderstanding,</hi> and
<hi>will.</hi> But, some of the <hi>Angels</hi> doe <hi>perseuere</hi> in the <hi>truth,</hi> and
some againe, haue <hi>fallen</hi> from the <hi>same:</hi> and therefore, <hi>Angels</hi>
and <hi>spirits,</hi> are some <hi>essences subsisting of themselues,</hi> and <hi>perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
also of <hi>vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 Againe, if <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels,</hi> were onely but the <hi>euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and <hi>affections</hi> arising in men, it shoulde be absurde, either
to <hi>distinguish</hi> their <hi>numbers,</hi> or to <hi>expresse</hi> their seuerall <hi>actions:</hi>
but the <hi>consequent</hi> is false, as all that feare God will confesse,
and therefore also the <hi>antecedent</hi> it selfe.</p>
               <p>7 Againe, whatsoeuer doth <hi>speake, assault, suggest, tempt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
torment,</hi> and <hi>circumuent,</hi> to deuoure, that must necessarilie
be a <hi>subsistance.</hi> But <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels</hi> doe so, for they <hi>spake</hi> to
<hi>Euah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 1.</note> they <hi>assaulted Achab,</hi> and suggested an vntruth into all
his <hi>prophets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. King. 22. 22.</note> they <hi>tempted Christ,</hi> they <hi>afflicted</hi> and <hi>tormented
Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 4. 1.</note> they made <hi>Iudas to hang himselfe,</hi> they seeke to <hi>winnowe</hi>
and <hi>fanne men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 14.</note> yea &amp; to <hi>circumuent</hi> al the children of God to
destruction:<note place="margin">Math. 27. 5.</note> and therefore, <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 22. 31.</note>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 11.</note> must necessarilie
be some <hi>subsistance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8 Againe, if <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>spirits</hi> be onely but <hi>accidentall affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8.</note>
and no true substances in deed, then, neither shall we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this life,<note place="margin">Math. 22. 30.</note> be anie true substances, for, the scriptures affirme,
that after the resurrection, we shall be like to the <hi>Angels in
heauen.</hi> Now then, if <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>spirits</hi> be not true substances
in deed, shall we also cease to be substances?</p>
               <p>9 Againe, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> he prooues this world to be <hi>perfect,</hi> for
that it consistes of all those things which can be desired there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
or which may in any wise appertain to the <hi>perfection</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Howbeit, to the <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>whole,</hi> there is required
therein, three seuerall sorts of <hi>substances:</hi> the <hi>first inuisible,</hi> the
<hi>second visible,</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> partly <hi>inuisible</hi> &amp; partly <hi>visible.</hi> The
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25312:31"/>
second sort, namely the <hi>visible substances,</hi> are the <hi>heauens,</hi> the
<hi>elements,</hi> and all things made of the <hi>elements.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> sort,
namely the <hi>substances,</hi> partly <hi>inuisible,</hi> and partly <hi>visible,</hi>
are <hi>men</hi> who consist of a <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>body</hi> togither, the <hi>soule inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and the <hi>bodie visible.</hi> Now then, if <hi>Angels,</hi> who are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<hi>inuisible,</hi> should not be <hi>substances,</hi> then should there be
wanting to the world, <hi>inuisible substances:</hi> and so, the worlde
should be <hi>vnperfect.</hi> But the world, it is <hi>perfect,</hi> as all, both <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi>
and <hi>Diuines</hi> do affirme. And therefore <hi>Angels</hi> they
be <hi>substances inuisible and spirituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10 Lastly, <hi>common experience</hi> (from the beginning of the
world to this present hower) hath apparently approued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, that there be <hi>Angelicall spirits and Diuels:</hi> and therefore
not to be denied of any, vnlesse he will shew himselfe a <hi>swinish
Saduce,</hi> or some <hi>monkish Anthropomorphite,</hi> as was shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And thus haue you briefly heard my seuerall reasons,
which prooue vnto you both <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pneumatomachus.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, by that which you haue spoken, I am now throughlie
perswaded, that <hi>Angels</hi> are indeed <hi>essentiall and spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</hi>
Howbeit, this one thing doth trouble me greatly:
namely, that (seeing all <hi>Angels</hi> were equally created accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the true image of God) no one of them all may truely
be said to be <hi>euill.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>You do well in deliuering your doubtes, but, goe to, frame
your argument.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pneumatomachus.</speaker>
               <p>I frame it thus.<note place="margin">Timoth. Brich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. Physica.</note> A thing created to the image of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, nor may not be said to be <hi>euill.</hi> But all <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
were (in the beginning) created all alike to the image of
God: therefore no <hi>Angell</hi> or <hi>spirite</hi> either can be, or may be
said to be <hi>euill.</hi> Now sir, if none of them can, or may be said to
be <hi>euill:</hi> how should there be any <hi>Diuels</hi> at all?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Verie true as you saie, if that which you seeme to conclude
were as truely concluded. Howbeit, I answere thus. First con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your <hi>proposition</hi> I say. That, so farre foorth as any thing
<hi>created</hi> to Gods <hi>image</hi> hath truelie that image, keepeth and
looseth it not: so farre foorth, and so long, anie such thing may
not truely be saide to be <hi>euill.</hi> Now next to your <hi>assumption</hi> I
answere thus. All those <hi>Angelicall spirits</hi> so <hi>created</hi> of God,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25312:31"/>
they did not retaine and holde falt that <hi>true image of God</hi>
wherein they were first created: but willingly reiected and
fledde from the same. And therefore I distinguish thus.<note place="margin">The Harmonie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessions, 58. Confessio Belgia articl. 12. Confessio Franc. artic. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
created in the beginning according to the <hi>true image</hi> of
God, did either perseuer in that <hi>originall</hi> integritie: or else,
they wilfully fell from the same. The one sort are finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in that selfe-same goodnes wherein they were first
<hi>created,</hi> and therefore, <hi>good Angels:</hi> the other sort loosing their
first <hi>goodnes,</hi> are hardened in that selfe-same <hi>euill</hi> whereinto
they first <hi>fell,</hi> and therefore <hi>euill Angels.</hi> So then, to imagine
that the <hi>euill Angels</hi> also notwithstanding their <hi>euilnes,</hi> must
still shewe foorth that selfe-same image of God from which
they fearefully <hi>fell:</hi> is nothing else in effect, but to confound
the <hi>formes</hi> of their distinguished <hi>kindes.</hi> For it is one thing to
be <hi>created good;</hi> and another thing, still to retaine that selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
<hi>goodnes.</hi> The one is past: the other is present. And the
vanitie of that childish conceite may be made euident by the
like reason thus. All men are created in <hi>Adam</hi> to the <hi>image</hi>
of God. But <hi>Atheists</hi> and vngodly ones are men: therefore
<hi>Atheistes</hi> and vngodly ones, they shewe foorth <hi>the image</hi> of
God. Here is more in the <hi>conclusion,</hi> then was put in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses.</hi>
For this onely shoulde folowe, namely, that <hi>Atheistes</hi>
in as much as they are men, were first created according to
the <hi>image</hi> of God: but in that they are now <hi>falne,</hi> they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the <hi>image</hi> of the <hi>Diuell.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Math. 15. 22.</note> that is not so. For (speaking of the woman of <hi>Canaans

and vexing</hi> of man. Howbeit, for further clearing the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we must here <hi>distinquish</hi> the <hi>Diuel</hi> his supposed <hi>possession,</hi>

executing of that his tyrannicall force and violence vpon him.</hi>
And, this supposed <hi>possession</hi> (how incredible soeuer) is thought
to be twofold: namely, either a <hi>mentall,</hi> or <hi>corporall possession.</hi>

<hi>possession</hi> it selfe being thus farre discouered, I would gladly

to haue a <hi>possession</hi> in man? Whether <hi>really,</hi> or <hi>actually?</hi> My

               <p>I am confidently perswaded, that the <hi>Diuell</hi> hath a verie

               <p>I am verily perswaded, that the <hi>Diuell</hi> (if he haue any <hi>reall
possession</hi> at all) hath onely <hi>mental possession:</hi> my meaning is, that
he doth <hi>substantially possesse</hi> the <hi>minde</hi> alone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>What is your reason?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>My reason is this. Seeing the <hi>minde</hi> it selfe, and it onely is
that wherein <hi>motion</hi> consisteth, and seeing the <hi>bodie</hi> is but
the <hi>mindes organon</hi> or instrument, hauing naturally in it selfe
no <hi>motion</hi> at all, or, no further <hi>motion</hi> at most, then for those on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>actions</hi> wherein the said <hi>mind</hi> (whose <hi>organon</hi> it is) imployeth
the same:<note place="margin">Haec Ambrosius super Lucam.</note> It seemeth reasonable, that therefore, the <hi>diuell</hi> must
<hi>really</hi> and <hi>substantially,</hi> first possesse the <hi>minde</hi> it selfe, or euer
he can possibly bring the <hi>bodie,</hi> vnto any disordered actions,
or,<note place="margin">Luc. 22. 3. Ioh. 13. 27.</note> cause it to accomplish any his <hi>diuellish</hi> attempts. And, euen
so the <hi>Euangelist Iohn,</hi> he expounds himselfe concerning the
<hi>diuell</hi> his possessing of <hi>Iudas.</hi> For, where he affirmeth that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
(after the soppe) did enter into <hi>Iudas:</hi> that possession or
entrance into him he sheweth before, to be nothing else in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 2.</note>
but, a putting into <hi>Iudas</hi> his hart, to betray his maister.
Demonstrating plainely vnto vs, that the <hi>diuell</hi> himselfe, did
first enter substantially into <hi>Iudas</hi> his hart or <hi>minde:</hi> before he
could bring his bodie or toong to attempte the entended
treason.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Your plaine demonstration, doth plainely demonstrate
the contrarie to that which you seeme to conclude: and the
verie text which you quote, doth euen cut the throat of your
childish opinion, or <hi>Cabalisticall</hi> fantasie concerning <hi>Satan</hi> his
sopposed substantiall possession. For,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 2.</note> seeing that <hi>Satan</hi> (in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
<hi>Iudas</hi>) did onely but put the entended treason into <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
his hart: it doth plainely appeare, that, the <hi>diuell</hi> had in
him no substantiall possession at all, but onely, an actuall, or
powerfull possession.<note place="margin">Psalm. 41. 9. Act. 4. 28.</note> By which said powerfull possession, the
<hi>diuell</hi> (according to God his determinate councell) did but
<hi>actually</hi> suggest, and effectually thrust the intended treason
into <hi>Iudas</hi> his hart. Besides that, if the <hi>diuell</hi> (as your selfe,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25312:38"/>
doth imagine) must first, essentially enter into the <hi>minde</hi> of a
man, before he can bring the <hi>body</hi> it selfe to accomplish any
his enterprises: it followeth consequently, that euerie man
then, is essentially possest of the <hi>diuell</hi> in his <hi>minde</hi> at the least,
because euerie man (more or lesse) doth actually effect many
<hi>diuelish</hi> actions. And thus you may see your reason is too too
absurd, or rather no reason at all, to conclude the <hi>mentall</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of <hi>diuels.</hi>

               <p>Sir, as your selfe haue plainely satisfied <hi>Exorcistes</hi> his place
of scripture, and therewithal fullie ouerthrowne his supposed
<hi>mental</hi> possession: so, let me now answere I pray you, that very
point of his argument, from whence (though falslie) he would
seeme to inforce his dangerous inferre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Thus he reasoneth.
The bodie of man, is but a bare <hi>organon</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> to put one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in action the <hi>mindes</hi> conceipte: therefore, the <hi>Diuel</hi> must
first conquere and fullie <hi>possesse</hi> the <hi>mind</hi> it selfe, before he can
bring the <hi>bodie</hi> vnto anie disordered <hi>actions.</hi> This I suppose is
his <hi>argument:</hi> and, from hence he would also implicatiuely
<hi>conclude,</hi> that therefore, the <hi>Diuel</hi> hath no <hi>power</hi> of him selfe,
either to <hi>tempt,</hi> or <hi>torment</hi> anie man outwardlie in his <hi>bodie,</hi>
before he hath first subdued and maistered his <hi>mind</hi> by a <hi>real
possession.</hi>

               <p>This then I must tel you for trueth, that (howsoeuer you
seeme in <hi>showe</hi>) you are nothing in <hi>substance:</hi> because neither
is your <hi>inferrence</hi> sound, nor your <hi>conclusion</hi> currant. For, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
I do freelie confesse, there can be no <hi>actual</hi> accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the worke of sinne, before the <hi>mind</hi> it selfe (being first
conuict) be made to consent yet doth it not follow, but that
(notwithstanding al this) a man may <hi>outwardlie</hi> be tempted to
sinne, and tormented also of <hi>Satan,</hi> though <hi>inwardlie,</hi> the <hi>mind</hi>
it selfe be neuer subdued. And, although it be vndoubtedlie
true,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 14. August. super Genes. and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram. cap. 11. Lyra in Genes. cap. 3. 1.</note> that <hi>euerie man (being tempted) is inticed and drawen by
his owne concupiscence,</hi> namely, by the <hi>concupiscible faculty</hi> of
his proper <hi>mind:</hi> yet, this is also as certeinly true, namely, that,
euen the <hi>concupiscible facultie</hi> also it selfe, is first set a worke by
meanes of the <hi>phantasie,</hi> or interiour <hi>sensitiue power.</hi> Which said
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25312:39"/>
                  <hi>sensitiue power</hi> (receyuing an impression of such <hi>sensible things</hi>

worke, and makes it to lust after those <hi>sensible things</hi> in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipte.</hi>
As for example, whensoeuer the <hi>diuel</hi> entendeth to

bring the <hi>bodie</hi> it selfe vnto his slauish subiection. And
in verie deed, I see not to what purpose we should yeeld him

               <p>With verie good will. And for a plainer proceeding, I will
first briefly <hi>put downe</hi> the <hi>reasons</hi> themselues: and then <hi>prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi>
them at large as occasion is offred.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>My <hi>reasons</hi> are these. 1. First, no such <hi>mentall possession</hi> may
possiblie be prooued from the written word.</p>
               <p>2 The <hi>diuell</hi> himselfe, as also mans <hi>minde,</hi> are euerie of them
both, <hi>intellectuall powers,</hi> created of God for other more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>ends,</hi> then that supposed <hi>mentall possession:</hi> it being no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>end</hi> of God apparantly reuealed in all the <hi>scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 They are both of them <hi>spirituall substances,</hi> the one not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(by <hi>nature</hi>) more <hi>subtile,</hi> more <hi>slender,</hi> or more <hi>thinne</hi> then
the <hi>other,</hi> neither yet, of more <hi>capabilitie,</hi> or more <hi>apt</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine</hi>
then the <hi>other:</hi> whereby it might of that <hi>other</hi> be made
the more <hi>capable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 There is nothing in <hi>heauen</hi> or in <hi>hel</hi> of power to <hi>penetrate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 7. 9. Act. 1. 24.</note>
or to <hi>enter into</hi> the <hi>spirits</hi> of men, saue onely the eternall <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
of <hi>spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 By auouching the <hi>diuell</hi> to be <hi>inherently</hi> in the <hi>possessed</hi>
mans <hi>minde,</hi> we doe fearefully derogate from the <hi>Deitie</hi> of
the holie <hi>Ghost,</hi> and very dangerously darken the <hi>miraculous
operations</hi> of that sacred <hi>spirite:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 16. 17.</note> whose peculiar <hi>office</hi> it is, by an
vnspeakeable and admirable <hi>action, (repletiuely)</hi> to <hi>inhabite</hi> and
<hi>dwell in our harts for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 If the <hi>diuell</hi> doth <hi>essentially enter</hi> into the very <hi>substance</hi> it
selfe of the <hi>possessed</hi> mans <hi>minde:</hi> then necessarily there must
be, either a <hi>confusion</hi> of <hi>substances,</hi> which to hold were absurd,
or else <hi>a rending and separation of substances</hi> at least,<note place="margin">Diuulsio siue distinctio sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantiarum.</note> called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a <hi>vacuum,</hi> which were follie to imagine, but madnes for
any to auouch.</p>
               <p>7 If the <hi>euill Angels</hi> (in the execution of <hi>iudgements</hi>) do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>essentially into</hi> any mans <hi>minde:</hi> then also the <hi>good Angels</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:25312:40"/>
(in the execution of <hi>mercies</hi>) they doe enter <hi>essentially into</hi>
some mans <hi>minde.</hi> But the <hi>latter</hi> is false, and therefore also
the <hi>first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8 If the <hi>minde</hi> be <hi>wholy in the whole body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte.</note> 
                  <hi>and wholy also in euery
part:</hi> also, if <hi>it</hi> alone be the <hi>first substantiall forme and acte</hi> of a
<hi>naturall bodie:</hi> how then may the <hi>diuell</hi> be possiblie <hi>inherent.</hi> in
the <hi>possessed</hi> mans <hi>minde,</hi> but either there must be a <hi>penetrating</hi>
of <hi>spiritual dimensions,</hi> or <hi>two distinct substances togither at once</hi> in
one and the selfesame <hi>subiect,</hi> or, <hi>two substantiall formes</hi> in <hi>one</hi>
and the <hi>same naturall bodie</hi> at least: all which are absurd.</p>
               <p>9 If the <hi>diuell</hi> be <hi>essentially inherent</hi> in the <hi>possessed</hi> mans <hi>mind:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Penetratio di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensionum. Simul &amp; semel.</note>
then is he so, either <hi>dimensiuely,</hi> or <hi>repletiuely,</hi> or <hi>definitiuely</hi> at
the least, or not at all. But not <hi>dimensiuely,</hi> for, so onely are <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
substances</hi> circumscribed in place: whereas the <hi>diuell,</hi> he
is onely a <hi>spirituall essence,</hi> and therefore, not <hi>dimensiuely locall,</hi>
as are <hi>corporall substances.</hi> Neither can he be in the <hi>possessed</hi>
mans <hi>minde repletiuely,</hi> for so onely is God, who onely is
of <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>incircumscriptible</hi> being: and therefore <hi>reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely</hi>
filleth each place whatsoeuer, whereas the <hi>diuell</hi> is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>circumscriptible</hi> creature, comprehended after a
sort, in <hi>one peculiar place.</hi> And therefore he must necessarily be
in the <hi>possessed</hi> mans <hi>minde definitiuely,</hi> or not at all. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be so, yet can we not thereby <hi>conclude</hi> any <hi>substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
inherencie,</hi> but a being there <hi>determinately,</hi> and in an onely
<hi>conceite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10 Lastly, if the <hi>possessed</hi> mans <hi>minde</hi> be essentially a <hi>place</hi> for
the <hi>diuell:</hi> then is it, either a <hi>common place,</hi> and so capable of
<hi>many substances</hi> together, or, a <hi>proper place,</hi> and so, absolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>circumscribe</hi> the <hi>diuell</hi> his essentiall <hi>being:</hi> for, a <hi>place is
the circumscription of an essentiall substance.</hi> And then also the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,</hi>
he must needes be a <hi>moueable bodie,</hi> yea and the <hi>possessed</hi>
mans <hi>mind</hi> (in that selfesame respect) must also become an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable
bodie:</hi> otherwaies,<note place="margin">progressus in infinitum.</note> there would be a <hi>progresse in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse,</hi>
which thing euer <hi>nature</hi> it selfe doth abhorre. Or els, if
neither a <hi>common,</hi> nor <hi>proper place,</hi> then necessarilie an <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
place,</hi> or no <hi>place,</hi> at al: which, though it be graunted, doth
not <hi>conclude</hi> anie <hi>real possession.</hi> For, <hi>an imaginarie place,</hi> is only a
<hi>place in conceite:</hi> and so, by <hi>consequence,</hi> the <hi>diuel</hi> he hath onelie
in man an <hi>imaginarie possession.</hi> Now then, al these the aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>reasons,</hi> doe make me to hold for infallible <hi>truth;</hi> that the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25312:41"/>
                  <hi>diuel</hi> doth neuer <hi>essentiallie enter</hi> into any mans <hi>minde.</hi>

               <p>Your <hi>reasons</hi> I assure you, they satisfie me to the full: but,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus</speaker>
               <p>I say and hold (as before) that the <hi>diuel</hi> (in so manie at least
as are subiected vnto him) hath vndoubtedly an <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
possession;</hi> yea, euen in their verie <hi>mindes</hi> or hartes.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Yes,<note place="margin">Math. 12. 45.</note> the very <hi>scripitures</hi> themselues they plainely auouch,
that the <hi>diuel entreth and dwelleth in man:</hi> that he <hi>entred into the

                  <note place="margin">Luc. 11. 26.</note> that he <hi>filled Ananiah his heart,</hi> and so forth.
What other thing els may be collected from thence; but,<note place="margin">Luc. 22. 3.</note>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>You relie too much vpon the bare <hi>letter</hi> it selfe, and that is
the onelie thing which deceaueth your <hi>iudgement.</hi> For, albeit
the bare <hi>letter</hi> doth say that the <hi>diuel entreth into, and dwelleth in
man:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, sed effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuè.</note> that he <hi>entred into Iudas his heart, and filled Ananiah his

that <hi>filling</hi> of the hart,<note place="margin">Lyrain Lucam, cap. 9. 15. Ioh. 13. 2.</note> must not be <hi>formally,</hi> but <hi>effectiuely</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
As for example, the <hi>Diuel</hi> (in verie deed and in
truth) may truely be said to <hi>enter</hi> into the verie <hi>hart</hi> of a man:
because, he powerfully <hi>suggesteth,</hi> and effectually <hi>worketh</hi> in
mans <hi>minde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 5. 3.</note> his purposed mischiefes. Againe, the <hi>diuell</hi> may
truely be said to <hi>dwell</hi> in the hart, because, by the <hi>efficacie</hi> of his
working <hi>power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 28.</note> he holdeth mans <hi>mind</hi> as a <hi>captiuated prisoner at

               <p>You may <hi>expound</hi> at your pleasure: but I verily beleeue

               <p>Are not the <hi>diuels,</hi> as also <hi>mens mindes, intellectuall powers,</hi>

Notwithstanding, I do freely confesse, that the <hi>diuell</hi> hath
an <hi>actuall,</hi> or <hi>powerfull possession</hi> concerning mans <hi>minde:</hi> so far
foorth especially, as tendes to the effectuall <hi>tormenting</hi> and

               <p>I thinke euen so: and yet the <hi>reason</hi> of both, is <hi>one,</hi> and the

that the Lord God as largely imploieth the <hi>ministerie</hi> of <hi>good

any one of the godly, by the <hi>ministerie</hi> of his <hi>good Angels

                  <note place="margin">Act. 1. 24.</note>
he being onely of power to <hi>penetrate the spirits of men and

               <p>You do ouer-grosly conceiue of the matter; and with as
good reason might aske me, howe an <hi>enimie</hi> should possiblie
<hi>hurt</hi> the <hi>captaine</hi> which keepeth an <hi>hold:</hi> he hauing in the
saide <hi>captaine,</hi> no <hi>reall possession?</hi> Howbeit, this (me thinke) you
might know by experience, that, notwithstanding the want
of <hi>reall possession,</hi> the <hi>enimie</hi> may many waies hurt the said <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:</hi>
as, by giuing him <hi>bribes</hi> to betray the hold: by <hi>assaulting,</hi>
by <hi>battring,</hi> by <hi>undermyning,</hi> by <hi>pyning,</hi> by <hi>wounding,</hi> yea, and
by <hi>slaying</hi> some of his <hi>souldiers</hi> before his face. All these,
and many moe annoiances, the <hi>enimie</hi> may offer the <hi>captaine,</hi>
though not essentially inherent in the <hi>captaine</hi> himselfe:
yea, and by the dispatching of these, he cannot choose but
<hi>vexe</hi> and torment the <hi>captaine</hi> himselfe, euen as if he had <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
and <hi>substantially possessed</hi> his person. After the selfe-same
maner dealeth <hi>Satan,</hi> with such as he is said to <hi>possesse,</hi> For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he doth not <hi>substantially</hi> enter into the <hi>possessed</hi> mans

               <p>If <hi>diuels</hi> enter not <hi>essentiallie</hi> into the <hi>possessed</hi> mans <hi>mind:</hi>

               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Touching the enclining of <hi>mindes,</hi> if we speake herein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to truth, God alone is properlie said to worke in the
<hi>minds</hi> of men, and to encline their <hi>wils</hi> which waies he please:
although yet, <hi>spirites</hi> and <hi>diuels,</hi> they may also be considered as
<hi>helpers</hi> herein, howbeit such helpers no doubt, as doe rather
moue by <hi>external reasons,</hi> then encline at al by <hi>internal actions.</hi>
And euen so,<note place="margin">1. King, 22. 21.</note> the lying <hi>spirite,</hi> in the mouth of <hi>Ahab</hi> his <hi>prophets:</hi>
was after a sort,<note place="margin">1. Chro. 21. 1.</note> an <hi>helper</hi> to God. Concerning therefore the
enclining of <hi>minds,</hi> we must here distinguish betweene the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
efficient,</hi> who onlie is God: and the <hi>exteriour agent,</hi>
namelie, <hi>spirites</hi> and <hi>diuels.</hi> Againe, the meanes whereby the
<hi>exteriour agent</hi> doth worke, is twofold. The first is the <hi>external
obiect</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> it being apprehended of the vnderstanding
for good, and effectuallie offered also vnto the <hi>wil.</hi> For, euerie
<hi>facultie</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> is especiallie moued by his proper <hi>obiect:</hi>
not only offered, but apprehended also effectually. The other
<hi>external</hi> meanes enclining the <hi>mind,</hi> is seated in those <hi>affections</hi>
and <hi>passions</hi> that are placed in the <hi>sensitiue appetite,</hi> namely, <hi>lust,
anger, loue,</hi> and such like, by which also, the <hi>wil</hi> (after a sort) is
inclined to something. Now then, <hi>spirites</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> they are
able by <hi>external obiects,</hi> to stirre vp <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> in the
<hi>sensitiue appetite.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non simpliciter. Pro. 21. 1.</note> Howbeit, not <hi>simplie</hi> and absolutelie as God,
who is said to haue <hi>the hearts of kings in his hand,</hi> and who also
is able alone,<note place="margin">Secundum quid.</note> to encline mans <hi>wil</hi> effectuallie, to whatsoeuer he
please: but, <hi>after a sort,</hi> and so far forth also, as they by <hi>external
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25312:48"/>
reasons</hi> are able (like <hi>councellours</hi>) to perswade the <hi>wil</hi> vnto
something. For, they cannot possiblie <hi>compel</hi> the <hi>wil,</hi> the same
(by nature) reiecting al maner of <hi>compulsion:</hi> although yet, (by
perswading and alluring) they may (after a sort) be saied to
encline and to moue the <hi>mind.</hi> Now then this their enclining,
you see it consists not in anie <hi>essentiall possession,</hi> but onely in an
<hi>effectuall operation,</hi> whereof we wil discourse to the ful, when
we come to entreate of <hi>actual possession.</hi> In the meane time, do
now cease for shame to auouch any longer the <hi>mental possession
of diuels.</hi>

               <p>For answere hereunto, it shall not be greatly amisse, first, to
shew what the <hi>corporall</hi> possession of <hi>diuels</hi> is supposed to be:

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus.</speaker>
               <p>What I pray you, is the <hi>corporall</hi> possession?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>It is that whereby the <hi>diuell</hi> is supposed of some, euen <hi>really</hi>
and <hi>essentially</hi> to enter into, and substantially, and <hi>inherently</hi> to
dwell in the possessed mans <hi>bodie:</hi> during the whole terme of
that his tyrannicall dominion ouer the man, whom he, so <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
and <hi>personally</hi> possesseth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus.</speaker>
               <p>This supposed possession of <hi>diuels,</hi> I suppose is vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sound: but what is your owne opinion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>My opinion is this: namely, that the <hi>diuels</hi> neuer had anie
such <hi>reall</hi> possession in men: but onely an <hi>actuall</hi> possession.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus.</speaker>
               <p>Conclude you then, that the <hi>diuels</hi> haue in men, no <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
possession at all?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>If by <hi>corporall</hi> possession, you doe meane, that the <hi>diuels
essentially</hi>
enter into, and <hi>inherently</hi> dwel in the possessed mans
<hi>bodie:</hi> I see then, no reason at all, but, that I may boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it. Neither do I perceiue, how your selfe should euer be
able to contradict the infallible truth thereof. For verie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
I am, that no such <hi>essentiall</hi> possession; is any where
extant in all the <hi>Bible.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, yes sir, in euery place of the <hi>Bible</hi> almost, especially
there, where those matters are handled: it is said, the <hi>diuels
entred into them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 12. 45.</note> that they <hi>enter in, and dwell there:</hi> that Christ
charged the <hi>diuell</hi> to <hi>come out of the childe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marc. 9. 25.</note> and <hi>to enter no more
into him</hi> and so foorth. All which places doe plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,

               <p>I vnderstand thereby, all those peculiar <hi>actions</hi> which doe
necessarily succeede the <hi>powers of the minde,</hi> as proper effects
peculiarly appertaining vnto it. Otherwaies, this peculiar
<hi>power</hi> of the <hi>minde</hi> (it being a meane betweene the <hi>substance</hi>

did vndoubtedly, and immediatly succeede the same. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
these selfesame <hi>effects</hi> cannot possibly succeed the saide
<hi>power</hi> of the <hi>minde:</hi> so long at the least, as the <hi>Diuel</hi> himselfe
(really possessing the <hi>bodie</hi>) doth wholy and absolutely take
vp the said <hi>bodie</hi> with the <hi>members</hi> thereof, to accomplish his
mischieuous purposes. As for example, all the <hi>operations</hi> of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:25312:54"/>
                  <hi>minde,</hi> are either <hi>organical,</hi> or <hi>animal.</hi> The <hi>organical operations,</hi>
they are those seuerall <hi>actions</hi> which the <hi>minde</hi> can in no wise
accomplish but in the <hi>bodie</hi> it selfe, and by all the seuerall
<hi>members</hi> thereof, as by the proper <hi>instruments,</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
peculiarly appointed vnto it. Namely, the <hi>nutritiue, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatiue,</hi>
and <hi>generatiue operations,</hi> appertaining especially to
the <hi>vegetatiue life:</hi> also the facultie of <hi>seeing, hearing, tasting,
smelling, handling,</hi> and of <hi>common sense:</hi> moreouer, the <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi>
the <hi>memoratiue,</hi> the <hi>concupiscible, irascible,</hi> and <hi>motiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi>
being all attendant vpon the <hi>sensitiue</hi> life. Now then,
these, and euerie of these are the <hi>organical operations</hi> of the
<hi>minde,</hi> yea and such also as the <hi>minde</hi> cannot possibly <hi>effect</hi> but
in her owne <hi>bodie,</hi> and by all the <hi>partes</hi> thereof, as by the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<hi>instruments</hi> appointed of <hi>God.</hi> And therefore, how should
the possessed mans <hi>minde,</hi> (his <hi>bodie</hi> it selfe being thoroughly
surprised and taken vp (as you say)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the <hi>Diuel)</hi> at any hand

               <p>As the <hi>minde</hi> her selfe cannot but be in perpetuall <hi>motion:</hi>
so surely (being forcibly restrained from these her <hi>organical

               <p>The <hi>animal operations,</hi> they are such speciall <hi>actions,</hi> as the

without the <hi>bodie:</hi> namely, those three <hi>essential powers</hi> of the

Whereof, the two last are fitly termed the <hi>intellectiue appetite:</hi>
whereas the <hi>organical affections</hi> (arising only from out of the

But, for as much as these <hi>animal operations,</hi> all the while the
<hi>minde</hi> it selfe is seated in her proper <hi>bodie</hi> (are) by the order of
<hi>God</hi> (appointed to be the <hi>directours</hi>) and <hi>moderatours</hi> of all the

Touching the <hi>minde</hi> it selfe, her <hi>animall operations</hi> are

yea, by such a <hi>non organicall or animall motion,</hi> the verie <hi>soules</hi> of

The <hi>animal operations</hi> respecting the <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>bodie</hi> togither,
they are the dutifull applying of the <hi>vnderstanding, affection,</hi>
and <hi>will</hi> to an orderly <hi>direction,</hi> and circumspect <hi>moderation</hi> of

both may, and doth also accomplish without any <hi>direction</hi> or
<hi>moderation</hi> of the <hi>minde.</hi> As for example. The dead <hi>carkasse</hi>
of a man being quite seperate from the <hi>soule,</hi> it hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
her corporall <hi>dimensions, figure, situation, and habite:</hi>
yea, and is <hi>locally mooued,</hi> either downewards by a <hi>natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or else vpwards, or ouerthwart by a <hi>violent motion.</hi> Yea,
and all these <hi>corporall operations</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> the <hi>bodie</hi> hath, and
may also accomplish by herselfe alone, without any her soules
<hi>direction, moderation,</hi> or guidance: they being especially such
<hi>actions</hi> and <hi>motions,</hi> as appertaine not to the <hi>minde</hi> at all. Now
then, as the <hi>soule</hi> hath some such <hi>animall operations</hi> peculiarlie
appropriate to it, as it may well, and doth effectually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
without the <hi>bodie,</hi> being freely seperate from it, and
therefore, no reason the <hi>bodie</hi> it selfe should any waies be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
for those <hi>peculiar actions</hi> of the <hi>minde,</hi> whereunto she

               <p>Verie well. But I pray you consider this also, that the <hi>diuels,</hi>
if they haue <hi>corporall bodies:</hi> then also, they haue their <hi>corporall
motions.</hi> Now, euerie naturall <hi>motion,</hi> we doe know is either
<hi>circuler,</hi> or <hi>elementarie:</hi> The <hi>circuler motion</hi> for <hi>celestial bodies;</hi>
the <hi>elementarie motion,</hi> for <hi>elementarie bodies.</hi> Whereupon it
followeth, that, if <hi>diuels</hi> (as you say) be indued with <hi>celestial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:</hi>
then also, those their <hi>celestiall bodies,</hi> must naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the <hi>circuler motion.</hi> On the other side, the possessed man
(you know) he hath an <hi>elementarie bodie:</hi> and therefore, his
said <hi>bodie</hi> it must and will naturally follow the <hi>motion</hi> of that
<hi>element,</hi> whereof it doth chiefly consist.</p>

               <p>Thus much I inferre: namelie, that <hi>Lycanthropus</hi> his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
concerning the <hi>real</hi> possession of <hi>diuels,</hi> doth draw after it,
manie grosse and palpable absurdities. As for example. If the
<hi>diuel</hi> (as you your selfe doe confidentlie hold) hath a <hi>celestial
bodie,</hi> then, how should he <hi>really</hi> and essentiallie enter into the
<hi>elementarie body</hi> of an earthlie man, or possibly make any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
abode in the possessed mans <hi>bellie:</hi> sith the <hi>diuel,</hi> hauing
as you say, a <hi>celestial bodie</hi> naturallie attending and folowing
the <hi>circuler motion,</hi> he cannot be long from that natural <hi>motion,</hi>
but must eftsoones mount aloft to that <hi>celestial heauen</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his supposed <hi>bodie</hi> consists, to folow his <hi>circuler motion,</hi> and
then, what wil become I beseech you, of the possessed mans <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die?</hi>
Againe, if a <hi>spirit</hi> or <hi>diuell,</hi> hauing as you hold a <hi>celestiall
bodie,</hi> should <hi>essentially</hi> enter into the <hi>elementarie bodie</hi> of a <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial</hi>
man: then surelie, for the whole time of that <hi>real</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
there must be both in the <hi>diuel,</hi> and the <hi>man,</hi> either no
<hi>motion</hi> at al, which were absurd to imagine, or else, in the one,
or in both a supernaturall <hi>motion,</hi> and so, by consequence, that
<hi>reall</hi> possession should be verie <hi>miraculous,</hi> which were now in
these daies of the Gospell, incredible to heare. For, the <hi>diuell,</hi>
he being (as you say) <hi>really, essentially,</hi> yea, and <hi>corporally</hi> also
in man, that man hauing an <hi>elementarie bodie</hi> which naturallie
attendes the <hi>elementarie motion;</hi> and the <hi>diuell</hi> he hauing a <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
bodie,</hi> which must naturally folow the <hi>circuler motion:</hi>
how can the <hi>bodie</hi> of man conuerse with the <hi>bodie</hi> of the <hi>diuel,</hi>
it following naturally the <hi>circuler motion,</hi> but that selfe-same
<hi>circuler motion</hi> must needes be in the possessed mans <hi>bodie</hi> a
supernaturall <hi>motion?</hi> Or, how should the <hi>bodie</hi> of the <hi>diuell</hi> be
<hi>really</hi> inherent in the possessed mans <hi>bodie,</hi> and so folow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>elementarie motion;</hi> but that selfesame <hi>elementarie moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
also, must needes be a supernaturall <hi>motion</hi> in the <hi>diuell</hi> his
<hi>bodie?</hi> And so, by consequence: a <hi>miracle</hi> in the one, or in both.

fower sortes of <hi>spirites.</hi> Namely, first a <hi>diuine spirit,</hi> which

of a <hi>bodie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Petr. Martyr. loc. com. 9. sect. 14.</note> touching either his <hi>being,</hi> or his <hi>working.</hi> The second
are <hi>Angelical spirites,</hi> namely <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Diuels,</hi> who, albeit
they neede no <hi>bodies</hi> at all,<note place="margin">Oth. Casman. Angelograph. par. 1. cap. 3. pag. 72.</note> in respect either of their <hi>being,</hi> or
of their proper <hi>actions,</hi> yet neede they their <hi>bodies,</hi> in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
their <hi>actions</hi> vnto vs. The third are <hi>humane spirites:</hi>
who, in regard of their <hi>essential being</hi> doe neede no <hi>bodies,</hi> for,
they <hi>really exist</hi> and <hi>liue,</hi> being disioined asunder from their
<hi>bodies.</hi> Although yet, concerning their <hi>organical actions</hi> apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:25312:61"/>
hand may want their proper <hi>bodies.</hi> The fourth and last sort,
are <hi>brutish spirites:</hi> which, neither can <hi>be,</hi> nor <hi>do</hi> any thing at al
without their <hi>bodies.</hi> By al which it is cleare, that of these foure
sorts of <hi>spirits,</hi> the <hi>diuine spirit</hi> alone (the omnipotent <hi>God</hi> I

and of others, and this, either to <hi>helpe,</hi> or to <hi>hurt.</hi> And,

and therefore, it doth not, nor cannot so <hi>generally</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
as you would haue it to doe. Because <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>spirits</hi>
they may, and do eftsoones vndergoe some certeine <hi>offices</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:25312:62"/>
without any assistance of an <hi>externall bodie:</hi> yea, euen all their
<hi>offices</hi> whatsoeuer, they might and could wel vndertake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>bodie</hi> at all, if it so seemed good to the <hi>Lord.</hi> Howbeit,
some other <hi>offices</hi> againe, they doe execute in <hi>bodies:</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is otherwaies in themselues a defect for that work,
but, for their sakes onely to whom they are sent. Neither is it
of any necessitie, that the <hi>Angels</hi> (for some speciall respects)
should alwaies consist vpon, and haue peculiarly vnto them
their owne proper <hi>bodies:</hi> because (for such speciall respects)
they may, and haue eftsoones <hi>assumed</hi> to themselues some

of <hi>bodies</hi> at all, if <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>spirits</hi> be alwaies endued with

               <p>This is so farre from confuting, as it rather confirmes that
qualification which the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> doe make. Namely, that

the <hi>spirituall</hi> and simple substance of <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels.</hi> Besides

                  </note> it is one thing to <hi>be a bodie:</hi> and another to <hi>haue a bodie.

haue proued before, &amp; do here affirm it a fresh: that the <hi>soules</hi>

                  <hi>Augustine</hi> verie flatly affirmeth, that the <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,</hi>
doe differ fully from <hi>corporall substances,</hi> and denieth
withall, that whatsoeuer is <hi>created,</hi> the same is a <hi>bodie:</hi> yea, he

               <p>
                  <hi>He reasoneth thus.</hi> We doe therefore affirme the intellectuall
powers to be corporall substances,<note place="margin">Aug. de spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, &amp; anima, libr. 18.</note> onely because they are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>This is his <hi>argument.</hi> Whatsoeuer is <hi>circumscribed</hi> with
<hi>place,</hi> that same is <hi>corporall:</hi> but <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> they are <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:25312:63"/>
with place, therefore, <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> they are <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</hi>
I answere, the <hi>proposition</hi> is faultie, and halteth downe
right. For,<note place="margin">Iul. Scaliger. Exercit. 359. sect. 5.</note> the <hi>localitie</hi> of <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> doth not simply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon a <hi>bodie</hi> which after it owne manner, I meane <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscriptiuely</hi>
and <hi>sensibly</hi> is (no doubt) in a <hi>place:</hi> but it ariseth
properly, from the <hi>finitouesse,</hi> and <hi>dimensiuenesse</hi> of the <hi>angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
nature</hi> it selfe. Which said <hi>angelicall nature</hi> being created
of <hi>God,</hi> is therefore but <hi>finite,</hi> and <hi>circumscribed</hi> also with those
her owne <hi>termes</hi> which are competent and proper vnto her.
And therefore, the <hi>intellectuall powers,</hi> they are in a <hi>place,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be <hi>finite substances:</hi> although yet, they are in a <hi>place</hi>
but <hi>definitiuely</hi> or <hi>determinately.</hi> So then, <hi>spirites</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> you
see, they are vndoubtedly in a <hi>place,</hi> because they be <hi>locall:</hi>
but, they are therefore said to be <hi>local,</hi> not because they be
<hi>corporall</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> imagineth, but for that, being <hi>finite,</hi> they
haue their <hi>muchnesse</hi> or <hi>quantity</hi> after a sort, I meane, no <hi>predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camental,</hi>
but an <hi>intelligible quantity.</hi> And therefore <hi>Augustine</hi>
he speaketh soundly you see, against <hi>Tertullian:</hi> but proueth
your purpose nothing at al.</p>

               <p>But,<note place="margin">Author de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticis dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matibus, qui extat in tom. 3. Aug.</note> the <hi>author</hi> of the <hi>Ecclesiasticall opinions</hi> writeth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that <hi>we must beleeue nothing to be incorporall or inuisible but
onely God.</hi> Who alone is truely said to be <hi>incorporall,</hi> because he
is euery where present, replenishing al things: and therefore
also <hi>inuisible</hi> to euery creature, because he is <hi>incorporall.</hi> His first
<hi>argument</hi> is framed thus. Whatsoeuer is <hi>incorporall,</hi> that same
is <hi>euery where,</hi> because <hi>vbiquity</hi> is the cause of <hi>incorporality.</hi> But,
<hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels,</hi> they are not <hi>euery where:</hi> therefore, <hi>spirits</hi> and

               <p>The <hi>proposition</hi> with his <hi>prosyllogisme</hi> halteth downe right,
the same being a deceaueable <hi>Elench:</hi> making that the <hi>cause,</hi>
which is not properly the <hi>cause</hi> in deed.<note place="margin">a non causa, vt causa.</note> For, neither is <hi>infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
nor the <hi>vbiquity</hi> depending thereon, the only <hi>proper cause</hi>
that any thing is <hi>incorporal:</hi> but some other thing els. As for
example, an <hi>omnipresence,</hi> or (if so I may speake) an <hi>incorporiety,</hi>
is truely in <hi>God:</hi> howbeit, <hi>God</hi> is <hi>incorporal,</hi> not so much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his <hi>vbiquity,</hi> as because he is a <hi>simple spirit.</hi> Angels in like
sort, are therefore <hi>incorporal</hi> in their proper degree, because
they be <hi>spirits,</hi> but yet <hi>created spirits:</hi> and they are therefore
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:25312:64"/>
                  <hi>local,</hi> because they be <hi>finite substances.</hi> Thus then, your said <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
his first <hi>argument,</hi> afordeth smal force (you see) to your
present purpose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus.</speaker>
               <p>But, he argueth secondly thus. Whatsoeuer is <hi>incorporal,</hi>
that also is <hi>inuisible: spirites</hi> and <hi>diuels,</hi> they are not <hi>inuisible,</hi>
therefore also, not <hi>incorporal.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>First, the <hi>assumption</hi> is meerely false, because it maketh <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
and <hi>diuels</hi> naturally <hi>visible:</hi> which al men do know to be
otherwaies by common <hi>experience.</hi> For,<note place="margin">Luc. 24. 39.</note> who euer hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
seene, or could possibly perceiue <hi>a spirit</hi> or <hi>diuel</hi> as they are
in their proper nature. Againe, in the <hi>proposition</hi> he failes as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by pretending a <hi>cause,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">a non causa, vt causa.</note> which is not the <hi>cause.</hi> For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
of a <hi>corporal</hi> or <hi>bodily beeing,</hi> is not the proper <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisibility:</hi>
but, the <hi>absence,</hi> the <hi>vitiousnesse,</hi> the <hi>depriuation</hi> or
<hi>fault</hi> of some other thing els which are necessarily required in
the <hi>action of seeing.</hi> Besides that, by this <hi>argument,</hi> a man might
also deny the <hi>aiery element</hi> to be a <hi>body</hi> or <hi>corporal substance:</hi>
for, who can <hi>possibly</hi> behold, or <hi>sensibly</hi> see the purity of the <hi>ayre</hi>
it selfe? Thus then, your <hi>old fathers</hi> (you see) they (in deed and

consonant to that other <hi>opinion</hi> which himselfe and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe hold about the <hi>creation</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> in that the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

               <p>Well, yet <hi>Zanchius</hi> and the other, they purposely encline

               <p>Not so. For whereas your selfe do certainly hold that <hi>spirits</hi>
and <hi>diuels</hi> are endued with grosse and <hi>airie bodies: Zanchius,</hi>
and some others suppose, they do rather consist of <hi>empyriall or

and woonderfull large, although yet (in comparison of

supposed <hi>bodies</hi> of <hi>spirites</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> in comparison of our
<hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>palpable bodies,</hi> may fitlie be saide to be <hi>spirituall,</hi>

               <p>With very good will my <hi>reasons</hi> are these.<note place="margin">Luc. 24. 39.</note> First, <hi>spirits and
diuels haue not flesh and bones (saith Christ) as you see me to haue.</hi>
Wherein it is very apparant, that, there is <hi>one substance</hi> of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
bodies,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> of <hi>spiritual</hi> powers. <hi>Spirits,</hi> they haue
neither <hi>flesh</hi> nor <hi>bones:</hi> therefore, they cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the <hi>sight</hi> of the <hi>eie,</hi> nor <hi>handled</hi> by the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>feeling,</hi>
both which are proper to the <hi>sensible</hi> perceiuing of <hi>humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
Againe,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle) hath made his spirits his

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 204. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and his ministers a flame of fier.</hi> The which place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<hi>Dauid</hi> doth properly vnderstand of the operation of

<hi>Angels,</hi> it is not to be doubted at all, but as the <hi>name Spirit,</hi> so
likewise a <hi>spirituall essence</hi> appertaineth vnto them. Againe,
we read that a <hi>legion of diuels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marc. 5. 9. Luc. 8. 30.</note> namely, sixe thousand, sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
sixtie and sixe <hi>possessed</hi> the man in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> whom
<hi>Christ</hi> deliuered. But, if <hi>diuels</hi> be <hi>corporall substances,</hi> and doe
<hi>essentially</hi> enter into the <hi>bodie</hi> of man, it is vtterly impossible
that there should so many be crouded together, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>I proceed thus; The <hi>spirits</hi> or <hi>soules</hi> of men are <hi>incorporall:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. Genes. ad literam, lib. 7. cap. 9.&amp; 12.&amp; 21.</note>
therefore <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> are also <hi>incorporall.</hi> For, if the <hi>reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
soule</hi> or <hi>spirit</hi> of a man, be not <hi>corporall</hi> in any respect, I
meane, if it be neither <hi>solide</hi> nor <hi>palpable</hi> as are the <hi>earthie</hi> and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:25312:66"/>
                  <hi>terrestriall bodies,</hi> neither yet <hi>subtile</hi> or <hi>slender</hi> as are the <hi>airie</hi>
and <hi>celestiall bodies:</hi> then without doubt, <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> they
are likewise <hi>incorporall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Danaeus, in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir. Aug. cap. 59. pag. 179.</note> because they also are <hi>spirits.</hi> For, the
<hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>definitions</hi> of a <hi>spirit</hi> and a <hi>bodie,</hi> do altogither, and
in euery respect <hi>differ</hi> betweene themselues. And thus (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those <hi>Philosophicall reasons</hi> which <hi>Physiologus</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
before) you haue hetherto heard from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
such seuerall <hi>arguments</hi> as doe verie plainely conclude the <hi>non</hi>

               <p>What man, must the credit of a <hi>grand-Iurie</hi> of <hi>Catholike

<hi>Councell?</hi> Well then,<note place="margin">Conc. Lateran. magnum. Can. 1.</note> the <hi>Laterane Councell</hi> doth flatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>spirits,</hi> they are <hi>incorporall,</hi> created of <hi>God:</hi>
and, were not eternall before al beginnings, but, created one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of <hi>Fathers,</hi> yea, and by the whole <hi>consent</hi> of a generall
<hi>Councell,</hi> that <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> are <hi>incorporall substances:</hi> and,
that therefore, if <hi>diuels</hi> doe <hi>essentially</hi> enter into the <hi>bodies</hi> of

               <p>What sir? would you beare vs in hand, it were hard to

            <sp>

               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>If a true <hi>naturall bodie,</hi> then tell me further, whether it be a

               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus.</speaker>
               <p>It is a bodie <hi>created before.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>If you hold it a bodie <hi>created before,</hi> then tell me yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whether you take it to be a <hi>liuing:</hi> or <hi>dead mans bodie?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>I take it to be some <hi>liuing mans bodie,</hi> if any at all: else, how
should it possibly serue the <hi>diuels</hi> purpose?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>I woonder, you should so grossely imagine an impossible
matter. For, where hath the <hi>diuell</hi> receiued power from the
Lord: to dispossesse liuing <hi>soules</hi> of their <hi>organicall bodies?</hi> And,
what must become of that <hi>liuing mans soule:</hi> all the while the
<hi>diuell assumeth</hi> his <hi>bodie</hi> it selfe, to serue his mischieuous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
Moreouer, it is verie absurde: to suppose that the <hi>diuell</hi>
can possibly assume to himselfe any liuing mans <hi>bodie.</hi> Because
the Lord hath so vnchangeably established such an insepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:25312:69"/>
vnion betweene the <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>bodie</hi> of a <hi>liuing man:</hi> as, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the <hi>bodie</hi> and <hi>soule</hi> be substantially vnited together, that
man may not truely be termed a <hi>liuing man.</hi> And which more
is, the <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>body</hi> are so inseparably conioyned by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God: as, no one creature in heauen or in earth may
possibly disioyne them, before the finall separation of life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the determinate councell &amp; appointment of God.
Briefly, be it supposed that the <hi>diuell</hi> could in deed <hi>assume</hi> to
himselfe some <hi>liuing mans bodie,</hi> and could also for the present,
<hi>extenuate</hi> the same, and <hi>transforme</hi> the substance thereof into
spirituall <hi>congellations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tatianus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra graecos. 4. physic. &amp; 2. de anima. simul, &amp; semel,</note> as <hi>Tatianus</hi> affirmeth: yet, this is verie
certaine and a generall <hi>rule,</hi> that, two substantiall <hi>formes</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly be inherent <hi>together</hi> and at <hi>once,</hi> in one and the
selfe same <hi>subiect.</hi> And therefore, to bring the substantiall
<hi>forme</hi> of a <hi>diuell</hi> without feeling, into the substantiall <hi>body</hi> of a
man without either killing or hurting, and which more is, to
<hi>transforme</hi> the same into such a slender and <hi>impalpable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
as cannot of the <hi>possessed</hi> him selfe be <hi>sensibly</hi> perceiued
or felt, no not at the first entrance into him: it may well be
vnlikely, but very certaine I am, the same is vtterly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for all the <hi>diuels</hi> in <hi>hell</hi> to accomplish, such hard hap they
haue, in <hi>assuming</hi> a <hi>liuing mans</hi> body.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pneumatomachus.</speaker>
               <p>For my part, I rather suppose that the <hi>Diuel</hi> doth <hi>assume</hi> to
himselfe some <hi>deads mans</hi> bodie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>This your <hi>supposall</hi> is no lesse absurd then the orher before.
For first, if that bodie which the <hi>Diuel</hi> doth <hi>assume,</hi> be the body
of a <hi>dead man departed long since,</hi> then surely, it is an hundred
to one, that, that selfesame <hi>assumed bodie</hi> is either eaten with
wormes,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 39.</note> and so, vnfit for the seruice: or is else so putrified with
filthie corruption, as the <hi>Diuel</hi> (by entring into any therwith)
must needes poyson the <hi>possessed</hi> man vnto death. Againe, if
that <hi>assumed bodie,</hi> be the bodie of a <hi>dead man but lately departed
this life:</hi> the <hi>Diuel</hi> then, by <hi>assuming</hi> such a <hi>newly departed bodie,</hi>
must be supposed to appeere in a white winding sheete, as he
was heretofore thought to appeere vnto Saul,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 28. 14.</note> in <hi>Samuels sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
bodie with a mantel about him,</hi> &amp; must so (for the present)
forsake that his supposed <hi>forme,</hi> which the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Painters</hi>
doe hold to be griesly and blacke. Besides that, in supposing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:25312:70"/>
the <hi>Diuel</hi> can <hi>assume</hi> to himselfe the <hi>bodie of a man,</hi> you doe
therein very grosly oppose your selfe to the blessed <hi>Apostle:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 13.</note>
who saith most confidently that mens <hi>bodies</hi> are created for
the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe, and not for infernall <hi>Spirits.</hi> That, they are
the <hi>members of Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 15.</note> not the <hi>mansions</hi> of <hi>Belial:</hi> the <hi>temples of
the holy Ghost,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 19.</note> not a <hi>dungeon</hi> for <hi>Diuels,</hi> a <hi>stie</hi> for <hi>Satan,</hi> not an
<hi>habitation</hi> for <hi>Helhounds.</hi> Briefly, if the <hi>Diuel</hi> doth <hi>assume</hi> to
himselfe, some <hi>dead mans bodie,</hi> whether long since, or but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
departed:<note place="margin">Otho Casman. Augelograph. par. 2. cap. 18. pag. 528.</note> we must (by this your supposall) imagine a <hi>resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
of <hi>bodies</hi> before to the generall iudgement, and therein
also, must attribute to the <hi>Diuel,</hi> that absolute power of <hi>raising</hi>
the dead, which only is due and proper to <hi>God,</hi> and so, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
conclude, that the <hi>Diuel</hi> can accomplish and worke
true <hi>miracles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 39.</note> Whereas the <hi>Lord</hi> only is able to <hi>take life from
the dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 26. Psal. 36. 9. Ioh. 5. 21. Act. 17. 28. Rom. 4. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and to restore them againe vnto life:</hi> which is such a
<hi>miraculous worke</hi> of the omnipotent <hi>God,</hi> as by an infallible
consequence approoueth the <hi>Deitie.</hi> Seeing therefore that by
this your <hi>supposal</hi> you doe in effect but <hi>Deifie</hi> the <hi>Diuel:</hi> bee
foorthwith ashamed to hold, that <hi>Spirits</hi> haue power to <hi>assume</hi>
to themselues the bodie of a man <hi>alreadie created,</hi> whether
dead, or aliue.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus.</speaker>
               <p>You grant then, that the <hi>Diuels</hi> doe <hi>assume</hi> to themselues
some <hi>vncreated bodie?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>I grant no such thing. For, how is it possible, either <hi>Diuel</hi>
or <hi>Angel</hi> should <hi>assume</hi> that which is not at all: or that they
should take to themselues, a bodie not yet <hi>existing in nature?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philologus.</speaker>
               <p>Very true. But after the <hi>creation</hi> of such an essentiall bodie:
you doe then confesse, the <hi>Diuel</hi> may <hi>assume</hi> such a <hi>bodie?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>I confesse no such matter: vnlesse you first shew me by

               <p>First, because the <hi>Lord</hi> hath infinite meanes besides, and
those also of more excellent maiestie for the execution of <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:</hi>
and therefore, he stands in no maner of neede to haue
such a patched supplie. Secondly, for that the Lord will neuer
do that;<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 2. 3. Exod. 20. 11. and 30. 17. Deut. 5. 14. Heb. 4. 4.</note> which may any waies witnes against himselfe. But, for
him to <hi>create</hi> such essential <hi>bodies</hi> afresh at the pleasure of the
<hi>diuell,</hi> and so oft as he pleaseth: doth derogate greatly from
the certaintie of that sacred truth which sealeth vnto vs, <hi>the
certaine accomplishment of all his workes whatsoeuer in sixe daies
space, and the vndoubted ceasing from all his labors the folowing
day.</hi> Moreouer, to hold for infallible truth, that those your
supposed <hi>bodies</hi> for the seruice of <hi>Satan</hi> must in any case be
<hi>created of God:</hi> what doe you else in effect, but thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the <hi>Lord</hi> him selfe to be slauishly subiect vnto <hi>Satan</hi> his
accursed commaund,<note place="margin">Math. 4. 3.</note> in <hi>creating</hi> him <hi>bodies</hi> afresh, and so oft
as seemeth him good?<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 4. Rom. 11. 36. Col. 1. 16.</note> Briefly sith <hi>the glory of God is the maine

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:25312:71"/>
nor <hi>glorie?</hi> And therefore, it is grosse <hi>impietie,</hi> or rather an
horrible <hi>blasphemie</hi> for any to hold, that the <hi>Lord</hi> alone must
be the <hi>Creator</hi> of any such essentiall <hi>bodies,</hi> as your selfe and

                  </hi> those heauenly priuiledges which the <hi>celestiall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
enioy: neither yet are they equall with them in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

<hi>assume</hi> to themselues <hi>essentiall bodies:</hi> yet doth it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie
folow, that therefore, the <hi>euill Angels</hi> or <hi>diuels</hi> are

themselues, but by the prouident power and appointment of

in this, <hi>viz. Good Angels,</hi> they do <hi>visible</hi> appeere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men in <hi>assumed bodies:</hi> therefore <hi>euill Angels</hi> they doe the

in <hi>visible bodies,</hi> we haue had often and manifest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
but of the <hi>euill Angels</hi> appearing so, no example or

Whereas you should haue argued thus. <hi>Good Angels</hi> appeare
in <hi>assumed bodies,</hi> therefore <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> do appeare vnto
men in <hi>assumed bodies:</hi> but then your <hi>consequent</hi> woulde haue

the <hi>diuel</hi> should be able vtterly to annihilate the <hi>esse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall being</hi>
either of himselfe, or of any other <hi>creature</hi> vnder the heauens?
Or, is it likely that <hi>satan</hi> can cause himsele to be a <hi>diuel</hi> or no
<hi>diuel:</hi> and the <hi>serpent</hi> to be a <hi>serpent</hi> or no serpent, when, and
so oft as it pleaseth himselfe? If this were certeinely so, what
one <hi>creature</hi> in al the world could any long time continue in
that proper estate wherein it was first created of <hi>God?</hi> For, the
<hi>diuel</hi> hath <hi>wil</hi> and malice enough to do mischiefe, if he had but
that <hi>absolute power</hi> to accomplish the same. Moreouer, from
<hi>satan</hi> his <hi>assuming</hi> of the <hi>serpents body</hi> alone, you doe plainely
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:25312:73"/>
conclude an absolute power in <hi>diuels</hi> ouer all other <hi>bodies</hi> else
whatsoeuer: and so, from one <hi>perticular example</hi> you do cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
gather a <hi>generall conclusion</hi> thus. <hi>Satan,</hi> he did <hi>essentially
assume</hi> the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>serpent:</hi> therefore, <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> can
<hi>essentially assume</hi> what <hi>bodies</hi> they please. This <hi>argument</hi> is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
vntrue in euery part. For first, whereas I plainely deny
that the <hi>diuel</hi> can so <hi>essentially assume</hi> a <hi>body,</hi> the which thing
you should proue:<note place="margin">Petitio principij</note> your selfe by a pitifull <hi>begging of the cause in
question,</hi> do take it as graunted, and thereupon, would proue
the <hi>same by the same,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem, per idem.</note> attributing also to the diuel such an <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
power</hi> therein as is vtterly impertinent to any <hi>creature,</hi> and
thereby also you doe highly derogate from the <hi>diuinity</hi> and
power of <hi>God.</hi> Secondly, your <hi>argument</hi> also is faulty, in that it
concludeth more largely then was put downe in the <hi>premisses:</hi>
namely, from one particular practize of <hi>satan</hi> it concludes an
absolute power (as was said) ouer al <hi>bodies</hi> whatsoeuer, which
is a deceiueable kind of reasoning. For, albeit we should grant
(which will neuer be proued) that <hi>satan</hi> had for that once,
some speciall preuiledge granted from <hi>God,</hi> and did thereby
also, <hi>essentially</hi> enter into the very <hi>essence</hi> of the <hi>serpent</hi> as your
selfe suppose: yet doth it not folow, that therefore <hi>spirits</hi> and
<hi>diuels</hi> they can also <hi>essentially assume</hi> to themselues what <hi>bodies</hi>
they please. Howbeit, to the end we may the more directly
and plainely proceed, doe tell me whether it was the <hi>diuel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
or the <hi>serpent</hi> alone, or the <hi>diuel</hi> and <hi>serpent</hi> together, that
gaue the onset vpon <hi>Euah</hi> in that temptation?</p>

accustomed thing in the sacred <hi>scriptures</hi> to vse the <hi>names</hi> of
other <hi>creatures</hi> in setting forth to our sense, the <hi>intellectual
creatures</hi> themselues. Hereupon it is, that (in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi>)
the (<hi>diuel</hi> by a perpetual <hi>allegory</hi>) is called a <hi>dragon</hi> or <hi>serpent:</hi>
and therefore in this <hi>history</hi> of <hi>Euahs</hi> tentation by the like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
<hi>allegory</hi> he is also called a <hi>serpent.</hi> Secondly <hi>Moses</hi> (in
that <hi>action</hi>) doth purposely intitle the <hi>diuel</hi> by the <hi>name</hi> of a
<hi>serpent:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 3.</note> because (by his effectuall creeping into the <hi>interiour

he doth very liuely represent <hi>the nature,</hi> disposition,
and qualities of the venemous <hi>serpent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Genes. 3. 1.</note> Thirdly, the <hi>serpent</hi> that
tempted <hi>Euah</hi> in <hi>paradice,</hi> is there said to be <hi>more subtile then
euerie beaste of the field:</hi> the which (if <hi>Philosophers</hi> writings
be true) cannot be truely auouched of the <hi>naturall serpent.</hi> For
there are many other <hi>creatures</hi> more <hi>subtile</hi> then she: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it must needs be ment of the <hi>spirituall serpent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 1. 3.</note> Fourthly,
<hi>Moses</hi> doth therefore purposely attribute <hi>speech</hi> to the <hi>serpent</hi>
which tempted <hi>Euah:</hi> to the end we (knowing by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that speach cannot properly accord with a <hi>naturall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>)
might the rather be induced to beleeue that the same
must <hi>metaphorically</hi> be vnderstood of the <hi>spirituall serpent,</hi>
Fiftly,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 14. 15.</note> the <hi>punishment</hi> inflicted by <hi>God,</hi> hath no conueniencie
at all with the <hi>naturall;</hi> but with that <hi>infernall</hi> figured <hi>serpent</hi>
the <hi>diuell.</hi> For, neither can the going vpon her <hi>belly,</hi> nor the
eating of <hi>dust</hi> be any punishment at all to the <hi>naturall serpent;</hi>
because (before the tentation) both those properties were
peculiarly alotted vnto her,<note place="margin">Serpens, a serpendo, Isidor. de summo bono. lib. 3.</note> she taking her name from her
<hi>creeping condition.</hi> Neither yet may we imagine that the said
<hi>serpent</hi> (being of some better forme before the tentation) was
then (by the iust iudgement of <hi>God) transformed</hi> into a viler
proportion,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 25. 26.</note> property, or shape: she being in the <hi>historie</hi> of the
<hi>creation</hi> accompted among the <hi>creeping creatures.</hi> Lastly,
<hi>Moses</hi> he makes no mention at all of the <hi>serpents comming</hi> to
<hi>Euah</hi> about that busines, nor of her <hi>departure</hi> after the <hi>action,</hi>
nor of any one speciall propertie whereby she might be <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi>
discerned to be (in deed) a true <hi>naturall serpent,</hi> no nor
of any manner amaze, or sodaine feare in <hi>Euah</hi> at her sodaine
approch &amp; <hi>extraordinarie speach:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 3.</note> whereas yet <hi>Moses</hi> him selfe,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:25312:75"/>
was afterwards horribly afraied at the onely sight of a <hi>serpent.</hi>
So then, by all the <hi>premises</hi> it is very apparant, that it was the
<hi>diuell</hi> him selfe and no <hi>naturall serpent,</hi> who set vpon <hi>Euah</hi> in
that tentation, he being onely <hi>metaphorically</hi> set forth by the
<hi>name</hi> of a <hi>serpent:</hi> and therefore had no need in that <hi>action, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially</hi>
to <hi>assume</hi> to him selfe the <hi>body</hi> of a <hi>naturall serpent,</hi> for
the better accomplishment of the entended businesse.</p>

                  <hi>which ought to be a watchword and terrour

is saide. <hi>Thou art cursed aboue all the beasts in the field,</hi> there the

their <hi>originall nature.</hi> For, the <hi>beasts of the field</hi> they doe not
forgoe any heauenly happines which they neuer yet had:
but they continue foorth their course in that selfesame <hi>primary

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus.</speaker>
               <p>Not so, For howsoeuer a <hi>minstrill</hi> might (by his <hi>breath</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone)
be able to cause the <hi>pipes</hi> to squeake, yet could he neuer

               <p>Well then, thus much yet you confesse by the way, that a

Goe to, what say you to the <hi>trumpeter:</hi>

<hi>breath:</hi> and yet, only therewith he causeth so certaine a <hi>sound,</hi>
as euery one that heares him, can tell what is <hi>played or sounded.</hi>
Now then, if it be possible for a <hi>reasonable man,</hi> thus to applie
a <hi>dead instrument</hi> at his pleasure to serue his turne without
any <hi>essentiall creeping</hi> into it: why should it be deemed impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for an <hi>intellectuall power</hi> or <hi>diuell,</hi> to apply to his purpose
the <hi>toonge</hi> of his <hi>liuing instrument,</hi> (the <hi>serpent</hi> I meane) in the

And therefore, let vs heare other <hi>reasons</hi> of more waighty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance

               <p>Well, sith you will needes transferre this miraculous and
immediate worke from the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe to the <hi>meanes,</hi> I
meane, to the <hi>ministerie</hi> of the <hi>Angell</hi> as your selfe doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
Let it be freely graunted that the <hi>Angell</hi> (indeed) did
<hi>frame</hi> that <hi>sensible speech</hi> in the mouth of the senslesse <hi>Asse,</hi> as
by a fit <hi>instrument</hi> appointed of <hi>God</hi> for that speciall purpose:
and yet this I auouch withall, that the <hi>Angell</hi> did not <hi>ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi>
effect that <hi>sensible speech</hi> by any such <hi>essentiall insinuation</hi>
as your selfe doth imagine: but by an onely <hi>effectuall operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as I haue shewed before. Briefly, this <hi>sensible speech</hi> (if you
will needes attribute the same to the <hi>Angell</hi>) might, and was
also <hi>effectiuely</hi> accomplished by some <hi>powerfull operation</hi> of the
<hi>Angell,</hi> without any such needlesse <hi>essentiall entrance</hi> into the
<hi>Asse:</hi> as by the <hi>simile</hi> of a <hi>minstrill or trumpeter</hi> we did illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:25312:79"/>
before. And heereunto also accordeth the iudgement
of <hi>Lyra:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lyra in Glos. or ordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

words were framed, neither by the Asse alone, nor by the Angel
himselfe essentially inherent within the Asse: but by an effectuall
operation or power of the Angell, directing and disposing the toong
of the Asse to deliuer such sensible speech, for the further confusion
of Baalam himselfe.</hi> And therefore, this <hi>reason</hi> (you see) is of
little, or no force at all: to fortifie your fond <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi>
his <hi>essentiall assuming</hi> of true <hi>naturall bodies.</hi>

               <p>Though this place doth not directly proue, that the <hi>diuels</hi>
may <hi>assume and essentially enter</hi> into a true <hi>naturall body,</hi> because
no such thing is apparant in this <hi>action</hi> of the <hi>Angel,</hi> from
whence the proofe it selfe should be brought: yet doth it
plainely conclude, that the <hi>diuel</hi> (by meanes of a true <hi>naturall
body</hi>) may deliuer a <hi>sensible speech,</hi> because some such thing we
find here effected by the <hi>good Angel of God.</hi>

               <p>Well said <hi>Lycanthropus,</hi> this <hi>argument</hi> I verely suppose, will

thereof. And therefore (letting it lie soaking a while in the

for an answere: It is generally and iudicially determined by
the whole <hi>church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yea and the <hi>marginall note</hi> in your <hi>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
doth likewise auouch, that it was not <hi>Samuel</hi> himselfe
that appeared, but the <hi>diuel</hi> forsooth in <hi>Samuels</hi> likenesse.

wil proue it the <hi>diuel</hi> himselfe <hi>essentially</hi> in <hi>Samuels body</hi> who
appeared to <hi>Saul?</hi> There is no mention of the <hi>diuel</hi> in all that

               <p>Though the <hi>diuel</hi> be not <hi>nominally</hi> exprest in the <hi>story,</hi> yet
there be many things in the <hi>story</hi> it self which do implicatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnfold his nature vnto vs,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 28. 6.</note> and which can haue relation to

                  <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 31. &amp; 20. 27.</note> it is vnlikely he would

                  <note place="margin">Act. 14. 15.</note> Againe, he that <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>

neither <hi>Samuel,</hi> nor any <hi>good Angel</hi> in heauen would haue

                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 28. 19. and 31. 6.</note>
Moreouer he which <hi>appeared</hi> told <hi>Saul</hi> that, <hi>the next day</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <note place="margin">1. Chro. 10. 13. 14.</note> but <hi>Saul</hi> was a reprobate, and

himselfe appeered to <hi>Saul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 28. 19.</note> Againe, he that <hi>appeered,</hi> did

a lier and the father of lying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> and therefore, not the <hi>Diuel</hi> but

this I must tell you concerning the first <hi>opinion.</hi> Namely, that
(howsoeuer it be granted for truth) it serues not your turne;
for, it denies the <hi>apparition</hi> to be <hi>Samuell</hi> in deed, but rather a
meere <hi>illusion</hi> of <hi>Satan.</hi> Touching the second, it is that (you
know) which I <hi>argue</hi> against: and therefore (by their leaues)
I dissent from the same, till that which I haue said, be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
answered. As for the last, howsoeuer it be new, and
therefore may haply seeme strange vnto some, yet if your

saith he, is woorthie due consideration: namely, Whether
<hi>spirites</hi> and <hi>Diuels corporal</hi> or <hi>incorporal,</hi> doe <hi>substantially</hi> enter
into the <hi>bodies</hi> of men, and <hi>essentially</hi> slip into their <hi>mindes:</hi> or

<hi>Diuels</hi> (being <hi>entred into some</hi>) were <hi>cast forth</hi> by our Sauiour
<hi>Christ.</hi> Howbeit, whether they <hi>entred into them substantially,</hi>
or rather, were said to be <hi>in them effectiuely,</hi> there lieth the
point,<note place="margin">Gennadius in definit. Eccles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogmatum. Aug. de definit. Orthodox. fidei cap. 46.</note> and the same is not yet apparant vnto vs. <hi>Gennadius</hi>

the minde:</hi> but rather, by an <hi>effectual application,</hi> and by a <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

                  <note place="margin">Aug. de spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu de anima, cap. 27.</note> Howbeit, <hi>Satan</hi> also, he <hi>filleth the

into his <hi>hart:</hi> for that <hi>power,</hi> (if any such be) appertaineth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

For suggest he may, but compell he cannot.</hi> And therefore
saith <hi>Lyra,</hi>

                  <hi>is only in Gods hand, and not in the hand of the Diuel.
The Diuel hath in deede a ministerie: but no arbitrarie power.</hi>
Now then, the <hi>ministerie,</hi> it consists not of an <hi>absolute auctoritie:</hi>
but of a <hi>subiected seruitude.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gregorius Moral. llib. 2.</note> And albeit saith <hi>Gregorie, the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
will of Satan be euer vniust, yet his deputed power is neuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust:
because, although he hath a will of himselfe, yet hath he his
power onely from God. And therefore whatsoeuer he desireth to
worke vniustly, that (if at any time he effect it) God permitteth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:25312:83"/>
most iustly. So then the Diuel ought neuer to be vniustly feared:
because he is vnable any further to deale then he himselfe is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
Briefly,<note place="margin">Hermes Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus, in suo periandro.</note> 
                  <hi>Hermes Trismegistus</hi> very confidently auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,

soule</hi> be capable only of an <hi>humane bodie:</hi> then also an <hi>humane
bodie</hi> is capable only of an <hi>humane soule,</hi> and so by <hi>consequence</hi>
vncapable of an <hi>essentiall Diuel:</hi> but the first is true, by <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus</hi>
his iudgement,<note place="margin">Reginald Skot in his discouerie of witchcraft pag. 508.</note> and therefore also the latter. And in
very deed (seeing <hi>Satans</hi> assaults are <hi>spirituall</hi>) why should we
imagine (saith <hi>Skot</hi>) that the <hi>Diuel who is a spirit (and therefore
inuisible and insensible) can be sensibly seene, knowen, perceiued or
felt essentially of a naturall man? Or that he should (contrarie to his
nature) become corporal: being by Gods appointment, ordeined and
created to a spirituall proportion? They that doe thus vnderstand
things spoken of the Diuel according onely to the literal sense; they
may as well conclude,</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Such a grant, we may yeeld you at no hand, because, euen
<hi>Philosophie</hi> her selfe is flat opposite to it: who will neuer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any such a confused participation of <hi>essentiall formes.</hi> For,
as <hi>essence</hi> it selfe is <hi>impartible,</hi> and vndeuidable, or rather a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
incommunicable, and singular matter: so surely (the
<hi>essence</hi> and <hi>vnitie</hi> of things being preserued intier) <hi>essentiall
formes,</hi> they cannot possiblie be cnumo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>icated, transferred, or

whereunto there is giuen a <hi>forme</hi> conuenient, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:25312:85"/>
of the thing it selfe. And therefore if <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> be
(at any time) essentially <hi>transformed</hi> into men: then do they
foorthwith cease (for that time) to be <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels,</hi> and

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>I will further explaine it thus. If there be any such essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>transforming</hi> of <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> into men, as your selfe
doth imagine: then vndoubtedly, that selfe same essentiall
<hi>transformation,</hi> it is, either according to the <hi>body alone,</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soule together.</hi> If, according to the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
alone,</hi> then that selfe same <hi>transformed body,</hi> it should (at
one, and the selfe same time) become, both the <hi>body</hi> of a man,
and the <hi>body</hi> of a <hi>diuell:</hi> which were to to absurde to imagine.
If, according to the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soule together,</hi> then either the
whole man (both <hi>body &amp; soule</hi>) must be essentially <hi>transformed</hi>
into the very <hi>essence</hi> and nature of a <hi>diuell:</hi> or, the <hi>diuell,</hi> he
must needes be essentially <hi>transformed</hi> into the very naturall
<hi>body</hi> and <hi>soule</hi> of a man at the least, which none but mad-men
will euer affirme. Againe, if that essentiall <hi>transformation</hi> be
effected according to the <hi>body alone,</hi> then, howsoeuer that
selfe same <hi>body</hi> be not (for the present) the <hi>body</hi> of a man, but
is wholy <hi>transformed</hi> into the very <hi>essence</hi> and nature of a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell:</hi>
yet, the <hi>soule</hi> of that man must either be forced to forsake
his owne <hi>body,</hi> and so bring present death to the <hi>body</hi> it selfe,
because <hi>death,</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>dissolution of soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die;</hi>
or else, the same <hi>soule,</hi> it must necessarily passe from out
of it owne <hi>body,</hi> into the very <hi>essence</hi> of a <hi>diuell,</hi> and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
there must needes be a meere <hi>confusion</hi> of spirituall
substances: or, two <hi>essentiall formes</hi> in one and the selfe same
<hi>body</hi> at once,<note place="margin">

the <hi>Apostles maine scope</hi> concerning that <hi>scripture:</hi> which was,
to display the crafty preposterous packings of those <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite

into publike contempt among the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> And this they
endeuoured to do, by preaching freely among the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
without any maintenance at all. Entending thereby (if <hi>Paul</hi>

them) either to weary him out quite for want of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:

a maintenance from them, for the necessary supplie

                  <note place="margin">Act. 20. 34.</note>

<hi>produced</hi> in an <hi>vnorderly course of nature</hi> it selfe. Howbeit,
<hi>miracles</hi> you may at no hand auouch them to be: because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>sorcerer</hi> not <hi>diuell</hi> could euer worke <hi>miracles.</hi> And, euen
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25312:89"/>
in that very point also appeered the difference betweene
<hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>serpent,</hi> and theirs: it being <hi>supernaturally</hi> effected
by the miraculous power of <hi>God:</hi> theirs being <hi>subtilly</hi> exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some craftie <hi>legerdemaine</hi> betweene them, and the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</hi>
Neither yet may you iustly affirme them any <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in nature.</hi> For then (howsoeuer <hi>nature</hi> her selfe had
failed in <hi>producing</hi> the worke) they should yet haue had in
them naturally, their <hi>true matter and forme</hi> of true natural <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi>
which they neuer had: and therefore no <hi>monsters</hi> at all
in <hi>nature.</hi> So then, sith those your supposed <hi>serpents</hi> could not
possiblie be <hi>true serpents</hi> indeed, neither by any <hi>orderly nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly

<hi>serpents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de trinit, lib. 3.</note> by any <hi>supernaturall skill</hi> whatsoeuer. Because, <hi>a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
substance</hi> (such as true <hi>serpents</hi> are) <hi>was neuer at any time
so much subiected vnder the power of the diuell, as that he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
able (of himselfe) to transpose the said corporall matter to
any true naturall forme: no surely, such an absolute power is onely,
and altogither reserued to God.</hi> That the <hi>diuell</hi> himselfe hath no
such <hi>supernaturall power,</hi> I prooue it thus. In all such <hi>naturall
bodies</hi> as are <hi>compounded</hi> of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> neither is the
<hi>matter</hi> by it selfe, nor the <hi>forme</hi> by it selfe, but the whole <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
is wholie <hi>formed</hi> togither: and therefore, <hi>the whole is
whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e transformed into the whole.</hi> As for example, the whole
<hi>aire</hi> is whollie made <hi>fire:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philosophus in libro de gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione.</note> so soone as the said <hi>airs</hi> is conuerted
to <hi>fire.</hi> Besides that, the <hi>effect</hi> is euermore like to the <hi>agent,</hi>
and in that selfesame <hi>agent,</hi> doth effectually <hi>preexist</hi> at the
least. And therefore a <hi>naturall bodie</hi> compounded of <hi>true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and forme,</hi> cannot possibly be produced, but by such an
<hi>agent,</hi> as is, either it selfe <hi>compounded</hi> of the selfesame <hi>matter</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:25312:90"/>
and <hi>forme:</hi> or hath otherwaies, that whole <hi>composition</hi> in his
owne proper <hi>power.</hi> But, a <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Diuel</hi> is only a <hi>simple forme,</hi>
not hauing in himselfe,<note place="margin">Lucas Lassius, in Euangelia dominicalia, fol. 505.</note> any <hi>material</hi> part of such a <hi>bodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
neither hath he (at any hand) the same in his proper
<hi>power:</hi> for, the <hi>Lord</hi> only, and he alone hath an absolute abilitie
of <hi>producing</hi> such <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme.</hi> And therefore, by any ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>Diuel</hi> there cannot possibly be <hi>formed</hi> any such a
<hi>natural bodie</hi> as is <hi>compounded</hi> of <hi>true matter and forme:</hi> no, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
euery thing in <hi>nature,</hi> continued entire and sound. But
the <hi>essential transforming</hi> of a <hi>rod,</hi> into a very <hi>true serpent,</hi> doth
implicatiuely include an <hi>essential bodie compounded of true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and forme by a natural production:</hi> and therefore, impossible
the same should be truly accomplished by any <hi>operation</hi> of the
<hi>Diuel</hi> whatsoeuer. And so by <hi>consequence,</hi> those your supposed
<hi>serpents compounded of rods,</hi> they are (in deede and in truth) no
<hi>true serpents</hi> at all, but sleights of <hi>legerdemaine.</hi>

               <p>I doe freely confesse there might (at that present) be seene

the very point it selfe, that we <hi>argue</hi> vpon. Those <hi>rods</hi> I say,
were not <hi>essentially</hi> changed into true naturall <hi>serpents:</hi> but
onely they seemed such in an outward <hi>appeerance.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, such an <hi>appeerance</hi> might easily be performed of <hi>Satan,</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:25312:90"/>
by sundry meanes. First,<note place="margin">Philosophus de anima, lib. 2.</note> because (notwithstanding the present
remoouing of <hi>sensible things,</hi> there might still remaine <hi>phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>
and <hi>imaginations</hi> within the head) it may be, that the very
<hi>sensible</hi> and earnest beholding of <hi>Aaron</hi> his <hi>rod,</hi> essentially
<hi>transformed</hi> to a <hi>serpent</hi> before, did (by reason of the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes) take in the beholders so deepe an impression, as that
thereby only (through some <hi>locall motion</hi> of <hi>sensible</hi> things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in the <hi>imaginatiue facultie,</hi> together with the <hi>humours</hi>
themselues wherein they were seated as in their proper <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect</hi>) there might still be existing in <hi>phantasie,</hi> a very liuely <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peerance</hi>
of some such <hi>bodily substance</hi> as was not subsisting in
<hi>nature</hi> at all. For, much blood descending before into the <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue</hi>
facultie,<note place="margin">Philosophus in lib. de som. &amp; rigil.</note> there descends withall, many <hi>imagined formes,</hi>
whereby there is forthwith procured a very liuely <hi>resemblance</hi>
of some such things as are not existing at all. By this meanes
therefore (there being beforehand procured a <hi>commotion</hi> of
<hi>humours,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hyperius, in method, theolog, lib. 2. pag. 311.</note> as well in the <hi>interiour,</hi> as <hi>exteriour senses</hi> of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders) the <hi>Diuel</hi> might both inwardly and outwardly also,
applie certaine apparant <hi>formes</hi> to the very <hi>organons</hi> of all the
<hi>senses;</hi> euen as effectually, as if they had risen only from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>sensible obiects:</hi> and (by such a <hi>legerdemaine</hi>) might cause
the <hi>sorcerers rods</hi> to seeme in <hi>appeerance,</hi> as though they had
beene <hi>true serpents</hi> in deede. A notable experiment of such
deceiuing of <hi>senses,</hi> may fitly be found forth in a <hi>candle</hi> of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
grease:</hi> which (all the while it be burning alone in the
night) will cause all the <hi>russhes</hi> strawed in the <hi>parlour,</hi> to seeme
as if they were <hi>crawling snakes.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycanthropus.</speaker>
               <p>It is incredible, that the <hi>external senses</hi> of all the beholders,
should (by any such <hi>legerdemaine</hi> of the <hi>Diuel</hi>) haue beene so

            <sp>

               <p>Why not they, as well as the <hi>senses</hi> of all in the <hi>parlour</hi>
aforesaid? Secondly, the <hi>diuel</hi> might not onely delude them
thus by some false resemblance of <hi>serpents:</hi> but might giue
them withall, an <hi>appearance</hi> of true <hi>serpents</hi> in deed. For,<note place="margin">Lyra in 1. Sanm cap. 16. 23.</note> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
a <hi>corporall matter</hi> is not so freely and so fully subiected
to the power of the <hi>diuel,</hi> as that he either may, or can possibly
<hi>transforme</hi> the same to some other <hi>forme</hi> from that which <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially</hi>
it is of it selfe: yet notwithstanding, such a <hi>corporall

matter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Magister sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. lib. 2. dist. 7. fol. 87.</note> both may be, and is also so farfoorth in the power of
the <hi>diuel</hi> as appertaines to a <hi>local motion,</hi> this al men do hold.
And therefore,<note place="margin">M. Perkins in his order of the causes, 2. com. pag. 80.</note> the <hi>diuels</hi> (by their owne proper power, and
without any perceiuance at all to humane sense) they might
(through some such <hi>local motion</hi>) take away with a trice, the
<hi>sorcerers rods</hi> from the ground: and put in their place true
<hi>naturall serpents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hyperius, in method. theolog. lib. 2. pag. 310.</note> taken by them from else where. And, this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
they might doe in a moment: through the agility
and nimblenesse of their owne proper <hi>nature.</hi> For, euen as the
<hi>mind</hi> of a man (it being a spirituall substance) can easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
her <hi>animall operations,</hi> and as it were with a thought:
so surely, the <hi>diuel</hi> (he being also a <hi>spirituall essence</hi>) he is able

               <p>As though the <hi>diuels</hi> (so couertly, and with such vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

               <p>The <hi>diuel</hi> (you know) he is an <hi>inuisible creature.</hi> Besides
that, this we see plaine in our owne experience, that a <hi>Iuggler</hi>
(by meanes of such <hi>local motion,</hi> and through the nimble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiance
of his onely hand) he can so sleightly, and so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conuey one thing in place of another, as the beholders
themselues, they do not onely not perceiue the <hi>legerdemaine:</hi>
but (which more is) they are vndoubtedly perswaded, that
the <hi>Iuggler,</hi> he hath <hi>essentially transformed</hi> the first <hi>matter</hi> in
sight, into some other <hi>substantiall forme.</hi> Now then, if a meere
<hi>mortalman</hi> (by the onely nimblenesse of hand) can so easily
effect such admirable <hi>matters:</hi> why should we imagine the
same impossible for <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels?</hi>

                  <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> (being naturally nimble and swift,

apply some <hi>naturall matter,</hi> preexisting in a neere disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>forme</hi> of true <hi>serpents,</hi> and withall (subiecting the

engender true <hi>naturall serpents,</hi> and vnperceiueably put them

<hi>persons,</hi> as the onely fitte <hi>instruments</hi> of that his <hi>diuine,</hi> and
<hi>supernaturall power.</hi> Nowe then, this <hi>power of obedience,</hi> albeit
the same doth not <hi>ordinarily</hi> attend vpon the pleasure and
becke of <hi>men</hi> or of <hi>diuels:</hi> yet, the <hi>diuels</hi> vndoubtedly they
had at that present (by some secret priuiledge from God) the
<hi>extraordinarie</hi> assistance also thereof, in those selfesame <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi>
of true naturall <hi>serpents.</hi> Yea, and this also according

his hart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 7. 13.</note> and so made a passage to the timely execution

               <p>Notwithstanding these two presupposed <hi>powers</hi> assisting
the <hi>diuell</hi> in those your supposed <hi>appearances,</hi> me thinke it is
cleere by the <hi>text</hi> it selfe, that the <hi>Sorcerersrods</hi> were truelie
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:25312:92"/>
                  <hi>transformed</hi> to <hi>serpents:</hi> and I argue it thus. If those <hi>rods</hi> were
no true <hi>serpents,</hi> but serpents onely in an outward <hi>appearance,</hi>
then is not that true which is set downe in the <hi>text:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 7. 12.</note> namelie,
that the <hi>sorcerers, Likewise they cast downe their roddes, and they
were turned into serpents.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>I answere you thus. It is vndoubtedly true whatsoeuer is set
downe in the <hi>text:</hi> and may verie well stand with that which
I say. For, be it it supposed, the <hi>Sorcerersrods</hi> were turned (as
you say) into <hi>serpents,</hi> yet were they not truely so turned; I
meane, they were not <hi>existingly,</hi> but <hi>appearingly turned into ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</hi>
And this <hi>distinction</hi> is verie fully borne foorth by other
words in the <hi>text;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 7. 11.</note> which affirme, that <hi>the Egyptian Sorcerers
they did (in like maner) by their enchantments.</hi> Where you may
plainely perceiue the <hi>particle</hi> of (<hi>likenes</hi>) purposely put down,
to set foorth the difference: as if he should say, the <hi>Sorcerers</hi>
they did the very like in <hi>shewe,</hi> although not <hi>in substance.</hi> For
marke I beseech you: there is in that <hi>text,</hi> both the <hi>maner</hi>
and <hi>meanes</hi> of their working, precisely put downe. The <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of their working, was by a <hi>likenes of serpents</hi> in an onelie
<hi>appearance:</hi> the <hi>meanes</hi> of effecting that worke, was the <hi>Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
inchantments.</hi> From which words of the <hi>text,</hi> I may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thus. A like <hi>cause</hi> argueth a like <hi>effect.</hi> But the <hi>Sorcerers
inchantments</hi> (which are altogither deceiueable, false, and
standing onely in outward <hi>appearance</hi>) were the very <hi>efficient
cause</hi> of that <hi>likenes:</hi> therefore, the <hi>effect,</hi> I meane, that <hi>likenes</hi>
it selfe, must needs be deceiueable, false, and onely exist in an
outward <hi>appearance.</hi> Thus then, the <hi>case</hi> it selfe being (by all
the <hi>premisses</hi>) apparantly euident: I will now returne at the
last, to answere your maine or principall <hi>argument,</hi> which was
this in effect. <hi>Satan</hi> (by the <hi>Egyptian Sorcerers) transformed
rods</hi> into <hi>serpents:</hi> therefore, he is much more able to doe the
same by himselfe. This (I must tell you) is a false and deceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>argument,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Petere prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium.</note> For first, in your <hi>antecedent</hi> you do shamefullie
<hi>begge the cause in question</hi> before it be prooued: and now, when
it comes to the triall, it is not able to holde the hammering.
Againe, your <hi>consequent</hi> also is false, for, therein you do make
the <hi>diuell</hi> a verie free and absolute <hi>agent,</hi> in <hi>transforming of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
as well without, as with <hi>meanes</hi> at his pleasure, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is a power peculiar to <hi>God:</hi> whereas the <hi>diuels</hi> can accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:25312:93"/>
nothing in <hi>nature,</hi> but by <hi>naturall causes</hi> and <hi>meanes,</hi> no
more then the <hi>Carpenter</hi> can frame an house without fit <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>instruments</hi> to worke withall. So then, both parts of
your <hi>argument</hi> being apparantly false: you cannot possiblie
conclude from thence, any <hi>power</hi> in the <hi>diuell,</hi> for an essentiall
<hi>transforming of bodies.</hi>

will wilfully insist vpon any <hi>essentiall transformation</hi> in <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chad-nezzer,</hi>
you might with more shew of sense, and better
probabilitie of reason auouch, that he was <hi>transformed</hi> rather
into an <hi>eagle:</hi> both,<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 30.</note> bicause <hi>the haires of his head</hi> (saith the text)
<hi>were growen like to an eagles feathers, and for that also, the very

that <hi>Nebuchad-nezzer</hi> was rather <hi>transformed</hi> into
some <hi>fowle</hi> hauing <hi>feathers</hi> and <hi>clawes:</hi> then, into a <hi>beast</hi> that

that, the binding and keeping of a <hi>madman</hi> close; is so far from
appeasing, as it rather doth aggrauate (for the present) his <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
humour:</hi> and therefore the <hi>courtiers</hi> forbore to bind him
at all. Besides that, they were the more especially loth to be
led to that course, because (by the <hi>reuelation of Daniel</hi>) they
plainely vnderstood before, that, the <hi>lord God</hi> had determined
his wandring abroad with the <hi>beasts</hi> in the field: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:25312:94"/>
they greatly feared to <hi>intercept</hi> the said purpose of <hi>God,</hi>

               <p>But sir, if he was not essentially <hi>transformed</hi> at all, how then
is it possible he should so long lie foorth <hi>naked</hi> in the fields in

                  <note place="margin">Hieron. in Daniel.</note> wee may
find by experience, that many things (in deed) are impossible
to a <hi>sound man:</hi> which yet, to a <hi>furious</hi> or <hi>mad man</hi> are not so
impossible. For, <hi>fury</hi> is such and so headstrong an <hi>humour,</hi> as it
maketh a man to endure and doe many things; which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
he could not possibly endure. As for example many
<hi>madde-men</hi> (we see) are well able to continue in the cold dew
a long time, and to be sustained (that while) with <hi>crude</hi> and
<hi>rawe meates:</hi> seeming also vnto themselues, that they are not
<hi>men,</hi> but <hi>brute beasts</hi> in deed, and thereupon also, they delight
to conuerse with <hi>beasts,</hi> and to grow into familiaritie with
them, although yet, not <hi>essentially transformed</hi> into true <hi>naturall

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>reason</hi> is this. <hi>Furie</hi> hath so highly disordered their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and made their <hi>minds</hi> so beastly affected, as, many things
(in that their <hi>disordered state</hi>) are possible and delectable to
them, which yet (in their <hi>sounder estate</hi>) were nothing so. Euen
as also we see by experience, that verie <hi>coales</hi> or <hi>earth</hi> (to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
women with child) are a verie sweete and delectable <hi>diet,</hi>
which yet (before then) they did loth and abhorre: and all
this, by reason of their <hi>disordered nature</hi> at that instant time.
And, hereupon also it came to passe that <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> did
grow into such familiaritie with <hi>beasts:</hi> namely, euen by reason
of that <hi>likenes of nature,</hi> which (to his owne seeming) he had
with <hi>brute beasts,</hi> in that his <hi>disordered state.</hi> Yea, and this also
is the verie <hi>naturall cause,</hi> why (at that present) he was not
torne and deuoured of <hi>beasts:</hi> euen as also we see by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:25312:95"/>
that <hi>furious dogges,</hi> they doe neuer hurt <hi>mad-men,</hi> nor <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
fooles.</hi> Howbeit, <hi>Nebuchad-nezzer</hi> (in his furious estate
and <hi>melancholike passion</hi>) he was more especially preserued
from the outrage of <hi>beasts,</hi> through a <hi>miraculous</hi> prouidence,
and speciall protection of God: and therefore, his said preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
(in that selfesame respect) the lesse admirable, and
woonderfull to vs. Thus then (the <hi>matter</hi> it selfe, being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly

had beene so <hi>transformed</hi> in deed as your selfe doth imagine:
yet, the <hi>sequel</hi> of your <hi>argument</hi> is vtterly vnsound: because it
stands vpon diuers, or rather contrarie <hi>efficients,</hi> namely <hi>God,</hi>
and the <hi>diuell.</hi> The one hauing of himselfe an <hi>absolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate
power,</hi> and therefore able of himselfe to worke
what he will, where, when, and howsoeuer best pleaseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
and so by <hi>consequence</hi> he might (if it had so seemed good
in his wisedome) haue <hi>essentially transformed Nebuchad-nez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer
into au oxe.</hi> The other (the <hi>diuell</hi> I meane) he hath onely
a <hi>finite and limited power,</hi> and therefore vtterly vnable of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to accomplish any one worke beyond the bounds of that
<hi>power:</hi> and so by <hi>consequence,</hi> he cannot possibly <hi>transforme
himselfe essentially</hi> into any <hi>creature</hi> whatsoeuer, without a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<hi>power</hi> from God. Lastly, your <hi>consequent,</hi> it standeth onely

               <p>Howsoeuer men, by <hi>tradition</hi> had receiued an <hi>errour</hi> hand

folow a multitude to do euill, neither agree in a controuersie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
after many, and ouerthrowe the truth.</hi> And verie certeine I
am, that no one sound <hi>writer,</hi> either <hi>old</hi> or <hi>new is</hi> of your mind:
but rather the contrarie. As for my selfe, I neuer could see any
shew of <hi>reason</hi> tending that way. For the <hi>Lord God,</hi> as he hath
endued <hi>man,</hi> and euery <hi>liuing thing,</hi> with their <hi>proper nature,
substance, forme, constitution, qualities and gifts,</hi> and directeth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:25312:96"/>
their <hi>wils, faculties, and powers</hi> accordingly: so hath he alotted
to <hi>spirituall creatures,</hi> their owne <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>properties</hi> seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
alone to themselues, and appointed them their lawes and
limits, beyond which they cannot possiblie passe the bredth
of an haire. And therefore, as it is absolutely against the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God,</hi> that I should flie like a <hi>bird,</hi> or swim like a <hi>fish,</hi> or
creepe like a <hi>worme,</hi> or become another <hi>creature in forme,</hi> to
that which by nature I am, insomuch, as if <hi>God</hi> would giue me
leaue, I could not possiblie do it, for it were flat contrarie to
his owne <hi>ordinance</hi> and <hi>decree,</hi> yea, and euen opposite to the
<hi>naturall constitution</hi> of that <hi>bodie</hi> which he hath created and
giuen me: so is it vndoubtedly incredible, that either a <hi>diuell</hi>
should be <hi>essentially transformed</hi> into a <hi>man,</hi> or a <hi>man substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
turned</hi> into a <hi>diuell,</hi> or that either of both, should <hi>reallie
change</hi> themselues into any other <hi>nature, substance, forme, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
qualitie</hi> or <hi>gift,</hi> then those verie same which they haue
by <hi>creation,</hi> yea, or that they should possiblie <hi>applie</hi> those
which they haue, to any other end or vse then that which <hi>God</hi>
himselfe naturally decreed, and directeth them vnto. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
either <hi>God</hi> should be contrarie to himselfe which is farre
from him: or else those things must needs be <hi>supernaturall,</hi> and
so, a true <hi>miracle</hi> in whom soeuer. Neither yet is <hi>Gods omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie</hi>
hereby qualified: but the <hi>diuell</hi> his <hi>impotencie</hi> is rather
manifested, and more liuely declared. Who hath no further
<hi>power</hi> then that which <hi>God</hi> from the beginning hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto him: and the same also consonant to his owne <hi>nature</hi>
and <hi>substance.</hi> The <hi>diuell</hi> (I confesse) may well be restrained
from his <hi>naturall faculties, power,</hi> and <hi>will:</hi> but (being <hi>Gods</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister)
beyond the same he cannot possiblie passe the bredth
of a pinne, neither yet any other waies, or further imploie his
endeuour, then onely in that verie worke which the <hi>Lord</hi>
(from the beginning) hath enabled him to do. Which is, that
he (being himselfe a <hi>spirit</hi>) may <hi>vitiate</hi> and corrupt the <hi>spirit</hi>
of man, and therein also he is diligent enough: howbeit for
the <hi>doing</hi> heereof, he cannot substantially <hi>alter</hi> his <hi>forme</hi> at all.</p>

or <hi>diuell:</hi> and not rather the <hi>Legerdemaine</hi> of some <hi>coniuring

transforme</hi> himselfe into the likenes, figure, or shape
of a <hi>man,</hi> a <hi>dogge,</hi> a <hi>catte,</hi> a <hi>mouse,</hi> or a <hi>toade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

into the likenes, figure, or shape of a <hi>diuell,</hi> sith there is a like
reason and possibilitie of both? Howbeit, we may not beleeue
(saith <hi>Augustine) that,</hi>

                  <hi>a mans bodie can (by any Arte or power of
the diuell) be transformed into the lineaments of a beast: much
lesse into the forme or substance of any infernall diuell.</hi> Besides
<hi>that,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Item, in libro de spiritu &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, cap. 26.</note> if <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> may possiblie <hi>transforme</hi> themselues

                  <hi>and put thy finger into my hands, and thrust thy

truely soeuer deliuered by <hi>Christ</hi>) could neuer (in truth) haue
satisfied <hi>Thomas</hi> concerning the <hi>resurrection of Christ:</hi> if it be
true in deed that <hi>diuels</hi> can truely <hi>transforme</hi> themselues into

boldly haue answered thus, oh sir? why doe you will me to
handle your hands and sides? that is no certeine <hi>argument,</hi> to
demonstrate vnto me your rising againe from the dead. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> (you know) they can truely <hi>transforme</hi>

the <hi>power of spirits</hi> aud <hi>diuels</hi>) you spake of a twofold <hi>posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
the one <hi>reall,</hi> the other <hi>actuall.</hi> The first you haue fully
confuted: notwithstanding any thing spoken to the contrary.
Howbeit, of the other, the <hi>question is</hi> ordinary in euery mans
mouth: and therefore, I pray you hartely shew vs your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
also therein.</p>

               <p>I here of none that make any doubt of <hi>actuall possession:</hi> yea,
and the <hi>Exorcist</hi> also who cast out the <hi>diuel</hi> at <hi>Magnitton</hi>
(howsoeuer he faggeth with me now,<note place="margin">M. Dorel in the title to his Apologie.</note> concerning his first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite

mannage that matter; so it haleth vs perforce to follow your

craue a larger discourse then the present time will afoord: es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,

               <p>The actuall possession, is that effectuall working power, wherewith
the diuels (by an operatiue permission of God) doe extraordinarily,
and in most woonderfull manner afflict, molest, torment, and vexe
some speciall persons (in a speciall iudgement of God) put ouer vnto
them, for that speciall purpose. <hi>Wherein, we haue first to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
the</hi> primarie efficient cause: <hi>namely, the speciall</hi> purpose
and iudgement of God. <hi>Then next, the</hi> secondary efficient cause: <hi>I
meane, the effectuall</hi> working power <hi>of the</hi> diuell. <hi>Thirdly the</hi>
materiall cause: <hi>that is to say, the</hi> affliction, <hi>the</hi> torment, <hi>and</hi>
vexation <hi>it selfe. Fourthly, the</hi> formall cause: <hi>namely, an</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
manner of working. <hi>And lastly, the</hi> finall cause: <hi>I
meane, some speciall</hi> purpose of God, <hi>best knowen to his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>

               <p>How manifold I pray you, is this <hi>actuall possession?</hi>

            <sp>

or inherently <hi>dwel</hi> in the possessed mans <hi>minde,</hi> which
we denied before, when we conferred of the <hi>real-mentall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session:</hi>

               <p>Seeing you stand with such a setled pertinacie in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
conceit, I doe argue against you a fresh on this sort:</p>
               <p>The <hi>extraordinarie power</hi> of <hi>casting out diuels,</hi> was peculiarly
appropriated to Christ himselfe, and his owne <hi>disciples:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the said <hi>extraordinarie power</hi> doth not ordinarily apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to any <hi>ordinarie ministerie</hi> succeeding that <hi>primitiue age.</hi>
And, if no extraordinarie power for expelling the <hi>actuall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of diuels</hi> remayneth perpetuall: then, neither the <hi>actuall
possession</hi> it selfe remaineth perpetuall.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>But, why should that <hi>extraordinarie power</hi> be peculiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to Christ himselfe, and his owne <hi>disciples?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Because the verie <hi>maine endes</hi> of euerie such <hi>extraordinarie

            <sp>

               <p>I perceiue no such inference thence: for this I suppose, is
your <hi>argument. Iustinus Martyr, Cyprian, Tertullian, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
the Councell of Bracha, and Ecclesiasticall histories</hi> doe all
iointly auouch the <hi>continuance of miracles</hi> for eight hundred
yeeres after <hi>Christ</hi> at the least: therefore the <hi>actuall possession</hi>
also of <hi>diuels,</hi> so long time <hi>continued in vse.</hi> This, as it foloweth
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:25312:105"/>
faire and farre of: so surely, it makes nothing at all for that
<hi>actuall possession</hi> which you plead for your selfe, sixteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres since the comming of <hi>Christ.</hi> No surely, it doth
rather conclude a <hi>finall determination</hi> thereof, aboue eight
hundred yeeres past at the least. But be it, that the <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
also of <hi>actuall possession</hi> were iointly auouched by euerie of
them for eight hundred yeeres after <hi>Christ:</hi> yet this, as it
makes nothing (I saie) for the <hi>possession</hi> impleaded by you: so
are we not necessarilie bound to beleeue whatsoeuer they
write concerning such matters, we hauing both <hi>scriptures</hi> and
probable <hi>reasons</hi> impugning the same. Againe, howsoeuer <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus,
Tertulian, Cyprian, Augustine, the Councell of Bracha,</hi>
and <hi>Ecclesiasticall histories</hi> do all iointly auouch the <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of actuall possession</hi> in those times and places wherein they
conuersed: yet no one of them all (how holie or gracious so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer)
do chalenge such <hi>extraordinarie power</hi> to themselues, or
once write that they <hi>dispossessed satan</hi> of any one person by
him <hi>possessed.</hi> And therefore they might be deceiued by some
false supposall of an <hi>actuall possession</hi> pretended by others: and
so (by consequence) that which they write concerning those
matters, is of so much the lesse credit, by how much especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
there haue in euerie age of the <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">D. Fulke to the Rhemish testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Marc. 13. 22. sect. 3.</note> some seducers
sprung vp, who (for gaine or glorie) pretending a <hi>special power</hi>
from aboue, for the <hi>dispossessing of diuels,</hi> both might and did
also therein deceiue the wisest of iudgement. Briefly, we are
therein to beleeue their <hi>writings</hi> the lesse: because there be
sundrie sorts of <hi>diseases</hi> in men now adaies, so like to the <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
possession of diuels,</hi> as verie fewe or none can hardly discerne
the one from the other. Which falling foorth likewise in those

strange imagination of some <hi>actuall possession:</hi> there being in
truth no such thing at all.</p>

               <p>Touching any thing hitherto heard I do I assure you. And,
for a further confirmation I argue it further thus. If an <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
power</hi> for driuing foorth <hi>diuels</hi> be now giuen to any
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:25312:105"/>
in these <hi>daies of the Gospel,</hi> the <hi>parties</hi> then who <hi>challenge such
power,</hi> they must as directly declare that their speciall <hi>donation</hi>
by some peculiar priuiledge from <hi>God,</hi> as did the <hi>disciples of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ:</hi> My meaning is, that whosoeuer will <hi>challenge</hi> to
themselues any <hi>extraordinary power</hi> for the working of <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
they must first <hi>testify</hi> that <hi>power</hi> by their <hi>extraordinary gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in preaching the gospel,</hi> they themselues being before but
<hi>vnlettered men:</hi> and they must also be able, euen as <hi>authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
to auouch for infallible truth whatsoeuer they preach, as
were the <hi>disciples</hi> themselues, vpon whom was bestowed espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that <hi>peculiar commission,</hi> with <hi>extraordinary graces</hi> and
powers to accomplish the same. Otherwise we may shrewdly
suspect some <hi>legerdemaine</hi> in pretending any <hi>extraordinary
seale:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 45. 1.</note> where the <hi>toong</hi> is not extraordinarily appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

of <hi>God:</hi> therefore, the <hi>actuall possession of diuels</hi> (comprehended

<hi>continued</hi> in the <hi>church of God.</hi>

               <p>I answere your <hi>antecedent</hi> thus. <hi>Deafenesse, dumbnesse, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
and such like, they are not still <hi>continued</hi> in the <hi>church,</hi> as
things <hi>actually effected</hi> by any <hi>extraordinary power</hi> of the <hi>diuel,</hi>
but as <hi>matters naturally arising in men,</hi> by reason of some <hi>defect</hi>
or <hi>redundancy in nature,</hi> or otherwaies, by meanes of some <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
humours,</hi> and such like <hi>vnnaturall accidents.</hi> Howbeit,
the <hi>actuall possession</hi> we speake of, is no <hi>matter naturally arising
in men,</hi> but a <hi>malady</hi> rather, that is <hi>actually,</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi>
wrought by the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>diuel</hi> himselfe. And therefore, this
(you see) is no sound <hi>consequent vz. Infirmities</hi> naturally ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in men, are still of <hi>continuance</hi> in the <hi>church:</hi> therefore, the
<hi>actuall possession of diuels,</hi> is still of <hi>continuance</hi> also. Here is no
<hi>sequel</hi> at all. For, the one, I meane those <hi>naturall infirmities,</hi>
they are but <hi>ordinary matters:</hi> the other, that is, the <hi>actuall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of diuels,</hi> was an <hi>extraordinary malady,</hi> and had an <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
power</hi> to repell the same.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>Sith you acknowledge the <hi>continuance</hi> of all saue onely that
of <hi>actuall possession:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Paul his doctrine, pag. 31.</note> there can be no <hi>question</hi> of the continuance
also thereof, and I prooue it thus. If <hi>deafenes, dumbenes, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
and such like (being euerie of them in <hi>Christes time,</hi> the
<hi>principall matter</hi> whereupon the <hi>miraculous faith</hi> did worke)
are yet <hi>ordinarie diseases continued</hi> still in these daies of the
<hi>Gospell,</hi> and are onely <hi>now cured by Physicke,</hi> as by an <hi>ordinarie
and naturall meanes</hi> appointed of <hi>God:</hi> then, the <hi>actuall passessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of diuels</hi> (it being also in <hi>Christ</hi> his time, one <hi>principall matter</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:25312:106"/>
for the <hi>miraculous faith</hi> to worke vpon) it also is now an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
infirmitie continued</hi> still in these daies of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and is
only now to be <hi>cured by fasting and praier,</hi> as by an only <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and naturall meanes</hi> appointed of <hi>God.</hi> But, the <hi>first</hi> is true
in all <hi>experience:</hi> and therefore also the <hi>latter.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Albeit I should grant you the truth of the <hi>first</hi> in all <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>
yet, your <hi>consequent</hi> concluded thence, hath in it no <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of truth,</hi> but is vndoubtedly an <hi>extrauagant</hi> and roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
conceite, nothing <hi>concludent in reason,</hi> but beyond the
bounds and limits thereof. For, howsoeuer <hi>deafenes, dumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
blindenes,</hi> and such other <hi>occurrents in nature,</hi> be euerie of
them <hi>ordinarie and naturall diseases,</hi> and are commonly cured
by ordinarie medicines and other <hi>Physicall helpes,</hi> as by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
and <hi>naturall remedies</hi> appointed of <hi>God:</hi> the <hi>actuall
possession of diuels</hi> neuer was, nor is now any <hi>ordinarie</hi> or <hi>natural
infirmitie,</hi> but an <hi>extraordinarie torment, actually</hi> inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some, by the <hi>extraordinarie power</hi> of the <hi>diuel,</hi> and therefore
neuer yet was nor is now anie waies curable by <hi>ordinarie</hi> or
<hi>naturall meanes,</hi> but, by an <hi>extraordinarie and supernaturall
worke of God.</hi> So then, howsoeuer your selfe would seeme to
make the <hi>actuall possession of diuels</hi> (in these daies of the <hi>Gospel</hi>)
but an ordinarie, or <hi>naturall disease,</hi> and the supposed cure
thereof by <hi>fasting and praier,</hi> to be now but an <hi>ordinarie</hi> and
<hi>naturall remedie,</hi> perpetually establisht by <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Church:</hi>
yet in verie deed and in truth, the <hi>disease</hi> it selfe, and the <hi>cure</hi>
also thereof by such meanes effected, are both of them <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
and supernaturall matters,</hi> and so by <hi>consequence,</hi> a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi>
surmounting the compasse of all ordinarie and <hi>naturall
causes.</hi> Vnlesse haplie you imagine that the <hi>fasting and praiers</hi>
performed by <hi>Exorcistes,</hi> are meere <hi>naturall matters,</hi> and haue
in them naturally, some secret <hi>naturall vigour,</hi> naturally
auaileable for the timely expelling of <hi>actuall possessions:</hi> euen
as herbes, and <hi>physicall confections</hi> haue naturally in them such
a <hi>naturall operation,</hi> as verie fitly accordeth to the timely <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
of <hi>naturall infirmites.</hi> Howbeit, pretermitting the further
<hi>discourse</hi> of this point, till we come to handle the <hi>power of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessing
the diuell:</hi> do now <hi>obiect</hi> what you can for the matter
in <hi>question,</hi> or, giue me leaue to proceed in the rest.</p>

               <p>Wel then, against the continuance of <hi>actuall possession</hi> I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
further thus. Whatsoeuer in it selfe is <hi>perpetually existing,</hi>
that also in it selfe is <hi>ordinarie and continually working.</hi> But the
<hi>actuall possession of diuels</hi> (in these daies of the <hi>Gospell</hi>) is in it
selfe neither <hi>ordinarie</hi> nor <hi>continually working:</hi> therefore, the
<hi>actuall possession of diuels</hi> (in these daies of the <hi>Gospell</hi>) is in it

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>I denie your <hi>proposition.</hi> Because something may be <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
existing:</hi> which yet is neither <hi>ordinarie nor continuallie
working:</hi> euen as we see by experience, that the <hi>brightnes and
heate of the Sunne</hi> (though the <hi>Sunne</hi> it selfe be <hi>perpetuallie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting</hi>)
yet, neither is the <hi>heate</hi> thereof <hi>ordinarie,</hi> nor the <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
continually working.</hi> Not at such times especially as there
is an <hi>interposition</hi> of <hi>cloudes</hi> betweene the said <hi>Sunne</hi> and the
<hi>earth:</hi> or when he which withdraweth his force from this our
<hi>Horizon,</hi> and maketh his <hi>progresse</hi> among the <hi>Antipodes.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>How certeinly, or vncerteinly soeuer the <hi>Sunne</hi> may be said
to <hi>continue</hi> his appointed <hi>progresse,</hi> very certeine I am, that the
man who endeuoureth to folow your footings at euery turne,
shalbe sure to finish his owne <hi>progresse</hi> in an endlesse <hi>laborinth.</hi>
For, how should the <hi>actuall possession of diuels</hi> by possibly <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi>
and not be <hi>ordinary</hi> in it selfe, nor <hi>continually working?</hi> Sith
that which is <hi>perpetually existing,</hi> must needes in it selfe, be <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi>
and <hi>continually effecting</hi> some manner of worke. Besides
that, you your owne selfe (euen in your last answere but one)
did confidently conclude the <hi>actuall possession of diuels,</hi> to be
none other thing now, but an <hi>ordinary infirmity,</hi> very ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inflicted vpon the <hi>church:</hi> and the <hi>cure</hi> also thereof, is to be
<hi>ordinarily effected by fasting and praier,</hi> as by the <hi>ordinary meanes
appointed of God.</hi> Vpon which your assertion, I framed this my
last <hi>argument</hi> against the <hi>perpetuitie of actuall possession:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
you doe now verie impudently opposse your selfe, by
denying the very point you propounded before. Giuing vs
thereby to vnderstand by the way, that (howsoeuer you want
a <hi>liers memorie</hi>) your <hi>toong</hi> would be lauish enough: if your
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:25312:107"/>
                  <hi>teeth</hi> would but giue it the scope, to be ranging abroade.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>I onely opposed my selfe to your <hi>maior proposition,</hi> and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
our present <hi>question,</hi> concerning the <hi>perpetuitie of actuall
possession</hi>) I did further <hi>demonstrate</hi> the matter, by giuing a fitte
<hi>instance,</hi> borrowed from the brightnes and heat of the <hi>sunne.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>A verie fitte <hi>instance</hi> in deed. For, euen by that selfesame
<hi>instance</hi> wherewith your selfe would <hi>demonstrate</hi> your matter:
I my selfe doe also entend to <hi>remonstrate</hi> the truth of my <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Whereas therefore you doe freely acknowledge, that
the <hi>actuall possession of diuels</hi> may (in deed) be <hi>perpetually exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,</hi>
but yet, neither <hi>ordinarie,</hi> nor <hi>continually working:</hi> giuing
vs also an <hi>experimentall demonstration</hi> thereof (as you imagine)
from the materiall <hi>sunne,</hi> which, howsoeuer the same in it selfe
be <hi>perpetually existing,</hi> yet, neither is the heat thereof <hi>ordinarie,</hi>
nor the <hi>brightnes continually shining.</hi> Mine answere is, that,
euen as by taking <hi>brightnes</hi> and heat from the <hi>sunne,</hi> you doe
(in effect) denie the <hi>sunne</hi> it selfe to be <hi>perpetually existing,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
heat and brightnes are <hi>essentiall qualities inseparably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent,
and perpetually knit with the sunne:</hi> so surely, by denying
the <hi>ordinarie and continuall working of actuall possession,</hi> you doe
consequently conclude, that euen the <hi>actuall possession</hi> it selfe
is not <hi>perpetually existing.</hi> Because the <hi>actuall possession</hi> of <hi>diuels,</hi>
all the while it is an <hi>actuall possession</hi> in any <hi>existence:</hi> so long (at
the least) the same must needs (in it selfe) be <hi>ordinarie,</hi> and wil
effectually performe some <hi>actuall experiment.</hi> Otherwaies,
how may that be truely termed an <hi>actuall possession,</hi> which doth
not <hi>agere aliquid:</hi> not accomplish (I meane) some one <hi>act</hi> or
other. Notwithstanding all this, you labour to vphold the
likelyhood of this your imagined <hi>instance,</hi> by two speciall <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
the one taken from an <hi>interposition of cloudes,</hi> the other
from the <hi>sunne</hi> his conuersing among the <hi>antipodes.</hi> To what
purpose these <hi>cautions</hi> should serue, I perceiue not as yet, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
(as it seemes by the purporte of your speech) you would
giue vs a watchword, &amp; thereby illustrate vnto vs: that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the <hi>actuall possession of diuels</hi> be in it owne selfe <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
existing,</hi> yet, the same is (<hi>in effect</hi>) neither <hi>ordinary,</hi> nor <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
working.</hi> And why so I beseech you? Because the <hi>diuell</hi>
(forsooth) at some one time or other, may happily be playing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:25312:108"/>
bo-peepe with the partie behinde a <hi>couerled:</hi> or may bid vs
here in <hi>England</hi> farewell for a season, while he goe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
among the <hi>Cannibals.</hi> Howbeit, vnlesse you be able di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to <hi>demonstrate</hi> vnto vs, that there may be some odde
time or other wherein the <hi>sunne</hi> it selfe, neither in this our <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rîzon,</hi>
nor among the <hi>antipodes</hi> hath his ordinarie course, or is
<hi>continually shining:</hi> doe pardon vs (I pray you) though we (in
the meane while) begin to imagine, that your <hi>wits</hi> (by roauing
at random among the <hi>antipodes</hi>) be turned <hi>topsie-turuie,</hi> and
permit vs withall to conclude as before, that, because the <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
possession of diuels</hi> is in it selfe, neither <hi>ordinarie,</hi> nor <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
working,</hi> therefore the same in it selfe is not <hi>perpetually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>My meaning is, that, if <hi>actuall possession</hi> (as the <hi>Exorcist</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth)
be now in these daies of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> an <hi>infirmitie</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<hi>perpetually</hi> vpon the <hi>Church,</hi> as are also those other <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases</hi>
contained iointly with it in one and the same <hi>commission:</hi>
the same vndoubtedly (as are all the rest) woulde be much
more <hi>ordinarie</hi> with vs then now it is. I meane, it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
more frequent and often, at manie moe <hi>times,</hi> in manie
moe <hi>places,</hi> and among manie moe <hi>persons</hi> then we see it to be.
Yea, and it would vndoubtedly, be so much more <hi>ordinarie</hi>
then anie of the rest:<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 7. &amp; 2. 2. 1. Pet. 5. 8.</note> by how much more malitiously the <hi>diuel
compasseth the earth, and goeth continually about, seeking whom to
deuour.</hi> Whereas the <hi>actuall possession</hi> which <hi>Exorcistes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth,
is a thing (now a daies) so vnwoonted, and so rare in
<hi>experience,</hi> as, verie hardly it is heard of in twentie yeeres
space. Yea,<note place="margin">Katherine wright saith, she neuer did thinke she was possessed: but that M. Dorel would needs perswade her she was so.</note> and when the same is generally supposed, to be

knowne vnto men, as, the verie <hi>parties</hi> themselues,
(of their owne knowledge) are vnable to say they be <hi>possessed
of diuels,</hi> neither (if they were not earnestly perswaded vnto
it, by some of the <hi>Exorcistes trade</hi>) would they euer imagine,
any <hi>possession</hi> at all. And therefore (howsoeuer you dreame of
the <hi>perpetuitie of actuall possession</hi>) the same (you see) cannot
truely be saide to be <hi>ordinarie:</hi> but rather, an <hi>extraordinarie,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:25312:108"/>
and supernaturall matter,</hi> surmounting the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>course of

               <p>Surely sir, I am iust of your <hi>minde,</hi> that, if <hi>actuall possession</hi>
were now, as <hi>ordinarie</hi> with <hi>diuels,</hi> as are <hi>diseases</hi> with men: such

efficacie</hi> of that his own effectuall working <hi>power,</hi> which (by the
powerfull <hi>preaching</hi> of his glorious <hi>Gospell</hi>) should after his

Which in that place (you say) importeth no predeterminate

working <hi>power of Christ</hi> (executed by the <hi>powerful preaching of
the gospel</hi>) to the end of the world. In deed, I do willingly gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the effectuall working <hi>power</hi> of Christ, neither doth, nor
may possibly <hi>determine</hi> to the end of the world: for, <hi>hee must
effectually reigne,</hi>

                  <hi>till he hath (actually) subiected all his enimies

of <hi>satan</hi> his power of <hi>actuall possession</hi> to the end of the world:
neither may such manner of <hi>inference</hi> be possiblie enforced
from thence. For, what a dalliance is this? Christ his <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
working power,</hi> must successiuely shewe foorth it selfe vpon
<hi>satan</hi> to the end of the world: therefore the <hi>actuall possession of
satan,</hi> must not, nor may not <hi>determine</hi> to the end of the world.

cease,</hi> and <hi>determine:</hi> the <hi>effectuall power of Christ</hi> could finde
nothing at all in <hi>satan</hi> to worke vpon. But tell me (I pray you)
had not the <hi>diuell</hi> at the first of all, a power of <hi>possession:</hi> and a
power of <hi>obsession</hi> permitted vnto him? And was, and is he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:25312:109"/>
not industrious enough in the <hi>execution</hi> of both from time to
time? Let continuall <hi>experience</hi> speake in this point. Now
then, if the <hi>effectual working power of Christ</hi> hath <hi>actually,</hi> &amp; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
subdued the <hi>first:</hi> may therefore the <hi>efficacy</hi> of that his said
<hi>power</hi> remaine now vtterly idle from time to time, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any the fiery assaults or harmes which might grow
from the <hi>latter?</hi> I suppose, nothing lesse. For, remember you
not that old saying? <hi>It is as much to keepe an hold:</hi>

                  <hi>as was before
to win the hold.</hi> Hence therefore, it is very apparant, that, as the
<hi>effectuall working power of Christ,</hi> hath extraordinarily and <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
shewed foorth it selfe vpon <hi>satan,</hi> by suppressing for euer
his <hi>power of actuall possession:</hi> so surely, the <hi>efficacy</hi> of that his said
<hi>power,</hi> must now successiuely shew foorth it sefe vpon <hi>satan</hi> to
the end of the world, by repelling his <hi>power of obsession,</hi> I meane
by withstanding his outragious <hi>assaults,</hi> his cunning <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions,</hi>
his subtile <hi>tentations,</hi> and by quenching the force of
his <hi>fiery darts</hi> for euer, through the <hi>powerfull preaching</hi> of his
glorious <hi>gospel.</hi> So then, howsoeuer the <hi>continuance</hi> of <hi>Christs
power</hi> be granted vnto you: yet, vnlesse you be able withall,
very substantially to prooue the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of <hi>satan</hi> his <hi>actuall

the <hi>final determination</hi> of <hi>satan</hi> his <hi>power of actuall possession.</hi> And

               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>With very good will. First therefore, concerning those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
<hi>scriptures</hi> which purposely handle the <hi>effectuall working
power of Christ,</hi> before his <hi>manifestation</hi> in the flesh: we haue to
consider, that the <hi>Lord God</hi> immediately after the fall of man,
did (for the comfort of the godly, and terrour of <hi>satan</hi>) foretell
to them both,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> that, <hi>the seed of the woman should bruse the serpents
head.</hi> In which place, he precisely puts downe one speciall <hi>act,</hi>
to be <hi>actually effected by Christ vpon satan,</hi> namely the <hi>actual</hi>
subduing of his <hi>actual dominion,</hi> vnderstood (in that place) by
the <hi>serpents head:</hi> and, purposely refers the <hi>actuall</hi> accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof to the <hi>future time,</hi> saying thus. The seed of the
woman (<hi>not doth, or hath</hi>) but rather (<hi>shall</hi>) bruse the <hi>serpents</hi>
head. That is, in processe of time, shall euen <hi>actually</hi> ouercome
the said <hi>power of the diuel:</hi> hauing also therein, a more speciall
relation to the very <hi>death</hi> of our sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi> vnderstood (in
that place) by the <hi>brusing of his heele.</hi> Now then, from the due
consideration hereof, I doe argue thus, namely, that euen as,
howsoeuer the <hi>diuell</hi> may be said to wage war with <hi>Christ</hi> and
his <hi>members</hi> from time to time, yet, there was one special time
predetermined of <hi>God,</hi> wherein the said <hi>diuel</hi> was <hi>actually to
bruse the heele of our sauiour,</hi> and that vndoutedly was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of <hi>Christ his suffering vpon the crosse,</hi> whereupon, the
<hi>diuel</hi> accordingly did <hi>put into Iudas his hart to betray his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:</hi>
so surely,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 2.</note> howsoeuer <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>members</hi> may be said
to infringe effectually, the <hi>diuel</hi> his <hi>tyrannicall power</hi> from time
to time to the end of the world, yet was there one speciall
time foreappointed of <hi>God,</hi> wherein <hi>Christ</hi> alone was <hi>actually to
breake the serpents head,</hi> and that vndoubtedly, was the very
selfesame <hi>time</hi> wherein <hi>Satan brused his heele,</hi> I meane the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
time of <hi>Christs sufferings,</hi> when he said, it is finished.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>Why doe you so exactly restraine, the <hi>conquest of Christ</hi>
ouer <hi>Satan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 8.</note> vnto the onely <hi>time of his sufferings:</hi> sith he was,
<hi>the lambe slaine from the beginning of the world?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>I restraine not the <hi>efficacie,</hi> but the very <hi>act</hi> of Christs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
to the onely time of his suffrings. Moreouer, although
it be truely said that <hi>Christ</hi> was the <hi>Lambe</hi> slaine from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world; yet,<note place="margin">Ioh. Caluin. in Heb. cap. 9. 26.</note> that must not be vnderstoode of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:25312:110"/>
anie <hi>actuall,</hi> but of an <hi>effectuall sacrificing of Christ,</hi> to so manie
as in all ages and times doe apprehend the <hi>efficacie</hi> of his said
<hi>sacrifice</hi> by a liuely faith,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>which is the victorie whereby they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the world.</hi> If therefore, you vnderstand the aforesaid
place of an <hi>actuall sacrificing of Christ,</hi> from the beginning to
the end of the world: then surely, your speech is not onely, to
to absurd, but withal, it crosseth directly the holie <hi>Ghost</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
who telleth vs plainly,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26.</note> that (if an <hi>actuall sacrificing of
Christ</hi> be there vnderstood) then <hi>Christ must often haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
from the worlds foundation.</hi> Besides that, it doth quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
the <hi>dignitie</hi> of <hi>Christ his priesthood,</hi> aboue the <hi>Leuitical
priesthood:</hi> which is there set foorth by many <hi>comparisons</hi> thus.
The <hi>Leuiticall high priest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 11. 12. 24. 25.</note> he <hi>sacrificed</hi> in a corruptible <hi>taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:</hi>
but <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>tabernacle</hi> of his owne <hi>bodie.</hi> He <hi>sacrificed</hi>
with strange <hi>bloud:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bulling. in Heb. cap. 9. 26.</note> but <hi>Christ</hi> with his owne <hi>bloud.</hi> He entred
into the <hi>sanctuary made with hands:</hi> but <hi>Christ</hi> into <hi>heauen</hi> it self.
He appeared before the <hi>materiall Arke:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pellican. in Heb. 9. 25.</note> but <hi>Christ</hi> before <hi>God</hi>
his father. He euerie yeere once, <hi>iterated his sacrifice:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Christ</hi> (offering himselfe but once for al) abolished sinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither,
as wel of the <hi>former,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26.</note> as of the <hi>ages to come.</hi> Then (after
all this) he renders a <hi>reason</hi> why <hi>Christ</hi> could <hi>actually but once
be sacrificed;</hi> namely, because he could <hi>actually but once be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi>
And in the end he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently <hi>concludes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27. 28.</note> that, howsoeuer
<hi>Christ</hi> was but once <hi>actually sacrificed,</hi> yet, the <hi>vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
of his said sacrifice,</hi> did, and doth <hi>effectually</hi> extend it selfe
to the sinnes which were before, and to the sinnes which <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
his sufferings.</hi> So then (notwithstanding whatsoeuer
you <hi>obiect</hi>) you may plainely perceiue, that, euen as albeit
<hi>Christ</hi> his said <hi>sacrifice</hi> hath euer beene, and euer shal be <hi>effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
from time to time, yet, there was <hi>one speciall time</hi> foreap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of <hi>God,</hi> wherein his said <hi>sacrifice was actually effected:</hi>
so surely, that although the effectuall working <hi>power of Christ,</hi>
hath beene, and is euer <hi>effectuall</hi> from time to time against
the <hi>power of actuall possession,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pet. Martyr. in Gen. 3. 15.</note> yet there was vndoubtedly <hi>one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
time</hi> wherein the saide <hi>power of actuall possession</hi> was by
<hi>Christ actually</hi> annihilated,<note place="margin">Ioh. Caluin. in Gen. 3. 15.</note> and that was the verie time of
<hi>Christ his manifestation in the flesh,</hi> when as (by the verie force
of his suffrings) he brake the <hi>serpents head.</hi> Hereunto also the
Euangelist <hi>Luke</hi> verie aptly accordeth saying.<note place="margin">Luc. 11. 20. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>When a strong

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:25312:111"/>
peace: but, when a stronger then he commeth vpon him, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he
trusted, and deuideth the spoiles.</hi> The <hi>Euangelist</hi> there,<note place="margin">Gualt. in Luc. 11. homil. 115.</note> 
                  <hi>doth
allegorically</hi> depaint vnto vs the <hi>condition, dominion,</hi> and <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of satan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mosculus, in Math. 12. 29.</note> For by the <hi>strong armed man,</hi> he meaneth the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</hi>
By <hi>his house,</hi> he vnderstandeth <hi>generally the world,</hi> and
more <hi>particularly,</hi> the <hi>parties actually possessed.</hi>

Lastly, by <hi>deuiding the spoiles,</hi> he meaneth the timely restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all poore <hi>possessed soules,</hi> to the <hi>kingdome</hi> and seruice of
<hi>Christ,</hi> according to that which <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>now is the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this world.</hi> Vnderstanding thereby, the iudgement of

               <p>Content. First therefore, the holy Ghost saith thus to the
Hebrewes.<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>For as much as the children are pertakers of flesh and
bloud, Christ also himselfe tooke part with them: that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
through death, him that had power ouer death, that is, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</hi>
Wherein, first (you see) he puts downe the <hi>incarnation</hi> of
Christ:<note place="margin">Henr. Bulling. in Heb. 2. 14.</note> and then next, he sheweth the <hi>maine cause</hi> of his saide
<hi>incarnation,</hi> namely, that he might <hi>destroy the diuell.</hi> Now then,
this same <hi>destruction</hi> of the <hi>diuell,</hi> it must in no wise be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the <hi>essence:</hi> but of the <hi>actions of Satan.</hi> For, the <hi>diuell</hi>
(as touching his <hi>essence</hi> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being) still liueth, and liue must
for euer. Howbeit concerning his <hi>actions,</hi> I meane his <hi>tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall

dominion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. in Ioh. cap. 14. 30. tract. 95.</note> and <hi>actuall power:</hi> he may verie fitly be said to
be <hi>now destroied.</hi> Because, howsoeuer <hi>satan</hi> be accounted a
<hi>prince</hi> of this world, and therefore endeuoureth verie proudly
to <hi>dominire</hi> ouer all:<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 31. and 16. 11.</note> yet, when he came vnto Christ, he found
nothing at all in him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 30. M. Bucer. in Ioh. 14. 30. Muscul. in Ioh. 14. 30.</note> that is no such matter of <hi>subiection</hi> as he
happily imagined. Neither could he possibly haue any power
ouer him at all, or, no further <hi>power</hi> at the most, then the <hi>bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Christ his heele,</hi> I meane, the <hi>crucifying of his flesh.</hi> And,
this one worke of <hi>satan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. in Ioh. 14, 30. tract. 79.</note> was that which <hi>accidentally</hi> procured
his proper <hi>destruction.</hi> For, therefore did <hi>Christ</hi> take flesh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, that, euen in the <hi>flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Item ibid. tract. 95.</note> he might <hi>conquere</hi> him who had
<hi>conquered flesh:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beza annotat. in Hebr. cap. 2. 14.</note> and through <hi>death</hi> might destroy him that had
<hi>power ouer death,</hi> namely, the <hi>diuell,</hi> as was shewed before. And
this, as it hath reference to the <hi>actions,</hi> and not the <hi>essence of
satan:</hi> so shall it giue much light to the <hi>matter</hi> in hand,<note place="margin">Theophil. in Ioh. 12. 31.</note> if we
precisely examine the verie <hi>word</hi> it selfe which the holy Ghost
here obserueth. For, he saith not, that Christ hath <hi>abated, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed,</hi>
or <hi>weakened,</hi> but that he hath <hi>destroied the diuell:</hi> that
is, that he hath vtterly <hi>cut off, exiled,</hi> and <hi>banished his tyrannicall
dominion.</hi> For,<note place="margin">

hath not properly any reference to the <hi>essence of satan,</hi> for,
therein he liueth, and liue must for euer, as hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

which is not yet vtterly destroied: for thereby, he assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,

be appropriated to his <hi>power of possession,</hi> which was not onely
much <hi>maimed,</hi> but <hi>vtterly destroied</hi> by the <hi>death of our Sauiour:</hi>
although yet we denie not, but that this <hi>vtter destruction,</hi> both

               <p>Herein your speech is derogatorious to the <hi>efficacie and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of Christs death,</hi> in that (by restrayning the same as you
doe, to the onely <hi>annihilating</hi> of the <hi>venemous sting of sinne and
of death</hi>) you vtterly exclude the <hi>effectual working power</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
from the <hi>actuall determination of satan his actuall possession.</hi>
For, consider you not what <hi>peculiar action</hi> therein, the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
impose vpon Christ? First, he hath been from the worlds
foundation, peculiarly appointed of God, to be that <hi>promised

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> Then next, he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly

                  <hi>who was to binde the strong armed

import some <hi>peculiar action</hi> to be performed by Christ: so
doe they vndoubtedly, binde the <hi>actuall accomplishment</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
vpon his owne <hi>person</hi> alone, and that also euen in the <hi>future

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> Then (<hi>after the fulnes of time, our Sauiour Christ being

prince of this world be cast out.</hi> Limitting (you see) the <hi>actuall</hi>
effecting of that selfesame <hi>peculiar action</hi> (so foretold as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
vnto the <hi>present time</hi> of his sufferings. Moreouer, after the

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> the holy Ghost else

him who had power ouer death:</hi> and againe, that <hi>Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to destroy the works of the diuel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 8.</note> Both which last places of
scripture, as they plainely import some <hi>speciall action</hi> effected
by Christ in the <hi>preter time,</hi> as did those other before in the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

<hi>conquest</hi> ouer <hi>satan</hi> himselfe. Now then, this said
<hi>actuall</hi> accomplishment of some <hi>special action</hi> thus <hi>actually</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by Christ: must necessarily haue a speciall reference to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:25312:112"/>
the <hi>finall determination</hi> either of <hi>Satan his power of possession,</hi> or
of his <hi>power of obsession.</hi> But, not of his <hi>power of obsession,</hi> for ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>now
shall the prince of this world be cast out:</hi> had an especiall regard
to that earnest <hi>petition</hi> which certeine <hi>greekes</hi> a little before,
did personally put vp vnto <hi>Andrew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 20.</note> saying. <hi>Good sir? we also
our selues, would gladly see that same Iesus,</hi> whom the world so
egerly affecteth and followeth.<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Andrew</hi> no sooner perceiued
their sute, but he acquainted <hi>Phillip</hi> therewith: and, they both
together propounded the whole matter to <hi>Iesus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 22.</note> Now then
<hi>Iesus,</hi> considering (in the zeale of those <hi>greekes</hi>) how all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
affected his <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>miracles,</hi> and came flocking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him:<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 23.</note> he answered <hi>Andrew and Philip</hi> thus. I perceiue by all
<hi>signes,</hi> that the very <hi>hower</hi> it selfe is now come, wherein the
<hi>sonne of man</hi> must be glorified in the <hi>actuall manifestation of his
effectuall power vpon satan</hi> by his <hi>sufferings and death.</hi> Which
his said <hi>death</hi> (I assure you) must now necessarily succeed, to
the <hi>actuall</hi> accomplishment of that <hi>actuall conquest:</hi> a very

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 24.</note> Which, <hi>vnlesse it doth fall into the ground and die,

vndoutedly spring many moe <hi>branches</hi> from thence: as from

is extreamely fearefull to <hi>flesh and bloud.</hi> For, euen my

were it not that euen therefore I <hi>came vnto this hower.</hi> In

earnestly endeuour my selfe, to vndergoe with patience, the

perceiue the fruits of my <hi>praier:</hi> you your selues shalbe <hi>eare
witnesses</hi> of my <hi>father his answere</hi> from heauen, saying. My <hi>son,</hi>
I haue both <hi>glorified it before</hi> in thy <hi>conception,</hi>

that (by the <hi>iudgement of the world</hi>) we must there vnderstand,
not the <hi>iudgement of damnation,</hi> which is reserued to the last

in <hi>reforming</hi> the worlde by the <hi>expelling of Satan.</hi> For, the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi>
(saith he) <hi>possessed mankinde,</hi> and held them guiltie of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
through the <hi>handwriting of sinne.</hi> He did <hi>dominier</hi>

                  <hi>by forsaking the Creator.</hi>
Howbeit, through that selfesame <hi>faith of Christ</hi> which (by his

his precious <hi>bloud</hi> which was shedde for remission of sinnes: a

in fires: they handled his stiffenes of limbes, his sundrie swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,

knockings, and the Diuell eftsoones speaking verie hideously with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <p>With verie good will. And, this I must tell you before, that,
there is not a man in the world (though neuer so little imbru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

be many <hi>hidden vertues</hi> of meere <hi>naturall</hi> things, and those also
the howerly <hi>effectours</hi> of many admirable <hi>actions:</hi> which saide
<hi>vertues</hi> if a man vnderstood well, and could skilfully apply
them to his purpose pretended, he might vndoubtedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
many vnwoonted experiments. Yea, there be many
<hi>maruels in nature,</hi> hitherto <hi>vnexperienced</hi> of any, and (to vse
<hi>Plinie</hi> his words) as yet <hi>wholy ouershadowed with natures maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie:
which the spirit of all spirits onely knoweth how, and when to
implop at his pleasure.</hi> Now then, if any man (couertly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>experiments</hi> of these <hi>naturall causes</hi>) did apparantly
accomplish like <hi>admirable matters,</hi> men would commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
him a <hi>Magitian,</hi> and verie hardly beleeue he could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
effect those rare and <hi>strange feats,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aristot. de ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirandis audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus.</note> without the <hi>power</hi> and

               <p>Againe, there are other two <hi>mountaines,</hi> very nerely adioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

their owne <hi>proper bodies,</hi> such woonderfull <hi>actions,</hi> as none
other might possiblie doe, and (hearing onely thereof) will
hardly beleeue them. For there were <hi>some to be seene,</hi> who
(without stirring their <hi>heades</hi> at all) could <hi>shake their own eares;</hi>
either <hi>one by it selfe alone,</hi> or <hi>both at once</hi> at their pleasure.</p>
               <p>Againe, there were <hi>some others,</hi> who not <hi>moouing their head</hi>
(where their <hi>lockes</hi> especially grew) would verie easily <hi>put
downe</hi> their whole <hi>bush of haire to their forehead:</hi> and <hi>eftsoones

               <p>There were <hi>some others</hi> againe, who, of such <hi>meats</hi> as they
had <hi>eaten before</hi> (those selfesame <hi>meats</hi> also, being incrediblie

they thought best at their pleasures.</p>
               <p>There were <hi>some others</hi> againe, who (from the very <hi>bottome

               </p>
               <p>Yea and (which more is) there was a certeine <hi>priest in Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensis

himselfe of all <hi>bodily sense,</hi> and lie flat on the grounde as if he

               <p>Now then, from all the <hi>premisses,</hi> I may fitly enforce this one
<hi>inference</hi> vpon <hi>Exorcistes.</hi> Namely, that if all these the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent

could not possible be effected, but, by some <hi>supernaturall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

verie certeine I am,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 1. &amp;c.</note> the <hi>diuell, he is no creatour of substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
no <hi>transformer of natures:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 17.</note> nor no <hi>worker of myracles.</hi> First,
that he is no <hi>creatour of substances,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 6.</note> it is apparant in this: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for that <hi>Iehouah alone is the Creatour of all things.</hi>

                  <hi>he is the author and father of all
things:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Natura princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piorum amat singularitatem.</note> and therefore the <hi>glorie of creation</hi> belongeth onely to
him. Moreouer this (in all reason) is verie apparant, namely,
that the <hi>nature of beginnings affecteth singularitie:</hi> insomuch
as possibly he could not be <hi>singular,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Danaeus, physica christiana, par. 1. fol. 92.</note> if he should communicate

                  <note place="margin">Aug. de trinit. lib. 3. cap. 8.</note> Yea,

                  <hi>Augustine,</hi> he flatly denieth <hi>spirits and diuels to be Creators

this point by a second supply: affirming, that <hi>by whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

                  <note place="margin">A quo vermes creantur, ab eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem &amp; Angeli.</note> 
                  <hi>by him also, the silie wormes

no creator of substances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now next, that he is no <hi>transformer of natures,</hi> it is verie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant,<note place="margin">In the 5. Dialog. fol. 77. 78.</note>
in that he cannot possibly <hi>transforme</hi> his owne <hi>proper
nature:</hi> no, not so much as in an <hi>outward appearance,</hi> as hath
plainely beene prooued before.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>working of miracles,</hi> he is as <hi>impotent</hi> therein, as in
any of the rest: because he hath no <hi>supernaturall power</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
such matters. He may worke <hi>strange woonders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 1. 9. 10. 11</note> as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Magus</hi> hath done: but,<note place="margin">George Gifford in his discouerie of Witches.</note> he can effect no <hi>supernaturall,</hi> and
<hi>miraculous actions:</hi> though God giue him leaue to shew his
<hi>whole power.</hi> So then,<note place="margin">Pet. Martyr. in 1. Sam. 28. &amp; loc. com. 9. fol. 67.</note> the <hi>diuell</hi> (you see) he hath a <hi>double bridle</hi>
put in his mouth: namely, the <hi>bounds of nature:</hi> and the <hi>will of
God.</hi> By the <hi>one</hi> he is <hi>vnable:</hi> and by the <hi>other</hi> he may not doe
more then the appointment of God. The premisses there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
considered, who seeth it not vtterly <hi>incredible in all sound
Diuinitie,</hi> that many of those your supposed <hi>actions</hi> could bee
possibly effected of <hi>satan:</hi> in such sort at least, as in those your
published <hi>pamphlets</hi> they are falsely reported.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>diuell,</hi> he is able to accomplish great matters.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>So much I confesse. And therefore (for <hi>arguments</hi> sake) be
it by the way, supposed (which may neuer be prooued) that
the <hi>diuel,</hi> either of himselfe, or by the <hi>yoong man</hi> at least, was
throughly able, and did truely effect such <hi>supernaturall matters</hi>
as are published in <hi>print:</hi> there is then no doubt but that he
can doe them againe, and as oft as he please. For, if he be anie
waies able: there is no doubt of his <hi>willingnes</hi> in working of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:25312:124"/>
mischiefe. That (if he hath done them before at <hi>Mahgnitton</hi>)
he is then able to doe them againe, my reason is this: namely,
for that euerie <hi>art,</hi> or <hi>action,</hi> presupposeth alwaies an <hi>essentiall
power in the artist,</hi> or <hi>actor himselfe.</hi> Your <hi>Apologie</hi> therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
(as it doth) for infallible <hi>truth,</hi> that the <hi>diuell</hi> (in the
<hi>yoongman at Mahgnitton</hi> either did, or could possibly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
such <hi>impossible actions:</hi> you your selfe must be able to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate</hi>
by what possible meanes he might possibly <hi>effect
them,</hi> which I verily supposse you cannot possibly doe.</p>
               <p>For this you may not be ignorant of, that, to euery <hi>action</hi> is
required <hi>the faculty and ability of the agent; the aptnesse of the
patient or subiect: with a conuenient and possible application of true
matter and forme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then first for the <hi>diuel,</hi> the supposed <hi>agent</hi> of those your
impossible <hi>actions;</hi> he is not <hi>omnipotent,</hi> but an <hi>impotent,</hi> a <hi>finite</hi>
and <hi>circumscriptible spirit:</hi> and his <hi>power</hi> whatsoeuer, it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vpon the <hi>analogy</hi> and <hi>consonancy</hi> of his <hi>mind</hi> and body, if
he had any at all. Howbeit, with his <hi>mind</hi> he can doe no more
but <hi>vnderstand and will,</hi> and with his <hi>body</hi> (if he had any at all)
he could accomplish no more then the very <hi>bounds and ends
of corporall sense</hi> would suffer, and the <hi>faculty</hi> of his <hi>nature</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
vnto: and therefore his <hi>naturall power</hi> whatsoeuer, it
cannot possibly stretch foorth it selfe to the powerfull effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of any such <hi>supernaturall actions</hi> as doe infinitely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
his <hi>naturall and finite faculty, his sense, his vnderstanding
and will.</hi> So then, here wanteth (you see) first, the <hi>faculty</hi> and
<hi>power</hi> of the <hi>efficient</hi> it selfe: for the possible effecting of those
impossible <hi>actious</hi> wherewith you would mannage your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>actuall possession.</hi> Whereupon I <hi>infer,</hi> that, if no such <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
power</hi> at all may be prooued in the <hi>diuel</hi> his suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>possession:</hi> then, no such <hi>supernaturall actions</hi> (in truth) may
possibly <hi>proceede</hi> from the same, notwithstanding any your
<hi>printed reports.</hi> For, in all reason, there can be no greater <hi>vertue</hi>
in the <hi>thing caused:</hi> then is in the <hi>cause it selfe,</hi> or in that which
proceedes from the <hi>benefit of the cause.</hi> But you (in your <hi>printed
apology</hi>) doe make the <hi>diuel</hi> his supposed <hi>actuall possession,</hi> the
principall <hi>effi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ient cause</hi> of all such <hi>supernaturall actions</hi> as were
<hi>ministerially</hi> effected (you say) by the <hi>yong man at Mahgnitton:</hi>
and therefore (the said <hi>power</hi> being finite) you cannot possibly
conclude from thence, any such <hi>admirable matters</hi> as you
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:25312:124"/>
would beare vs in hand. Neither may you conscionably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
vs to entertaine for <hi>sound truth,</hi> whatsoeuer you report
concerning that point: especially,<note place="margin">Arist. de anima lib. 2.</note> if we will credit our owne

<hi>diuinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now next for any <hi>aptnesse</hi> in the <hi>yoong man at Mahgnitton</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See M. Dorels Narration, to the 16. obiection fol. 4. pag. 1.</note>
whom (in any wise) you will haue the proper <hi>patient</hi> or <hi>subiect</hi>
of those strang and impossible <hi>actions:</hi> how should there pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be found in him any <hi>aptnesse</hi> or <hi>inclination</hi> at all, to any
such <hi>supernaturall matters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He saith, if M. D. would say or sweare that Sommers did such things, he was not to be credited.

that way: then his <hi>naturall faculty</hi> extendeth vnto, and may

               </p>
               <p>1. For first, the working of <hi>miracles</hi> (in all sound <hi>diuinity</hi>)<note place="margin">Diuinitie.</note> is
<hi>ceased</hi> long since: neither was the <hi>diuel</hi> euer able to effect

any <hi>miracle,</hi> whatsoeuer he pretended in <hi>outwarde appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>

               <p>2. Besides that,<note place="margin">Philosophie.</note> no <hi>one reason</hi> (in all <hi>Philosophie</hi>) may possibly

of such <hi>impossible actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Nether yet may a <hi>circumscribed nature,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nature.</note> at any hand extend

               </p>
               <p>5. Moreouer,<note place="margin">Lawe.</note> because there is nothing <hi>possible in Law,</hi> which

(notwithstanding any thing confessed before by the <hi>parties</hi>)
he is not to attend or regard whatsoeuer those <hi>partiall repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
haue published in <hi>print,</hi> or otherwaies <hi>reported</hi> to be done

be beleeued therein, whether his <hi>iudgement be sound or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,</hi>
I mean, whether he be <hi>wel,</hi> or <hi>but wild in his wits.</hi> For first,
be it supposed the man were <hi>sound in his iudgement,</hi> yea, and so
<hi>well in his wits,</hi> as possiblie he might be: yet were there no <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
at all, to credite a cousoning <hi>companion,</hi> so <hi>vnconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie</hi>
auouching such <hi>incredible actions.</hi> But if (as may rather be
deemed) he was someway <hi>intoxicated,</hi> or <hi>not well in his wittes</hi>
when he reported such <hi>matters</hi> abroad: then tell me what <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
or what <hi>wisdome</hi> it were, to credite for <hi>infallible truth,</hi>

For,<note place="margin">L. absent de paenis.</note> this I take to be <hi>Lawe;</hi> namely, that when the

               <p>
                  <hi>Things naturall, I account all those seuerall matters to be, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
which God hath essentially enabled vnto the orderly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of that selfesame ende whereunto he created them first:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:25312:126"/>
it being withall, verie naturall and consequent in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</hi>
And of this sort, I esteeme all matters and <hi>actions</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer;
<hi>which be naturally consonant and concludent to the orderly
course of nature.</hi> Now sir, if your <hi>matters at Mahgnitton</hi> were al
vndoubtedly such, then, either all men in like sort, are <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
tainted with <hi>Satan</hi> his <hi>actuall possession,</hi> because all men in

which haue hetherto wanted your helpe of prayer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
should wholly remaine in <hi>Satan his actuall possession.</hi> Or
(on the other side) if all men in like sort, be not <hi>naturally pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,</hi>
then, neither the <hi>yoong-man</hi> himselfe (remaining with
them, in one and the selfesame <hi>naturall condition</hi>) was <hi>possessed</hi>

no naturall abilitie for the orderly accomplishment of nature her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

               <p>1 Things directly <hi>against nature,</hi> are all those <hi>accidentall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents</hi>

               <p>Content. <hi>The rule of right iudgement, is some certaine direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
leuell, or square, whereby is declared vnto vs, both what is true,
and what is false: and for which onely respect, it is also verie fitly
termed the rule of truth.</hi> Moreouer, this selfesame <hi>rule of truth,</hi>
is either <hi>naturall:</hi> or <hi>supernaturall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The naturall rule of truth, is that naturall direction, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
herselfe doth truely declare; and verie sufficiently affoorde
vnto vs.</hi> And this selfesame <hi>natural rule of truth</hi> is also twofold;
namely, either some <hi>naturall principles,</hi> or <hi>vniuersall experience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The naturall principles, are some certeine generall notions, or
vniuersall directions, verie naturally engrafted and knowen vnto
men by nature it selfe: and which also are so necessarilie, so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly,
and so vnchangeablie true, as whosoeuer shall dare to call
them in doubt, he may iustly be termed a mad-man, or foole.</hi> And
these <hi>naturall principles</hi> also, are, either <hi>theoricall: or practicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The theoricall principles, are all such speculatiue demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as doe certeinly direct and guide the iudgement, in a true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
&amp; knowledge of things.</hi> As for example, <hi>twise two, are
fowre.</hi> Againe, there is <hi>one onely truth.</hi> Againe, <hi>the whole is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any part thereof.</hi> Againe, <hi>the cause is not after the effect.</hi>
Againe, <hi>there is one onely naturall motion of a simple bodie,</hi> and so
foorth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The practicall principles are such certeine and infallible grounds
of truth, as do certeinly direct and gouerne the manners of men.</hi> As
for example, <hi>God is to be serued. Men may not be hurt. Honest
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:25312:128"/>
things are to be done. Falshood is to be fledde,</hi> and so foorth. Now
then <hi>this naturall rule,</hi> I meane these <hi>natural principles</hi> (whether
<hi>theoricall, or practicall</hi>) they can be no <hi>competent Iudges</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
and trie foorth the <hi>truth</hi> of those your supposed <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
wrought at Mahgnitton.</hi> First, because <hi>this selfesame rule</hi>
(being onely but <hi>naturall,</hi> in what kinde soeuer) cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
extend foorth it selfe to the full compasse and reach of
those your <hi>admirable actions:</hi> manie of them especially being
so <hi>absurd</hi> as they are, so <hi>supernaturall,</hi> and euerie way so
<hi>impossible in nature.</hi> Secondly, for that manie <hi>wise men</hi> in the
world (no lesse wise then your selfe, yea, and as sufficientlie
qualified with those selfesame <hi>naturall principles</hi> whatsoeuer)
are of a farre <hi>different iudgement to yours:</hi> and therefore (by
force of <hi>this rule</hi>) you cannot possiblie put downe vnto vs any
such <hi>infallible and certeine conclusions,</hi> as may possiblie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
an <hi>actuall possession.</hi> And thus much brieflie, for that
<hi>first rule of truth,</hi> which ariseth onely from meere <hi>naturall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>

<hi>Thus then, you may plainly perceiue,</hi> that <hi>sense,</hi> obseruation,
induction, <hi>and the like</hi> perpetuall experience: <hi>do fully constitute
a second infallible</hi> naturall rule, <hi>for the orderly examining and</hi>

trying foorth of truthes. <hi>Howbeit, neither may this selfesame</hi>
naturall, <hi>or</hi> experimentall rule: <hi>in any sort be enforced to serue</hi>
Exorcistes <hi>his turne. Because, it in no wise accordeth with his
supposed</hi> actuall possession; <hi>or with any the</hi> admirable actions <hi>ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from thence: whether we respect</hi> the verie rule it selfe, <hi>or
the</hi> seuerall degrees thereof.</p>
               <p>For first, concerning the verie <hi>rule it selfe.</hi> There were then,
and are now many <hi>wise and sensible persons</hi> besides your selues:
some of them <hi>seuered by time and place,</hi> and many of them <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersing
among you,</hi> euen then and there, where your supposed
<hi>actuall possession</hi> was <hi>actually</hi> effected, or practised. Who do all
of them flatly affirme, that, they (for their owne parts) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then, nor at any time since had any such <hi>experimented
trials,</hi> or approoued <hi>experiments</hi> of such an <hi>actuall possession,</hi> as
your selues haue published in <hi>print:</hi> and therefore, the <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi>
which you flee vnto now for your refuge, is no <hi>catholike</hi>
or <hi>vniuersall experience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides all this, let the <hi>matters</hi> themselues be yet further
examined and tried foorth fully by the <hi>seuerall degrees</hi> of the
<hi>vniuersall experience</hi> propounded before: and then tell me,
how this selfesame <hi>experimentall rule,</hi> and the <hi>actions</hi> that are to
be <hi>ruled thereby,</hi> may possibly accord in one. For first, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>sense,</hi> how is it possible that any <hi>sensible experience</hi> (as it
were step by step) should directly proceed from the sensitiue
knowledge, to the memory it selfe, seeing all the <hi>obiects</hi> of
sense (arising especially from any your supposed supernaturall
actions) were none other thing else, but deceiueable obiects
and crafty conueiances: and therefore, could not possibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
true <hi>naturall notions,</hi> towards the timely effecting of a
<hi>vniuersall experience?</hi> And next for <hi>obseruation,</hi> how is it
possible that any infallible rule for the triall of truthes: should
bee sensibly and soundly collected from such <hi>insensible noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and vnsound examples? Againe, concerning <hi>induction,</hi>
where, or from whence should we possibly collect any other
examples, which may, or can possibly accord with this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
example of yours: for the further confirmation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
infallible <hi>rule,</hi> constituted (as before) vpon <hi>sensuall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,</hi>
and sound examples?</p>
               <p>Moreouer, where is that perpetuall <hi>consenting experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
wherein all men of sound iudgement whatsoeuer, haue
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:25312:129"/>
truely found foorth by like <hi>perpetuall experiments</hi> from time
to time: that, this one, with all other the approoued <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of <hi>actuall possession,</hi> doe mutually concurre after one and
the felfesame <hi>manner,</hi> and fully accord in euery point? Now
then, sith the <hi>vniuersall experience</hi> wee speake of doth not (so
much as in outward appearance) hold any agreement at all,
either, with your pretended <hi>actuall possession,</hi> or with any
the <hi>supposed actions</hi> thereof: you cannot (in any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reason) either conscionably auouch, or consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude from thence, any approoued <hi>experience,</hi> to try
foorth the truth of your matters. Yea, and this I say more, that,
if the <hi>experience</hi> wee speake of heere, and your <hi>actuall possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
with the supposed <hi>actions</hi> there at <hi>Mahgnitton,</hi> did so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accord, and so iustly iumpe together in all outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as the one might not possibly be discerned from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
yet could you not gather from thence, such a certeine
<hi>rule of right iudgement,</hi> as might (for the purpose in hand) be
able to serue your turne to the full. Because, that your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>actuall possession,</hi> and the <hi>supposed actions</hi> arising from
thence, are (many of them) <hi>supernaturall,</hi> absurd, and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:
whereupon, this <hi>experimentall</hi> or <hi>vniuersall experience</hi>
being (you may see, when it is at the best) but a <hi>meere natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rule</hi>) it cannot possibly compasse and square foorth vnto
vs, the <hi>certeine truth</hi> of those your <hi>supernaturall actions.</hi> And
therefore, it is vtterly in vaine for your selfe, to rest as you do:
vpon <hi>vniuersall experience</hi> for triall thereof.</p>

               <p>I doubt not then, but that you would more fully haue made
knowen that selfesame <hi>apparancy</hi> long ere now. But, go to, be
it so as you say. The <hi>perpetuity</hi> thereof will then appeare vnto
vs, either, by some <hi>canon,</hi> or <hi>counsel</hi> at least conteined in the
<hi>scriptures:</hi> which (I verely beleeue) you will neuer be able to
shew. For, first, the <hi>Apostle Paul,</hi> he tels the <hi>Ephesians</hi> (with an

                  <hi>he hath shewed them the whole

the <hi>perpetuity of actuall possessions:</hi> therefore, the <hi>perpetuity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
possessions,</hi> is no such part of <hi>Gods counsell,</hi> as may any
waies concerne the sauing,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 26.</note> or killing of soules. If yea, then was
not the <hi>Apostle</hi> himselfe set free from their <hi>bloud</hi> in concealing
it from them: for, in none of his <hi>canonicall Epistles</hi> hath he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
the same. If no, then the <hi>perpetuitie of actuall possession</hi>
is no part of <hi>Gods counsell</hi> concerning the sauing or killing of
soules: because the same cannot possibly be prooued from
any of the <hi>Apostles authenticall writings.</hi> For, the <hi>Apostle</hi> no
doubt,<note place="margin">Epistolae Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>perpetuitie of actuall possession,</hi> then had he verie fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
therefore, in all, or some one of his <hi>Epistles to Timothie
and Titus:</hi> where he purposely handles all <hi>ministeriall functions,</hi>
and precisely puts downe all <hi>ecclesiasticall constitutions</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
concerning <hi>Church discipline.</hi> But, in no one of those his
<hi>authenticall Epistles,</hi> is there any one <hi>Canon</hi> at all apparant,
which may tend in shew, to any such purpose: and therefore,
the <hi>perpetuitie of actuall possession,</hi> is no such part of <hi>Gods counsell,</hi>
as may in any sort concerne the sauing or killing of <hi>soules.</hi>
And as no one <hi>Canon:</hi> so, neither hath the <hi>Apostle</hi> himselfe (in

such <hi>matters.</hi> No, not euen there, where he purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entreats of the <hi>full power of the diuell:</hi> and had iust occasion

the same. Especially,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note> there where he calleth <hi>The prince of the

               <p>Good sir? I beseech you beware what you doe. And so
much the rather, because, this <hi>your absolute deniall of actuall
possessions;</hi> will open a wide doore vnto <hi>Atheisme,</hi> and loozen
the <hi>reines</hi> of our vnruly <hi>affections,</hi> to an <hi>irreligious,</hi> licentious,

               <p>Nay rather, this <hi>your obstinate auouching of actuall possession,</hi> it
the verie high way vnto <hi>Atheisme,</hi> to an <hi>irreligious</hi> behauiour,
and all <hi>carnall securitie.</hi> For, by making men verie idlely to
<hi>gaze</hi> (as they do) at an <hi>imagined actuall possession of diuels,</hi> when
no such matter (in deed and in truth) may soundly be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
what doe you else (in effect) but lull the whole world
fast a sleepe <hi>in the cradell of carnall securitie?</hi> Yea, and (which
more is) by this <hi>meanes</hi> you make men forgetfull and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of <hi>Satan his pernicious power of obsession:</hi> wherein lieth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly
enfolded, a very <hi>pestilent poyson,</hi> and most deadly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for <hi>bodie and soule.</hi> Neither may you more fitly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the <hi>diuell,</hi> nor more fully make him beholding vnto you
in any thing else: then, in vpholding for him (as you do) a fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<hi>imagined actuall possession.</hi> For, by this meanes, <hi>the mysterie
of iniquitie,</hi> doth more freely and more forciblie worke <hi>in the
mindes of men:</hi> and the <hi>diuell</hi> may more <hi>easily seduce their soules</hi>
at vnwares: by vsing at his pleasure, <hi>the power which he hath,</hi>
while the whole worlde (at their pleasure) so improuident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and so carelesly stand musing vpon an <hi>imagned power which
he hath not indeed.</hi> And, herein the subtile dealing of <hi>Satan,</hi> is
nothing inferiour to the craftie <hi>bird-catcher:</hi> who (while the
silie poore <hi>birdes</hi> sit prying at, and playing with the <hi>whirligig,</hi>
or <hi>staling</hi> before them) doth cunningly clap them (vp at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares)

that which is spoken may fully suffice, (I perceiue) for a
<hi>caueat</hi> herein: you your selfe being thus driuen (as you are)
into a maruelous maze concerning the <hi>matters</hi> in <hi>question.</hi> For
these your <hi>idle vagaries,</hi> and often startings aside from the

               <p>Yea sir. When I see you haue prooued my <hi>action at Mahg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niton,</hi>
no <hi>action</hi> at all concerning the <hi>actuall dispossessing of diuels:</hi>
I will then lay my hand on my <hi>mouth,</hi> without any further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie

               <p>Well, then we will take so much more leisure in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

that tyrannicall <hi>dominion of diuels,</hi> which might anie
way concerne their power of <hi>possession,</hi> or their power of <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session:</hi>
we will now proceed next, to an orderly examination
of that <hi>superiour ineuitable working power,</hi> whereby the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>actuall possession of diuels</hi> is vndoubtedly conquered, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
squashed, and euen vtterly annihilated, in comparison
of any the precedent poysons thereof. Yea, and so much the
rather, we entend verie carefully to follow this our entended
<hi>course:</hi> because in an only Imagination thereof, there doth lie
(it should seeme) the verie <hi>fortresse</hi> it selfe, of all those <hi>fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
and idle conceits,</hi> which concerne your supposed <hi>disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
of <hi>Satan.</hi> And therefore, hauing once (by a conscionable
discouery of the infallible truth) made knowen to your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that, your prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded <hi>action</hi> which was wrought at <hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnition,</hi>
cannot possibly chalenge the approoued priuiledge
of any <hi>exordinarie power from the Lord,</hi> for the <hi>actuall disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of diuels.</hi> I hope we may confidently conclude from the
consideration thereof, an apparant <hi>nullitie</hi> of all <hi>actuall posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
in these daies of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>

the dispossession it selfe:</hi> otherwaies how could they be <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
signes of a certeine deliuerance,</hi> the deliuerance it selfe not
fully effected? And so,<note place="margin">Marc. 9. 25. 26.</note> the <hi>Euangelist Marke</hi> he puts them

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>But yet, the <hi>Euangelist Luke,</hi> he telleth vs plainely,<note place="margin">Luc. 9. 42.</note> that,
while the <hi>childe</hi> was comming to Christ, and, or euer that
Christ began to adiure or command the <hi>diuell</hi> to depart, <hi>the
diuell he rent and tore the childe.</hi> Thereby declaring vnto vs,
that, those <hi>cryings aloude,</hi> those <hi>rendings</hi> and <hi>tearings,</hi> and that
<hi>leauing as dead:</hi> are rather the vndoubted <hi>true signes of Satan
his actuall possession,</hi> then of any <hi>his dispossession</hi> at all. So then,
howsoeuer the <hi>Euangelist Marke</hi> doth put downe those <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
partly <hi>preceeding,</hi> and partly <hi>succeeding the action</hi> it selfe:
Verie certaine I am, it was neuer his purpose to haue them
esteemed as vndoubted <hi>true signes</hi> of euerie the <hi>dispossessions of
Satan</hi> whatsoeuer: but rather, to be taken as the <hi>infallible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:25312:140"/>
of that selfesame <hi>speciall action,</hi> which Christ (at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
performed. Otherwise, if these <hi>cryings,</hi> these <hi>rendings,</hi> and
this <hi>leauing as dead,</hi> must necessarily confirme vnto vs the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of euerie <hi>dispossession of Satan</hi> in whomsoeuer: then, how
should we be assuredly perswaded concerning the certaine
truth of all other the <hi>dispossessions of Satan,</hi> in whom, those the
aforesaid <hi>signes</hi> are not found?<note place="margin">Math. 8. 32.</note> Namely, of those whom Christ
performed in the <hi>Gergesenes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marc. 5. 13.</note> of those which the <hi>seuentie disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
effected,<note place="margin">Luc. 8. 33. and 10. 17.</note> and of that which <hi>Paul</hi> accomplished in the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonist,</hi>
with sundrie other besides: for,<note place="margin">Acts. 16. 18.</note> in no one of those the
<hi>dispossessions of Satan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marc. 9. 38.</note> are any of those your vndoubted <hi>true
signes</hi> reported, and yet we doubt not at all of their certaine
deliuerances. The <hi>premisses</hi> therefore considered, we may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
fitly retort your reason vpon you thus. In those <hi>adiurations</hi>
whatsoeuer, where there was <hi>no crying aloude, no rending sore,
nor no leauing as dead,</hi> there were no vndoubted <hi>true signes of
any dispossessing of Satan.</hi> But in all the <hi>adiurations</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the aforesaid <hi>examples,</hi> there was <hi>no crying aloude, no ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
sore, nor no leauing as dead:</hi> therefore in all the <hi>adiurations</hi>
which concerne the aforesaid <hi>examples,</hi> there were no vndou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>true signes</hi> of the <hi>dispossessing of satan.</hi> Thus then it is very
apparant you see, by all the <hi>premisses,</hi> that (vnlesse you will
purposely fall into palpable absurdities) you may at no hand
auouch, that those <hi>cryings,</hi> those <hi>rendings</hi> and <hi>tearings,</hi> and that
<hi>leauing for dead,</hi> are the vndoubted <hi>true signes of the dispossessing
of satan.</hi> No, you must rather perswade your selfe, they were
purposely reported for <hi>speciall and proper effects</hi> of that <hi>speciall
and proper action of Christ:</hi> and, not considerately put downe
for <hi>perpetuall, and vndoubted true signes of all the actuall disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of spirits and diuels</hi> in whomsoeuer. Notwithstanding, be it
supposed (which will neuer be prooued) that, your selfe did
vndoubtedly driue foorth a <hi>diuel</hi> from the <hi>yoongman at Mahg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitton,</hi>
and that, some <hi>cryings aloude, some rendings sore,</hi> and some
<hi>leauing as dead,</hi> were then also the <hi>speciall effects</hi> of that your

               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Make your mind plaine, before we proceede. And tel me
(I pray you) whether <hi>spirtts</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> (by very <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
meanes</hi>) may be truely <hi>dispossessed,</hi> and driuen from

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, euen by very <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>corporall meanes.</hi>

But, such is the proper condition of <hi>spirituall creatures,</hi>
that, <hi>all corporall matters</hi> whatsoeuer, they come short there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by many degrees: and therefore, we may boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that those <hi>corporall</hi> or <hi>sensible things,</hi> can work nothing

               <p>Yes sir, I am able to <hi>demonstrate</hi> this matter, by an <hi>argument

of <hi>spirits,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coelius Rhod. lect. antiq. lib. 1. cap. 29.</note> and of <hi>liuing mens soules:</hi> for they are both of them
<hi>spirituall essences.</hi> But, euen by a meere <hi>corporall,</hi> or <hi>sensible
meanes,</hi> may some violence be offered to <hi>liuing mens soules,</hi>
yea, they may thereby, eftsoones be <hi>separated</hi> quite from their
<hi>bodies:</hi> and therefore, euen to <hi>spirits</hi> also (by <hi>meanes</hi> of some
<hi>corporall</hi> or <hi>sensible matter</hi>) there may eftsoones, some <hi>violence</hi>
be offered, and they also may be expelled quite, from their <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Your <hi>argument of comparison,</hi> it consisteth not of <hi>such pares</hi> as
are equally alike in euerie respect; no, it halteth downe right
in that selfesame point, wherupon it is more especially groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
and therefore, it enforceth no necessarie <hi>conclusion</hi> vpon
vs at all. For, the <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>spirits,</hi> and of <hi>liuing mens soules</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:25312:141"/>
(howsoeuer alike in <hi>spirituall essence</hi>) it is vtterly vnlike, respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the <hi>bodies</hi> whereupon they both worke. <hi>Soules,</hi> they are
properly conioyned to their <hi>owne proper bodies,</hi> as the verie

there,</hi> as the <hi>afflictors, or tormentors permitted by God.</hi> So then
(for those <hi>former respects</hi>) the <hi>soules of liuing men,</hi> doe necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
require in those their owne bodies, some such certaine <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi>
and <hi>qualities,</hi> as the <hi>diuels</hi> themselues (they being <hi>no true

<hi>spirits or diuels,</hi> they may <hi>actually afflict</hi> and torment those
<hi>selfesame bodies of men,</hi> how
vnfitly soeuer they finde them:

I am, that <hi>spirits</hi> or <hi>diuels,</hi> they may be driuen foorth

true, that, <hi>no created or naturall meanes whatsoeuer: may effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

                  <note place="margin">Quidlibet, ex quolibet.</note> euen <hi>any thing, of euerie thing may

               <p>Wel sir, howsoeuer you may iustly challenge the <hi>authority</hi>
of <hi>Tobiah,</hi> for not being <hi>authenticall,</hi> I haue one <hi>example</hi> from
the <hi>canonicall scriptures,</hi> to confirme the infallible truth of that
which I hold herein. Namely, that admirable <hi>action of Dauid:</hi>
who onely but <hi>plaied with his harp, and the euil spirit of the Lord
departed from Saul.</hi> Howbeit, that <hi>harpe,</hi> and that playing of
<hi>Dauid</hi> thereon,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 23.</note> were onely <hi>created,</hi> and meer <hi>naturall meanes:</hi>
therefore, some onely <hi>created,</hi> or meere <hi>naturall meanes,</hi> may
haue in it naturally, an effectuall power for the dispossessing
of <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>In deed, if <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels,</hi> had their <hi>peculier bodies</hi> natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnited vnto them,<note place="margin">Apuleius.</note> as <hi>Apuleius</hi> affirmeth: saying, <hi>that diuels
are liuing creatures, constituted of airy bodies, of passible minds, and
in time also eternall:</hi> then, there would be no inconuenience at
all, to hold that <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> (by a melodious sound, or
some other such <hi>sensible meanes</hi>) might be altered in their <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and expelled from men. For, the <hi>Platonists,</hi> they flatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that <hi>diuels are a certeine meane, betweene the intellectuall
spirits, who are of a pure spirituall</hi> substance: <hi>and between men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
bodies constituted of the foure elements.</hi> Howbeit, because
the sacred <hi>scriptures,</hi> and catholike faith doe iointly auouch
that <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> are of an <hi>Angelical</hi> nature, and that (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
by malice corrupted) their naturall <hi>faculties</hi> doe still
remaine absolute in them: we may consequently conclude,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:25312:143"/>
that therefore, no <hi>sensible matter,</hi> or <hi>corporall vertue</hi> is able of
it selfe, directly, or indirectly to effect in them, any such <hi>action,</hi>
they beeing properly of a <hi>spirituall substance.</hi> So that, the <hi>diuels</hi>
themselues, they cannot (by any such <hi>created or corporall
meanes</hi>) be compelled to any thing: much lesse may they be
violently expelled from their <hi>actuall possessions</hi> in men. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
yet, I dare not deny, but that (by a <hi>diuine</hi> and <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>
power whether <hi>immediate,</hi> or <hi>mediate</hi>) they may be
<hi>dispossessed,</hi> or driuen from their hold.</p>

neither by the inherent holinesse of <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, nor, by

               <p>Verie well I assure you. For, this we may boldly auouch,
namely, that by meanes of a <hi>melodious sound,</hi> or some other
like <hi>sensible matter,</hi> such as are <hi>actually</hi> afflicted of <hi>Satan,</hi> they
may haue their <hi>afflictions,</hi> for some season <hi>abated:</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>actuall possession of Satan</hi> it selfe be not vtterly expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and this also in a double respect. First, <hi>because</hi> the <hi>action</hi> of

consideration, when they would afflict any man with
their <hi>actuall torments:</hi> they doe eftsoones respect the <hi>naturall

the <hi>braine</hi> also of man, it being naturally more <hi>moist</hi> then any

that all <hi>shel-fish</hi> in the <hi>seas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aretius, in Math. 8. 16.</note> they are at the <hi>increase of the Moone,</hi>

his <hi>actuall torments</hi> in men: so surely (on the other side)

               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Secondly, this said mitigation of <hi>satan</hi> his <hi>actuall torments</hi>
inflicted on men, it may very easily be effected also if we but
consider aright as we ought: that, to the <hi>actuall afflicting</hi> of
any,<note place="margin">Pet. Martyr, in Iudic. cap. 5.</note> there is required in the <hi>patient,</hi> an apt <hi>apprehension</hi> of the
intended affliction. For, euen as <hi>delectation</hi> or pleasure, is none
other thing els but the <hi>coniunction of some conuenient actiue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Item, in loc. com. clas. 3. tit. de musica &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus.</note> 
                  <hi>to
some conuenient passiue,</hi> with an apt <hi>apprehension</hi> of the present
<hi>delight,</hi> in so much, as where there is no such <hi>apprehension,</hi> there
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:25312:145"/>
is no <hi>delectation:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pythagoras.</note> so surely, in <hi>affliction</hi> or heauinesse, which is
the <hi>coniunction</hi> of some conuenient <hi>actiue,</hi> to some conuenient
<hi>passiue,</hi> there must needs be an apt <hi>apprehension</hi> of the obiected
<hi>affliction,</hi> otherwise, where such <hi>apprehension</hi> is wanting, there
the <hi>affliction</hi> is no <hi>affliction</hi> at all. Whereupon it doth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follow, that, euen as that which <hi>diminisheth</hi> the <hi>apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
diminisheth</hi> also the <hi>affliction</hi> it selfe: so surely on the other
side, that which <hi>encreaseth the apprehension,</hi> it <hi>encreaseth</hi> also the
<hi>delectation</hi> intended. But, a <hi>melodious sound or musicall harmony,</hi>
it draweth vnto it the <hi>minds</hi> attention, and therewithall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth
the same from the offered <hi>affliction.</hi> And so, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it might very well <hi>lessen those torments</hi> which <hi>satan</hi> did
<hi>actually</hi> inflict vpon <hi>Saul,</hi> in as much as it drew the <hi>minds</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
vnto it, and withdrew the same (for that present) from
any such <hi>apprehension</hi> of the <hi>torments</hi> inflicted: but, by no
meanes in it selfe, the same might vtterly <hi>expell</hi> the <hi>actuall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi>
of the <hi>spirit</hi> in <hi>Saul,</hi> if any such were.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>If those <hi>torments actually</hi> inflicted by <hi>satan,</hi> might <hi>something
be lessened:</hi> then might they also <hi>be totally remooued.</hi> For, seeing
that <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> (as your selfe doth affirme) are vnable,
(at their owne pleasures) to alter the <hi>essentiall qualities</hi> of any
true <hi>naturall matter</hi> to serue their owne turne, but must doe it
by meanes of some <hi>corporall actiues:</hi> it followeth consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they are also of themselues vnable to afflict any man
<hi>actually,</hi> but, must do it by meanes of some such <hi>corporall actiues</hi>
as are able, very aptly to dispose the <hi>passiue</hi> matter it selfe, to
an apt <hi>apprehension</hi> of the <hi>afflictiue action</hi> in the party possessed.
And then, (according to your owne <hi>reason</hi> a little before) such
a <hi>disposition (by corporall or sensible meanes</hi>) may eftsoones be
wel procured in the <hi>body</hi> of man, as may make the same <hi>body</hi>
become vtterly vnapt for the present, to <hi>apprehend</hi> any the
<hi>actuall torments</hi> of <hi>satan.</hi> As for example, the <hi>disease</hi> called <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Damascenus, Philosophus, in 4. Ethic.</note>
which (as <hi>Damascene</hi> reports) <hi>is a perpetuall fury, very migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely

so may it (in like manner) be thoroughly and <hi>perfitely cured,</hi> it
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:25312:145"/>
being (as <hi>physitions</hi> affirme) an <hi>infirmity,</hi> eftsoones very cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But, the <hi>disease</hi> it selfe being perfitely cured, that former
<hi>disposition</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> (which was naturally enclined to the
speedy <hi>apprehension</hi> of those selfesame <hi>Demoniacall torments</hi> so
answerable vnto it) is in like manner remooued or staied: and
so by consequence, the <hi>actiue</hi> affliction of <hi>satan,</hi> it may be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
expelled from men, by an vtter expelling before of the
<hi>passiue disposition</hi> correspondent thereto in the party possessed.
Now then, if a <hi>melodious harmony</hi> hath in it selfe an apparant
<hi>efficacy,</hi> for the present appeasing of <hi>passions</hi> and greefes of the
<hi>mind,</hi> and for the timely procuring of present <hi>delights</hi> (as <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi>

consequently, that, that selfesame <hi>melodious sound,</hi> which
(by a <hi>sensible,</hi> or meere <hi>naturall quality</hi>) did vndoubtedly <hi>alter
the mental passions in Saul:</hi> the same might also <hi>quite change the

which was naturally inclineable before, to the speedy
<hi>apprehension</hi> of <hi>satan</hi> his <hi>actiue affliction</hi> was vtterly remooued,

               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Wel sir. Thus much first, you do fully confesse in your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere:
namely, that, by a <hi>melodious sound,</hi> or some <hi>sensible
meanes,</hi> there may wel be procured in the <hi>bodies,</hi> &amp; <hi>humours</hi> of
men, such an apt <hi>disposition,</hi> as the <hi>torments actually</hi> inflicted by
<hi>satan,</hi> may vndoubtedly be <hi>abated,</hi> or lessened. Howbeit, from
thence also, you would further inferre: that therefore, those
the said <hi>torments actually</hi> inflicted by <hi>Satan,</hi> they may in like
manner, be <hi>totally expelled.</hi> The <hi>reason</hi> of which your said <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
is vndoubtedly this. Namely, for that, by an vtter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing
of the <hi>passiue disposition</hi> apprehending those <hi>torments</hi>
inflicted: the <hi>actiue operation</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> is likewise vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued.
And so, when the <hi>diuell</hi> (to our seeming) afflicteth
no more: we must then be perswaded, that the <hi>euill spirit,</hi> is
vndoubtedly departed from thence, and the <hi>partie possessed</hi> is
quite deliuered. This (I suppose) is the verie summe of your
<hi>inference:</hi> and the <hi>reason</hi> also it selfe, wherewith you would
mannage the <hi>matter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>Yea sir, it is wholie the same.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:25312:146"/>
               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Then, this I must tell you for truth: that your <hi>assertion</hi> it is
too too absurde, and grounded altogither, vpon <hi>phantasticall</hi>
and idle <hi>conceits.</hi> For, first you imagine there can be no <hi>actuall
possessions</hi> at all: vnlesse some <hi>naturall disposition,</hi> or <hi>passion</hi> at
least, do offer before hand a free passage thereto. This (I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you) is vtterly vntrue, as may plainly appeere in the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Saul</hi> himselfe,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 9. 2.</note> of whom we entreate. For (he in all <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of nature</hi>) excelled his brethren by much; or any man
else in that age. He <hi>being a goodly yoong man, and faire, so as
among all the children of Israell, there was none more goodly then
Saul: being also from the shoulders vpward much higher then
any any in Israell.</hi> Thus then you see, there was no such <hi>redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie
of humors,</hi> nor no other such <hi>naturall defects in Sauls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
as might make him the more naturally disposed to the
speedie <hi>apprehension</hi> of any those <hi>actuall</hi> afflictions which <hi>satan</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 14.</note>
inflicted vpon him. And yet notwithstanding all this, the <hi>text,</hi>
it telleth vs plainely, that the <hi>spirit</hi> of the Lord departed from
<hi>Saul:</hi> and an <hi>euill spirit</hi> was sent from the <hi>Lord,</hi> to vexe him
withall. Secondly, you doe no lesse fondly imagine againe,
that, the <hi>diuell</hi> he is quite gone and departed: when he doth
not <hi>apparantly and actually</hi> afflict the possessed.<note place="margin">Math. 11. 29.</note> The vntruth of
this idle <hi>conceite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 11. 21. 26.</note> we neede not discouer at all: it being more
apparantly euident, then the <hi>Sunne-shine</hi> at mid-day. For, the
<hi>diuell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 17. 15.</note> eftsoones he slippeth aside according to <hi>sensuall appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marc. 9. 18. 21.</note>
when yet (in deed and in truth) he still continueth his
<hi>actuall residence.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 9. 38. 42.</note> Yea, this your idle <hi>conceit,</hi> as it fighteth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

any of your other conceits. Because, neither the <hi>actuall posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>

               <p>Well sir: I argue it further thus. If a <hi>melodious sound</hi> may
effectually procure such an <hi>apt disposition</hi> in the <hi>minde</hi> of a

some <hi>supernaturall gift,</hi> being lost before: then may it

               <p>If it be an <hi>holie ordinance,</hi> perpetually <hi>establisht by Christ,</hi> as
you beare vs in hand: then hath it also an apparant <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement</hi>
appertaining vnto it, for the <hi>authenticall approbation</hi> of
such a perpetuall establishment: &amp;, it hath also some certeine
<hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>rules,</hi> concerning out orderly directions therein.
But, no such <hi>commandement</hi> or <hi>canon</hi> is any where extant in
all the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> therefore, <hi>praier</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi> is no <hi>perpetuall

                  <hi>This kind goeth not foorth but by

                  <note place="margin">Marc. 9. 39.</note> therefore, from hencefoorth (saith <hi>Christ</hi>)
I do solemnly <hi>establish prayer and fasting,</hi> as a perpetuall <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,</hi>
for the powerfull expelling of <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> for

               <p>Againe, if the holy <hi>ghost</hi> in that place, had either <hi>expresly,</hi> or
<hi>implicatiuely</hi> entended to put downe a <hi>commaundement</hi> for the
perpetuall <hi>establishment</hi> of any such falsly supposed <hi>ordinance:</hi>
then surely, it is not to be doubted at all, but that (in a matter
especially of such sacred importance) he would neuer haue
left vs at randome, to deale therein as seemed good to our
selues, but (in some other place else at the least) he would haue
inserted such certeine <hi>canons</hi> and <hi>rules</hi> as should more <hi>fuly</hi>
haue serued for our <hi>orderly direction</hi> and guidance therein.
Howbeit,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 6. &amp;c.</note> neither in the <hi>epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romanes</hi> or <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
neither yet,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 28.</note> in any of those to <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> (where all

one <hi>rule</hi> at all, concerning the <hi>orderly practise</hi> of this your falsly
supposed <hi>perpetuall ordinance:</hi> and therefore, the <hi>same</hi> is no such
<hi>ordinance</hi> established by <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides that, the <hi>apostle Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8. 9.</note> hauing purposely laid open
the <hi>perpetuall vagaries of satan to kill and deuour,</hi> he maketh no
mention at all of <hi>praier</hi> and <hi>fasting,</hi> but onely of a <hi>strong faith</hi>
to resist him withall.<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 11. 12.</note> As also, the <hi>apostle Paul</hi> displaying pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
the <hi>compleate armour of christians against the power of the

for the timely withstanding of any <hi>his fiery darts.</hi> So then, sith
(<hi>in all</hi> the <hi>canonicall scriptures</hi>) there is neither <hi>commaundement</hi>
nor <hi>canon</hi> for the timely fortification of any such <hi>new-found or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance:</hi>
I wonder you blush not, to braue out the matter (as

the <hi>testimony of fathers</hi> old and new,<note place="margin">D. Apolog. pag. 32.</note> the <hi>practise of the

               <p>Very true. But <hi>ministers,</hi> whensoeuer they put vp their

do not that work, by reason of the onely <hi>generall duety,</hi> which
generally belongeth to <hi>euery christian:</hi> but rather, in regard
of their <hi>peculiar calling,</hi> and by vertue of a <hi>ministeriall function,</hi>

               <p>Master <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> let me <hi>argue this point.</hi> Come on <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cistes.</hi>
If your owne selfe (as you say) had then a more <hi>speciall
power</hi> to expell the <hi>diuell</hi> by <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>fasting,</hi> then any of
the rest: that your said <hi>power,</hi> it must needs be a <hi>vocall,</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
power</hi> at the least. My meaning is, that such a <hi>speciall
power,</hi> it proceeded either from your <hi>prayer;</hi> or your <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
but not from your <hi>prayer</hi> at all: for, the others also,
they <hi>prayed</hi> and <hi>fasted</hi> as deuoutly as you did your selfe,
albeit in vaine: and therefore, your <hi>prayer</hi> (of it selfe) it could
haue no more <hi>power</hi> then theirs, vnlesse hapily you haue some
<hi>speciall prayer,</hi> for that <hi>speciall purpose,</hi> beyond the rest of your

but your <hi>preaching</hi> (it should seeme) that expelled the
<hi>diuell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, if such a <hi>speciall power</hi> proceeded from your <hi>person
alone:</hi> then surely, that selfe same <hi>personall power,</hi> it was either
some <hi>naturall,</hi> or, <hi>supernaturall power</hi> at the least. Howbeit, a
meere <hi>naturall power</hi> it might not possibly be: because, no <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi>
or meere <hi>naturall power,</hi> may possibly extend foorth it

(in like manner) proceed from my <hi>person:</hi> for the timely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling

the one from the other: in as much as the <hi>verie cause</hi> it selfe
doth apparantly shine foorth in <hi>that selfesame effect</hi> which it
worketh. And, euen after such a manner, we must vnderstand
<hi>this matter</hi> in question. Because, the <hi>Diuine vertue</hi> it selfe (<hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially

for the same of necessitie (at all times and seasons) is euerie

                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> Howbeit that selfesame <hi>comparison,</hi> it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:25312:157"/>
not so currantly in a second respect. For, howsoeuer it is

                  <note place="margin">Luc. 24. 19.</note> to be also an

the <hi>Diuinitie of Christ to suffer afflictions in any respect.</hi> I meane,
either <hi>principally or instrumentally:</hi> because, the <hi>diuinitie</hi> it selfe,
is wholy <hi>impassible.</hi> Although yet I dare not denie, but that (in

proprieties of both natures in the one person of Christ</hi>) that
which is truely said of <hi>the one,</hi> may be as true said of <hi>the other.</hi>

said,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 16.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3. 14.</note> Because, Christ himselfe

accomplish the same. Neither yet, doe I account
<hi>the humanitie of Christ,</hi> and other <hi>the saints of God,</hi> as <hi>instruments</hi>

<hi>illustrated</hi> from the resemblance of a <hi>Carpenter</hi> entending, and

&amp; his <hi>axe</hi> as a <hi>seperated instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> to accomplish the same:

thing whatsoeuer, although yet the <hi>diuinitie</hi> it selfe
(so oft as seemeth him good) doth vse the <hi>humanitie of Christ</hi>
as a <hi>conioyned,</hi> and other <hi>good men,</hi> as a <hi>seperated instrument,</hi> for
the orderly accomplishment of many most <hi>admirable matters.</hi>
And therefore, euen as the <hi>axe</hi> can worke nothing at all, but
<hi>by the power of the hand,</hi> neither yet, <hi>the hand</hi> it selfe, but by the
onely direction of the <hi>Carpenters minde:</hi> so surely, the holiest
<hi>person</hi> on earth, can effect no <hi>admirable action</hi> at all, but in and

then, howsoeuer the <hi>humanitie of Christ,</hi> and many other <hi>good

to giue an extraordinarie <hi>visible token</hi> thereof, on <hi>Ananias

               <p>Why thus. If we dulie consider of all sortes of <hi>miracles</hi> in an
onely respect of the <hi>actiue vertue</hi> it selfe, <hi>which actually effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
those myracles:</hi> we shall plainely perceiue, that no one of

they are all of them, equally <hi>effected,</hi> by the <hi>onely diuine,</hi> and
<hi>infinite power of Iehouah</hi> himselfe: and are such, as doe wholie
surpasse the power of euery <hi>created nature,</hi> how holy soeuer.
So that (in this onely respect) there appeereth no difference at
all among any the <hi>miraculous actions of God:</hi> because, those

in all those the <hi>miraculous actions.</hi> Whether we respect

the curing of some sudden new sicknesse.</hi> Againe, if we also
respect the <hi>externall manner of effecting</hi> those admirable <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
we may likewise perceiue an apparant difference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
For, it is outwardly, more admirable <hi>to cure a leprosie by
word,</hi> then <hi>by touching or handling:</hi> and, more woonderfull by
much, <hi>to heale the diseased by a passible, or vanishing shadow,</hi> then
by <hi>an audible, or sounding word.</hi> Because, such a <hi>sounding word,</hi> is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:25312:162"/>
some matter, proceeding powerfully from the <hi>partie</hi> that

from the <hi>partie</hi> himselfe, but onely, <hi>a priuation of light, by

it is verie apparant, that, neither the <hi>humanitie of Christ</hi>

               <p>Neither could it be the <hi>historicall faith:</hi> because, that hath

               <p>You do ouer grosly forget your selfe. For not long since it

your owne <hi>faith</hi> apprehending onely, that effectuall <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

the <hi>possessed mans faith,</hi> the bare <hi>apprehender</hi> of that admirable

               <p>Nay sir, I call not <hi>their iustification</hi> in question, but do onely

                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:25312:166"/>

            <sp>

               <p>Well yet, by the <hi>tenour</hi> of your speech you would haue vs
imagine at least, that <hi>the iustifying faith of Christs disciples</hi> did
oftentimes <hi>ebbe and flowe with the moone:</hi> because (howsoeuer

the <hi>efficacie</hi> thereof (for that present) was suddenly falne to a

               </p>
               <p>And (which more is) we must (by the purport of your
speech) be further perswaded, that verie many whom <hi>Christ</hi>
(in the <hi>generall iudgement</hi>) will finally,<note place="margin">Math. 7. 22.</note> and iustly reiect as <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 2.</note> they had once (notwithstanding) the true <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 5. 6.</note> and <hi>finally fall from the

opinion of falling from grace:</hi> so doth it mightily <hi>weaken</hi> that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<hi>assurance of the sauing faith</hi> in all the <hi>elect.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Let it strengthen, or weaken whatsoeuer it will: verie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

               <p>If you meane such a <hi>worke, as your faith effected at Mahg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitton
of late,</hi> we are growne to an issue. Howbeit, if you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the <hi>iustifying faith</hi> may <hi>miraculously</hi> driue foorth a
<hi>diuell:</hi> then, <hi>all the elect</hi> (how vnexpert soeuer) they also are
<hi>sufficiently able</hi> to cast foorth <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> if they please.
For, they are all mutually interessed in the selfesame <hi>iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith:</hi> and do iointly participate with all the <hi>prerogatiues
thereof</hi> whatsoeuer, as well as any of the rest. Yea, then those

deale with the <hi>partie possessed:</hi> they might as effectually haue
<hi>dispatched that matter</hi> as you did your selfe: vnlesse haply you
imagine them but <hi>reprobates concerning the faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides all this, if the driuing out of <hi>diuels</hi> from men, be (as
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:25312:167"/>
you would haue vs imagine) the vndoubted <hi>effect</hi> of a <hi>iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

such a worke,</hi> they may <hi>doubt of their iustification in Iesus
Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and those other <hi>Preachers</hi> also (who eftsoones before,
and with your owne selfe at that present) attempted the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
in vaine: they may begin to make some scruple of <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
concerning the soundnes of their <hi>iustification,</hi> for <hi>their
faith could effect no such worke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly, if the powerfull expelling of <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels</hi> be in
deed (as your selfe doth auouch) the <hi>essentiall effect</hi> of a <hi>iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

verie many of the rest) it would vndoubtedly haue
beene <hi>reckoned vp</hi> in some one of those places at least, where
the <hi>other effects of that faith</hi> are purposely <hi>registred by the spirit
of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. 2. 3.</note> Howbeit, this <hi>powerfull</hi> expelling of <hi>diuels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 5. 6. 7.</note> is not anie
where mentioned amongst those other <hi>essentiall fruits of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

the <hi>faith of the Gospell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marc. 16. 17. 18.</note> For, after our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <p>Whatsoeuer Maister <hi>Beza</hi> or your selfe may imagine, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
certeine I am, that <hi>Christ</hi> speaketh there of that <hi>sauing faith</hi>
which doth <hi>orderly succeed</hi> the <hi>orderlie administration of the
word and sacraments:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marc. 16. 15.</note> saying thus. <hi>Goe yee into all the world, and
preach the Gospel to euery creature. He that beleeueth, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised,
he shalbe saued: he that beleeueth not, shalbe damned.</hi> And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
then (vpon this so solemne a determination concerning
the <hi>sauing faith</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi>) he addeth foorthwith (by the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulatiue
(and</hi>) the infallible <hi>tokens</hi> vndoubtedly succeeding that
<hi>sauing faith;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marc. 16. 17.</note> saying thus. And, these <hi>tokens</hi> shall follow them
that beleeue. <hi>In my name they shall cast out diuels,</hi> and so foorth.
Demonstrating very plainely vnto vs, that, the <hi>effectuall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
for expelling <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels:</hi> is an vndoubted <hi>effect</hi> of the
<hi>iustifying faith.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>No such <hi>demonstration</hi> at all. For, <hi>Christ</hi> (in that place) doth
onely declare what <hi>tokens</hi> should follow the <hi>preaching</hi> and
<hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but, puts downe no <hi>essentiall fruits</hi> or <hi>effects</hi>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:25312:168"/>
of a <hi>iustifying faith</hi> as we shewed before, and which may yet
more plainely appeare, if you rightly consider his <hi>maine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
it selfe, and the <hi>orderly course</hi> of his <hi>speech</hi> concerning the
same. The <hi>maine purpose of Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hugo Cardinal. in Marc. cap. 16. 17.</note> was to <hi>allure the elect</hi> to a
timely entertainement of the <hi>sauing faith</hi> of <hi>the Gospel:</hi> and
this he endeuoureth to do, partly, by an <hi>infallible promise of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
saluation to all the beleeuers,</hi> and partly, by an ineuitable
<hi>threatening of eternall damnation to all the vnbeleeuers</hi> thereof.
And now next (for their further <hi>confirmation</hi> in that selfesame
<hi>sauing faith</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi>) he addeth certeine <hi>temporary and
personall priuiledges,</hi> as infallible <hi>tokens</hi> and <hi>pledges</hi> of that his
<hi>eternall sauing power:</hi> I meane, the powerfull <hi>operation</hi> of many
most admirable &amp; <hi>miraculous actions.</hi> The which said <hi>personall
prerogatiues,</hi> our sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> did purposely bestow vpon
some certeine <hi>speciall persons:</hi> not that he would haue those
<hi>personall prerogatiues</hi> reputed as <hi>essentiall effects</hi> of a <hi>iustifying
faith,</hi> but, to be rather esteemed as <hi>temporary pledges</hi> or <hi>seales</hi>
for the perpetuall establishment of his <hi>glorious Gospel.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that in the end of the chapter, where it is said that <hi>the
Apostles went foorth and preached euery where;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marc. 16. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord working
effectually in euery of them, and confirming the word with miracles
following.</hi> Thus then you may plainely perceiue how <hi>Christ</hi>
putteth down those tokens, as <hi>temporary pledges</hi> or <hi>seales</hi> of
the <hi>perpetuall truth</hi> of his <hi>Gospel:</hi> and no <hi>essentiall effects</hi> of the
<hi>iustifying faith.</hi> And therefore, if you haue none other word
else for your <hi>purpose,</hi> but that one place of <hi>Christ</hi> where he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that <hi>this kind goeth not foorth but by praier and fasting,</hi> the
same (You see) will not serue your turne: it being not ment at

propounded vnto vs: as we heare in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that there

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:25312:169"/>

whereby we beleeue <hi>the promises of God,</hi> and do truely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<hi>his great mercy and grace in Iesus Christ:</hi> this properlie is
called <hi>the instifying faith.</hi> The <hi>third kind of faith,</hi> is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we doe firmely beleeue, that there is <hi>nothing impossible to
God,</hi> and whereby also the <hi>minde</hi> it selfe (<hi>by a speciall motion of
the spirit of God</hi>) is forciblie <hi>mooued</hi> to the powerfull effecting
of some <hi>admirable matters:</hi> and, this is properly called <hi>the faith
of miracles.</hi> The <hi>first kinde of faith is most generall,</hi> and reacheth
euen to the <hi>reprobates:</hi> in so much as <hi>satan</hi> also himselfe is
thought to enioy it,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 19.</note> according to that of <hi>Iames. Thou beleeuest

in Christ.</hi> Of this <hi>faith</hi> the <hi>Euangelist</hi> speaketh not heere: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

by <hi>vertue</hi> thereof.<note place="margin">Aug. Marlorat. in Math. cap. 17. 20.</note> The <hi>third kinde of faith,</hi> is onely a <hi>particular

vnto her.<note place="margin">Ioh. Caluin. in Math. 17. 20.</note> This <hi>kinde of faith,</hi> may fitly be called a <hi>particular,

hauing from thence her <hi>singular directions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 9.</note> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth

which (without doubt) must in no wise be vnderstood of the
<hi>iustifying faith:</hi> because (this being <hi>peculiar to some one, or a

some <hi>hidden facultie of nature</hi> her selfe three manner of
waies.</p>
               <p>1. For first, verie certaine it is, that <hi>Angels, diuels,</hi> and <hi>men</hi>
(expert in <hi>naturall philosophie</hi>) hauing a deepe insight into the
<hi>hidden secrets of nature:</hi> and being thoroughly <hi>experienced</hi> in

<hi>natural powers,</hi> to some such <hi>perexisting matter,</hi> as hath in it selfe,
a <hi>naturall disposition</hi> to euerie such <hi>action</hi> entended. For, from
the <hi>naturall coniunction</hi> of some such <hi>perexisting matter</hi> with
some <hi>proffered efficients,</hi> there will euen <hi>naturally succeed,</hi> some
such vndoubted <hi>effects,</hi> as the <hi>partie</hi> (procuring such <hi>naturall

sudden, and beyond the expectation of all the <hi>beholders</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
which doth eftsoones enforce them <hi>to admire</hi> at such rare,
and <hi>vnwoonted euents.</hi> For, the <hi>diuell</hi> himselfe, as also, those <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
persons in natures secrets,</hi> they doe verie well know,
that <hi>frogs, wormes,</hi> yea, and also some <hi>serpents,</hi> are easily <hi>engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>
of some <hi>putrified matter perexisting in nature:</hi> especially, if
there be <hi>added</hi> to euerie such <hi>putrified matter,</hi> and of <hi>heat;</hi> by

this the foresaid <hi>conioyning of putrified matter,</hi> an <hi>actiue heat</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
being not verie difficult for <hi>diuels,</hi> and for cogging

               </p>
               <p>2 Secondly, the <hi>diuell</hi> himselfe, and so many besides as haue
any insight at all into the <hi>secrets of nature,</hi> they doe very well
know,<note place="margin">Philosophus, de som. &amp; vigil. libr.</note> that some sodaine <hi>commotion</hi> of the <hi>naturall spirits,</hi> of
<hi>bloud,</hi> and of <hi>humours,</hi> do mightily <hi>disturbe</hi> and distemper the
<hi>bodies</hi> of men. Insomuch as the <hi>imaginations,</hi> the <hi>formes,</hi> and
<hi>representations</hi> of things raised vp and conserued in those
selfesame <hi>commotions:</hi> are eftsoones exhibited to the <hi>phantasie</hi>
or <hi>imaginatiue facultie,</hi> at the verie same instant the <hi>commotion</hi>
was made, yea, and eftsoones also, euen in that <hi>selfe same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
and <hi>order</hi> wherein it pleaseth the <hi>disturber of our spirits and
humours</hi> to conuaie those selfesame <hi>representations.</hi> By which
said <hi>meanes</hi> verie many and sundrie <hi>visions</hi> do foorthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere
to the <hi>phantasie:</hi> as we may plainly perceiue in so many
as are fearefully affected with <hi>Phrenesies.</hi> Yea, and (which
more is) the matter it selfe may be brought to such issue, as
those selfe same <hi>representations</hi> which are inwardly conserued
in the <hi>imaginatiue facultie:</hi> they may, and are eftsoones <hi>recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
to the <hi>externall senses</hi> themselues. In so much as the <hi>partie</hi>
(preposterously affected therewith) doth verie <hi>strongly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi>
that he vndoubtedly <hi>beholdeth</hi> those selfesame things with
his <hi>eies,</hi> which were apprehended before, in the <hi>phantasie, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi>
or <hi>common sense,</hi> and are conuersant wholy therewith:
whereas (in deed and in truth) there was neuer any such
<hi>matter</hi> existing <hi>essentially</hi> in outward appearance.</p>
               <p>3. Lastly, many like <hi>admirable matters</hi> may verie easily, and
(as it were) with a trice,<note place="margin">Magister sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. lib. 2. dist. 7. fol. 87.</note> be foorthwith effected both by <hi>diuels</hi>

(in an outward <hi>sensible seeming,</hi> and by a <hi>nimble conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>)
both may be, and are eftsoones effected by <hi>seducing

                  <note place="margin">See M. Darels Apolog. pag. 33.</note>
that is no <hi>miracle.</hi> But, the driuing out of <hi>diuels</hi> by <hi>praier and

               <p>First, make plaine the <hi>ambiguous terme (meanes</hi>) in your

thereby, any such <hi>essentiall meanes,</hi> as, either <hi>naturally,</hi> or <hi>artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially</hi>
at least, hath in it selfe, some <hi>energeticall force,</hi> for the

               <p>I vnderstand not any such <hi>essentiall meanes</hi> at all: but such a

that selfesame <hi>accidentall meanes,</hi> not hauing any further force

               <p>This then I dare tel you for truth: that, your <hi>assumption</hi> is
vtterly false. For, the powerfull expelling of <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels,</hi>
was neuer effected by any such <hi>meanes,</hi> but, by the onely <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
power of the Lord,</hi> as hath been sufficiently prooued

For,<note place="margin">See M. Darels Doct. in pag. 59.</note> although the <hi>assurance</hi> is, and may be great in this

<hi>meanes beeing vsed:</hi> because, <hi>God</hi> is at liberty, to blesse the
<hi>meanes</hi> he hath appointed to this ende: or to withhold his
blessing from it. And, in this <hi>latter case:</hi> what will any <hi>meanes</hi>
profit or preuaile?</p>

               <speaker>Physiologus.</speaker>
               <p>Your <hi>minde</hi> (it shoud seeme) is mightily amazed with the
matter in question: your speeches they are so fearefully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted

great in this case: and yet, you cannot be <hi>assured</hi> of the <hi>parties
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:25312:175"/>
deliuerance.</hi> Because, the whole successe of that busines, doth
wholie depend vpon the <hi>great blessing of God:</hi> without which
the <hi>meanes</hi> cannot possiblie preuaile, or profit in any respect.
Oh, heere are crowded vp closely togither, an huge company

they be not al bound the sooner vnto the <hi>good behauiour:</hi> some

But goe to: what if your saide <hi>meanes</hi> should <hi>be blessed
of God?</hi> My meaning is this; What if the <hi>Lord,</hi> euen at your
<hi>praier</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi> be entreated to driue foorth a <hi>diuell?</hi> Were
that worke, thus effected (as you fondlly imagine) by <hi>meanes:</hi>
no <hi>miraculous action</hi> at all?</p>

               <p>Howsoeuer you frame <hi>expositions</hi> to fitte your owne turne,
the holie <hi>Ghost,</hi> he knoweth best how to enterpret himselfe:

                  <hi>and by diuers</hi> miracles. In which place, either he doth plainely
<hi>distinguish miracles</hi> from <hi>signes</hi> and <hi>woonders:</hi> or else he makes
but a needlesse <hi>tautologie</hi> at the least, which were absurd to
auouch. And therefore, my former <hi>distinction of woonders,</hi> and

               </p>
               <p>Howbeit,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 18. 33.</note> as <hi>Tautologies</hi> are verie frequent and ordinarie

told <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that his <hi>double dreames,</hi> did both of them tende

time doubled, because the matter it selfe foreshewed thereby,
was certeinly establisht by God.</hi> So surely, in that place to the
<hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the often repetition of <hi>miracles</hi> by those seuerall
termes of <hi>signes,</hi> of <hi>woonders,</hi> and of <hi>sundrie powers,</hi> it is no need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<hi>Tautologie,</hi> as you do triflingly tell vs: but rather a most

               <p>Notwithstanding, if you will in no wise be perswaded, but
that (howsoeuer) some difference there is concerning those

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:25312:179"/>
there is no difference at all as touching their <hi>primarie efficient,</hi>

power of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. Caluin. in Heb. 2. 3. 4.</note> But the difference (if any at all) respecteth <hi>their

               </p>
               <p>As for example, first,<note place="margin">Edw. Dearin, in his 7. Reading, Hebr. 2. 3. 4.</note> the holie <hi>Ghost</hi> doth call <hi>miracles,

               </p>
               <p>Againe, he calleth them <hi>woonders:</hi> because they were

               <p>Lastly, he calleth them <hi>powers:</hi> because they had in them, <hi>an

the whole <hi>difference</hi> that may be discerned concerning these
matters. The which as it truely declareth vnto vs, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable

                  <note place="margin">Marc. 16. 20.</note> Where the <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list</hi>

               <p>On the other side, if you wrought a <hi>woonder</hi> at least: then

               </p>
               <p>If onely a <hi>false woonder,</hi> then you effected the same, either

(whether the same was effected by <hi>meanes,</hi> or without <hi>meanes</hi>)
it was an vndoubted true <hi>miracle.</hi> And therefore, you are now

the <hi>testification of Christ his Deitie,</hi> and the <hi>confirmation of the

then, you may plainely perceiue, that, those <hi>two maine ends

               <p>In like maner, if the admirable effecting of <hi>miraculous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

there must necessarily appeare in the <hi>christian churches,</hi>
such <hi>an externall basenesse</hi> by the <hi>ceasing of miracles:</hi> that the

the <hi>inconstancy of scandalized reprobates,</hi> more euidently <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:</hi>

other <hi>signes</hi> or <hi>woonders</hi> then those, neither we, nor our fathers

vnto vs, and we doe <hi>beleeue the Gospell,</hi> in token that
our <hi>faith</hi> is freely accepted with <hi>God:</hi> he hath taken awaie
<hi>signes</hi> and <hi>woonders</hi> from vs, which serued vs fitly before, when
we were vnbeleeuers. And surely, our <hi>faith</hi> is neuer so <hi>honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>

nor we so highly in the <hi>fauour of God:</hi> as when we haue

that we haue now taken fast hold of all <hi>the good promises of the</hi>

               <p>Surely sir, (so farre as we can perceiue) his <hi>Euen-song</hi> and
<hi>Morne-song,</hi> they are one and the same. Neuertheles, we haue
(by our vrgent, and often entreaties) preuailed so much with
the man, as that he is nowe exceedingly willing to accept of
your <hi>Christian</hi> offer, concerning one halfe howers <hi>conference</hi>

there may be great hope of his happie <hi>conuersion.</hi> Come on

               </p>
               <p>That there are <hi>essentiall spirits</hi> and <hi>diuels,</hi> we prooued direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from their <hi>essentiall creations,</hi> and <hi>effectuall operations:</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
withall, those beastly <hi>anthropomorphites,</hi> and <hi>swinish Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,</hi>
who (in these our daies) doe impudently denie, that,
there is <hi>either Angell or diuell.</hi> And this (in effect) was the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>It was so, I confesse.</p>

               <p>The next,<note place="margin">A summarie abridgement of the second Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</note> (concerning the <hi>vndoubted dominion or power of
the diuell</hi>) it was likewise apparantly prooued; that <hi>spirits</hi> and
<hi>diuels,</hi> they haue no such <hi>possession</hi> in men, as the world doth
fondly imagine. Both, because the worde (<hi>possession</hi>) is no
where (in any such sense) to be found throughout the whole
<hi>Bible:</hi> &amp; for that also, if the same were so to be found, yet must
it be taken <hi>metaphorically,</hi> for, so onely the <hi>Scriptures</hi> doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
their <hi>nature, operation, and power</hi> vnto vs. Admitting
you therefore, the worde <hi>possession in a metaphoricall meaning:</hi>
wee confessed that selfesame <hi>dominion or power of spirits and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels,</hi>
to be two-fold. Namely, either <hi>a power of possession:</hi> or <hi>a
power of obsession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By their power of <hi>possession,</hi> we vnderstood that their <hi>authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
authoritie, iurisdiction,</hi> or <hi>interest,</hi> which they vsurping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(by <hi>the operatiue permission of God</hi>) doe exercise ouer some
speciall men, in afflicting, tormenting, and vexing their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
And, this their saide <hi>power of possession,</hi> it must needes be
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:25312:189"/>
(we told you) either <hi>reall,</hi> or <hi>actuall.</hi> By the <hi>reall possession,</hi> (we
tolde you) was ment an <hi>essentiall,</hi> or <hi>personall</hi> entring in men:
the which we vtterlie reiected as a palpable vntruth, absurd
in <hi>Philosophie,</hi> and vnsound in <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> as by vnanswerable
<hi>arguments,</hi> authenticall <hi>authorities,</hi> and plaine euidence of
<hi>Scripture</hi> was apparantly prooued vnto you. Telling you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that, if such a <hi>reall possession</hi> be granted, the same must be
either a <hi>mentall,</hi> or <hi>corporall possession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>real-ment all possession</hi> we flatly denied. Because else the
<hi>possessed mans minde,</hi> it must needs be a <hi>locall-receptacle, essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and substantially comprehending the diuell</hi> for the present:
which (by the verie swaie of <hi>arguments,</hi> the <hi>authoritie of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and plaine <hi>euidence of Scriptures</hi>) we fully confuted. And
this also (in effect) was the verie summe or scope of our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>conference.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Then next,<note place="margin">A summarie abridgement of the 3. Dialogue.</note> concerning the <hi>reall-corporall possession,</hi> that also
we reiected, as fond and friuolous: it being a matter neuer
purposed by the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe, in the first <hi>creation of bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, else the <hi>minde</hi> it selfe must be vniustly charged, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
all those her <hi>animall, and organicall operations,</hi> which
(without any her consent, and approbation) are violently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
vpon the <hi>possessed mans bodie:</hi> or, if (the <hi>possessed</hi> himselfe
being freed from those operations) the <hi>diuell</hi> alone should be
called to account for the guilt of those <hi>actions,</hi> then something
(concerning the <hi>possessed</hi> himselfe) should be <hi>acted</hi> by him to
no purpose.</p>
               <p>Besides that, such <hi>a real corporall possession</hi> (the <hi>diuell</hi> being
onely a <hi>spirituall substance</hi>) cannot possiblie be perceiued of
the <hi>possessed</hi> himselfe, but onely <hi>effectiuely:</hi> and therefore there
can be no sensible perceiuance of any such <hi>essentiall possession,</hi>
vnlesse we retaine the <hi>Platonists</hi> opinion, concerning <hi>corporall
diuels.</hi> A thing directly opposite to <hi>reason,</hi> to the <hi>testimonie of
writers:</hi> and the plaine euidence of sacred <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And, this
also (as I take it) was in effect, the summe of our third <hi>confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>I may with no good conscience denie it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:25312:190"/>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Then next (because your selfe so earnestly insisted vpon the
<hi>reall corporall possession</hi>) it was further declared vnto you,<note place="margin">A summarie abridgement of the 4. Dialogue.</note> that
(if the same should be granted) the <hi>diuels</hi> then, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
haue such a kinde of <hi>possession,</hi> either by <hi>assuming</hi> to
themselues some <hi>true naturall bodie:</hi> or, by <hi>transforming</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into some <hi>true naturall bodie</hi> at least.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>assuming of true naturall bodies</hi> wee flatly reiected,
as an <hi>opinion</hi> too too vnreasonable, absurd, and most senslesse:
whether we vnderstand the same of bodies <hi>created</hi> before, or
of bodies, then foorthwith to be created. And that therefore
the <hi>diuell</hi> his tempting of <hi>Euah</hi> by the <hi>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Angell</hi> his
deliuerie of a sensible speech, by <hi>Baalam</hi> his <hi>Asse,</hi> the <hi>diuell</hi> his
supposed <hi>assuming of Samuels bodie,</hi> with such other <hi>examples</hi>
and <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which verie manie doe most ignorantly vrge
for this <hi>matter:</hi> they are too too grosly and fondly abused, as
we prooued vnto you by <hi>arguments,</hi> by <hi>writers,</hi> and by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>scriptures.</hi> And this also (if I be not fowly deceiued) was
in effect the summe of our fourth <hi>conference.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>I dare not denie any part thereof.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A summarie abridgement of the 5. Dialogue.</note> Then next (for the <hi>diuell</hi> his <hi>transforming</hi> of himselfe into
any <hi>true naturall bodie</hi>) we declared vnto you, the <hi>impossibilitie,</hi>
and most palpable <hi>absurditie</hi> thereof, notwithstanding the
<hi>Sorcerers rods transformed</hi> as you thought) into true <hi>naturall
serpents,</hi> the supposed <hi>transfiguring of Nebuchad-nezzer into an
oxe,</hi> with such other examples. Shewing you withall (by the
conference of places) that, that place of <hi>Scripture</hi> which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of <hi>Satan his transforming</hi> of himselfe into an <hi>Angell of
light,</hi> was misunderstood of the most.</p>
               <p>Neither may the same, or any like places of <hi>scripture,</hi> be <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally</hi>
vnderstood of any <hi>essential transformations;</hi> because that
work was neuer in <hi>the power of a diuel.</hi> No, he cannot possibly
<hi>transforme</hi> him selfe into any <hi>true forme</hi> whatsoeuer, if <hi>Christ
his argument</hi> (concerning the <hi>non visibility,</hi> and <hi>palpability</hi> of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
and <hi>diuels</hi>) be without contradiction: which it could not
be, if the <hi>diuel</hi> was able (but onely in outward appearance) to
<hi>transforme</hi> him selfe into any <hi>true forme</hi> whatsoeuer, as wee
proued by <hi>reason,</hi> by <hi>fathers,</hi> and by the <hi>canonicall scriptures.</hi>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:25312:190"/>
And this also, was (in effect) the summe of our fift <hi>confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>I wil (at no hand) contradict your report.</p>

               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Hauing thus dispatched the supposed <hi>real possession of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A summarie abridgement of the 6. Dialogue.</note>
                  <hi>and diuels:</hi> we entred then into a like serious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their <hi>actuall possession:</hi> shewing you first, <hi>what it was:</hi> and
then next, <hi>the seuerall parts thereof.</hi> Namely, either, a <hi>mentall
afflicting</hi> and greeuing: or, a <hi>corporall tormenting</hi> and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>We shewed you further, that this <hi>actuall possession,</hi> was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>vse</hi> in the daies of <hi>Christ</hi> and of his <hi>disciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit, the <hi>maine ends</hi> thereof (namely, the <hi>declaration of

in those daies very effectually accomplished: the <hi>possession</hi>
also, it was (by our Sauiour himselfe) verie fully, and finallie
determined. Yea, and the <hi>determination</hi> of this actuall possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we confidently auouched, notwithstanding any one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pretended by you, for the <hi>perpetuitie</hi> thereof: as was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
prooued by force of <hi>argument,</hi> by the plaine testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of <hi>ancient writers,</hi> and the ineuitable euidence of the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>And then next (because you insisted still vpon the <hi>perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of actuall possession,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A summarie abridgement of the 7. Dialogue.</note> by an <hi>argument</hi> drawne from <hi>common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
in all that beheld your supposed <hi>action,</hi> wrought at

supposed <hi>experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> it could be <hi>accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted</hi> no <hi>currant experience</hi>
in deed. Both, because manie like admirable <hi>matters</hi> may be
demonstrated from meere <hi>naturall causes, effects,</hi> and <hi>diseases:</hi>
and for that also, a meere <hi>naturall experience</hi> (when the same is
brought to the best) it may be no <hi>competent Iudge</hi> in such <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
matters.</hi> A thing opposite to <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> to <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,</hi>
to <hi>Physicke,</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> to <hi>Lawe,</hi> and to <hi>Conscience,</hi> as may
verie plainely appeere: whether we respect the <hi>action it selfe,</hi>
or the <hi>manner of doing the same.</hi> Then after all this, we came
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:25312:191"/>
to entreate of <hi>Satan his power of obsession:</hi> which consisteth
especially, in <hi>an outward assaulting</hi> and circumuenting, or, in an
<hi>inward suggesting</hi> and tempting. And this also in effect, was
the summe of our seuenth <hi>conference.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>The whole truth thereof, is without contradiction.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Hauing thus handled the <hi>power of spirits and diuels</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer:<note place="margin">A summarie abridgement of the 8. Dialogue.</note>
we came next to entreat of that <hi>extraordinarie working
power,</hi> whereby their saide <hi>power</hi> was subdued. Shewing you
directly, that the same was either <hi>immediate in Christ the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi>
or <hi>mediate,</hi> in some certeine <hi>speciall persons,</hi> extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
mooued to that selfesame busines.</p>
               <p>Againe, the <hi>mediate power</hi> we told you, it was either <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall,</hi>
I meane, in the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselues, an admirable extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
good <hi>meanes,</hi> to confirme their extraordinary <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings:</hi>
or else <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> that is, in the seuentie <hi>Disciples,</hi>
and some others succeeding. And that therefore this <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
power,</hi> it was more especially to be considered againe,
in respect either of the <hi>Churches primitiue:</hi> the <hi>Churches</hi> I
meane more <hi>immediately</hi> succeeding the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselues:
or in the <hi>Churches successiue</hi> at the least. And heere we han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
at large the <hi>continuance,</hi> and compasse of that <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
power:</hi> declaring plainely vnto you, that this selfesame <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
power</hi> (howsoeuer most egerly attempted, and
<hi>apishly</hi> imitated of some in euerie age) it consisted not in anie
<hi>created,</hi> or meere <hi>naturall meanes</hi> whatsoeuer, neither yet, in
the onely <hi>bare practise of praier and fasting:</hi> as was sufficientlie
shewed by force of <hi>reason,</hi> authoritie of <hi>writers,</hi> and the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
euidence of <hi>canonicall Scriptures.</hi> And this also in effect

                  <hi>The personal power,</hi> we
tolde you, it must more especially proceede, from either <hi>the

that praieth,</hi> we told you, he hath no such <hi>personall power:</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
you laboured to support that <hi>opinion,</hi> from a <hi>personal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in Christ.</hi> The <hi>partie that is praied vnto</hi> (namely the <hi>Lord</hi>)
although he vndoubtedly hath such an absolute <hi>supernaturall
power,</hi> as is able foorthwith to effect such a worke: yet, the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating
therewith</hi> must needs be effected by the timely <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,</hi>
either of a <hi>iustifying</hi> or <hi>miraculous faith.</hi> The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of that power, by the meanes of a <hi>iustifying faith</hi> we
flatly denied, it being an <hi>opinion</hi> too too preposterous, as we

supernaturall <hi>power of God</hi> by the onely <hi>meanes</hi> of a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
faith:</hi> that apprehension also, we flatly refuted. Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
you first, what <hi>true miracles are.</hi> And declaring withall,
that this your supposed <hi>action</hi> wrought at <hi>Mahgnitton,</hi> if it
were in such sort effected, as you beare vs in hand: then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(howsoeuer you would cunningly suppresse the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
thereof by your new coyned <hi>distinction</hi> of <hi>mirandum</hi>
and <hi>miraculum</hi>) the same vndoubtedly it was a <hi>true miracle.</hi>
And that therefore, either you must vtterly disclaime the
whole <hi>action</hi> it selfe, as a meere <hi>sophisticall practize</hi> of some: or
acknowledge (at least) that you effected a <hi>miracle.</hi> Which (we
told you) you might in no wise auouch: because the <hi>working
of miracles</hi> was long since determined. All which we proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
directly by the verie sway of <hi>argument,</hi> by a <hi>grand-Iurie</hi> of
ancient <hi>fathers:</hi> and by the vnmeasurable true euidence of
the <hi>canonicall scriptures.</hi> And this in effect, was the verie true

these our dialogical discourses. Tell vs therefore directly your

               <p>My answere in few words is this: I cannot gainesay the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted

               <p>Seeing then you haue hitherto heard, that the word (<hi>posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>)
is not any where to be found (respecting this <hi>Question</hi>)
in all the <hi>Canonicall scriptures.</hi> Seeing, albeit such <hi>possession of
spirits and diuels</hi> should be admitted in an onely <hi>metaphoricall</hi>
meaning, yet there was neuer any <hi>reall,</hi> but onely an <hi>actuall
possession:</hi> seeing such <hi>actuall possession</hi> was onely but <hi>temporarie</hi>
for some <hi>speciall respects,</hi> and long since, euen <hi>actually</hi> also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by Christ: seeing moreouer, that the dispossessing
of <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels</hi> (whatsoeuer, and by whomsoeuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted)
was euermore effected by an <hi>extraordinarie power</hi>
of the Lord either <hi>immediately</hi> or <hi>mediately:</hi> Seeing the <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
power</hi> was onely <hi>peculiar,</hi> and peculiarly applied by some
<hi>speciall persons</hi> for speciall respects: seeing that <hi>power</hi> is now
<hi>finally</hi> restrayned from men, because those the <hi>former respects</hi>
are fully accomplished: seeing also the working of <hi>miracles</hi> is
ceased long since: briefly, seeing the <hi>improbable affirmation</hi> of
any thing opposite to any the precedent points, is not onely
<hi>absurd in Philosophie,</hi> but also <hi>vnsound in Diuinitie,</hi> as hath
beene declared at large: we doubt not, but that the truth of
the <hi>premisses</hi> (breaking foorth now as it doth, like the <hi>Sunne</hi>
in his strength) the same will now be so pretious in your eies,
and so far forth preuaile with your iudgement at least, as that
(in an holy approbation thereof) you will willingly submit
and subscribe to the same.</p>

               <p>Nay sir, howsoeuer I doe happily iumpe with your selfe in
the soundnes of <hi>iudgements</hi> concerning the sound truth of
euerie thing handled before: yet may I by no meanes submit

               <p>What man? doe neuer say so for shame. Shall any <hi>respects</hi>
(how substantiall soeuer in outward appearance) so much

foorthwith enforce your <hi>vnruly affections</hi> against your owne

               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>First, by such a submission, I should be discredited much, be
deemed too to inconstant, yea, &amp; accounted but a cowardly
<hi>dastard:</hi> in, now growing wearie vnder that selfesame <hi>crosse,</hi>
which I haue hitherto, so confidently, and so couragiously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, now I perceiue, what hath hitherto with held you from
submitting your selfe to authority: namely the paltry respect
of your <hi>worldly estimation.</hi> But, goe to, let vs soundly examine
the seueral <hi>points</hi> of this your <hi>primary respect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First therefore (concerning your supposed discredit, by
such an holy submission) doe know this I beseech you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it for certeine, that, it is vndoubtedly a good <hi>Christians</hi>
praise before <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>church, to cease to do euil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 1. 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and to learne
to do well:</hi> and which more is, to submit him selfe, his <hi>senses,</hi> his
<hi>reason,</hi> his <hi>wil,</hi> and all his <hi>affections</hi> to a sounder dexteritie
in all things, and to bee onelie constant in that which is
good.</p>
               <p>As for valour and courage, we must hold this for infallible
truth; namely, that onely in good <hi>matters, it is good to be feruent
and zealous, whether the Apostle</hi> (I meane any of the godly) <hi>be
present, or absent.</hi> Yea, and to be highly ashamed of <hi>the ignorance
of your owne soule:</hi> but, not ashamed at all, to submitte to the
<hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for constancy vnder the <hi>crosse,</hi> consider. I pray you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which you suffer, be <hi>the true crosse of Christ,</hi> or a iust
<hi>scourge</hi> for your sinnes.<note place="margin">Aug. in Psalm. 34. part. 2.</note> There were three (you know) on the
<hi>crosse</hi> at once: the first <hi>a sauiour,</hi> the second <hi>to be saued,</hi> the third
<hi>to be damned.</hi> All these, they endured the <hi>selfesame paine,</hi> but,
did not all vndergoe the <hi>selfesame cause.</hi> So then, <hi>it is not the
martyrdome it selfe, but, the cause of the martyrdome that maketh
a martyr.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 5. 10.</note> You are not therefore, simply to reioice in suffering:
but; in suffering especially for righteousnesse sake.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 13.</note> And, who is
it (I pray you) <hi>that can harme you at all, if only you follow the thing
that is good?</hi> On the other side, what praise is it vnto you, if,
<hi>when you be iustly buffetted for your owne faultes</hi> (as herein you
haue been) <hi>you take it patiently?</hi> But,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 20.</note> if when you do wel (which
vndoubtedly you should do in yeelding submission) if then (I
say) <hi>you suffer euil vndeserued</hi> (by vndergoing with patience,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:25312:193"/>
the <hi>cynical censures</hi> of some <hi>giddy conceitours</hi>) this is <hi>thankwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
and <hi>acceptable before the Maiesty of our eternall God.</hi> And
therefore, this your <hi>primary</hi> respect for not submitting your
selfe: it is (you see) very fond, and preposterous.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but by this my <hi>submission,</hi> I should giue our aduersaries
great occasion, <hi>to insult ouer the brethren afresh in farre better
causes then this:</hi> as we found by experience, how highly they
triumphed ouer the intended <hi>discipline</hi> of late, by reason of

               <p>If your owne dealings, in these your preposterous courses,
doe as deepely discredit <hi>the holy ordinance of praier and fasting,</hi>
as <hi>Hackets seduction</hi> disgraced (in the iudgement of some) the
entended <hi>church discipline:</hi> I hope then you will neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
much lesse entitle them <hi>aduersaries to sincere religion</hi>
(howsoeuer opposite to these your practises) that shal seeke,
by due meanes to suppresse the <hi>irregularity</hi> of your intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
humour.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, if these your disordered attempts haue mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
iust occasion for any to <hi>insult ouer the brethren</hi> (as you
say) <hi>afresh, in far better causes then this:</hi> when you see such fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>effects</hi> to follow your <hi>fooleries,</hi> you may neuer blame the
<hi>insulters</hi> themselues, but your owne <hi>indiscretion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howsoeuer, I do aduise you in all loue, to reckon this <hi>late-giuen

God and men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the inconsiderate and vnchristian <hi>insultings</hi> of any,
ouer good and <hi>Christian causes;</hi> let not their <hi>euil dealings</hi> that
way, make you <hi>to constant in euil.</hi>

               <p>But yet sir, by this so vnseasonable a <hi>submission</hi> of mine, I
should <hi>scandalize the zealous professours,</hi> and offend sundry <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,</hi>
and <hi>noble personages,</hi> both <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Ladies,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
others of good estimation: who (fauouring rightly the

zealous entertaining of a newly <hi>reuealed truth,</hi> can, euer <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
such sincere professours,</hi> as are zealously, and <hi>rightly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi>
As for offending any <hi>honorable personages</hi> or others in
any account, who (<hi>wishing reformation</hi>) haue hetherto affected
<hi>your cause</hi> and mainteined <hi>your person:</hi> know this, and know it
for truth, that if those <hi>honorable personages</hi> (euen in a sincere
regard of some <hi>holy reformation</hi>) haue hitherto affected <hi>your
cause,</hi> so far foorth at the least, as they supposed the same <hi>to be
sound and good:</hi> then, doubt not at all, but that they wil much
more affect <hi>your holy and hoped conuersion,</hi> so soone especially, as
their <hi>enlightned iudgements</hi> shall once but soundly perceiue
the infallible <hi>truth.</hi> Yea and which more is, they will then be
much more forewards in supporting <hi>your person and state,</hi> then
euer before.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, those your <hi>maintainers,</hi> they might be supposed
to affect your <hi>cause,</hi> and to support your <hi>person,</hi> in an onelie
<hi>malcontentednes,</hi> rather against the persons of some in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
then in any true <hi>mindednes</hi> towards reformation indeed.
And which more is, you your owne selfe (by persisting as you
doe in your <hi>errour</hi>) you may be supposed of all (as you are
shrewdly suspected of some) to be rather their <hi>humorist</hi> in
an onely respect of <hi>their hier:</hi> then anie their approoued
<hi>martialist</hi> to mannage <hi>these matters,</hi> in any right reuerend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

withhold you from the dutifull discharge of a <hi>Christian consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
No, no, be you rather assured of this, that your obstinate
holding out with a setled pertinacie in this your peeuish
opinion, it will more discredit you with the <hi>true Church of
Christ,</hi> then your humble submission would do, by a thousand
degrees.</p>
               <p>Neither, let any falslie supposed feare of <hi>future wants,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
you herein: both because true <hi>repentance</hi> depriues not a
man from the fauour of God, or his fatherly <hi>prouidence,</hi> but
bindeth them so much the more firmely vnto him: and for
that also, this your refusall to yeeld, in an onely feare of some
falslie supposed <hi>wants,</hi> it would but confirme that hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
which many haue had against you of late. Who doe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
giue it foorth, that (howsoeuer you cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
your fault concerning these matters) you will neuer be
brought to acknowledge the same. Because (in standing thus
stoutly as you do to your <hi>tackling,</hi>) you do get better <hi>mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
by your <hi>imprisonment,</hi> then you could otherwaies gaine
by your <hi>enlargement.</hi> And therefore, if it were for none other
cause else, but, to take away <hi>occasion</hi> from such as seeke for <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi>
to depraue the holie <hi>profession,</hi> doe you foorthwith sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

and this also I dare say for so many besides, as haue beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with your former sinceritie and vpright cariage:
they are euerie of them, free from such a <hi>perswasion.</hi> This one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is that which we entertaine, and verie confidently hold for
a truth. Namely, that the <hi>gracelesse boy,</hi> did gracelesly counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:25312:195"/>
and <hi>knauishly</hi> beare the world in hand, he was <hi>really posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Satan:</hi> when there was no such matter at all. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your owne selfe, we do vndoubtedly thinke, that you
being fully perswaded of the <hi>perpetuitie of reall possessions,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
most strongly deluded with an <hi>erronious opinion</hi> of your
owne abilitie for the powerfull <hi>dispossessing of diuels by prayer
and fasting:</hi> did thereupon simply vndertake that trifling
worke. This then is our <hi>opinion</hi> concerning your selfe in the
<hi>action:</hi> namely, that the same was simply your <hi>errour in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but no purposed <hi>errour in your practize</hi> at all. This is that
we would haue you reuoke: and this is that wherin we would
haue you submit your selfe to authoritie. And why should you
not willingly yeeld to the same? Thinke you it impossible for
your selfe to be deluded by the <hi>diuell:</hi> or to be deceiued at all
by a <hi>cogging companion?</hi> Was not the reuerend father Maister
<hi>Foxe,</hi> and many others besides, as grosly beguiled by such
counterfeit <hi>crankes</hi> as euer was you with this your faisely <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed

                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:25312:196"/>
which you so constantly foretold and auouched to be in the

before. For if there was in him such a <hi>repossession</hi> in deed:
then, where was your <hi>reioynder</hi> for the casting of him out by
