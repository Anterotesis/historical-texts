            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or I write onely to you that haue, or at leaſt deſire earnestly to haue a part in that glory which is already in part, and ſhall ſhortly be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed:) I haue here preſented you with a birth, as farre, I ſuppoſe, beyond your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, as it ſeemes, beyond the abilities of my younger yeeres: but howſoeuer, I ſhall intreate your kind acceptance of it, and craue you all to foſter it vp in your owne boſomes; for I dare warrant you in the Lord, that if you but ſaue it from death by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable warmings, it ſhall liue to giue you all wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thankefulneſſe. If I ſhould but tell you of thoſe fearefull conflicts I had in my trauell of it, and my many grieuous cares in nurſing it hitherto, you would ſurely ſay, it were an inhumane impiety preſently to ſtifle it. Pray peruſe it well, and I hope, I ſhall not need much to ſpeake for it; it hath teares enough of it ſelfe to enforce your pity; and is of ſo good a nature, you cannot well chuſe but foster it. If you imagine it is too faire to bee mine, I ſhall not be ſo preſumingly proud on ſelfe-abilitie, as quite to denie you: for I muſt confeſſe indeed, I haue had ſuch large experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mine owne infirmities in the trauell hereof,
<pb facs="tcp:4671:7"/>
that I can attribute nothing vnto my ſelfe, but the imperfections herein, and the glory of an inſtrument onely in producing its better parts. I haue been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as a common Father, as they ſay, in bringing forth the matter; but the forme, life and ſoule of it was from God alone (the Father of life) to whoſe ſole guiding and bleſſed aydance, I muſt alwaies thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſcribe theſe my better performances. When I began this worke, I intended onely to treate of our Sauiours Paſſion, but I was ſo led away by that all-ruling Spirit of my God, that I ceaſed quickly from being mine owne man in it, and brought this to paſſe which now you ſee, <note n="*" place="margin">Neh. 1.8.</note> (according to the good hand of my God vpon me) both beyond mine owne aimes, and naturall abilities. And now, deare Chriſtian friends, I humbly beſeech you in the Lord, for your faithfull peruſall of it: and may<note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.17, 18.</note> the God of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, giue vnto you the Spirit of wiſedome, and reuelation in the knowledge of him, that the eyes of your vnderſtandings being enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of his inheritance in the Saints.</p>

Whence it came to paſſe, that whereas I thought preſently to apprehend it vpon the firſt onſet, without any further trouble, I was caſt downe ſuddenly by mine owne ſinnes and infirmities, euen to deſpaire of my ſelfe, and there lay for a long time in a ſpeakeleſſe miſery, till God of his free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at length reſtor'd me, and brought me to the happy ſight hereof by the ſweee helpe and aydance of his Word and Spirit. So that the readieſt way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this happy aſſurance, is to abandon all Papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call preſumings on ſelfe-abilities, and to annihilate ourſelues as twere, by a faithfull humility, that ſo wee may<note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note> become the ſonnes of God, by that ſole power of Chriſt Ieſus; and by a <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> new Creation be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into his bleſſed likeneſſe, till in his good time,
