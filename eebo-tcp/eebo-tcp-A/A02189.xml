            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ACTS 26. 30, 31.</bibl>
               <q>Sirs, what muſt I doe to be ſaued? And they ſaid, Beleeue in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, thou ſhalt be ſaued, and thine houſhold.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE onely courſe the Lord our God doth take in the effectuall calling and conuerting of ſuch, whoſe names are written in the booke of Life, is this: hee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, before he exalteth; he ſhews our daninable eſtate through ſinne by the Law, before euer hee ſignifieth vnto vs, that hee is our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>A three-fold reaſon may be rendred thereof:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe till men bee thus humbled, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will neuer ſeek after Chriſt nor deſire him, without which they can neuer finde him, for God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that by ſeeking we ſhall finde him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:19575:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, that our redemption might be more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> precious vnto vs: as health is more pleaſant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſickneſſe; liberty, after bonds; plenty, after ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie; peace, after warre; and faire weather after foule.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that Gods mercy in our deliuerance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> might bee prized in his kinde: the redeemed, in heauen for this eſpeciall cauſe extoll the Lord and the Lambe with a perpetuall Halleluiah: for an euerlaſting redemption from an euerlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation requireth an euerlaſting glorification.</p>
            <p>This generall truth is confirmed by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular example, in the words of my text: for this poore Iayler is moſt greeuouſly tormented through the horror of the Law, before euer hee can finde his ſoule recouered by the ſaluation of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs, what muſt I doe to bee ſaued? and they ſaid, Beleeue in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words I commend to your religious conſiderations in generall theſe two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, an earneſt inquiſition for ſaluation, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that on the Iaylers part: <hi>Sirs, what muſt I doe to bee ſaued?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, a comfortable reſolution to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Iayler; and that on <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Syla's</hi> part: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, thou ſhalt bee ſaued and thine houſhold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Iaylers earneſt enquiry for ſaluation, I note theſe three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, his reuerent carriage to the Miniſters of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:19575:5"/>
the moſt high God, in the firſt word, <hi>Sirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the occaſion of this his earneſt inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and that was his humiliation by the Law, in thoſe words: <hi>What muſt I doe?</hi> I that am the ſonne of bitterneſſe, indignation and eternall weeping; what muſt poore, lamentable, damnable I doe to bee ſaued?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the inquiſition it ſelfe, and that is for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſaluation, in theſe words: <hi>To be ſaued. Sirs, Sirs, what muſt I doe? Sirs, what muſt I doe to be ſaued?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs,</hi> It is <hi>nomen honoris,</hi> a name of honour, and <note place="margin">Sirs.</note> title of dignity, <hi>elim tributum ijs qui ſapientia abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darunt:</hi> in elder time appropriated to wiſdome and learning.</p>
            <p>Heere firſt I might take occaſion to ſhew with how great reuerence Miniſters of the Goſpell are to bee reſpected: good Paſtors are to bee had in double honour: yea their feet to be eſteemed bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that bring glad tidings of peace to our ſoules; but I forbeare the proſecution of this point, and propound vnto you <hi>the marueylous change that is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>found in this Iayler:</hi> for in the precedent verſes it is euident how doggedly and deſpectiuely hee vſed theſe holymen: he laid vpon them hand and foot bolts and fetters as many as they could beare, hee thruſt them into the inner dungeon and priſon: but now the Lord hauing taken him to doe, and giuen him the true and terrible fight and ſenſe of his ſinnes, hee is of another minde: now he brings them out, waſheth their wounds, refreſheth their bodies, and reuerenceth their perſons; <hi>Sirs, Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19575:6"/>
Sirs, you Miniſters of the moſt high God; what muſt I doe to be ſaued?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No reaſon can be rendred for this miraculous change, but this: <hi>The winde bloweth where it luft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This change wee muſt all be acquainted with, if euer wee will proue our ſelues truely conuerted.</p>
            <p>The Greek word for repentance, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by name ſignifieth a change, ſignifying vnto vs, that hee that will proue himſelfe truly penitent for his ſinne, muſt bee truly changed from his ſinne.</p>
            <p>This change we finde in penitent <hi>Mary:</hi> thoſe eyes which once inticed to ſinne, and thoſe hayres which once were employed to iniquity, were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drouſly altered and changed; for her eyes were conduits to diſtill whole buckets of teares to waſh our Sauiours feet, and her <hi>hayres an acceptable towell</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn 11. 2.</note> 
               <hi>to wipe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This change wee finde in penitent <hi>Paul:</hi> who <hi>of a Perſecutor became a Profoſſor,</hi> of a Lyon a Lambe: <note place="margin">Acts 9. 6.</note> and as he put to death others for the Goſpell; ſo in the end himſelfe put to death for the ſame.</p>
            <p>This change wee finde in <hi>Zacchee:</hi> who before his conuerſion was a notable pick-purſe and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Commons: but when Chriſt came to the houſe and home of his heart, proued bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and liberall, inſomuch, that <hi>halfe of his goods hee</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 19. 8.</note> 
               <hi>gaue to the poore, and if any man could proue that hee had wronged him a penny, he would make him quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reſtitution.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:19575:6"/>
So this Iayler before his conuerſion, an inſidell, prophane, and hard-hearted member: but the Lord hauing taken him to taske, and trembling him by the ſpirit of bondage, now hee reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Gods Miniſters, now hee humbly ſues vnto them for counſell and inſtruction, ſaying: <hi>Sirs, Renerend Sirs; what muſt I doe to be ſaued?</hi>

            <p>It is moſt certaine that ſaluation belongeth to none but the humble: <hi>To whom will I looke</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">Eſay 66. 2.</note> the Lord) <hi>euen to him that is of a contrite heart, and trembleth at my words:</hi> yea the refreſhing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>to none but the laden:</hi> for we muſt go through <note place="margin">Math. 11. 28.</note> the hell of a wounded conſcience, before wee ſhall taſte of the heauenly refreſhing: Merchants waxe <note place="margin">Similie.</note> muſt leach in a candle, before it can take a ſtampe or impreſſion: the terror of ſinne muſt languiſh our ſoules, before wee can come to bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>The comming of God into the ſoules of his choſen, is notably reſembled by his appearance to <hi>Eliah: Firſt, there came a mighty ſtrong winde</hi>

            <p>This poore Iayler had an earth-quake in his conſcience, as an earthquake in his Caſtle,

before euer hee perceiued his election and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>There is an old ſaying, Wee muſt goe by the gates of Hell to Heauen: but I ſay more, We muſt after a ſort be in Hell before euer we can bee capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Heauen: that is, in the hell of an aſhamed, affrighted, and confounded conſcience, before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Lord will ſay vnto our ſoules that he is our redemption.</p>
            <p>If humiliation by the Law precedes the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the Goſpell, then they are not conuerted that more or leſſe were neuer humbled.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they that are troubled and amazed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> at their ſinnes, let them not be diſparaged; ſo farre they are in this their hell from Hell, as hereby they are compoſed and fitted for Heauen; for wee muſt be loſt before we can be found, wee muſt bee condemned before we can be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let not humbled conſciences reſt here, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but paſſe on ſtill till they haue found the ſpirit of bondage become the ſpirit of adoption to their ſoules.</p>
            <p>And this counſell I giue all troubled ſoules for ſinne:</p>

We alſo returne vnto thee all due and poſſible prayſe, for preſeruing vs hitherto of thine eſpeciall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy; ſupplying aboundantly all our

neceſſities both in ſoule and in body; and for thy bleſſing vpon vs and ours, keeping vs from diuers dangers, that might iuſtly for our ſinnes haue come vpon vs, both ſpirituall and corporall. O what ſhall we render vnto thee for all theſe thy mercies done vnto vs? what are wee, that thou ſhouldſt thus reſpect vs? or what are our deſeruings, that thou ſhouldſt thus eſteeme vs? To vs, O Lord, to vs moſt miſerable ſinners, there nothing belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth but ſhame and confuſion. If thou (Lord) markeſt ſtrictly what is done amiſſe, who is able to abide it? O how farre doth thy mercy exceed thy iuſtice! O the deepneſſe of thy fauours towards vs! So vnſearchable are they, as no man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them, ſo vn-vtterable, as no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them.</p>
            <p>And (moſt mercifull Father) wee humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for thy Chriſts ſake the continuance of theſe mercies towards vs: Bleſſe vs this day and euer with thy heauenly protection and benediction, guide vs by thine owne Spirit into all godlineſſe, that we may profitably and conſcionably walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee in our vocations, both generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: bleſſe vs in the houſe, and bleſſe vs in the field: bleſſe vs in the basket, and bleſſe vs in the ſtore: bleſſe vs in our out-goings, and in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings in; compaſſe vs on euery ſide with thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; guard thine Angels round about vs; keepe vs from the euill of this world, and euery worke of darkneſſe; and ſanctifie both our ſoules and bodies with thy feare to thy ſeruice, that as heretofore we

haue ſerued the Diuell and the world by prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſo euer heereafter (redeeming the time) wee may apply our ſelues vnto holineſſe.</p>
            <p>To which end we moſt earneſtly craue (O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father) the preſence of thy Spirit alwayes to direct vs, the powerfull preaching of thy Goſpell, alwayes to inſtruct vs, the holy vſe of thy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alway to confirme vs, that (all hereſie and vngodlineſſe remoued farre from vs) by theſe meanes ſanctified vnto vs, we may glorifie thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name, by our holy conuerſations in this life, and bee glorified of thee euerlaſtingly in the life to come.</p>
            <p>And becauſe (by reaſon of our ſinnes) in ſtead of thy mercies we haue deſerued thy furious indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt vs: we therefore ſeriouſly begge at the throne of thy mercy, in the meritorious media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ieſus Chriſt, that thou wouldeſt remoue far from vs and our Land, all thy fearefull and heauy iudgements whatſoeuer, as famine, peſtilence, ſword, and the like; and giue vs all grace from the King to the beaſt, that we may be truly humbled for all our iniquities, that wee repenting vs of our euill which is ſinne, thou maiſt be pleaſed to repent thee of thy euill which is puniſhment for ſinne.</p>
