            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A ſtupendious and rare Miracle which God, ever to be praiſed, ſhewed about the filthy death of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> a man damned both in body and ſoule, ſo that it conduced to the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and the amendment and comfort of godly men. When <hi>Martin Luther</hi> was ſick, he deſired the Lords Body to be communicated to him, which he receiving, dyed preſently; when he ſaw that he muſt dye, he requeſted that his body might be ſet upon the Altar, and be adored with Divine worſhip; but God, to put an end to his horrible errours, by a great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle warned the people to abſtaine from that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40850:55"/>
impiety which <hi>Luther</hi> invented; for when his body was laid in the Grave, ſuddenly ſo great a ſtir &amp; terror aroſe, as if the foundations of the earth were ſhaken together; whereupon all the Funerall trembling, were aſtoniſhed, and after a while lifting up their eyes, beheld the ſacred Hoſt appearing in the aire; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with great devotion of heart, they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the moſt ſacred Hoſt upon the holy Altar, whereupon the fearefull noyſe ceaſed; but in the night following a loud noyſe, and rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, much ſhriller then the former, was heard about <hi>Luthers</hi> Sepulcher, which awaked all the City, terrified them, and almoſt killed them with aſtoniſhment; In the morning, when they opened the Sepulcher, they found neither his body, nor the bones, nor any of the cloaths; but there came a ſulphurous ſtinke out thereof, which almoſt over-came the ſtanders by. By this Miracle many were ſo amazed, that they amended their lives, for the honour of the Chriſtian Faith, and the glory of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <head>Eight Rules to know falſe Doctrines by.</head>
               <p>They that would not be corrupted with the Errours and Hereſies of theſe times, muſt carefully reject all erronious and hereticall Doctrines; to which purpoſe theſe generall rules may be very uſefull.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whatſoever Doctrine is contrary to godlineſſe, and opens a doore to Libertiniſme, and prophaneneſſe, muſt be rejected as Soule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſon; ſuch are Doctrines againſt the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, Family duties, and publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and ſuch is the Doctrine of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Tolleration of all Religions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch Doctrines muſt be rejected, as hold forth a ſtrictneſſe above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; many Doctrines in Popery are of this ſort, as Selfe-whippings; voluntary Poverty, and Vowes of Continency.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whatſoever Doctrine tendeth to the lifting up of nature corrupted, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting of unſanctified Reaſon, and giveth Free-will in ſupernaturall things to a man unconverted, is a Doctrine contrary to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40850:68"/>
Goſpel. This Rule will preſerve us againſt all Arminian Tenets.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, all Doctrines that ſet up our owne righteouſneſſe, whether of Morality, or Sanctification, in the roome of Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; that place good workes in the Throne of Chriſt, are Doctrines of Antichriſt, and not of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, All Doctrines that doe ſo ſet up Chriſt and his Righteouſneſſe, as to decry all workes of Sanctification, and to deny them to be fruits and evidences of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are to be avoyded and abhorred. This Rule will keep us from moſt of the errours of the Antinomians.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That Doctrine that leſſeneth the priviledges of Beleevers under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and maketh their Infants in a worſe condition, then they were in under the Old Teſtament, cannot be the Doctrine of the Goſpel; for the Goſpcl tells us, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt was made a Surety of a better Teſtament, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi> This Rule will preſerve us againſt the poyſon of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Doctrine that cryeth up purity to the ruine of unity, is contrary to the Doctrine of the Goſpel; for the Goſpel calleth for unity, as well as purity. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40850:68"/>
4, 5, 6. This Rule will teach us what to judge of the Congregationall way, and of Tollerating different Religions, which tends much to the breach of Spirituall love and unity, and cannot be the Government of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whatſoever Doctrine is contrary to the rule of Faith, or to any duty required in the ten Commandements, or to any Petition of the Lords Prayer, is not a Doctrine of Chriſt, and therefore to be rejected.</p>
