         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Friend, By this thy deceitfull flander, while thou haſt thought to prove us deceivers, hath proved thy ſelfe one, even a falſe accuſer, mayſt thou not bluſh to ſay we own Chriſt no otherwayes, then as he is within? we own him which was, is, and is to come, who is within us, and without us, as I have ſaid in my firſt, we own him as the Scripture ſpeakes of him, and it is known to the Lord, and in his ſight we are approved, whether thou be ieve it or not; for I begg not beleife of thee, but leaves thy double ſlanders to be read, and judged of, by all honeſt people, and in the interim, know it is a bad way to prove us deceivers by thy lyes, this the rather is a witneſſe to us that we are of God, and againſt thee, to be of the Devil, who was a lyar from the beginning, and thou his Child ſucceeds him; in lying.</p>
            <p>Thy ſecond proofe is, That we are deceivers, becauſe (ſaith thou) <hi>We doe perſwade ſoules that Chriſt is crucified in them, dead within them, kept down with ſomething within them, which was never taught by them that ſpoke the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Farther (thou ſaiſt) <hi>We perſwade ſoules that that man that was borne of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>is not above the clouds, and the Starres, when as the Scripture ſaith a cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi>

               <hi>Reply,</hi> O how ſwiftly thy lying tongue runs without feare, as though neither God nor man took notice of thee, or that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou ſhould be called to queſtion for them, many lyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thou haſt here foulded up in one, thy lyes I deny, and this to be one; haſt thou ſet thy ſelfe to tell lyes O abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wickedneſſe maiſt thou not tremble? when thou conſiders what thou falſly ſaiſt of us contrary to my words, who ſaid in the truth of my heart, we own him to be what the Scripture ſpeaks of him and not otherwiſe? it ſeemes thou cannot believe when I ſpeake truth; I number up thy lyes and returnes them backe to thee to read, and by all this; is it not true, that thou art of the ſame ſpirit with thy fellow, and abounds more in lyes, as I ſaid in my firſt, his was but about 3, thine manyfold more, but thy lyes is no teſtimony againſt us, that we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, but they ſhall lay heavy upon thee at one day, when we ſhall be cleare, for in the affirmive.</p>
            <p>I further ſay that, that Chriſt Jeſus that was crucified, and roſe again, ſhall come as he went away to judgement, and the dead ſhall be raiſed, and every man ſhall receive according to their deeds, and he ſhall ſet to judge the Heathen round about, according to <hi>Joel</hi> 3. and thy portion in that day ſhall be how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and gnaſhing of teeth, for the lyars Portion is the lake.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt again the <hi>Quakers make no difference between that light, wherewith Chriſt as he is God hath enlightned all, and the ſpirit of Chriſt he gives not to all.</hi>

one againſt the other, for thus Chriſt ſaith, I will ſend you the comforter even the ſpirit of truth, which muſt needs be the ſpirit of Chriſt and he ſhall reprove or convince the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſſe; now mark that ſame ſpirit of the Father and of the Son, who is the comforter of the Saints is the ſame, and not another that doth reprove the world, he that can read let him underſtand the world cannot receive the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter yet have they given to them that which doth reprove them; which is with the light of Chriſt Jeſus, of the ſame, and not contrary nor divided; if thou haſt an ear, thou may heare, the error is in thy ſelfe who art without underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Further thou ſaiſt, They ſay that every one hath that which is like the ſpirit of Chriſt, even as God, as the ſpirit of Chriſt, which thou ſaiſt is deſperate blaſphemy, and cryes out with an out-cry, <hi>O wonderfull deceit!</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Thy confuſed words ſeems to carry this meaning,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118822:13"/>
let the Reader judge, whether that be not the ſame Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of; <hi>Jobn</hi> 1. 9 as it is written of <hi>John</hi> 8. 12. and though thou ignorantly ſay I would have roome to broach my folly, yet thou lets out of thy veſſel inſides of leaves, of lyes ſlanders and folly and thou ſaiſt, <hi>when he ſaid I am the light of the world, he was without he did not meane any light within, and thou preſumptuouſly bids me deny this if I can,</hi> to which I ſay, the ſame Chriſt, which ſaid I am the light of the world, was he which was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was a light to the Gentiles, and lighteth every man in the world; yea, he was and is given to be a light, where his perſon (which was ſuppoſed the ſon of <hi>Joſeph)</hi> never came, and doe thou deny this if thou can that all men may ſee thy folly, for there is not many Chriſts, but one Chriſt, which is not only within but without, not only without, but within, but is all and in all, let him that reads underſtand.</p>
            <p>Then thou ſaiſt, <hi>the light wherewith Chriſt, as he is God, lighted every one, is the ſoule of man, which is the life of the body, and is a creature and hath one faculty of its owne Nature called conſcience.</hi>

               <hi>Reply,</hi> Now lets try this doctrine and conſider what thou haſt ſaid, it amounts to thus much that conſcience is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſoule of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſoule is the light of Chriſt, as God.</p>
            <p>Therefore thou haſt ſaid the conſcience is the light of God which muſt needs be without ſin, this is more then I have or dare ſay, I might here fitly ask thee, if thou knowe what the word conſcience ſignifies, in true underſtanding, and yet though thou haſt uttered this that conſcience is a faculty of the ſoule, which thou ſaiſt is the light of Chriſt as God, which light of God muſt needs be of the nature of God pure and not impure, yet in the next page thou ſaiſt, <hi>Conſcience is a poore dunghill, creature in compariſon of the ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. and in another page <hi>calls conſcience poore, ſoe empty beggerly things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What now <hi>John Bunion;</hi> is that which thou haſt concluded to be the light of God, but a dunghill creature and loe, and empty and beggerly in compariſon <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For ſhame ceaſe ſuch Divinity, leaſt all thy fellowes reproove thee; O how doth thy ignorant zeale lead thee into ſnares and trape thy owne feet

Conſcience which thou ſaiſt is the light of God, is Nature it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it muſt needs be that every mans nature (which is ſinfull ſay I) is the light of God, O what horrible doctrine this proves in its explanation!</p>
            <p>Bluſh, and be aſhamed when thou conſiders; then thou cryes out in reproofe; O wonderfull ſayes thou, <hi>That men ſhould make a God and Chriſt of their conſciences!</hi> I know none that doth it, nor that ever ſpoke ſo highly of conſcience, as thou haſt here done, yet we ſay our conſciences beares us wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the holy Ghoſt, and this is our rejoycing, the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our conſciences; and if our conſciences condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God, and yet makes not God and Chriſt of our conſcience, as thou ſecretly would charge us withall; then thou goes on and would ſeeme to prove but cannot, that ſomething beſides the light of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth of ſin, but thy reach is too ſhort, though thou wind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and lets thy thoughts into the pit of thy owne reaſon, to bring up a thing to confound truth, but cannot; for this is thy proofe, where they were all convinced by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences <hi>Jo.</hi> 8.

            <p>And whereas thou haſt anſwered my queſtion, which is; did Chriſt put an end to the law for them, who yet live in the tranſgreſſion of the law, or doth he juſtifie that which the law condemns, before the worke of the law be finiſhed?

            <p>I ſay that tranſgreſſors of the law are not Chriſts but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience, and children of wrath, and ſuch God hath not given to Chriſt, who are his enemies, nor Chriſt to them is not given, but to condemne them in that eſtate and thou ſaiſt there is many given to Chriſt, who yet lives in their ſins, the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, he that ſins is of the Devil, and hath not known God, and ſuch as are of the Devill are not Chriſts,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118822:17"/>
and in that I ſaid doth Chriſt juſtifie that which the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns before the worke of the law be finiſhed, and not one tittle of the law ſhall faile, till all be fulfilled, thou haſt not reached the underſtanding of my words, for while diſobedience ſtands &amp; the tranſgreſſor lives, the work of the law is not finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor fulfilled, but to that is condemnation and not juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if thou haſt an ear thou maiſt heare, for he that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth the law is an enemy to Chriſt, and Chriſt fulfills not the law for his enemies they muſt beare their own burthen, and though this thou cannot underſtand now, yet in the day of judgement ſhalt thou feele it, and when the burthen of thy own iniquity is upon thee, then ſhalt thou confeſſe to what I have ſaid, and read me in what now thou canſt not underſtand, and in the meane time I deny that Chriſt hath put an end to the law for thee, who art a lyer, and breaks one, and ſo is guilty of all.</p>
            <p>Many of thy words might be weighed and ſearched, but I am no picker of quarrells, but to my laſt Query, thou ſaiſt little to the purpoſe, which is; what aſſurance have any, that the law is fulfilled for them, who are yet tranſgreſſors of it, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? but ſaiſt, <hi>Aſſurance comes through believing and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the law is a fruit of believing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Saying every one that hath the hope of the Son of God purifies himſelfe as he (Chriſt) is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Then he that hath not the fruit, <hi>(viz.)</hi> obedience to the law, we may judge by the fruit, or for want of fruit is no believer; and he that is not purifyed as he is pure (Chriſt) hath not the hope of being the Son of God, but is without hope, now ſee where thou art, why it breaks the law, and is without (thy owne noted) fruit of believing neither is puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed as he is pure, and ſo is without hope, this is according to thy own affirmation, if thou cannot beare it blame thy ſelfe for laying downe ſuch a poſition, as hath proved thy ſelfe to be an unbeliever and without hope; and ſo without God in the world; one that is for condemnation, and to be judged into the ſtate where now thou ſtands.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>I would lay aſſurance on obedience to the law.</hi> thou lyeſt in this alſo, my words are, the law muſt

            <p>But the froth proceeds out of thy mouth, for this argument comprehends thee, and ſtands out of thy reach for all thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable ſpeeches againſt me, and the truth, and the reſt of my following words thou haſt paſſed by, where I ſay, who ownes not that which convinceth of ſin, how can they own him that takes it away by his blood? and this is truth, and tell me in juſtneſſe according to my firſt Query in that page, how is ſin taken away from thee, more then from the Pope, ſeeing neither of you hath the fruit of ceaſing to commit ſin, and art not thou in the froth, who oppoſes me as though (I ſhould ſay yet never did nor thought) that juſtification muſt be ſought by the deeds of the Law and ſo gathers a falſe conception, and fights with it, and keeps thy ſelf doing in 9 ſheets againſt 4 and yet hath paſſed over many ſpeciall things, almoſt the chiefeſt, and though no fleſh ſhall be juſtified by the deeds of the law, yet muſt all fleſh living be condemned for the tranſgreſſion of the law by Chriſt, who freely gives life to all that believes, if thou haſt an eare thou may heare; in the next thou ſeems (or would at leaſt) to defend thy ſelfe from my charge which ſhall (if it doth not) ley heavie upon thee, which is that I call thee ſlanderer, and truly too, from thy words where thou falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the <hi>Quakers</hi> with boaſting, and hipocriſy, and in thy anſwer thou ſaiſt, <hi>I need not be offended, for thou doſt not know our fellow for boaſting in that</hi> (thou ſaiſt) <hi>we cry up our ſelves and condemn all others,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Reply,</hi> Well, thy ignorance and wickedneſſe vents it ſelfe forth a pace, let any man read that firſt of <hi>John,</hi> and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he doth not ſpeake of Chriſt as Mediator, he ſaith he was in the beginning with the Father, and was made fleſh and dwelt with the Diſciples; and his life was the light of men, and the light ſhined in darkneſſe, and what was he which ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth every man that comes into the world, and he came to his owne but they received him not, but as many as received him to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſaiſt thou, Was not this ſpoken of Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, conſider &amp; be inſtructed rather then let thy blood go for it, however I leave thy doctrin, thy errors herein to be judged by them that are ſpirituall, and for ſhame ceaſe ſuch doctrin, the more I rake among the filth, the more vilely and odious it appeares, and for thy proofe of this doctrine, thou brings <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. and ſaies here the Father and the Son are ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one to another, but what doth this prove though it be ſo, doth it any way follow that <hi>John</hi> did not ſpeake of Chriſt as Mediator, <hi>John</hi> 1. what vaine productions thou brings from thy impertinent proofes, let them be weighed and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of honeſtly, and thou bids me underſtand thus much, <hi>That nature which is conſcience, is the light of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I underſtand thy blindneſſe; if this be ſo as thou ſaiſt, then mans nature is pure without ſin, as the light of God is; and this is error abominable, contrary to the Scripture which ſaith, all by nature are the children of wrath, is all by the light of God (as thou ſayſt nature is) children of wrath; ſo thy Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and take it as it is truly interpreted, I deſire not to wrong thy words, thou gives me to underſtand the greateſt ignorance from thoſe things that lately I have heard, no not the like in <hi>England;</hi> and it is very true, as I ſaid thy folly appeares by thy much medling.</p>
            <p>Then thou askes me, <hi>What I will have the light called, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with every man in the world is lightned,</hi> and becauſe I doe not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118822:20"/>
call it the Spirit of Chriſt, thou (as it were) murmurs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have cut of thy occaſion, and thou cannot bend thy tongue with any ſeeming advantage againſt the truth; but in that I ſay the light of Chriſt convinceth of ſin, which is true, thou on a ſudden produces thy bad conſequences, and askes if I call nature the light of Chriſt, and ſuch like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they all doe not prove the contrary, ſo that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth of ſin, is worth minding and takeing notice of, by all that ever is ſaved, and as to that where I ſay, that which may be known of God was manifeſt in them even in them that was given up to worke unrighteouſneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſaid the truth which thou art not able to contradict in equity, though thou very ignorantly bend thy anſwer (as if I had ſaid) the knowledge of God was made manifeſt in them, when I ſay plainly in my Booke that they were turned from the knowledge of God, and yet that which might be known of him was manifeſt in them, and this thou canſt not deny, and though my words as layd down are not in the Scripture words in terms, yet have not I ſaid falſly herein, and doe not be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of that which thou cannot thy ſelfe deny, then thou ſaiſt, <hi>How feeble an argument is this to prove, that every one hath the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Thou blind man, did I goe about to prove any ſuch thing or make any argument thereupon; we are about the light which Chriſt hath given or lighted every man in the world withall, which light convinceth of ſin, and is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit of Chriſt, unto this was I ſpeaking and this I ſtood by, and thou conceives another thing from my words and fight againſt thy own conſequences like a man too irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall to underſtand common Engliſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then thou ſaiſt, <hi>Thou paſſed by other lame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I tumble over like a blinde man in a thicket of buſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O be aſhamed for ever! thus to evade and ſhuffle, with ſuch ſcornefull words; I ſaid that which reproves of ſin is the gift of the Spirit of God. <hi>John</hi> 16. and that which makes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſin, is light, and whatſoever is reproved is made manifeſt by the light <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. how dare thou call theſe lame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118822:20"/>
tumbling over? what impudence is in thy heart, ſo to ſay? when thou art put to confuſion, then ſuch excuſes thou brings; Well, ſome may ſee thy folly? then to my Queſtion which was, whether that light which every man is lighted withall, is ſufficient in it ſelfe for life and ſalvation to every one that believes; if thou ſay, not wherein is the blame, in God in his light or in the creature, thou ſaiſt, <hi>No it is not ſufficient,</hi> I take it for an anſwer, and leaves it to be weighed by the ſober Reader, and though there be veſſels of honour and of diſhonour made of the ſame lumpe as thou ſaiſt, yet I further <hi>Query,</hi> is not every mans blood that periſheth of his owne head, and is not the Lord clear from the blood of all men, even though they goe to deſtruction, and if the Reader try thy Book over he may judge whoſe arguments are lame.</p>
            <p>Then whereas thou ſaid, <hi>Chriſt as God hath lighted every man that comes into the world,</hi> To which I ſaid, then why doſt thou ſay we wreſt that Scripture <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. ſeeing thou thy ſelfe haſt confeſſed no leſſe then what thou calleſt wreſting in us, and this is truth let all men conſider elſe; that when thou confeſſes Chriſt as God hath lighted every man in the world, it is no leſſe then what we ſay, and that Scripture ſay, which is, that Chriſt is the true light, and that is he which lighteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that comes into the world; and maiſt not thou be aſhamed to call this ſo ſcornfully <hi>a glavering Anſwer,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to clear thy ſelfe from my juſt charge, in that herein I charged thee with confuſion to oppoſe us, in that which thy ſelfe confeſſeth to be true conſider well of it, and let not thy blood goe for the truth of all what thou ſaiſt, for I deſire it not.</p>
            <p>Further thou cries out, <hi>Is this all the wit I have, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ignorance,</hi> Becauſe I ſaid it is not good to neglect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the light, but that every one minde the light of Chriſt Jeſus in them; in anſwer to thy words which was haveing ſaid the light which convinceth of ſin is the light of Chriſt as God, which the neglect of, will be ſure to damne, as thou ſaiſt, and now let wiſe men judge of my anſwer, but thou falls heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on it; proving that obedience to the law will not juſtifie, and the like which I doe not at all affirm but to that I ſay, the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118822:21"/>
law having its opperation upon the diſobedient; the juſtifier comes to be ſeen, which is he that is the end of the Law, and the law muſt by him be obeyed or fulfilled in thee, if ever thou be ſaved from being damned by it.</p>
            <p>Conſider of this, when thou haſt a better underſtanding, for its yet hidden from thee, then when thou haſt thus cried out againſt my juſt <hi>Anſwer,</hi> tbou tells me what I ſhould have ſaid, Alas poore man, thou reaches not what the knowledge of things eternall is, by that wiſedome in which thou art, I need no man to teach me, but the Lord.</p>
            <p>Then thou ſaiſt. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath obeyed the Law and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Nay hold, repent firſt and be turned from thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities, and believe in him, and boaſt not thy ſelfe ſo proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; thou art in the tranſgreſſions of the Law in diſobedience to it, a lyar, ſlanderer, and ſcorner, one that the Prince of the power of the Aire rules in a childe of wrath, and every one ſhall dye for his owne iniquity, and the ſoule that ſins ſhall dye, and wrath to every one that doth evil, and the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the judgements of God; Learne what this meanes, or ask them that are of a better underſtanding then thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Then thou ſeems to minde me of ſome weakneſſe and cries out, <hi>Wonderfull fooliſhneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Becauſe I ſaid the light of Chriſt given to every man, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 9. as thou confeſſeſt, is not contray to the Spirit of Chriſt, and to the grace of God, but is one in their nature (Mark) and a man cannot poſſibly love one of them and hate ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore one they are, in the union leading in the ſame way, unto the ſame end, and where doth the Spirit of Chriſt give light, or that grace of God work or lead if not in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are my words, Now let honeſt men conſider and <hi>John Bunion</hi> be ſilent, what fooliſhneſſe or wonderfull weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is in theſe words, but is onely to the wiſedome which is devilliſh, which deſpiſeth truth? or what cauſe was there to bluſh when I wrote them? as he impudently ſaith, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contradict them, nor reprove them, and yet railes upon them: no marvell that thou would paſſe them, as thou ſaiſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118822:21"/>
with ſuch a poore ſhift to evade with a lye that thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to it already, when as thou haſt not medled of theſe things.</p>
            <p>O let not thy impudency ſo ſottiſhly carry thee, for thy ſhame is ſeen and laid open, its good (in thy light) to paſſe that which confounds thee, which is paſt anſwering, ſo to ſave thy credit among thy fellowes, the cauſe to bluſh is in thy ſelf, and its brought to thy doore.</p>
            <p>Then thou pleads for the Scripture to be the rule in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to my <hi>Queſtion</hi> which is not anſwered, which was, can there be any ſurer thing for the creature to look to, to walk to life, or to come to God by, then the light of Chriſt which every man hath given him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But thou may for ſhame ceaſe pleading for Scripture rule, being thy ſelfe art ſo farr contrary to it, for he that walkes in the life of the Scripture I have union with him, and the light of Chriſt is a more ſurer teſtimony either to witneſſe juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or condemnation, then any mans words without, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; then my other <hi>Queſtion</hi> was whether the <hi>Turks Jewes,</hi> and thee and others doe ſerve ſin and luſt, becauſe Chriſt hath not given you light to diſcover your ſins, or becauſe you hate that light, that is given, and much to this thou ſpeakeſt not pertinent, nor anſwered in plaineſſe, I leave it to the Reader to judge, and to read my anſwer Page 17. of my firſt, which clears truth from all what thou haſt ſaid againſt it in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the next thing, where thou fooliſhly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me, <hi>That my doctrin is not according to truth, but a lye, Charigng me to affirm that which the Apoſtle doth deny,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe I ſaid the ſpirit is given to every man, though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man receives it not, and it ſtrives with the wicked though he follow it not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My words herein are truth, and no lye, neither contrary to the Scripture, and let the Reader be Judge betwixt us, the Apoſtle ſaith the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall, and ſome of theſe to whom he writes thus; was wicked, given to inceſt and idolatry, and other ſins, here I prove, it was given to the wicked, and thou confeſſes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118822:22"/>
the righteous had it, and there is but theſe two on the face of the earth; Now if thou can find a man that is neither wicked nor righteous then thou haſt advantage, then ſome hath not the manifeſtation of the Spirit, the Saints had the Comforter the Spirit of truth, and he (the Spirit of truth) convinced or reproved the world of ſin; they that were not Saints, but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked had it reproving them, Marke theſe things; and let honeſt men judge while both you, and I am ſilent, whether thy doctrine which denyes that which the Scripture affirmes, or mine which bears witneſſe to the ſame thing which Scriptures ſpeaks, be to be diſowned, let an equall line meaſure; the ſhame, and falſe doctrin is fallen upon thee, and thou art of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended (that I ſhould ſay thou brings other vain arguments) with a vapour ſaying <hi>Neither I nor my fellowes are able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I ſay true, the arguments are vaine, one is, <hi>The Devils are convinced but hath not the Spirit,</hi> or ſuch like, Now what is this to the purpoſe, that thou contends in that wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body ſtrives with thee, nor none affirms againſt thee, and it is a vaine argument to parelell the Devill in ſuch a cauſe, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Spirit, but thou art ſo blind, its hardly poſſible to let thee ſee thy ignorance herein. I may not much ſtrive with thee, onely Ile tell thee of thoſe things, and the ſober Reader ſhall judge, to inſtance a thing impoſſible to prove things poſſible, is vaine arguments, ſo that I have herein done thee no wrong. Then thou cries out of my weakneſſe, and that I <hi>Blaſpheme,</hi> and of <hi>a great deale of ignorance diſcovered in me, and bids me be ſilent,</hi> and falſly charges me with <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and ſuch like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe I ſaid thus much I leave with thee, till thou prove the light of Chriſt, (which thou confeſſeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath) to be contrary to the Spirit of Chriſt, I ſhall ſay every man hath that which is one in union and like the <note place="margin">John 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> Spirit of Chriſt, even as good as the Spirit of Chriſt according to its meaſure, theſe are my words, Page 18. and I own them, and thy anſwer to them is no contradiction, nor juſt confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, but lyeſt in ſaying I call conſcience and nature it ſelfe the Spirit of Chriſt, this is falſe never ſpoken by me, ſo that thou haſt uttered a pack of railing words without any
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118822:22"/>
knowledge or feare of God, in ſtead of a ſober Anſwer, the blaſphemy and great deale of ignorance and preſumption ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not in my words, they are truth, and thou haſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the light of Chriſt is contrary to the Spirit of Chriſt, Nay, thy ſimple policy is too ſhort, when thou had done ſo, then had been a time to have caſt theſe opprobrious ſpeeches at mee, like venomne from a Viper, but the weakneſſe (or ſtrength of error) and blaſphemy and the great deale of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and preſumption <hi>&amp;c,</hi> is fallen at thy doore and there I leave it, clear thy ſelfe from it as thou art able, who without any confutation of the words, falls impudently to charge me thus highly and falſly from the words, be thou ſilent whiſe the Reader Judges; then thou goes about to defend thy firſt wickedneſſe in that thou ſaid the Devill doth deceive poore ſoules by bidding them liſten within; and turne the minde within, and ſee if there be not that which doth convince of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this is ſound, and ſtands over thee, and unreproved by thee, though many words thou ſpeakeſt, yet from the Scripture doth not prove or by honeſt arguments, that the Devill doth deceive any, by bidding them to turne to the light within, which convinceth of ſin, if thou would have cleared thy ſelfe, thou ſhould have proued thy aſſertion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my deſire I asked thee, was ever ſuch a thing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that the Devill can deceive any by the light of Chriſt, but to this not a word in proofe, but faith, <hi>Every man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But further then I <hi>Query,</hi> Doth the Devil deceive any by bidding them to turn in, and liſten to that light ſpoken of <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. for that light am I contending for, and not any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, then thou ſaiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou denyes <hi>That Paul bid listen within, telling me of making ſhelter for my error,</hi> &amp;c. This is no error to ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> bids liſten within, let the Reader judge from that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. The righteouſneſſe of faith ſpeakes on this wiſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6 (which is the voice of the Goſpel) and <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. what ſaith it, the word is nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart, was not that the end of theſe words to liſten within? the word is in the heart, what ſaith it there? now the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118822:23"/>
error is thine, that denyes the truth, and the lye is returned to the founder, who denyes that <hi>Paul</hi> bids liſten within, when its plain he ſaith the word is in the heart, what ſaith it there?</p>
            <p>O that a man profeſſing knowledge and enterprizing ſuch things, ſhould be ſo ſottiſh! and ſo unable to finiſh what he hath begun then thou cryes out-hidiouſly and notes it in the margent for wreſting of thy words, in that I ſaid, thou ſaiſt, they are ignorant of the Goſpel who cloſes in with theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the light within (or conſcience) which doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to abſtaine from the evill, and to practiſe good, and thy owne words are, now the poore ſoule through ignorance of the Goſpel cloſes in with theſe motions of its owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>(viz.)</hi> the motions which convinceth of ſin within, which doth command to abſtaine from this evill, and practice this good, ſo let wiſe men conſider whether I have wronged that intent of thy words, and be not ſo ſoon angry, for thou canſt not vindicate, that they that cloſes in with theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the conſcience or the light of Chriſt within, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth of ſin within, which doth commmand to abſtaine from this evill, and to practice this good, is ignorance of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and doe not evade it by words without knowledge, in picking of quarrels and ſeeking offences (by different tearms of words) where no occaſion juſtly is given thee. Then my Queſtion thou ſeemeſt to anſwer, which was, what, and how doth the light of the Goſpel worke, if not in the conſcience, and to command from evill, and to practice good? this <hi>Query</hi> ſtands over thy head not conſuted nor fully anſwered, for the true underſtanding of it thou haſt not comprehended, but to thy own conception, thou haſt anſwered as if I ſhould ſay that every man hath the light of the Goſpell working in them to ſalvation which I never ſaid nor thought, ſo thy anſwer is not to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Then thou haſt paſſed by ful ſlightly (as diſable to clear thy God and his Spirit, that guides thee, which is the God of this world) of that great ſum of wickedneſſe juſtly charged upon thee, Page 19. of my laſt, which according to true col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is; by turning the mind within to the light which doth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118822:23"/>
convince of ſin, and liſtning thereunto and claſpeing in with the motions of the conſcience, which doth command to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from evil, and to practice good, and cloſing with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within which thou confeſſed is the light of Chriſt, theſe things preceding, then thou ſaiſt, hereby or thus, is the poore ſoules carried headlong, and at the end of its life doth fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belly of Hell, this is indeed a ſum of wickedneſſe ſet forth by thee, which when thou receives it in againe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the intereſt upon it, of indignation and vengeance, and though thou haſt ſlipped it now, it ſhall then be reckoned on <hi>Jobn Bunions</hi> ſcore. Remember thou oweſt to prove this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou be heard any more.</p>
            <p>Then againe thou cries out, <hi>That I have naughtily belyed thee,</hi> and the like, becauſe of miſplaceing a word, and ſaying the light of the world, inſtead of the light brought into the world, thou art an unjuſt Judge who makes offenders for a word miſplaceing, but it is plaine, thou means by light brought into the world, that light <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. which every man in the world is lightned withall, and if thou doe then thou art a lyar in ſaying in thy firſt Booke and in this, the Devil counterfeits the new birth, by perſwading it is wrought by that light, and if thou meane not that light, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. but that of the Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 16. (which I ſay is not divided) then thou art a lyer alſo, and now while thou charges me to be guided by Satan, and to be a lyar, in the very time haſt anſwerd thy ſelfe in a lye and cannot get out, Mark it.</p>
            <p>Then thou ſaiſt, <hi>Thou paſſes by many urgeing expreſſions, which thou might charge with unrighteouſneſſe</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> I asked thee by what is the new birth wrought, and how, if not by following the light of Chriſt in the conſcience is there any other way to God but Chriſt Jeſus, who hath lighted every man that comes into the world, this is part of that thou haſt paſſed by, with thy lyeing excuſe of Rageing expreſſions of which thou may be aſhamed to equivocate thus poorely to ſave thy owne credit, the charge of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe juſtly falls upon thy own head.</p>
            <p>Thou further ſaith, And eates up thy owne wickedneſſe who ſaid then, and ſaith it now but moſt ignorantly, <hi>That
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118822:24"/>
Satan makes the ſoul believe iſ it will but be lead by what ſhall be made known to it, from the light (or conſcience) within it ſhall doe well,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>My laſt <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this, is ſufficient, onely I ask thee a proof out of the Scripture for this doctrin, that the Devil doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any by the light of Chriſt, in the conſcience within, and till then minde my words, in my laſt <hi>Anſwer,</hi> if ever thou know God, it muſt be by following, and by being led with the light within, which God hath made known unto thee, elſe that light is thy condemnation eternally.</p>
            <p>Then againe thou chargeſt me with corrupting thy words for wrighting <hi>thee,</hi> for <hi>their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Now a ſcorner I charged thee to be, from thy words, and that I yet ſay of thee, taking thy words in thy own ſence, as <hi>Page</hi> 77. of thy firſt doth manifeſt thee, unto the ſingle eye, and thou ſecretly charges us, with <hi>following our own ſpirit, and ſpeaking by our own ſpirit,</hi> but our own Spirit we have denyed, and have received the Spirit of the Father through the light of Chriſt; whereby every man in the world is lighted to life, or to condemnation, then thou ſeemes to be highly offended that I ſhould ſay, thou doſt not profit people at all, noting it for falſe in the margent, but thou needs not be ſo angry, though thou ſay <hi>The people in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where thou dwells will testifie the contrary,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which I ſay thou haſt no cauſe to boaſt of the fruit of thy miniſtry, nor they of much profit received by thee, witneſſe a meeting in <hi>Bedford,</hi> where a company of thy cheifeſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, I ſuppoſe, uttered much wickedneſſe in lyes and ſlanders as many can witneſſe, and witneſſe three of thy brethren, teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Booke, who ſay they know that to be truth, which thou haſt declared, and thou art proved a lyer in many things, let them read themſelves falſe witneſſes and lyars like thy ſelf, and theſe things being conſidered as I ſaid with other things at the end of this, thou haſt no cauſe to boaſt of thy miniſtry, nor they of their profit, by it in that Contry, who art uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted yet, from lying and falſe accuſing, and ſo art not turned from Satans power to the power of God, and as for a carnal miniſtry of which thou ſpeakes, they are very bad that exceeds thy ſelfe in carnality, in thy underſtanding of the things that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118822:24"/>
are ſpirituall, Then further thou goes on ſeeming to bring witneſſe of thy former ſlanders, having in thy laſt, falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed us with ſad blaſphemies and horrible doctrins and thou ſaiſt, <hi>My ſpeech bewrayeth me, that I am one of them,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſaiſt thou, I ſay that every man hath the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>O thou lying tongue when wilt thou ceaſe thy wickedneſſe! I never ſaid nor thought ſo.</p>
            <p>And further thou ſaiſt, I ſay there is that in every man which is as good as the Spirit of Chriſt, my words are the light of Chriſt, lighteth or is given to every man that comes into the world, which light is not contrary to the Spirit of Chriſt, but one in the union and as good in its nature according to its meaſure, and till thou prove that that light <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit, which yet thou haſt not done, ſtop thy mouth and take ſhame to thy ſelfe, for being fouly guilty thy ſelfe of corrupting my words, which thou falſly charges on me.</p>
            <p>Other things thou ſaiſt, that our <hi>ſociety ſhould affirm,</hi> but I may have ground to Judge thou art, ſo ſlanderous a tongue on me, that the like thou may doe of others.</p>
            <p>And whereas I ſaid thou art, confounded in thy diſcourſe I ſaid true herein, as inſtance, thou ſaiſt, that conſcience may be ſeared and evill, and another place that conſcience is the light of God, can the light of God be ſeared, or is it evill? thou holds it forth.</p>
            <p>Conſider, is not this confuſion, other things I might collect, but this one is ſufficient to prove thee in confuſion and though thou reckon us ſome time with the Ranters, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with the Phariſees, with many words of bitterneſſe and envy yet we beare thy reproaches, and when they are taken off then ſhall we appear, and thou appear and be judged, as we are, by him that is above all.

Friend, I rejoyce in that I am hidden from thee, and that my words are a ſtumbling to thee, for in that ſtate thou ſtandeſt the entrance into the Kingdome of God, thou ſhalt not know whoſe wiſedome is fooliſhneſſe with God, and though thou ſay the light of Chriſt is a ſaving comforting light, ſo will it be to thee a condemning light, and of all lyars and ſlanderers, and this ſhalt thou know though thou art buſied up and down, in thy minde ſeeking occaſions againſt me, from my words, not clearing thy ſelfe from what I have truly charged upon thee, but accuſing me falſly, and this is come to paſſe, that thy ſhame might openly appeare, as to that difference of the law, and Goſpel; thy wiſedome with my knowledge of it, I ſhall not ſeed, yet I leave the Reader to conſider, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>to</hi> 16. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 7, 8. And what I ſaid yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines upon thee undone to prove by the Scripture, ſomething to convince of ſin without, and beſides or contrary to the Spirit of God, which thou art never able to doe, for though thou ſay (as none affirmes) the light in every mans conſcience is not the Spirit of God, yet how doſt thou prove; or when that it is contrary to the Spirit of God, which in my laſt I put upon thee, and now I leave it with thee, and then thou would excuſe thy firſt words, in that thou called the Quakers found hipocrites, but haſt not yet proved that they live in hipocriſy, and ſo art a lyer ſtill, and my words are juſt upon thee, a perverter of the right way of God thou art, and in the day of judgement it ſhall be proved by thy recompence. Then thou goes about to prove that a naturall man may have power over ſin, and abſtaine from thoſe things forbidden in the law, and for thy proofe thou inſtances in <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid he was blameleſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. Now this was before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement came from God to him, which let him ſee the law was ſpirtuall, and this doth not prove that he had power over ſin, for he was in envy, and ſo a murtherer, and had not power over ſin, according as I asked thee, if thou ſaiſt he had power over ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As thou ſeems to doe before he was convicted, while he was a naturall man, then it was no ſin to perſecute Jeſus, and this would be blaſphemy, the product of thy doctrine, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118822:25"/>
this thou haſt cuningly ſlipped, where I asked thee to get pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over ſin, and to abſtain from thoſe things forbidden in the Law, is it not further then thou ever came? and becauſe thou wilt not anſwer, I doe and ſay yet, and concludes, that <hi>John Bunians</hi> ſtate is not ſo good as <hi>Pauls,</hi> while he was a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter according to his own doctrine, and thou ſaiſt the Gentiles did by nature the things contained in the Law; true, but their ſtate was not condemned, but juſtified, before the circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I aske thee, is any condemned by the Lord, who are excuſed in his ſight, or is any juſtified who is accuſed, and my words are ſound, which thou ignorantly comments upon where I ſaid I rather choſe to be of that profeſſion which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaynes from thoſe things forbidden in the Law, and to have power over ſin then to live in the tranſgreſſion of the Law, and under the power of ſin; yet talking of beliefe in the Son of <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> Let the Reader judge whether of theſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is more accepted in the ſight of God, thy Religion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be talking of beliefe, in the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> and art in the tranſgreſſion of the Law, a lyer a falſe witneſſe in envy and backbiting and ſuch like, thy falſe beliefe will not ſave thee in the day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Then further thou ſtill confeſſes that as he is God, Chriſt lighteth every man that comes into the world, then, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doſt thou make all this adoe, in oppoſing us, in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, yet let's try thy Doctrine, whether it be ſound, thou ſaiſt, this light wherewith Chriſt as God hath lighted every man, is conſcience; and yet ſometime ſaith this conſcience is ſeared and hardned and evill; What is the light of Chriſt as God, ſeared, hardened, and evil? <hi>J. Bunian</hi> holds it forth; this is thy great Ignorance and Blaſphemie, and ſomtime thou ſaiſt this light is Nature, and Nature is corrupted and ſinfull. And in it, all are children of wrath, what is the light of Chriſt as God corrupted and ſinfull, and is all by it children of wrath? <hi>John Bunians</hi> Doctrine holds it forth; Though blindnes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed thee, when thou write this, yet mayſt thou bluſh at the reading hereof.</p>
            <p>Then thou goes to give a meaning upon my words; in that I ſaid the Law is light, and light is the Law, which is truth,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118822:26"/>
but I ſpoke them not for thee to Interpret with thy lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but let ſpirituall men judge of them then much adoe thou makes in anſwering my queſtion to thee, but hitts not my words at all: I asked thee and bid thee ſhew if thou canſt any ſin which is not againſt the Law but this thou canſt not doe, though you would prove if thou could, that unbeliefe is not a ſin againſt the Law of God; then thou ſpeaks of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> imputed to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I ſay the obedience of him without doth not juſtifie any; who are in the Nature of enmity againſt him, who is not a new creature nor condemned in the fleſh; and whereas thou ſecretly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us, with mingling Law and Goſpell together; I tell the we know the operation of each, and doth witneſſe the Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of each, and they are not devided nor oppoſite one againſt the other; but that one is the fulfilling of the other, and though thou ſaid <hi>you leape over the Law, for Juſtification,</hi> yet it is too high for the to leape over for condemnation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, and all thy fained faith while in that Nature thou ſtands uncondemned, is but as the ſtubble for the fire; then whereas I charged thee with preaching another Goſpel, then the Apoſtle preached, &amp; my charge is true upon thy head, and my proofe is ſound, againſt thee, he directed to the word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in the heart <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. what ſaith it, the word is in the heart, and he turned to the light from darkneſſe; but thou ſaith who ſhall aſcend to fetch him, men muſt follow him to the Croſſe without, and to Heaven without, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo art one that ſaith loe here and loe there; but theſe things thou haſt paſſed by, with thy lying excuſe of quarrelling, a many poore ſhifts thou art faine to make, and in that I ſaid thou was a lyer, in ſaying the light <hi>(viz.)</hi> of Chriſt as God, doth not ſhew the ſoul a Saviour or deliverer, my charge upon the is true and ſtands vnremoved, and I asked thee, if the light of Chriſt doth not ſhew Chriſt to all that walke in the light, then what can but this; thou haſt paſſed alſo moſt deceitfully which ſtands upon thee to anſwer or to ſtop thy mouth, then thou would excuſe thy contradictions charged upon thee, in that thou ſaid they are wickedly deluded, who own Chriſt no otherwiſe then as he was before the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet ſaying
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118822:26"/>
God onely is the Saviour and there is none beſides him, and all thou ſaiſt cleares not thy ſelfe from contradiction herein, let honeſt men be judge betwixt us both, for thou judges falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly me to be naught, and I am ſure thou art naught, and thou will not take my judgement, I may not take thine, (let impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallity judge betwixt us) then thou would excuſe thy ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders charged juſtly upon thee, in ſaying that Quakers make light of the Reſurrection, and to prove thy wickedneſſe, thou askes us whither it be ſo, i'ts time enough for us to anſwer when thou haſt brought evidence of the firſt accuſation, what poor proofe is this for to cover thy ſelfe, though to add to thy wickedneſſe. Thou ſay, thou knows we deny it, I aske thee when it was, or where it was, O thou enemy of Righteouſnes, yea thou ſhalt ariſe in the day of judgement to ſhame and contempt, and this I affirme except thou repent of this thy wickedneſſe;</p>
            <p>Then whereas thou urges me, that I ſhould have anſwered, the Querie raiſed from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10, better, or confuted thine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doe not boaſt but heare what I ſay, thou ſaiſt in that anſwer, that Chriſt aſcended to the right hand of the Father in your Nature.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118822:27"/>
that I ſhould ſay as though there were no falſe Prophets now, becauſe I ſaid they were in the Apoſtles dayes, which is true, and yet are they now too; even its witneſſed by thee, and thy fellowes, who are in their ſteps, who through coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes making merchandize of ſoules, and your people are ever learning, and not able to come to the knowledge of the truth, and goes for gifts and rewards, and are falſe accuſers and ſuch like. Nay but underſtand me better, for I ſay thou art a falſe Prophet, and thou art now, though thy root ſprang forth in the time of the Apoſtles of which thou art a branch, and thy fellows; And though I ſaid that Antichriſt was in the dayes of <hi>John,</hi> and this was before a Quaker was heard of, my words I own, prove that, that the Chriſtians was called Quakers at that day if thou canſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I alow not thee to be my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, except I found thee more honeſt, but doth condemne thy meaning upon my words, and though thou ſay inſtead of proving our ſelves not falſe Prophets, we prove our ſelves no Chriſtians, becauſe I ſaid (that word) Quakers was not <hi>heard of</hi> in thoſe dayes. Now conſider, are they no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now, whoſe title or name without, was not given or heard of, in the Apoſtles dayes, then Proteſtants are no Chriſtians, nor Independants are no Chriſtians, nor Anabaptiſts are no Chriſtians, becauſe they were not called ſo in the Apoſtles dayes, and while thou haſt thought to prove us no Chriſtians, haſt caſt out thy ſelfe alſo, then thou art no better then we, and what poor arguments theſe are, let the wiſe conſider, and vaine conſequences, I did not ſay there were no Quakers then, but not a Quaker beard of <hi>(viz)</hi> by that name; for there was thouſands of Quakers, who trembled and quaked at the word of the Lord, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David, Jeremiah, Iſaack, Paul</hi> with many more were Quakers, and tremble<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As to that of ſome bidding thee throw away the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed upon ſuch termes, it might be ſpoken ſo as to be owned, a lyer and a ſlanderer is an unfit fellow to meddle with the Scriptures, or to take the name of the Lord, or of the man Chriſt Jeſus, in his mouth, and I may ſay truly what haſt thou (unrighteous perſon) to doe, to take his name, and truth in thy mouth, hateing to be reformed.</p>
            <p>And in that I ſay of thy crying againſt Chriſt within, this is true who ſaid there was nothing in thee, nor any man (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acception) to be taken notice of, as we may prove by witneſſe though thou deny it; then, was not Chriſt within, and what leſſe is this, then to cry againſt him, when as thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him within, or elſe concluded he is not worth taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. And though thou ſay I falſely ſpeak of thee in ſaying thou calls the Doctrine of Chriſt within, falſe opinions, and take in hand to diſcover it, but the falſeneſſe is in thee, who hath utterd that which is untruth, and contrary to the Goſpel,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118822:28"/>
and now denyes it, or would hide thy wickedneſſe; for thou having framed an objection, and ſpeaks of ſome that are for a Chriſt within, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then thou ſaiſt, thou will diſcover the falſity of ſuch opinions, Now thou doſt here reckon the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt within falſe opinion, (or among them at leaſt) let the Reader judge, and be thou ſilent for ſhame; but all thou ſaiſt cleares thee not, from what I ſaid of thee, God ſhall judge thee thou lying tongue, and deceitfull heart.</p>
            <p>Then thou charges me with folly and to eat my firſt words, and to be unſtable in judgement, and to fight againſt the truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From my queſtion asked, doth not the Scripture ſay, Chriſt is within, except you be reprobates, and is not this thus much, all is reprobates but they in whom Chriſt is within, and yet becauſe I ſaid the meaſure or manifeſtation of the Spirit, is given, to every man, this thou haſt catched. at, and would prove it unſound, but truth is over thee, and both theſe are true; and further, I ſay that Chriſt is given into the world, yea to all, but all receives him not, and they that doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him are reprobates, though he be given but not received, and the folly and fighting againſt truth is in thy ſelfe, who ſaith it is contrary to the Scriptures to ſay the Spirit is giving to every one, thou here lyeſt of the Scripture as its proved and I doe not befoole my ſelfe in ſaying the words (or ſome of them) I own in thy book, though I have written againſt the book, for though thou ſpeak Chriſt words and the Apoſtles words, yet thy voyce is the ſtrangers and thy voyce I deny, what ever words thou ſpeakes, and is not befooling my ſelfe, and here I could juſtly end my diſcourſe, and what is ſaid is ſufficient, to manifeſt thee and me, to the honeſt Reader. And thus far thy weapons of ſlanders are broken, and thy refuge of lyes are layd-waſt, and this alſo is caſt by, as our ſpoyled prey of <hi>Babylons</hi> treaſure, and trampled upon, and know that we are of God, and he that is of God heareth us; and to our God, ſhall all bow; and before him tremble.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſeemes to be greatly offended, and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling very much, at my anſwers to thy Queries, becauſe thy carnall conceptions is not ſatisfied, nor thy vaine minde grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, having as thou thinkſt great occaſion againſt me thereby,

            <p>And whereas further I ſpeake at the end of my Anſwers of Chriſt within the hope of glory and ſaid, it is that miſtery which long hath been hid from ages, but now is made manifeſt and declared, and though the wiſe of this world cannot receive it, but ſpeaks evill againſt it, yet it is deare unto us, and ſo much more precious becauſe deſpiſed by ſuch as him and ſuch things are a teſtimony to us and againſt you, <hi>(viz.)</hi> our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As in my 29.

recalled; and before the long ſuffering of God come to an end and you be ſhut up in utter darkneſſe, and indeed friends the day haſtens wherein every man ſhall receive according to his deeds; he that hath done evill ſhall not be cloaked, and he that hath done good ſhall not be uncovered, in that day when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be laid open, and ſearched with the eternall eye; the end of my worke is to clear the truth, and the way thereof, (God is witneſſe) from thy ſlanderous and lying and perverting tongue, and onely I reproove thee, by the Spirit of the Lord, and ſo leaves thee to receive thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the juſt God of righteous judgement; who upon thy head will render vengeance in flames of fire, in his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day, which upon thee comes ſuddenly, even when thou and you cries peace, peace, then ſhall deſtruction come as an armed man from which thou ſhalt not fly to eſcape, though now you all be hardened againſt the Lord and his way and truth, and hath even bent thy tongue for lyes, and hath reproached the innocent, to the peirceing of thy own ſoule, and one day ſhalt thou know it, therefore bow and tremble before the Lord God, thou and all thy companions, a lyar and ſlanderer thou art, a perverter and wreſter of the right way of God, and of the Scriptures, a hipocrite and diſſembler, a holder forth of damnable doctrines an envious man, and falſe accuſer, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning another falſly in what thy ſelfe is fully guilty of; theſe things I lay to thy charge juſtly in the preſence of the Lord God, and upon thy account are they reckoned by him, and proved by teſtimony in the ſight of man (and may be more fully hereafter if any thing be wanting) and one day ſhalt thou feele the burthen of them, though now thou be above ſhame; and all thy lyes, ſlanders, deceits, confuſions, hypocriſies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, and damnable doctrines of Devils, with impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy held forth by thee, ſhall be conſumed in the Pit of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and then ſhall the witneſſe in thy conſcience juſtifie the Lord (in condemning thee) &amp; me, to be true in reproving thee, and this I ſay to thee, and you all, the liveing God you know not, nor his Son Jeſus Chriſt; but are enemies to God and <note n="*" place="margin">Witneſſe one of their brethren a Juſtice of peace (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to all their ſhame.</note> perſecuters of the Lord of life, and ſhall periſh among the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, yee falſe witneſſes, and wicked helpers; you may

be aſhamed of your teſtimony ſubſcribed at the beginning of his lying ſcribble, will you yet ſay <hi>through Grace,</hi> thoſe things are true; the father ſtop your mouthes in the duſt, who hath offended the Lord, more then defended him, or your ſelves; and be aſhamed in the preſence of God and man, much more may be ſaid hereafter, to lay you further open, if you yet hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your hearts in your wickedneſſe, but I doe rather reprove you, then ſtrive with you, and rather deſires your return to God, then your condemnation by him, and with this I ſhall end, and by what is ſaid in ſhort is ſufficient to manifeſt you, and <hi>John Bunian</hi> to all honeſt people, what generation you are of, and that you are guided by a lying and unclean ſpirit, and that you are doing the Devils worke in gain-ſaying the way of truth and righteouſneſſe, by your multitude of lyes and ſlanders, and damnable doctrines, and whatever you account or falſly judge of me, yet am I true (though as a deceiver) and the Lords ſervants, and a witneſſe for him and againſt all your lyes and ſlanders, and wickedneſſe hatched amongſt you and brought forth by a lyeing orator whom you have made your mouth into the view of the world, even a curſed birth, and the father of it; and the womb that conceived it, and it ſhall rot, and periſh as the dunge and not accompliſh any part of the end, of your deſire, for ſo loathſome it is, being truly ſearched and laid open that it hath not obtained neither the praiſe of God nor man, but is defamed by men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of God; alas, alas, for thee <hi>John Bunian</hi> thy ſeverall months travell in griefe and paine, is a fruitleſſe birth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes as an untimely fig, and its praiſe is blotted out among men, and its paſſed away as ſmoak; <hi>Truth,</hi> is a top of thee, and out-reaches thee, and thy formed weapons cannot proſper, and it ſhall ſtand for ever to confound thee, and all its enemies; and though thou wilt not ſubject thy mind to ſerve it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet a ſlave to it muſt thou be and what thou doſt in thy wickedneſſe againſt it, the end thereof brings forth the glory of it, and thy owne confounding and ſhame; and now be wiſe and learned, and put of thy armour, for thou maiſt underſtand the more thou ſtrives, the more thou art entangled, and the higher thou ariſes in envy, the deeper is thy fall into confuſion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118822:34"/>
and the more thy arguments are, the more increaſed is thy folly, let experience teach thee, and thy own wickedneſſe correct thee, and thus, I leave thee, and if thou wilt not owne the light of Chriſt in thy owne conſcience, now to reprove thee and convince thee, yet in the day of judgement thou ſhalt owne it, and it ſhall witneſſe the juſtneſſe of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, when for thy iniquities he pleads with thee, and behold as a theife in the night, when thou art not awarre, he will come, and then woe unto thee that art poluted,</p>
