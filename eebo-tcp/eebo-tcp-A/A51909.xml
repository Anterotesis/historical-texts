            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first part of my
labour is, to shew
what words are acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
in the Law,
and what not? In the
prosecution of which,
ti's not my purpose
to run over all the cases that have bin
adjudged, neither can I if I would; my

them rightly to manage that,<note place="margin">Cooke, l. 4 fol. 20. b.</note>

proves often the greatest good, or the
greatest evill to most men. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to deterre men from words, which
are but winde (as hee further speakes)
which subject men to actions, in
which dammages and costs are to bee
recovered, which usually trench to the
great hinderance and impoverishment
of the speakers.</p>
            <p>And in truth that which caused mee
to enter upon this labour, was the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency
of these actions; for I may with
confidence affirme, that they doe at this
day bring as much Gryse to the Mill, if
not more, then any one branch of the
Law whatsoever. And it were to bee
wished and certainly never in a better
time then now) that the greatest part of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46451:4"/>
them were suppressed, that words only
of brangle, heate and choler, might not
he so much as mentioned in those high
and honourable Courts of Justice. For
I professe for my part, I judge of them
as a great dishonour to the Law, and the
professors thereof; especially when I
consider that they are used only as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to promote the malice, and
vent the spleene of private jarres and
discontents amongst men.</p>

               </gap> Law, but onely to reprehend
the folly of such, who upon every slight
and triviail occasion (like many in these
contention times) care not to intayle
a suite upon them and their posterity;
though in Fine they docke their owne
intayles without recovery: and justly
may actions for words come within
the compasse of the Apostles exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I doe not condemne all actions for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46451:5"/>
words neither, for it is but equall, that
where a mans life, liveliehood; or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
(which is dearer to him then the
former) is much endangered by scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
words, that in such case the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
should bee inforced by action to
make compensation. But that a man
should flee to the Law out of malice,
and make the Courts of Justice main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of every small and vaine brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
this seemes to me utterly unlawfull
and intolerable amongst Christians.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice of that which
<hi>Wray Chiefe Iustice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cooke, lib. 4. f. 15. b.</note> saith in <hi>Cookes</hi> 4th
Booke, That though slanders and false
imputations are to be repressed because
that oftentimes <hi>a verbis ad verbera per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum
est;</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>confes tends much
to the disturbance of the common peace,
and therefore by all meanes possible to
bee prevented. Yet he saith, that the
Judges have resolved, that actions for
scandalls should not bee maintained by
any strained construction or argument,
nor any favour extended for supportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them. And he addes the reason
of it, because they doe abound more in
these dayes; then in times past, and the
intemperance and malice of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46451:5"/>
               <hi>Et malitijs hominum est obvian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum;</hi>
and further addes, that in our old
bookes, actions for scandalls are very
rare, and such as are brought, are for
words of eminent slander, and of great
importance.</p>
            <p>I is true that the Law doth in some
cases discountenance these actions, and
therefore we have a rule, that words if
they admit of a double construction,
shall alwayes be taken in the best sence
for him that speakes them (as I shall
make evident hereafter) because usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are spoken in chollar and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>This I say the Law doth, where the
words are amphibolus; but if the words
are clearely actionable, in such case the
Law will never ayde a man, though they
were spoken in the distemper of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which seemeth very hard and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</p>
            <p>Nay which is yet more extreame, if
counsell shall but informe the Jury of
the quality and reputation of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
and also make them understand [if
they be capable the true sence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the words, and the hainousnes
of them; such words, against such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46451:6"/>
this inforced and prest on by emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Councell, shall make a Jury give a
hundred pounds dammages, whereas it
doth not appeare to them, that the
Plaintiffe by the speaking of the words
was prejudiced one farthing, a case of
very great extremity, and worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
            <p>And can any man deny, but that this
is a countenancing of these frivolous
Actions: But give mee leave Reader,
and I will in a word informe you how
this may be remedied: and though the
malice of men cannot bee stopped, yet
their Actions may.</p>
            <p>Let no words be actionable which do
appeare to have beene spoken in chollar
and passion, or if actionable, yet let the
Plaintiffe recover no more in damage,
then hee can upon Oath make appeare,
that hee was actually damnified by the
speaking of them; and if this were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by Act of Parliament, our new
bookes would bee as little infested with
these frivolous actions, as the old ones
are. But I cannot thus baulke that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of that learned Chiefe Justice

for scandalls are very rare, and such as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46451:6"/>
are brought, are for words of eminent
slanders and of great importance.</p>
            <p>This must needs bee acknowledged
to be a most exact and true observation,
for in searching of the Books, I cannot
finde that any Action for scandalous
words was brought before <hi>E.</hi> 3. time, and

<hi>Traytor. Felon;</hi> and <hi>Robber,</hi> no frivolous
cause of action.</p>
            <p>And I finde but three Actions for
words brought in 22. yeares of <hi>E.</hi> 4.
and those for one and the same words,<note place="margin">2 E. 4, 5, 15. E. 4. 32 &amp; 4. 3.</note>

            <p>In all the 21. yeares of <hi>H.</hi> 7. there is
not one action that I can find brought

no trifling words; for you shall finde
that one of them was for calling a man
<hi>Heretike,</hi> another for saying a man was
perjured; and the other three for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of one Thiefe all of which are high
scandals to a mans reputation and most
of them tending to the losse of life and
fortunes; so that it is very true that
that Reverend Chiefe Justice observed,
that these Actions were very rare in our
old bookes, and such as were brought
were for words of emminent slander,
and of great importance.</p>
            <p>But these few have now got such a
numerous progeny that I feare we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
turne over many leaves in our new
books, but wee shall finde one of these
Actions. They began thus to multiply
in the <hi>Queenes</hi> time, as wee finde in my
Lord <hi>Cockes</hi> 4. book, where there is no
lesse then 17. adjudged cases together
upon these Actions.</p>
            <p>And you may easily judge, they did
not abate in <hi>King Iamses</hi> his time; for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46451:7"/>
(if I mistake not) there is no lesse then
two and twenty adjudged cases upon
these Actions in my LORD <hi>Hobarts</hi>
Book.</p>
            <p>And I am certaine they are not fallen
in His Majesties Raigne that now is;
for I my selfe have reported no lesse
then three and twenty judgments upon
these Actions but from <hi>Easter</hi> Tearme
in the sixteenth yeare of the King, to
<hi>Trinity</hi> Tearme in the eighteenth.</p>
            <p>Well therefore might <hi>Wray Chiefe
Iustice</hi> say, that the malice of men doth
more increase in these times, then in
times past; and as he saith, the malice
of men ought to be with stood as much
as may be; which I am sure the too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
tollerating of Actions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
wil not effect,<note place="margin">Psal. 37. ver. 1. 2.</note> no more then fire can
be extinguished by adding fewell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. You have heard my advise and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
before, therfore I will here close
this with one word, though the tongues
of men be set on fire, I know no reason
wherefore the Law should bee used as
Bellowes to bow the Coles.</p>
            <p>It is the saying of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;
I will take heed to my ways, that I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
not with my tongue, I will keepe my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46451:8"/>
mouth as it were with a Bridle.</hi> It were
happy for all men if they could make
the like resolution, and keep it. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that wee are but men; whilest wee
carry this lump of flesh and masse of
corruption about us, we shall be subject
to the like passions and affections that

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> have beene before us, and the
flesh will rebell against the spirit. And
therefore I have provided this Treatise
upon Actions of slander, as a Bridle for
all rash and inconsiderate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ongues; that
seeing the mischiefe they may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
know how to avoyd it.</p>
            <p>And here I shall lay downe this as a
generall rule, which I shall by the way
as I goe, make good in every perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>That all scandalous words which touch
or concerne a man in his life, Liberty, or
Member or any corporall punishment; or
which scandall a man in his Office or place
of Trust; or in his Call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng or function by
which he gaines his living; or which tend
to the slandering of his Title or his disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;
or to the losse of his advance,
me it, or preferment, or any other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
damage; or lastly which charge a man
to have any dangerous infectious disease,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46451:8"/>
by reason of which he ought to seperate
himselfe, or to be seperated by the Law
from the society of men: all such words
are actionable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And first for the first part of this Rule
viz.</hi> Scandalous words which touch or
concerne a man in his life; such words are
actionable.</p>
            <p>If a man call another Traitor,<note place="margin">30. Ass fol 19. 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 14. &amp; 22.</note> Felon

            </p>
            <p>So it is all one if one shall say of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

him, if it appeare to be intended
to be wittingly done, or the like, these
words likewise are Actionable, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares

            <p>So if one shall say of another he hath

judgement that the words were not
certaine enough to ground an Action
upon, because the Plaintiffe might have
more Brothers, and it doth not appeare
of which of them the words were spoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but it was resolved that the action
would well lie, because it is alledged
that they were spoken of the Plaintiffe,
and the Jury have found accordingly;
and here <hi>Tanfield Iustice</hi> tooke this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
where the words themselves
are incertaine, as to say, one of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
is perjured, there they can never
be made good by any averrement, but
where the words are certaine in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
so that it may appeare that the

there they may bee made certaine by
such a Declaration, and the finding of

            <p>Fifthly, where former words actionable
are qualified with subsequent words not
Actionable, there though the former words
spoaken generally, aud by themselves
would have maintained an Action, yet
now, taking altogether, they will not bee
Actionable.</p>
            <p>Thou art a Theefe, for thou hast sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len

that in all these cases, the Law which

words are not actionable, because
though the former words would beare
an Action, the latter do so qualifie and
extenuate them, that taking altogether
they are not actionable for the latter
words do explaine his intent, that hee
did not intend any judiciall perjury; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
it was impossible, that a Stake could
prove him perjured, and therefore for
the impossibility, and insensibility of

the words the action would not lie.</p>

beare an Action; because that the words
do not import that he hath done or is

an inclination to it only.</p>
            <p>But if a man say of another that hee

of my Lord <hi>Cookes;</hi> and the reason
of the case seemes to intimate as much
unto us; which is, that the purpose or

truth.</p>
            <p>But I conceive it is as true, that
where that purpose or intent is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
by an overt act or attempt that
that is punishable.</p>

in waite to assault him, but if hee
had said that he would have murdered,
or would have robbed <hi>I. S.</hi> an action
would not lye, because hee only guesses
at his imagination.</p>

because such lying in waite is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

            <p>By this case it should seeme, that to
charge a man with an attempt only to
commit Felony, as to say of a man that
hee offered to rob, or to poyson, or to
murder I. S. that these should be actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
for I think the like punishment
is in these cases, as in the former, which
I conceive is only the good behaviour,
or at most indictable for it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
fined.</p>
            <p>And if an action should lye in such
case; by the same reason, to say of a
man, that he is a common Quarreller,
breaker, or perturber of the Peace, or
that hee is a Riotter or the like would
beare an action, because that for these
likewise the good behaviour is granta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

will not in such case punish a man; for
then no man durst claime his owne for
feare of an action.</p>
            <p>But upon these Bookes I conceive
the Law is evident, that if a man had
published another to be the Villein of
<hi>I. N.</hi> that in such case an action would
have layne, because these words tend to
the inslaving of him and his posterity,
and to the utter deprivation of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertys,
which the Law so much favours,
for, as it is well knowne, he that was a

that he might seize all his Estate reall

            <p>But I conceive that at this day an

for if they be not worth twelve pence,
so that it is but petty Larceny, and not

            <p>By this it is evident, that to say a man

thereof imprisonment. And hee held
that all scandalous words, which if they
were true, would make a man lyable
either to a pecuniary or a corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
would beare an action.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Mallet Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Bramston
Chiefe Iustice</hi> were of a contrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and their reason was because
that if this should be law, it would be
a great occasion to increase and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
actions for words, which the Law
labours to suppresse as much as may be
for then all words spoken of any man,
which if they were true would subject
him to a penalty, either by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
or the Statute Law would beare
an action, as to say of a man that hee
hath erected a Cottage, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

which the Law will not suffer

            <p>
               <hi>Mallet</hi> Justice in the arguing of this

calling of a man Recusant, and hee said
that his opinion was, the action was
not maintainable, I never heard what
became of that case, but I conceive
the Law to bee with Justice <hi>Mallet;</hi>
for though there bee many penalties
and forfeitures provided by Statutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Recusants, yet no corporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
is given by any of them; no
not after conviction.</p>

the action will not lye for saying

I conceive upon the case aforesaid, that
to say of one, who is no Attorney, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of Peace, nor other publike
Officer that he is a Champertor, or a
common maintainer of suites, will not
be actionable, nor is it actionable in
case of the Atorney to say that he is a
common maintainer of suites.</p>
            <p>The reason of these cases may bee,
because that though any man may bee
indicted for being a common Barre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
Champertor, or maintainer of
suites, and thereupon fined and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned;
yet the punishment is only the
Fine, and the imprisonment as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
or incident thereunto.</p>
            <p>And as it is said before in <hi>Hawes</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:46451:34"/>
case, if an action should lye in these
cases, then in all cases, where a man
shall charge a man with a crime or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
for which a man might be indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

which would occasion multitudes of

slander to him in his function by which

if a man [saith he have a Bayliffe, to
whom he commits the buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his Corne and graine, and gives
him the greater wages in respect of
that trust and imployment, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
him to have deceived him in his

will beare an Action, because this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credits
him in his Office, and may not
only, because to put him out of that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

(as I have said before) are as a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
for all Actions for words what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
and therefore if you meet with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46451:41"/>
scandalous words, which touch a man
in his Office or place of trust, examine
them by those rules, if they be too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
or not s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of a double intendment, or doubtfull
in meaning, or incertaine in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or the person of whom they are
spoken, or the like in such cases they
will not be actionable, and therefore
those Rules ought especially to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>The fourth part of that generall rule
which I have laid downe before, and
which in course I must now speake of,
is this.</p>
            <p>That words spoken of a man, which
scandall him in his profession or function
by which he gaines his living, will beare
an Action.</p>

               <hi>Dawtry</hi> is a

suffered me to be condemned at

Attorney for me. The only words held
considerable in this case were these;
the Defendants saying that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
tooke Fees of both hands, and
whether this would amount to as much
as if he had said the Plaintiffe was an

            <p>
               <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Yelverton, Iustices</hi> that
the action would not lie, because that
the words in this case may have a
double intendment, for it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that hee tooke Fees with both

not permit; and the rather as this case
is, because that hee doth charge him

though that he were once a Bankrupt,
yet it may be now that he is of credit.
But it was resolved that the Action

would lie, because that it was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of his credit for if he were

because that the words are too general.
But if they had touched him in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
they would have borne an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And therefore to call a Marchant
Bankrupt, will beare an Action; but to
say of a Lawyer that he is a Bankrupt,
will not be Actionable the reason may
be, because that a Lawyer cannot bee a

the plaintiffe entred into the said Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Tittesey. and further shewes
that <hi>William</hi> had issue <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his
heire apparent, and that the plaintiffe
had a wife and sonnes and daughters;
and that he had an intent to conveye
some of his lands to his wife for her
ioynture, and some to his sonnes and
daughters for their advancement and
to exchange parcell with others, and to
make a lease of another parte, but doth
not shew to whom, and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
<hi>premissorum non ignarus</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46451:48"/>
of the Title and estate of the
plaintiffe, said these words to the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe.
As I before said to your Wife,
I say now that your brother was afoole
and never borne to doe himselfe any
good, for that he could not hould his
hands from ratefying and subscribing
to his Fathers will: bnt yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
I have that to shew in my
house that if his heire doe not any such
Act as hee hath done, it shall bring
her to inherit Tittesey, by which words
he saith, that hee was hindred in the
conveyances aforesaid.</p>
            <p>In this case it was resolved that the
Action would not lie, first because that
the words themselves are not scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to the Title of the plaintiffe: the
words considerable are onely these,
that he had that in his house, &amp;c. that
shall bring her [that is the Daughter
and Heire of <hi>William</hi>] to inherit <hi>Titte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey;</hi>
which is apparently feasible, for the
Plaintiffe being Donee in Taile of the
guift of his Father, the Daughter and
Heire of the eldest Brother is inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Revertion in Fee; and so
no prejudice to the Plaintiffe, to say
he hath that which shall bring her to
inherit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:46451:48"/>
Besides the action will not lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that he doth not shew any special
damnification by the speakeing of these
words as that he was upon a sale of
these lands to I. S. who by reason of
the speaking of these words refused to
buy them, or the like; and in this case,
here was nothing but a purpose or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of conveying some of these lands.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Popham Iustice</hi> said, that there
is a difference when a man declares his
opinion of the Title of another to land
this is nothing, and he shall not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for it, but if he doth so publish
it, that it comes to the hearing of any
one that intended to buy the Land in
such case an Action lies, but he must
shew specially in his Count in what he
was damnified, otherwise the Action
will not lie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Banister</hi> brought an Action against
<hi>Banister</hi> for that the Defendant said of
the Plaintiffe (being Sonne and Heire
to his Father) that he was a Bastard,<note place="margin">Trin. 25. of the Queene in the Kings Bench.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that the Action would lie, for
this tends to his disinherision of the
Land which discends to him from his
Father.</p>
            <p>But in this case it was resolved, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46451:49"/>
if the Defendant pretend that the plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiffe
was a Bastard, and that he himselfe
was next heire, there no Action lies.</p>
            <p>So if a man say that another hath noe
right to land, an Action lies; but if a
Counseller say that his Client hath the
better right, this will not beare an
Action.</p>
            <p>Mich. 3. Jac. in the Kings Bench <hi>per
Curiam,</hi> if one say to me that I am a
Bastard, if I have Land by discent, I
shall have an Action upon the case, and
thought that I have Land by discent, and
this tends to my disinheritance, if I sue
in Court Christian for it, a Prohibition
lies, because that the tryall there may
be to my disinheritance.</p>
            <p>And if one say to another that hee is
base borne, an action will not lie, for
the words shall be taken in <hi>meliori sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su.</hi>
And if one say to his Sonne that he
is a Bastard, or a Leaper, hee shal not
have an action neither in Court Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
nor at Common Law.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard</hi> brought an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against <hi>Mary Dickinson,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coke lib. 4. fo. 18.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
how that he was seised of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
lands in Fee, and that hee was in
communication to demise them to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46451:49"/>
               <hi>Ralph Egerton</hi> fot 22. yeares for 200. l.
Fine and a 100. l. rent <hi>per annum,</hi> and
that the Defendant <hi>(premissorum non ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nara)</hi>
said, I have a Lease of the Mannor
and Castle of <hi>H.</hi> (which was the same
lands) for ninety yeares, and shewed
and published it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by reason of which
words (he saith) the said <hi>Ralph Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
did not proceed to accept the Lease
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this case it was resolved, that no
Action would lie for the said words,
though they were false, because that
the Defendant pretended an interest
in the said land.</p>
            <p>So if the Defendant had affirmed and
published that the Plaintiffe had not
any right to the said Land, but that she
her selfe had right to it, in this case
because that the Defendant pretends
title to it though, that in truth, shee
hath not any, yet no Action lies. For
if in such case an Action should lie,
how could any one make claime or
title to any land, or commence any suit
or seeke advise and Counsell, but hee
should be subject to an Action; which
would be very inconvenient.</p>
            <p>Agreeing with these cases,<note place="margin">2. E. 4. 5. 15. E. 4. 32</note> in 2. <hi>E.</hi> 4.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46451:50"/>
and 15. E. 4. it is resolved that no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

publishing another to be his Villeine.</p>
            <p>The sixt part of that generall Rule
which I have laid downe before; and
am now to speake of is this.</p>
            <p>That scandalous words which tend to
the hinderance or losse of a mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
or preferrement, or which
cause any particular damage, will beare
an Action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anne Davies</hi> brought an Action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Gardiner</hi> for these words,<note place="margin">Coke lib. 4. fo. 16. b.</note> spoken
to one <hi>B.</hi> a Suiter to the Plaintiffe
and with whom a marriage wss almost'
concluded. I know <hi>Davies</hi> Daughter
well, shee did dwell in Cheape side and
a Grocer did get her with Childe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and shee saith that by reason of the
speaking of these words, the said <hi>B.</hi>
utterly refused to take her to Wife, so
that thereby she lost her advancement,
&amp;c. adjudged that the Action would
lie, because that if shee had a Bastard
she was punishable by the Statute of
18. of the Queene cap. 3.</p>
            <p>But it was in this case further resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that if the defendant had charged
the Plaintiffe with bare incontinency
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46451:50"/>
only yet the Action would have laine,
by reason that by the said slander shee
was defeated of her advancement in
Marriage.</p>
            <p>And it was in this case likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that if a Divine be to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to a Benefice, and one, to defeat
him of it, saith to the Patron that he is
a Heretique or a Bastard, or that he is
excommunicated, by which the Patron
refuses to present him (as he well
might, if those imputations were true)
and he loses his preferrement, that in
this case an Action will lie.<note place="margin">Hil: 4. Iac. in the Kings Bench.</note>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en upon a question
very necessary to be resolved, and that
is.</p>
            <p>What words are Actionable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
only? and what are not Actionable,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46451:51"/>
without alledgeing of a particular damage;
I take this for a Rule, that scandalous
words which touch or concerne a man in
life, liberty, or Member, or any corporall
punishment, or which scandall a man in his
office or place of trust, or in his calling or
function, by which he gaines his living, or
which charge him with any great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
disease, by reason of which hee
ought to seperate himselfe or to be sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Law from the society of Men;
all such words will beare an Action, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
averring or alledging of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
damage by the speaking of them.</p>
            <p>Yet I do not deny, but that it is best
to alledge a particular damage, if the
case will beate it; and it is usuall so to
doe in these cases, for the increase of
damages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bramston chiefe Iustice</hi> in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
of <hi>Hawes</hi> case which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
before tooke this for a Rule,<note place="margin">Mic. 17. Car. in the Kings Bench.</note> that
if words did import a scandall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by which damage might accrue,
in such case the words would beare an
Action, without alledgeing of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
damage.</p>
            <p>But now on the other side, words which
doe not touch or concerne a man in any
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46451:52"/>
of the cases aforesaid, will not beare an
Action, without alledgeing of a particular
damage.</p>
            <p>Words spoken in scandall of a mans
Title will not beare an Action; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
averring of a particular damage, as
appeares by the cases before cited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ground.</p>
            <p>There are many words,<note place="margin">Cook lib. 4. 10. 15. b</note> which are

or a varlet,<note place="margin">Averre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> or the like, these words are

the Booke of Common Prayer and said
that it was not fit to bee read in the

the speaking of these words by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he was cited in to the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
Court and had paid and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

the words themselves were not Actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
because if they had beene true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:46451:54"/>
they charge him only with an offence
against a penall Law, which doth not
inflict corporall p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nishment, but for
non payment of the penalty.</p>
            <p>But it was resolved that for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
damage the Action would lie,
and of this opinion were <hi>Heath</hi> and
<hi>Mallet Iustices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Bramston Chiefe Iustice,</hi> (the other
Justice being absent) was of a contrary
judgement, and hee tooke this for a
Rule, that if the words did not import a
scandall in themselves (as Hee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
they did not in this case) in such
case the averrement of a particular
damage should not make them Actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>But with all due respect to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this learned Judge, I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the words are in themselves
scandalous; because that they do charge
a Man with faction and opposition to
established Law, and settled Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But if they were not in themselves
scandalous, yet I conceive (according
to the judgement of those reverent
J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dges) that for the dammage only the

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46451:54"/>
shall suffer through the default of
the Defendant, and be without remedy,
which I conceive the Law will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
but I submit this to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the learned <hi>Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, words which charge a man with
any dangerous infectious diseas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of which he ought to seperate himselfe,
or to be seperated by the Law, from the
society of men, will beare an Action.</p>
            <p>If a man say of another that hee hath
the French Pox,<note place="margin">Coke lib. 4. fo. 17.</note> an Action will lie.</p>
            <p>Taylor brought an Action against
<hi>Packins</hi> for these words, thou art not
worthy to come into any honest
mans company,<note place="margin">Hill. 4. Iac. in the Kings Bench.</note> thou art a Leaprous
knave, and a Leaper. Adjudged that
the words are Actionable, because that
it is cause of seperation by the Law of
God and Man.</p>
            <p>So by <hi>Tanfield Iustice</hi> to say that
one is infected with the French Pox,
will beare an Action, but to say that
one h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th the falling Sicknesse, is not
Actionable, except that it disables him
in his profession, as to say that a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
hath the falling Sicknesse, an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because that it disableth him
for his businesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:46451:55"/>
Vpon this ground I conceive, to say
of a man that hee is infected with the
Plague, will beare an Action, because
this also is a dangerous infectious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and a cause of separation.</p>
            <p>I have now finished my task of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you what words are Actionable in
the Law, and what not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
I shall not end this Treatise here,
for there are many things not worthy
the knowing (which I could not aptly
introduce before) and therefore not to
be omitted.</p>
            <p>There are two things or grounds very
remarkable in all Actions upon the case
for words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First Causa dicendi, the ground or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the speaking of the words:</hi> And
that must be collected out of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
discourse or communication con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Plaintiffe; or else out of
the relation that the words themselves
have to the Defendant, or otherwise, as
the case shall fall out to be.</p>
            <p>The next thing is the affection of the
Speaker, that is to say whether the words
were spoken Ex malitia, or not?</p>
            <p>First, for the first, <hi>Causa dicendi,</hi> the
ground or occasion of speaking of the
words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:46451:55"/>
               <hi>And here I shall lay downe this as
a ground,</hi> that scandalous words which
of themselves singly would beare an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
yet being joyned to other words or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and so Causa dicendi, or the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
matter being considered, they will not
beare an Action. <hi>For</hi> Sensus verborum
ex causa dicendi accipiendus est, <hi>&amp;c. And
words must ever be construed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the subject matter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coke lib. 4. fo. 13. b</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> brought an
Action <hi>de Scandalis Magnatum</hi> against
<hi>Edmund Denny,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coke ubi supra.</note> Vicar of N. in the
County of <hi>Norfolke, &amp;c.</hi> for these
words: It is no marvill that you like
not of me, for you like of those that
maintaine sedition against the Queens
proceedings; the Defendant pleaded a
speciall justification, in effect thus;
that the Defendant being Vicar of N.
the Plaintiffe procured I. T. and I. P.
to preach there, who in their Sermons
enveyed against the Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer, and affirmed it to bee su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious;
wherefore the Defendant
inhibited them, for they had no licence
nor authority to preach, yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
through the encouragement of
the Plaintiffe, and the Plaintiffe said
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46451:56"/>
to the Defendant, Thou art a false varle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
I like not of thee; to whom the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
said, It is no marvill though
you like not of me, for you like of those
(meaning the aforesaid I. T. and I. D.)
that maintaine sedition [meaning that
seditious Doctrin] against the Queens
proceedings.</p>
            <p>In this case it was adjudged that the
justification was good. For though
that in this case, taking the words sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of themselves as the Plaintiffe hath
declared, they might have beene Actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
because that then they could not
be construed otherwise then of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and violent sedition, as the word
it selfe doth import.</p>
            <p>Yet now the ground and occasion of
the words appearing, by which it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that the defendant did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any publike or violent sedition,
but only that seditions Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the proceedings of the Queene,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Statute <hi>de anno primo,</hi> by which
the Common Prayer was established,
and God forbid [saith the Booke] that
words by a strict and Grammaticall
construction should be taken contrary
to the manifest intent of the Speaker,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46451:56"/>
therefore it was ruled upon the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of all the words, that the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
was good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so the words not
Actionable.</p>
            <p>And in this case it was ruled, that if
a man bring an Action against another,
for calling of him murderer, and the
Defendant will say that hee was spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with the Plaintiffe of unlawfull
hunting, and that the Plaintiffe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that he had killed divers Hares with
certaine Engines, to whom the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
answered and said, Thou art a
murtherer [meaning the killing of the
said Hares] that this was a good justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and so upon the whole matter
the words not Actionable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Byrchley</hi> an Attorney brought an
Action against one for these words;<note place="margin">Coke lib. 4. fo. 16. 1.</note>
you are well knowne to bee a corrupt
man, and to deale corruptly: resolved
that the words were Actionable, but in
this case it was ruled that if the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
speech had beene that <hi>Byrchley</hi>
was a Vsurer, or that he was Executor
of another, and would not performe
the testament, and upon this the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
had said these words, upon a

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> as aforesaid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, they

would not beare an Action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Banister</hi> and <hi>Banisters</hi> case resolved
that if I call an heire a Bastard,<note place="margin">Coke lib. 4. 10 l 17. a.</note> an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if the defendant pretend
that the plaintiffe is a Bastard and that
he is next heire, there no Action will
lie. The reason of this is plaine, because
<hi>causa dicendi,</hi> or the occasion of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of these words, is not to defame
the Title of the plaintiffe, but only to
justifie the Title of defendant, and
it is lawfull for any one to speak in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of his owne Title, though
hee do thereby seeme to slander the
Title of another man, agreeing with
this case is <hi>Gilbert Gerrards</hi> case cited
before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Molton</hi> brought an Action against
<hi>Clapham</hi> and declares how that there
being a cause pending in this Court
betwixt the plaintiffe and defendant,<note place="margin">See fo. 26: b. 27. a Pasch. 15. Car. in the Kings Bench.</note>
upon reading of certaine Affidavids
of the plaintiffes in Court, the
Defendant said openly in <hi>present<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
&amp; auditu Iusticiariorum &amp; juris
peritorum, &amp;c.</hi> There is not a
word true in the Affidavids, which I wil
prove by forty witnesses: and alledges
that the words were spoken <hi>malitiose.</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:46451:57"/>
yet it was resolved by the Court that
they were not Actionable, because as
they are usuall words upon the like
occasion; so they are spoken in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the defendants cause, and this
case was likened to the case of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
immediatly before.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Bartley Iustice</hi> said that there
are two things mainely considerable in
words, the words themselves, and <hi>causa
dicendi;</hi> and therefore somtimes though
the words themselves would beare an
Action yet <hi>causa dicendi</hi> being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
they will not be Actionable, as
in this case.</p>
            <p>Now as my Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> ses in <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi>
case before remembred,<note place="margin">Coke lib. 4. fo. 14. a.</note> so I say
to you. In these cases, <hi>Reader,</hi> you may
take notice of an excellent point of
learning in Actions for slander; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the cause and occasion of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of them, and how this may bee
pleaded in excuse of the Defendant.</p>
            <p>But before I passe this,<note place="margin">Coke lib. 4. fo. 13. b. 14. a</note> 
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I shall
observe unto you that the defendant
in these cases might take the generall
issue, if he would, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is not
guilty <hi>modo &amp; forma,</hi> as the Plaintiffe
hath alledged, and so give in evidence
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46451:58"/>
the coherence and connection of the
words, and the occasion of speaking of
them, and have them specially found, if
it be conceived to be necessary.</p>
            <p>Or the defendant may [as the case
shall require] justifie the speaking of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
words, and traverse the speaking of
the words in question; and so likewise
upon the evidence have the words spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And hereupon;</hi> where the speciall fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Iury will warrant the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Plaintiffe, and maintaine the
action, and where not? may be very que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable,
and worthy the knowing.</p>
            <p>The Defendants plea is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> must
guid us in these cases, if hee plead not
guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the words are [as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore]
<hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> as the plaintiffe
hath alledged, and if the justifie the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of other words, and traverse the
words in question, he doth it thus, <hi>abs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
hoc,</hi> that he spake the words in the
Declaration <hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> as the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
hath alledged.</p>
            <p>Now where the words that are
founde by the Iury shall bee said to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> with the words
in the Declaration, this is the question,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46451:58"/>
here I shall lay down this as a ground.</p>
            <p>That where the words that are found
do not agree with the Declaration in the
substantiall and essentiall forme, that in
such case, they do not warrant the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
But if they do agree in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
and essentiall form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, though they
agree not in every word, yet they doe well
warrant the Declaration, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
maintaine the Action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sydenham</hi> against <hi>Man</hi> for these
words;<note place="margin">Hob. Rep. pa. 252. pl. 213.</note> If Sir <hi>Iohn Sydenham</hi> might
have his will, he would kill all the true
Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> and the King too,
and he is a maintainer of Papistry and
rebellious persons. The defendant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
other words, and traversed the
speaking of the words <hi>modo &amp; forma,
&amp;c.</hi> the Iury found that he speak these
words, viz. I think in my conscience,
that if Sir <hi>Iohn Sydenham</hi> might have
his will, he would kill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and find all
the subsequent words before Alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and whether the Defendant
were Guilty of speaking of the words
in the manner and forme as they
are Alleadged by the Plaintiffe in
his Declaration, was the Question
resolved against the Defendant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:46451:59"/>
And upon a Writ of Error in the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
Chamber, the Court also inclined
against the defendant, for the matter is
in effect the same, and the forme must
be understood the essentiall forme, not
according to every word, here you have
the ground laid downe before.</p>
            <p>Yet the Booke saith that Pasch. 16.
though the Court inclined that either
of the words would beare an Action,
yet it was agreed that the words were
not found so absolute as the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
neither moved credit in the eare so
fully, which is the force of a slander;
and then they are not the same words
in force and effect, as if the words were
laid, I know him to be a Theefe, and it
were found, I thinke him to bee a
Theefe.</p>
            <p>For my part <hi>Reader,</hi> I doubt in this
case whether the finding of the Jury
do warrant the Declaration, because
they are not the same words in force
and effect (as is said before) And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
they are not the same in the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall
forme of them, for I question,
(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as I have don before) if a man should
say of another, that he doth think if he
might have his will, he would kill all
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46451:59"/>
the Kings true Subjects, and the King
too; or that he doth think such a one
to be a Theefe, whether these words be
Actionable or no, because the words
are no positive charge out only the
thought or opinion of the Defendant.</p>
            <p>But to this it may bee said that if
such words as these should not be acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,
this would open a gap for scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Tongues to slander a man at
pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet no Action lie, which
were very mischievous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore I

the defendant pleaded not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;

was the question, and the doubt
was whether this word (cause) amount
to as much as procure. <hi>Tanfield Iustice</hi>

               <hi>Brugis</hi> is a maintainer of theevs
and a strong Theefe himselfe, issue was
joyned whether the Defendant spoake
the words <hi>modo &amp; forma,</hi> and the Iury
found all the words except the word
[strong] and in this case the Plaintiffe
had judgement.</p>
            <p>Here we may observe that though
every word alledged in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
be not found, yet the essentiall
and substantiall forme of the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found, that is sufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the Declaration. This I say you
may observe not only by this case, but
the cases also before put.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barbar</hi> brought an Action against
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46451:61"/>
               <hi>Hawley</hi> for these words <hi>Iohn Barbar</hi>
and his Children be False Theeves, men
cannot have their Cattell going upon
the Common, but they will kill them,
and eat them, &amp;c. issue was joyned
whether the Defendant spoake the
words <hi>modo &amp; forma,</hi> and the Iury
fonnd that he spoak these words, viz.
Men cannot have their Cattell going
upon the Common, but <hi>Iohn Barbar</hi>
and his Children will kill them with
<hi>Barbars</hi> Doggs in this case it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
for the Defendant.</p>
            <p>The reason is plaine, because the
words found by the Iury do vary in the
essentiall and substantiall forme, from
the words in the Declaration. For the
words in the Declaration do charge the
Plaintiffe with Tneft, for which an
Action would lie, but the words found
by the Iury charg him only with tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
for which no Action will lie, I
have sufficiently proved the ground
laid downe before, and therefore I shal
now proceed to the second thing
[which I have touched before] very
considerable in all Actions for words,
and that is.</p>
            <p>Quo animo, with what affection the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46451:61"/>
words are spoken, whether <hi>ex malitia</hi> or
not? for if it do appeare that they were

in the Law and that he was retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of Counsell against the Plaintiffe
at such a Tryall, and set forth all the
matter in certaine, and that hee in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
evidence to the Jury spoake the
words in the Count (which words were
pertinent to the matter in issue) in this
case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was resolved that the Action
would not lie, because that the words
were not spoken out of malice; for
that they were spoken to the purpose,
and being to the purpose, though the
words were false, no Action will lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Defendant.</p>
            <p>As in an Appeale of Murder, if the
Counsell with the Plaintiffe saith that
the Defendant committed the murder,
though it be not true; yet he shall not
he punished for it, because that what he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46451:62"/>
said was pertinent, so that it cannot be
taken to be spoken out of malice, but
only as of Counsell for the Plaintiffe.</p>
            <p>But if that which he saith be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
in scandall of him against whom
he speaks it, as in Trespasse of battery
to say that the Defendant is a Felon,
there an Action will lie, for that they
cannot be otherwise taken, but to bee
spoken out of malice.</p>
            <p>And in this case it was further said,
that if a Counseller be informed of any
matter of slander apt to be given in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and hee speakes it at other
places, and at another time, then in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
an Action lies for it, for the
same reason.</p>
            <p>In confirmation of the former case,
there was this case put and agreed for
Law, which was the case of Parson <hi>Prit</hi>
in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> the case was thus. In the
Acts and Monuments of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> there
is a relation of one <hi>Greenwood</hi> of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi>
who is there reported to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
himselfe before the Bishop of
<hi>Norwich</hi> in the testifying against a
Martyr in the time of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi>
and that afterwards by the judgement
of God, as an exemplary punishment
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46451:62"/>
for his great offence, his bowels rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of his belly.</p>
            <p>And the said Parson <hi>Prit</hi> being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come to his benefice in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and
not well knowing his Parishoners,
preaching against perjury, cited this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for an example of the justice of God
and it chanced that the same <hi>Greenwood</hi>
of whom the story was written, was in
life, and in the Church at that time, and
after for this slander, brought an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to which the Defendant pleaded
not guilty, &amp;c. and upon evidence all
the matter appeared, and by the rule
of <hi>Anderson</hi> Justice of Assise he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted,
because it did appeare, the
Defendant spoak the words without
malice, and this rule was approved by
the Kings Bench in this case.</p>
            <p>In the arguing of <hi>Sanderson</hi> and
<hi>Rudds</hi> case which I remembred before,
these cases following were cited by
<hi>Gotbolt</hi> Serjeant, who was of Counsell
with the Defendant, and agreed by
the Court for Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Rudlies</hi> case,<note place="margin">40. &amp; 41 of the Queene in Common Pleas.</note> the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46451:63"/>
was full of the French Pox, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advised him not to keepe him
company, adjudged (he said) that no
Action would lie for these words of
advise, the reason is, because that these
words were not spoken out of any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
to the Plaintiffe, but meerely cut
of good will to his friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>Simons</hi> case remembred
before,<note place="margin">Trin. 7. Car. in the Kings Bench.</note> the Plaintiffe brought an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

were spoaken <hi>falso &amp; malitiose;</hi> the

was given that the Action would
not lie, because that they did not find
the malice; for if the words were not
spoaken malitiously, no Action will
lie.</p>
            <p>And therefore I conceive that if a
man bring an Action for words, and
do not declare that the words were
spoken <hi>malitiose</hi> as well as <hi>falso</hi> that the
Action will not lie.</p>
            <p>In the case of the Lady <hi>Morrison</hi> that
I have cited before this case was put by
<hi>Popham chiefe Iustice:</hi>
               <note place="margin">sil. 4 Iac in the Kings Bench.</note> If one say in

that an Action will lie for such counsell,
but quaere saith the Reporter, for it
is without malice. And truly for my

lie for that reason, but I submit it to
the judgement of the Reader.</p>
            <p>And now I have finished my labour of
shewing you what words are Actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

            <p>In this case it was adjudged, that so
the said words not examinable in the

            </p>
            <p>Also by the Law no Murder or

ought to be indicted of it, and upon this

the defendant pleaded not guilty

            <p>
               <hi>Tanfield Iustice,</hi> A conspiracy, nor an
action in nature of a conspiracy wil not
lie, if the plaintiffe bee not <hi>legittimo

the like action upon the case had beene
adjudged to lie well, though that the
Plaintiffe were never acquitted; and
the Justices relied much upon the
words <hi>falso &amp; malitiose;</hi> and after
judgement was given for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe.</p>
            <p>Thus you may see that where a man
is falsly and malitiously procured to be
indicted, if he be acquitted a Writ of
conspiracy, or an action upon the case
in nature of a conspiracy, as the case
shall be, will lie, and though he be not
acquitted, yet an action upon the case
will lie for the slander and vexation.
Yet in all these cases there is a prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in course of justice; but because
this prosecution was malitious, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
much to the slander and scandall of
the plantiffe therefore the action lies.</p>
            <p>But here I would have you observe,
<hi>Reader,</hi> that the plaintiffe ought in
these actions to declare, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
<hi>falso &amp; malitiose</hi> procured him
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46451:68"/>
to bee indicted, because the malice is
the ground of the Action; and if upon
the Tryall it doe appeare that there
was <hi>Probabilis causa</hi> for the indictment
and prosecution therevpon, the Action
will not lie. Thus much shall suffice to
shewe you, in what case a legall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46451:69"/>
and I have seene a Record of a case in
4. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of such an action brought by
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> for such
words which might cause him to be in
contempt, which were holden sufficient
upon which to ground an action, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart
Attorney Generall</hi> for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
also; who said that though an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth not lie for words betwixt

they are touched in life or Member, or
much in reputation; yet if one speake
any scandalous words of an Earle or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Peere of the Realme, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaches
their credit, because that they
are of the great Counsell of the King
and State, and a principall part of the
body politique, so that their discredit
or disparagement, is a disparagement
to all the Realme, therefore every
thing which trenches only to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
is a cause of action, and this was
the cause of the judgement in the case
of the Ducke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in. 4 <hi>H.

the action lies for they are words of
great slander to the Earle. But where
the Statute of <hi>Marleb.</hi> is that Lord
shall not distraine the Beasts of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46451:69"/>
of the King, and carry them into
Castles so that they cannot be replevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and if one say that a Lord hath so
done, yet an Action will not lie, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
Iustice concesset</hi> but he saith if one
say of a Lord that he used to distraine
and put the Beasts in his Castle, <hi>ut su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra,</hi>
an action lies; for one act against
Law wil not bring him into contempt:
but if it be usuall for him so to do, this
is a cause to make him contemptible.
In the case of the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi>
who had made Commissions to his
Servants to make Leases and improve
Rents, one said of him, <hi>My Lord hath
sent his Commissioners to spoyle the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
it was adjudged that this action
would lie, and yet in case of a common
person it would not lie without doubt,
yet because that it may cause the Lord
to be in contempt with the King and
the People, this action lay, and so it
seemes to me that it will here, <hi>Williams
Iustice</hi> to the same purpose; and that
the Earle is <hi>conservator Pacis</hi> at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law and <hi>Comes Regis,</hi> and if any
one speake of them any thing which
may make them to bee contemned of
the King or his people, an action lies
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46451:70"/>
upon this STATVTE.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yelverton Iustice</hi> was absent, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was respited to the intent that
the Defendant by his submission might
give satisfaction to the Earle.</p>
            <p>Here you see the difference between
words actionable in case of a Noble
man, and of a common person. For
words only of descredit to a Nobleman,
and which may bring him to contempt
with the King or his People are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to maintaine an action <hi>de scandalit
magnatum,</hi> otherwise in case of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
person.</p>
            <p>I have now <hi>Reader,</hi> quite finished my
labour of shewing you for what scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
an action will lie, for what not. But
before I conclude, there are two things
yet in all Actions for words worthy the
knowing, which I cannot omit. The
first is to declare unto you the use or
office of an <hi>(innuendo)</hi> And the next is,
to shew you where an <hi>Averrement</hi> will
be necessary, and where not.</p>
            <p>For the first, you may take this for a
certaine and infallible rule.</p>
            <p>That an <hi>(innuendo)</hi> shall never make
words actionable, which of themselves are
not Actionable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:46451:70"/>
And therefore, if words be of a double
or indifferent meaning; and in the one
sence actionable, in the other not; in such,
case an <hi>(innuendo)</hi> shall never make
them actionable.</p>
            <p>As if a man bring an Action against
another for saying that he hath the Pox
[<hi>innuendo</hi> the French Pox] or for saying
that the Plaintiffe burnt his Barne [<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuendo</hi>
a Barne with Corne.]<note place="margin">Coke lib. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fo. 17. b. &amp; 20.. a.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In these cases the <hi>[innuendo]</hi> where
the words are of an indifferent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and may be taken so as not to be
Actionable, shall not straine them to
such an intendement, as to make them
Actionable; and therefore the <hi>[innuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do]</hi>
in these cases is idle and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>So if the words be incertaine of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or the person of whom they are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
an <hi>[innuendo]</hi> shall never make them
actionable.</p>
            <p>If a man bring an action against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
for saying that the Plaintiffe
tooke away money from him with a
strong hand <hi>[innuendo felonice]</hi> here the
words being incertaine in the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Mich. 15. Car. in the Kings Bench. cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note>
whether of a Trespas, or Felony
the <hi>(innuendo)</hi> cannot extend them to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46451:71"/>
an intendment of felony, thereby to
make them actionable, and so it was
adjudged.</p>
            <p>So if a man bring an action against
another,<note place="margin">Hob. Rep: pa: 3 pl. 4</note> for saying that hee forged a
warrant [<hi>innuendo quoddam Warrantum,
&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Axworths</hi> case is
cited before,<note place="margin">Hob. Rep: pa 63, pl 48.</note> or for saying that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a writing <hi>innuendo</hi> such a writing]
as <hi>Harvy and Duckins</hi> case is likewise
cited before. In these cases, because the
words themselves are utterly incertain,
adjudged that the <hi>[innuendo]</hi> shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make them actionable.</p>
            <p>A Servant of <hi>B.</hi> brings an action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
one for these words;<note place="margin">Coke lib. 4. fo. 17 b.</note> One of the
Servants of <hi>B. (innuendo</hi> the Plaintiffe.

And if an Action be brought for these
words, I know one neere about <hi>B.</hi> that
is a notorious Theefe, (<hi>innuendo</hi> the
Plaintiffe:) In these cases, because of
the incertainty of the persons inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the words the <hi>[innuendo]</hi> shall
not make them actionable.</p>
            <p>I could multiply cases upon this
ground, but because these will bee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;
I will adde onely the Office of
an <hi>(imnuendo.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:46451:71"/>
               <hi>The office of an</hi> [innuendo] <hi>is onely to
containe and designe the same person,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cook. lib. 4 fol. 17. b</note>
               <hi>which was named in certaine before:</hi> as
thus, two are speaking together of <hi>B.</hi>
and one of them saith, hee is a Thiefe;
there <hi>B.</hi> in his Count may shew that
there was a speech of him betwixt those
two, and that one of them said of him,
hee (<hi>innuendo</hi> the plaintiffe) is a thiefe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or else to declare the matter or sence
of the words themselves, which was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
expressed before;</hi> as thus, <hi>A.</hi> and
<hi>B.</hi> speaking of <hi>C. A.</hi> said that <hi>C.</hi> was
a Traytor, to whom <hi>B.</hi> said that he was
so too; in this case if <hi>A.</hi> bring an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for these words, he may shew in his
Count, that there was a speech betwixt
him and the defendant of <hi>C.</hi> and that
the plaintiffe said to the defendant that
C. was a Traytor, and that the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
said then to the plaintiffe, that hee
(<hi>innuendo</hi> the plaintiffe) was so too
[<hi>innuendo</hi> a Traytor.]</p>
            <p>In both these cases the <hi>(innuendo)</hi> is
good, becuase it doth its Office, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
of the person, as also in declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the matter or sence of the words
which was certaine before.</p>
            <p>But an <hi>[innuendo]</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cooke lib. fol. 17. <hi>b</hi>
               </note> cannot make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46451:72"/>
certaine, which was incertaine be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore,
nor alter the matter or sence of
the words themselves; for it would be
inconvenient, that actions should bee
maintained by imagination of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
which doth not appeare by the
words, upon which the action is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
but is utterly incertaine, and
subject to deceaveable conjecture.</p>
            <p>For by this meanes, if I should bee
suffered to be the declarer of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or intendment of the incertain and
doubtfull speeches of another man;
I might judge him to speake that, hee
never thought or intended, and so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him for that wherein he never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
            <p>The next and last thing to be considered
is where an averrement will be necessary
in these actions, and where not: <hi>and here
I shall lay downe this as a ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in all cases for words where there
is any thing that is the cause or ground of
the action, or tends necessarily to the
maintenance of it, in such case the action
will not lie, without that thing be expresly
averred to be, or not to be, as the case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.<note place="margin">Hob Rep pag. 8.</note>

for these words; Thou <hi>(innuendo

<hi>nuper mortuum</hi>) adjudged the action
would not lie, because the plaintiffe did
not averre that he was dead at the time
when the words were spoken, and it
was ruled that the <hi>innuendo</hi> was not a
sufficient averrement.</p>
            <p>The reason of these cases, is, because
the death of the party is the ground of
the action, and if hee were not dead
(which shall the rather bee intended,
without the plaintiffe do expresly aver
him to bee dead) then the plaintiffe
could not bee indamaged by the speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the words, and by consequence
no action will lye for them.</p>
            <p>I must confesse that I have a report of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46451:73"/>
a case which was 5. of <hi>King Iames</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged

any such purgation of the slander as
this is, except it doth appeare in the

reported to be dead. But if it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Record, that the party
reported to be dead, was in life, it were
otherwise.</p>
            <p>As it words were spoken of a woman,

            <p>THe next thing <hi>Reader,</hi> that I have
undertaken to discourse of, is,
Arbitrements, the learning whereof
will be very usefull to all men; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that Compremises or Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were never more in use then
now. And most men either have been
or may be Arbitrators, or at teast
have done, or may submit themselves
to the Arbitration of others. And as
long as differences and contentions
arise among men, which will bee
to the worlds end, certainly the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Arbitrements will well
deserve our knowledge. Which being
well observed and learnt by all men,
will be a good meanes to prevent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Suits and contentions in the Law
for the future which are now daily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
through the defects of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrements
which rather beget and
raise new controversies amongst the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46451:76"/>
parties, then determine the ould. The
only cause whereof is the ignorance of
men in this learning. The Composer
hereof, <hi>Reader,</hi> tooke this paines, only
out of a desire of the Common good,
that none might bee ignorant of that
which concernes all. And if it shall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that for which it was made, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strvcting
of the ignorant, and the good
of the publike; the Author hath his
ends, and abundant recompence for his
labour. Which that it may accomplish
is the earnest and affectionate desire of

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46451:77"/>
graut, so I conceive, that they are not
of capability to submit to an Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but that the submission will bee
absolutely void in these cases.</p>
               <p>The reason of these cases may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that they have not power of them
selves to dispose of their interest or

transferre such power over to another;

               <p>But now on the other side, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that all persons whatsoever that
are not fettered with these naturall or

to make a grant, that such persons may
submit themselves to an Arbitremen,
as persons not attainted, <hi>compos mentis,</hi>

               <head>What things may be submitted
to an Arbitrement, and
what not?</head>
               <p>THat is to say, what things are in
Law arbitrable, and what not?
Things and Actions which are meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
personall, and incertaine,<note place="margin">22. H. 6. 39 4. H 6. 17. 14. H. 4. 2. 4. H. 16. 17. 2 H. 5. 2.</note> as Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
a Ward taken away, and the like,
are arbitrable.</p>
               <p>But things which are of themselves
certaine, are not arbitrable, except the
submission be by Deed, or that they be
joyned with others incertaine, as Debt
with Trespasse, or the like.</p>
               <p>The reason that is given in 4. H. 6. is,
because the nature of an Arbitrement
is, to reduce things to a certainety,
which are in themselves incertaine, and
not to make things more certaine,
which are certaine already.</p>
               <p>And the reason likewise that is there
given, why a thing certaine, which is
joyned with a thing incertaine should
be arbitrable, is because that the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement
is intire, and therefore cannot
be good as to that which is arbitrable,
and voyd for the residue; (which you
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46451:78"/>
must understand being of things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the submission) but being good for
the part which is incertaine, it will
make the rest also arbitrable.</p>

of Lands, Leases, or the like, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

due by Record; Annuities, nor Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdes,
none of these are of themselves
arbitrable, without the snbmission bee
by specialty.</p>
               <p>I must confesse that some of these
Bookes say, that Arbitrators may award
a Freehold without Deed. Others say
that the submission must be by specialty
[as you may observe before) and some
say that the Arbitrement in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
must be by Deed and that then the
arbitrement may be pleaded in Barre
of an action.</p>
               <p>Bnt I take this as a generall rule, that
no Chattels reals, or mixt, no Debts by
Deed, or Record no Annuities nor Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
are of themselves arbitrable though
that the submission bee by Deed; and I
shall prove it thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:46451:79"/>
If they were arbitrable of themselves,
then upon an action brought in any of
these cases, an arbitrement were a good
plea in Barre of the action but an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement
in such case is no plea in Barre
of the action as appears by the books be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore cited therfore I conceive that the
argument is plaine &amp; evident that these
are not of themselves arbitrable.</p>
               <p>But for further proofe of this ground
that I have laid downe; it is taken as a
generall rule in <hi>Blaks</hi> case in my L. <hi>Coke
6.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coke lib. 6. fo. 43. b. 44. 2.</note> Book, that an arbitrement is no plea
when an action is founded upon a deed,
when it is in the Realty, or mixt with
the realty, but in such cases only, or at
least, regularly, where Damages alone
are to be recovered.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this with the Booke
of 21. E. 3 cited before,<note place="margin">21. E. 3. 26</note> that an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement
that the one party shall have
the land our of the possession of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doth not give a Freehold; and if
hee refuse to permit him to have the
Land, he hath no remedy, if hee hath
not an Obligation to stand to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement.</p>
               <p>By this case wee may learne, as also
by that which I have told you before,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46451:79"/>
that though these thing are not of
themselves arbitrable; &amp; so the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not pleadable in Barre of an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yet a man may in such cases bind
himselfe by Obligation to stand to an
award [as it is usuall so to do] and for
the non performance of the awrd, the
Bond will be forfeited. And this is the
submission by specialty so often spoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the Bookes before.</p>
               <p>And therefore I conceive that the
opinion of <hi>Greuill</hi> and <hi>Pollard</hi> in 23.
H. 7. is no Law,<note place="margin">23. H. 7. Keilway fo 99. pl. 6.</note> who say that where
there is a submission of the right, Title,
and possession of land, [without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parsonall difference] to an award,
that an arbitrement in such case is
void; and that an Obligation to obey
such an arbitrement is void.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Booke makes a quaere
of it; because that others were, (as the
Booke saith) cleere of another opinion.
And certainely the Bond is good; as
common experience teaches; <hi>I</hi> shall
put a case like it, which I conceive will
plainely prove it.</p>
               <p>A man makes a Feoffement upon
condition that the Feostee shall not
take the profits,<note place="margin">Coke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton fo. 206. b.</note> the condition is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46451:80"/>
repugnant and void. But a Bond
in such case conditioned that the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee
shall not take the profits, is good.</p>
               <p>So I say in this case, though the
thing it selfe be not arbitrable; yet if a
man in such case, will bind himselfe to
stand to an award, the Bond is good.</p>
               <p>Lastly, causes matrimoniall are not
arbitrable; neither are Offences crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
as Treasons, Felonies, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it concerns the Commonwealth
that such offenders be punished. But
of this sufficient; the nature or kindes
of submissions is now to bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

an Arbitrator; or avoide his sentence

differs much from a submission to an
Arbitration for in such case a man
ties his interest and binds his person
which every one is not of capacity to
doe; but in this case what he doth as
an arbitrator, is onely to charge or
discharge others. And besides they

                  </gap>orne,
as other Judges established by publike
authority are.</p>
               <p>Besides, their power is farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for as they may judge as they
please keeping themselves to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
so their sentence is absolutely
definitive and conclusive from which
there lies no Appeale; as it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently

plead that the Arbitrators made no

the award is void (as it may be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cases which I shall set forth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after)
the Action in such case will not
lie as every dayes experience teaches,
and in which our Bookes are plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
By that which I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is manifest, how it concerns
every man to have a care what Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators

               <head>Whether the power of Arbitrators
be Assigenable or not?</head>
               <p>The Law is cleere that Arbitrators
cannot assigne over their power, the
reason is, because that it is but a nude
power or Authority (which is evident
in that it is revocable, as I shall shew
you hereafter) and therefore by the
Law not assignable. To which may be
added, that it is a power coupled with
a great trust and confidence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not assignable.</p>
               <p>I confesse that the Booke in 47. E. 3
doth tacitely admit this power to bee
assignable where the case is thus,<note place="margin">47. E. 3. 20</note> In

they submmitted themselves to

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> here it is tacitely admitted
that the Arbitrators might award
that they should stand to the Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of another, but Brooke in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging
this case saith, the Law see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
contrary.</p>
               <p>In 8. <hi>E. 4. prototam Curiam</hi> except
<hi>Yelverton,</hi> where a man is bound to

that an Action shall be commenced
betwixt the parties by the advise of
<hi>VV.</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> this is a good award for by
this W: &amp; P. are not Arbitrators,<note place="margin">8. E. 4. 1. &amp; 10.</note> but
onely executors of the Arbitrement.
And in this case the Arbitrators jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Title to bee tryed betwixt
them; but know not what action should
be brought.</p>
               <p>But if they had awarded, that the
parties should stand to the Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of W and P. this had beene void,
because that they cannot assigne ouer
their power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yelverton</hi> held in the first case, that
the award was void for the incertainty
because that W. and P. are to give their
advise, which is not certaine vntill it
be notified, and in this case he hath
made them Judges.</p>
               <p>I confesse that I doe somewhat doubt
of the case, because the judgment
of the arbitrators ought to be finall,
and this is no concluding of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46451:84"/>
their advise, or may refuse to doe it,
and in such case the arbitrement will
prove idle.</p>
               <p>And I do not conceive this case to
be like the case in 19. E. 4. where the
Arbitrators awarded a certaine sume,<note place="margin">19. E. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for here their judgement of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

where it is said that if a man be bound

put you presently.</p>
               <p>In 28. H 6. by <hi>Ashton Iustice</hi> if there
be two plaintiffs and one defendant
or two defendants and one plaintiffe
put themselves to the award of other

the other, may discharge the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the reason is obvious, because that
they were chosen by the joynt authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of both, and therefore cannot be
countermanded by one alone.</p>
               <p>But that which is the last and best
authority,<note place="margin">Coke lib. 8. fo. 82.</note> is <hi>Vinyors case;</hi> where it is
resolved that though a man be bound
to stand to the Arbitrement, &amp;c. yet he
may countermand the Arbitrators; the
reason that is given is, because a man
cannot by his own act make such an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

               <p>But in this case it was further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that by the countermand or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation

               <p>In this case it was objected that

of these can be maintained also

have power over the principall, they
have power over the accessory; and
therefore the right and Title of the

which is the Principall, he hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to make an award of the Charters
which are the accessory.</p>
               <p>Againe, an award may in some cases be

of things or matters contained in the

               <p>Which books,<note place="margin">Coke lib. 8. fo. 98. Baspoles case.</note> and all others to this

these differences: First, where the
submission is by Deed,<note place="margin">Trin. 4. of the Queen Dyer. fo. 216. b. &amp; 7 &amp; 8. of the Queen. Dyer fo. 242. pl. 52.</note> and where
without Deed: where it is without
Deed, there the award may be made
of part only, and good.</p>
               <p>Again, where the submission is by
Deed, there is this difference to be
observed; where the submission is
generall of all matters, &amp;c. or in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,
of some particular things only,
with an <hi>Ita quod,</hi> or <hi>Proviso,</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be made <hi>de premissis;</hi> or that
the said award be made and given up
by such a time: and where the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is general or special, without
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46451:93"/>
such a conditional conclusion. For in
the first case the award must be made
of all the matters submitted, because
of the conditionall reference, and in
the last the award may be made of
part only, and good.</p>
               <p>So it is (where the submission is
not conditionall) in case of divers
particular persons (as the case is put
before) if two of one part, and one of
another part submit themselves, the
arbitrator may make an arbitrement,
betwixt the one of the two of the one
part, and the other of the other part,
and good.</p>
               <p>But note Reader, that there is this
difference to be observed betweene
pleading of an award upon a submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
general conditional, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an award upon a submission
special conditional.</p>
               <p>For in the first case,<note place="margin">Baspoles case, <hi>ubi supra.</hi>
                  </note> if an award be
pleaded <hi>de premissis modo &amp; forma se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentibus;</hi>
and alledged to be upon
one single matter in controversie, this
is good; because it is shown that the
award was made <hi>de premissis,</hi> which
doth import an award of all that
which was referred to the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46451:93"/>
and so it shall be intended, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the contrary be shewn by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party: for when the submission
is generall, <hi>Generale nihil certi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat;</hi>
and it may well stand with the
generality of the words, that there
was but one cause depending in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
betwixt them.</p>
               <p>But in pleading of an award upon
a submission special conditional, there
the award must be expresly alleaged
to be made of all things within the
submission, or otherwise it is nought,
because upon the very face of the
award it will appear, whether it were
made of all things in the submission
or no. For if the submission be of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things in special, and an award
pleaded only of one, it is apparent
that the award is not of all matters
contained in the submission.</p>
               <p>Again, if upon the pleading of an
award upon a submission general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
it doth appear either upon
the shewing of the other party (as
hath been said) or by the award it self,
that it was not of all matters in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
in such case also, the award
will be void, though the submission
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46451:94"/>
were general, because that it was
conditional.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mote</hi> and <hi>Menerels</hi> case in my
Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> was thus,<note place="margin">Trin. 4. of the Queen Dyer, fo. 216. b.</note> they were bound
to stand to the award of <hi>A.</hi> for Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidations,
&amp;c. and all other suits,
quarrels &amp;c. <hi>Ita quod,</hi> the said award
were made, &amp;c. who made an award
of the Delapidations, with a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
that hee would not meddle
with the rest. In this case the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the book is, that the award is
nought, for that it did not extend to
all the points in the submission, for he
made no arbitrement of the suits and
quarrels, &amp;c. but made an expresse
protestation that he would not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with them; by which he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
himself to be an arbitrator in
the premises, because that he refused
to make an arbitrement according to
the submission of the parties, who
chose him for to arbitrate, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<hi>ut supra: viz.</hi> So that the same
award, &amp;c. which is as well of suits
and quarrels, &amp;c. as of dilapidations.</p>
               <p>In this case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though the latter part
of the submission were generall, yet
because it was conditional, and it did
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46451:94"/>
appear by the award it self, that it was
not made of all things submitted,
therefore the award was not held
void.</p>
               <p>But in this case I conceive, that if
the award had been of the dilapidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
generally, without the protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it had been good enough,
because that the latter part of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is general: and therefore if
the award had been pleaded <hi>de premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
and aleage the award of the dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidations,
it shall be intended that
this was all the matter in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
betwixt them, untill the contrary
be shewed.</p>

omit: where it is adjudged, that
though there are many matters in
controversie, yet if one only be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the Arbitrator, he may make
an award of this; for the Arbitrator
is in place of a Judge, and his office is
to determine <hi>secundum allegata &amp;
probata;</hi> and the duty of the parties
which are grieved, and know their
particular griefs, is, to give notice of
the causes of controversie to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator,

the Defendant maintained the Bar,
that the Arbitrator made no award,
and verdict for the Plaintiff &amp; judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
here the award was a day
short of the submission. Upon this a
Writ of Error was brought, but
what issue it had, that my Lord <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart</hi>
saith, he doth not know.</p>
               <p>I doe conceive, Reader, that the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46451:95"/>
difference formerly taken, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
this case; for if the submission
were conditional, then I think the
award is nought, being not so large
as the submission; but if it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
in such case I think it good.</p>
               <p>But to this it may be said, that the
Law will not intend any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of controversie to arise betwixt
the third of September &amp; the fourth,
without it be shewn; and for ought
appears, the award is of all causes to
the fourth of September, because no

the delivery of it in writing, and doth

a breach, and judgement given for

it is no arbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no cause of action.</p>
               <p>So in this case I conceive,<note place="margin">1 H. 7. 5. 7 &amp; 8. of the Queen Dyer, fo. 243. pl. 56 31. H. 8. Br. arbitr. 42.</note> if the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

               <p>So likewise, if it had not been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that it was delived in writing, it
had been void.</p>
               <p>And where there is a submission
to an award,<note place="margin">2 R. 3. 13. pl. 32. &amp; 8 E. 4. 11 a.</note> so that it be made and
delivered to the parties in writing,
at or before such a day: in such case,
if it have not all the circumstances,
that is, though it be made, yet if it be
not delivered; and though it bee
made and delivered, yet if it be not
delivered to the parties, and though
it be made and delivered to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
yet if it be not in writing; and
though it have all these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet if they be not all done, at or
before the day, in any of these cases
the award will be void, as appears by
the books in the margent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:46451:96"/>
And if the Arbitrators award any
thing after the time limited,<note place="margin">8 H. 6. f. 18</note> it is
void.</p>
               <p>Two of one part,<note place="margin">Coke li. 5. fo. 103. Hungates case.</note> and two of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
submit themselves to an award,
so that the award be made and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to both parties, &amp;c. A delivery
in this case to one of either party is
not sufficient, but it must be to both
the entire parties.</p>
               <p>The reason of all these cases may be
because (as I have formerly said) that
it is but a bare power or authority
which is giveu to an Arbitrator, and
therefore it must be strictly executed
according to the qualifications and
conditions annexed to it.</p>
               <p>But the reason that comes more
close is, because that the submission
is condit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>I</hi>

                  <hi>Cornelius Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
and <hi>Carres</hi> case, which was thus:
They submitted themselves to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of <hi>I. S.</hi> concerning an Action
of account pending; the Arbitrator
made an award touching the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and further award, that every

adjudged that the award was good, as
to the account, which was submitted,
and void for the surplusage. See fol.
9. b.</p>
               <p>But note, <hi>Reader,</hi> that though an
arbitrement may be void in part, and
good in part as in the cases aforesaid,
yet it cannot be totally void,<note place="margin">An award voide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one of the parties, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her; for as
the award must be on both sides (as

the award must be equally and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46451:98"/>
reciprocally obligatory to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and if it be void against one, it
will be void against both.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that <hi>Moore</hi> and
<hi>Bedels</hi> case cited before,<note place="margin">In <hi>Osburns</hi> case. Coke l. 10. f. 131</note> will warrant
this: The case was thus, <hi>Bedel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by default in an action of
Waste, against <hi>Moore</hi> 45. l. damages,
and had judgement, after they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselvs to an arbitrement,
and an award is made that <hi>Moore</hi>
should pay to <hi>Bedel</hi> 10 l. at certain
dayes, &amp; 15 l. at certain other dayes;
and that for payment of the 15 l. one
<hi>William Salter</hi> should bee ready to
seal and deliver 15 Obligations, and
the award was of other things also
out of the submission: and in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
thereof, that <hi>Bedel</hi> should
discharge <hi>Moore</hi> of 20 l. parcel of the
said 45 l. recovered in the said Writ
of Waste, and that upon the readines
of <hi>William Salter</hi> to seale and deliver
the said 15 Obligations, <hi>Bedel</hi> should
release to <hi>Moore</hi> all actions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>In this case <hi>Moore</hi> brought an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against <hi>Bedel,</hi> &amp; shewed how that
he payed the 10 l. &amp;c. and assigned
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46451:98"/>
a breach of the award, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
had not made the release up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
request.</p>
               <p>It was resolved, that though that
many things are awarded to be done
in satisfaction of another, (as in this
case) and some are within the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(as here the payment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
and some out (as in this case, all
to be done by <hi>Salter</hi> being a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
and so void; and though that all
were intended by the Arbitrators to
be one full and entire recompence,
for the things that the other should
doe in consideration of this (as here
the discharge of the 20 l. and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
by the Defendant) notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if any to be done or to be given
to the party, though that it be of
small value be within the submission,
the award is good; so in this case
judgement was given for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe.</p>
               <p>In this case it is apparent, that if
what was awarded on the Plaintiffes
part, had been all out of the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and by consequence void, that
then the Defendant in such case had
not been tyed to perform what was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46451:99"/>
awarded on his part, for an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement
void against one, is void a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

where there was a submission by
bond, and an award to pay 20 s. to
a stranger; and it is there said, that
the judgement of the Court was,
that though the award were void, yet
it ought to be performed by reason
of the bond; for otherwise the bond
is forfeited: and therefore saith the
book, the Plaintiffe traversed the

where there was no first day named

is void in the whole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the day to which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
is referred to be made it uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and so it doth not appear when
it shall be made: and for that it doth
appear, that the intent of the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
was, that it should be made at a
day certain, and this is not certainly
expressed, it is void. And though
that the arbitrement consists upon
divers parts, and some are certain,
yet if any part be uncertain, all is
void, if it be materiall and concern
a party to the submission, as here it
doth. And it is not like the case of
19 E. 4. 1. for there the award which
was void for part, that part concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a stranger not party to the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement,
but here it concerns both
parties to the arbitrement. And
though that there be another clause,
that the Plaintiffe shall make further
assurance; yet his intent was, that
the other should be also done: and
because that that is void for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
all is void: for an award is
like a judgement, which if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect

               <p>By <hi>Keble</hi> this plea is not good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath bound himself to stand
to the award, and to perform it, which
he must do, otherwise his obligation
is forfeited. Besides this is a thing
feasable, for though Sir <hi>Hen, Collet</hi>
had not any bales in his house, if he
would have performed the condition,
he ought to have bought certain bails,

it is the folly of the parties to

because that the arbitrators are made

is of a collaterall thing not executed;
yet if the submission be by speciallty, the
award is good.</p>
               <p>Upon these grounds you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
these four rules to direct you
where an arbitement shall be a good
plea in barre of an action in these
cases.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> where the day of payment
is past<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is no plea in barre of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without pleading of payment.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>and lastly,</hi> where the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is of a thing for which the party
hath no remedy, though the day be not
yet come, in which the thing ought to
be done or delivered, in this case the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is no plea in bar of the action. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to these differences it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath

                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:46451:116"/>
The defendant in trespasse pleaded
an award that he should instantly pay
20 s. to the plaintiffe,<note place="margin">Mich. 9. Iac in the Kings Bench</note> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
judgement of the action: by
<hi>Flemming</hi> Chiefe Iustice, <hi>Williams</hi>
and <hi>Crooke</hi> Iustices it was holden,
that the plea was nought, because
that he did not shew the money was
paid, and these differences agreed.</p>
               <p>An arbitrement pleaded in bar of
an action, where the defendant hath
not performed the thing, and the
day past, is no good plea. But where
the day of the performance of the
thing awarded is to come, and the
doing of the thing awarded may be
compelled by action, there the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement
is a good plea in barre of
the action.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Flemming</hi> if the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other collaterall matter, which the
defendant cannot be enforced by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to do, in such case the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement
is no good plea in barre of
the action, though the day of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
be not yet come.</p>
               <p>And you must know Reader, that
where the arbitrement is to make a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46451:116"/>
Release, or such other collaterall
thing, and the day to come, though
the sumission were by specialty, yet
the award would be no plea in barre
of an action; because that cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the doing of it, though it may
be forfeited for the thing not done.</p>
               <p>And so saith <hi>Nedham</hi> in 9 E. 4.
though the arbitrement be void to
this intent that the plaintiffe hath no
action to compell the defendant
to make the release;<note place="margin">9 E. 4. 44. a</note> yet it is good to
this intent, if the party do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it, that he shall forfeit the

of this, the next thing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,

               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:46451:117"/>
Tis true,<note place="margin">19 H. 6. 36</note> an award may in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
(as I have shewed before) be good
of part of the things only submited,
but we must vnderstand this so that
the award must be finall as to that
parte, or else it will be void.</p>
               <p>An award that either party shall be
Non-suit against the other in actions
commenced by them is void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it makes no end of the matters
in controversy.</p>
               <p>And every arbitrement, saith the
Booke, ought to make an end and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
determination of the things in
dispute and controversy; which it
doth not in this case, because that
notwithstanding the Nonsuits, they
may commence their Suites, <hi>de nove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And vpon this ground, as also the
former authority,<note place="margin">5 H. 7. fo. 13.</note> I conceive that the
Booke in 5. H. 7. is no Law; where
there is an opinion that an award of
a Nonsuit may be good, but it is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this reason, because it is not only
the act of the Court, but the act of the
party also. But if it were wholy the
act of the party, yet for the reason be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because it is no final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
I conceive it cannot be good
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46451:117"/>
for this is but like blowing out of a
candell, which a man may at his own
pleasure light againe.</p>
               <p>So, in all those cases that I have
put you before, where the award is
of one side only, it is void also for
this reason; because it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the controversies between
them, and the controversies cannot
be ended, without they be ended in
respect of both parties.</p>
               <p>So likewise in the cases that I have
put you before,<note place="margin">Coke li. 5. fo. 78. a. Samons case.</note> where the award is
uncertain, it is also voide for this
cause, for that it is not finall. For an
uncertaine award cannot decide the
matter in controversie, but is more
apt to beget new strifes and varian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
then to conclude the old.</p>
               <p>In 8 E. 4. an award is made,<note place="margin">8 E. 4. 11. a</note> that
an action shall be conceived betwixt
the parties by the advice of S. and F.
I do conceive in this case the award
is void, because it is not finall: for
this concludes not the controversie,
but leaves it to the judgement of
law: See fo. 16. b.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warley</hi> and <hi>Beckwiths</hi> case, in debt
upon a bond to stand to an arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46451:118"/>
the arbitrators award that
the defendant shall pay severall sums
to the plaintiffe,<note place="margin">Hob. Rep. p. 306. pl. 281.</note> which were aleaged
by the plaintiffe to be done unto
him. And further, that if the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then so much should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
out of the payment of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
summes aforesaid, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Tis true, I finde no judgement in
this case, yet I conceive the Law will
be somewhat strong in it, that the
arbitrement is void because it leaves
the matter in suspence and undeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whereas it ought to be finall
and conclusive. And besides, this is
upon the matter a reserving of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to make a second arbitrement,
which I conceive they cannot do.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this point with that

saith he, is used for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale, for to decide debates
and wrongs amongst the people, as
fines are; here hee likewise joynes
them both together.</p>
               <p>And the very words of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in every bond to stand to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
will sufficiently instruct the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators
what they are to do in this
behalfe (which certainly prudent
Antiquity put in to that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
where the parties doe submit
themselves to the arbitrement; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and finall determination of the
arbitrators: and therefore the award
is not according to the submission, if
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46451:119"/>
it be not finall: the next thing to be
considered, is,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question_and_answer">
               <head>Where an award against law shall
be void.</head>
               <p>It may be aptly demanded, what I
intend by an award against law: for
every award that is not according to
law; as where it is uncertaine, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
or the like (as I have shown
before) may bee truly said to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
law: and therefore this will
be but <hi>actum agere,</hi> to shew, that an
award against law shall be void.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Billing</hi> in 8 E. 4. an award which
is impossible is against the law:<note place="margin">8 E. 4. 12. b</note> for
(saies he) the law is upon possibility
and reason, therefore that which is
impossible is against law.</p>
               <p>So by <hi>Nele</hi> and <hi>Choke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">19 E. 4. 1. a</note> an award
which is made in parcels, or which
enjoynes a thing not in the power of
the party, is against law.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Keble</hi> also in 9 H. 7. an award
that a man shall pay more then of
right he ought to pay,<note place="margin">9. H. 716. a. b.</note> is against law.</p>
               <p>Tis true, that all these, or the like,
in a general acceptation of the words
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46451:119"/>
may be said to be against law, because
they do not agree with the law.</p>
               <p>But in a more particular and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
acceptation of the words,<note place="margin">Coke, Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton, fo. 206. b. 42 E. 3. 6. 2 H. 4. 9. 19 H. 6. 55</note>
that is properly said to hee against
law; which is either <hi>malum in se,</hi> or
<hi>malum prohibitum;</hi> that is, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Commandements of God,
or the Decrees Maxims and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Law, as appeares by the
books in the margine. And in this
sense properly I conceive the Law is
to be understood, where it speaks of
an award against law.</p>
               <p>And therefore if an award be, that
the defendant shall kill or rob I. S.
or that he shall maintain the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
in such a suit: or that he shall be
bound to the plaintiffe, being a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe,
to save him harmelesse if hee
shall imbesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l a Writ, or suffer an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape;
or that he shall forge such a
deed or writing for the plaintiffe, or
the like: in such cases, I conceive, the
award will bee void, because it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes
things against the law. But
of this sufficient. The next and last
thing to be considered is,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="question_and_answer">
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:46451:120"/>
               <head>Where an award made at several times,
or by parcels shall be void?</head>
               <p>An award,<note place="margin">19 E. 4 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by Choke.</note> that the defendant shall
pay a certaine sum of money to the
plaintiffe, and that the surety for
payment thereof should be by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the arbitrators: this by <hi>Choke</hi>
is a void award, because that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators
cannot make their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> award
twice; for every arbitrement ought
to be made entirely, and not by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.
And here is first an award for
the payment of the money: and then
here is another part of the award for
the sufficiency of the security, and
these at severall times, which cannot
be.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Danby</hi> Justice,<note place="margin">39. H 6. 9.</note> if the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
arbitrate part one day, and part
another day, and give their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there the second is void; but
they may commune upon one point
one day, and another, another day: so
that they do not give their judgment
<hi>nisi unica vice</hi> for all.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Yaxley,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">17 H. 7. Keilway. f. 43. pl. 10.</note> an arbitrement
told in part, is void in the whole;
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46451:120"/>
for an arbitrement cannot be made,
by parcels.</p>
               <p>I conceive Reader, that this point
will stand upon this difference, where
there are several awards made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
where but one award made at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
times or by parcels. I conceive
they cannot make severall a vards:
First, because that were not agreeable
to the submission; in which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
binde themselves to stand to the
award and arbitrement of the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators;
and by these words in the
submission, they have no power to
make severall awards or arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and when they have made
one arbitrement, they have executed
their power and authority, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a second arbitrement will bee
void. And again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that they might make two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
they might make twenty,
which were very inconvenient.</p>
               <p>But now on the other side, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that an award may be made at
severall times or by parcells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that
it be not delivered vnder their hands
according to the submission untill
the whole be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:46451:121"/>
And certainly that which is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaly
required in every arbitrement
is, that it be agreeable in substance
and circumstance to the submission;
which it may well be, though it be
made at severall times or by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
so that it be made and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
according to the submission, at
the time appointed.</p>
               <p>And I conceive all that is done by
the arbitrators, is but as a comuning
or discourse concerning the matters
in controversy submited unto them;
for that they may vary in their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as they shall see occasion,
for they have liberty to arbitrate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their discretions, so they
have an eye to the submission. I say,
I conceive all as nothing untill they
have finished, and delivered the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement,
which is the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and perfection of it.</p>
               <p>Besides, where the submission is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of many things, and those of great
difficulty, if the Law should be that
the arbitrators might not make their
arbitrement by parcells, it might
be very mischeivous to the parties,
especially considering that submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46451:121"/>
are most commonly to illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
men.</p>
               <p>Neither is my opinion groundless or
without authority;<note place="margin">39 H. 6. 9.</note> for by <hi>Moile</hi> in
39. H. 6. an arbitrement may well be
made in parcells, so that all be made
before any day assigned.</p>
               <p>I have now finished this poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of mine of shewing you
what arbitrements are good in Law
and what not. I shall only adde this
one Rule concerning the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or exposition of arbitrements,
which will be very vsefull in that
particular, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>That an award or an arbitrement
