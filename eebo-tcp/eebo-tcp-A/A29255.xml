            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<hi>Circular Letter</hi>
To the Clergy of <hi>Mary-Land,</hi> Subſequent to the late
Viſitation.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I cannot reflect upon the good Order of your Conferences, and the Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in your Reſolves at your late <hi>Viſitation,</hi> without the greateſt eſteem
of, and Affection towards you. And ſo happy a beginning gives me good
Grounds to hope the beſt things from you. The truth of it is, when I ſit
down and conſider the ſeveral particular Methods of <hi>Miniſterial Inſtruction,</hi> which
you did then ſo chearfully come into, I am not able, upon the moſt mature
Deliberation, to conceive, what can be farther wanting on your Parts, to render
the People committed to your Charge, fully edify'd in all things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but the putting the meaſures then Reſolved upon, vigorouſly into Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both as to <hi>Catechizing, Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Private Exhortation</hi> and <hi>Admonition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the firſt of your Reſolutions refer to <hi>Catechizing;</hi> a part of your Miniſtry
ſo exceedingly neceſſary in the Church of Chriſt, eſpecially in an Age ſo looſe
in its Principles, as ours is, that enough can never be ſaid to inculcate that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon you. But I forbear here, having ſo largely ſpoken to it in my <hi>Viſitation
Charge.</hi> However there is one conſideration of ſuch peculiar force to your ſelves
in <hi>Maryland,</hi> that I muſt needs remind you thereof, to invigorate you in that
Work, tho' I know the words themſelves were ſo emphatical, and the occaſion
of them, muſt be ſo freſh in your Minds, that it will not be eaſy for you to
forget them.</p>
            <p>And was it ſo, that but few Months ago, the whole Province were in that
Conſternation, on the account of their Religion, as did far exceed our Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And did the <hi>Patriots</hi> of your Country under ſuch Difficulties, and Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as I forbear to name, renew its Eſtabliſhment, and that too with ſuch an
<hi>Unanimity,</hi> and <hi>general Conſent,</hi> as ſhews that it is no indifferent thing to them?
And wherefore was it, that notwithſtanding all, they would re-eſtabliſh our Church,
and provide for its Clergy amongſt them; Why? For this end they declare they did
this glorious Work! THAT THEIR CHILDREN AND POSTERITY BEING
PRESERVED IN THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH, FROM FACTION
AND SCHISM, IN HONESTY AND CHARITY, MIGHT BECOME GOOD
AND SOBER MEN, LOVING VERTUE, HATING VICE, THE RATIONAL
CONSEQVENCE OF TRUE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE. Words ſurely that
deſerve to be written (both for the perpetual Honour of the Province, and for a
Memorandum to you of the Clergy, to what purpoſe you are continued) IN
LETTERS OF GOLD on PILLARS OF MARBLE. It evidently appears hence,
That the Chriſtian Education of their Youth, is what thoſe <hi>Patriots</hi> do chiefly
expect from you. And ſurely then, if for this Reaſon principally, a Clergy have
been there re-eſtabliſhed, ſo far as lies in their Power: To this work therefore it
is, That in a more eſpecial manner, you are call'd to exert your Labours, as a
moſt important part of your Miniſtry among them. And you are to conclude
hence, That you, of all the Clergy in the King's Dominions, have a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Call to apply your ſelves particularly thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43314:2"/>
And indeed the Catechetical part is Digeſted by you, ſo much to my Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that if you ſhall marſhall all the Youth within your reſpective Cures into
thoſe <hi>Three Claſſes,</hi> and ſhall Catechize them accordingly, I ſhould then hope
very ſoon to ſee thoſe in <hi>America,</hi> as far exceed many amongſt us here, as the
Children of the poor <hi>Vaudois,</hi> which <hi>Thuanus</hi> ſpeaks of, Lib. 27. do thoſe in the
wealthier parts of the Chriſtian World. And the Religious Education of Youth,
being a part of your Duty of ſuch infinite Conſequence, as well to the planting of
Chriſtanity with you, as the Reſtauration of it here, now almoſt expiring amongſt
us, I conjure you, by all that Love which the Son of God bore to the Sons of
Men, when he deſcended from Heaven, to teach and enlighten the ignorant and
benighted World; and which Love he particularly expreſſed to ſuch tender ones:
I conjure you by all this, to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe Lambs.</hi> And that there may be no impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
incapacity, or any want of means urg'd in excuſe for any one's omiſſion
in that part, I have provided you with ſuch a quantity of Books, Adapted to
thoſe ſeveral Degrees of <hi>Catechumens,</hi> as will ſupply all the poorer Children, at
leaſtwiſe, in your reſpective Cures; and will alſo take care of even thoſe of
better Condition, ſhould their Parents be ſo Barbarous towards them, as to deny
to provide them with neceſſary Books, rather than they ſhall want <hi>Catechetical
Inſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt Claſs,</hi> you have. <hi>The Church Catechiſm, together with ſome of the
moſt Appoſite Texts pertaining to the ſeveral Doctrines, and Duties contained
therein, with a Form of Morning and Evening Prayer for Children. Alſo,
a Grace before and after Meat.</hi> And of theſe I would have you give one to all
the poorer Families, and to Servants Quarters within your reſpective Cures,
where there are Children, and to recommend it to the welthier Parents to buy for
theirs. And after this, let it be your Care to have the Children frequently call'd
upon to repeat their Catechiſm, and to recite their Scriptures, and Prayers. Let this, I
ſay, be done, either by your ſelves, when you ſhall viſit thoſe Families, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whom you ſhall intruſt to call them thus to account in your ſtead. And as
you cannot think of ſuch proper Perſons for this purpoſe, as the Members of the
<hi>Religious Society,</hi> or ſuperior <hi>Claſs of Catechumens</hi> within your Pariſhes, whom
you will find very ſervicable to you in this, and many other good Offices within
your Cures: So indeed this part muſt be done chiefly by ſome truſty Deputy,
it being equally impoſſible, either that ſuch ſmall Children ſhould be brought
many Miles to Church to be Catechiz'd, or that you ſhould be continually viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them at their Houſes for that purpoſe, for which more than your whole
time would be inſufficient in ſuch dilated Cures. And it may ſuffice that you do this
in Perſon only, when either a <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or the <hi>Viſitation</hi> of the Sick, or a <hi>Funeral,</hi>
or any other occaſion ſhall draw you out into any quarter of your Pariſh. Where
a Competition between the ſeveral Duties of your <hi>Paſtoral Office</hi> is ſuch, that your
time will be devoured by any one of them, to the omiſſion of others equally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
if you ſhould give your ſelves up wholly to that; there is a neceſſity, ſo far to
diſpenſe with the <hi>Perſonal</hi> Execution thereof, as to reſerve a ſhare for other parts
of your Function, And this I know is too much your Caſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Claſs</hi> of Catechumens you have judiciouſly appointed to conſiſt of
Children, between Nine and Thirteen: not that you are to tye up your ſelves ſo
nicely between ſuch Periods, that a Child either under the one, or beyond the
other is always to be excluded that inſtitution which you judge moſt proper for
ſuch as are within that Compaſs: But becauſe it is to be expected, that
as well <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Children, as thoſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould by that time be able
to give ſome Account, or <hi>Reaſon of the Faith that is in them.</hi> And it is of the
greateſt uſe to fix deſigns to certain Periods, which will cauſe ſuch expectations,
that, generally ſpeaking, things will anſwer within thoſe termes. And as you have
<hi>Reſolved,</hi> with reſpect to this rank of <hi>Catech<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to have them learn by Heart
Some Expoſition with <hi>Scripture Proofs;</hi> ſo I have accordingly ſent you a ſufficient
number of that Kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Book is divided into four parts, and ſubdivided into Fifty Two Leſſons;
one for every Sunday in the Year; in which are explained the peculiar Terms in
Divinity; and in which are given the Elements of Chriſtian Knowledge; both in
the general Doctrine, and particular Articles of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> And it
<pb facs="tcp:43314:2"/>
is in this manner, I think, that your Catechiſm ought to be Expounded to Young
Children. For firſt, as to the terms in Divinity; <hi>Theology,</hi> as well as all other
Sciences, has ſome peculiar Expreſſions, which till underſtood, render any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
on Subjects of that Nature utterly unintelligible to either Hearers or
Readers: And therefore the peculiar acceptations of ſuch words, ſo often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
in our Diſcourſes of Religion, muſt be firſt explain'd to the Youth, as
we would have them be ever Edify'd from the Desk, or from the Pulpit. And
ſuch Expoſitions ought alſo to be ſo contrived, as to give the <hi>Catech<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> a view of
the Nature, Terms and Conditions of his Covenant with God. For Chriſtianity
is no other than ſuch a Covenant. And the whole Texture of our <hi>Church Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi>
is, according to the Analytical and beſt Method, both a general, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Inſtruction in that matter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Claſs</hi> of Catechumens, you would have to conſiſt of Youth grown up
to ſome Years. And theſe you are for treating with in a manner ſomething more
Manly than the very Children of Thirteen. You would not oblige them to get an
Expoſition by Heart, but would recommend to them ſome proper Book to <hi>Read,</hi>
but yet to Read ſo attentively, and with ſuch Application of Mind, as to
be ſo much Maſters of its Senſe, as in Conference and Diſcourſe with you upon
thoſe Subjects, to be able to give you Reaſon to conclude they underſtood what
they have Read. And indeed hereby you will both lead them to exerciſe their
own Judgments, a thing or ſingular uſe to them, and will alſo treat them in ſuch
a manner (tho' it be in effect ſtill but Catechizing) as none will think themſelves
above.</p>
            <p>And it is moreover very judiciouſly <hi>Reſolved</hi> by you, to adviſe them more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to Read ſuch a Book, or Books, as ſhall more fully inſtruct them in the
Nature, Terms and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace. To underſtand and
comprehend which throughly, is to know the whole Tenor of Chriſtianity, and
which, except it be conceived under ſuch a Scheme, cannot, in my Opinion, be ſo
rightly and clearly apprehended. Beſides, theſe your <hi>Catechetical Conferences</hi> with
them are primarily deſign'd to prepare them with proper Knowledge, that if
<hi>Adult,</hi> and not yet Baptized (of which there are ſo many in the Plantations) they
may be liſted to God in Baptiſm; or if they have been already Baptized, that
they may ratify their <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant</hi> with God in the Lord's Supper. And
therefore ſome more enlarged Diſcourſe upon the Nature, Terms and Conditions of
their Covenant with God; ſuch as ſhall farther explain, what through ſhortneſs
might be left obſcure in the former, muſt, I humbly conceive, be the moſt proper
Book, which at firſt you can recommend to them: And then other Diſcourſes on
Faith, or a good Life, ſuch as you will find in the <hi>Layman's Library,</hi> when that
former is fully imbib'd, may be with greater advantage propos'd afterwards. Well,
I think it my Duty to furniſh here alſo, ſuch of your Diſciples, at leaſt, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
provide themſelves; and therefore give you Commiſſion to take of Mr.
<hi>Jones</hi> at <hi>Annopolis,</hi> as many of the <hi>Short Diſcourſes upon the Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi>
as you ſhall want for the poorer Youth, both Children and Servants.</p>
            <p>And becauſe that <hi>Youth</hi> when once they advance towards the State of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
will ſoon out grow your Tuition, begin with them firſt: And, I beſeech you,
with all expedition, to form out of ſuch amongſt them, as are grown up to years
of Diſcretion, a <hi>Claſs</hi> or <hi>Society of Catechumens,</hi> whom I would have you to
Inſtruct and Direct according to the Methods, which you will find I have laid
down at large in the Preface to my <hi>Diſcourſe on the Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> to
which I refer you. I call theſe your Young Diſciples, indifferently a <hi>Religious
Society,</hi> or a <hi>Claſs of Catechumens.</hi> But ſince too many have ſuch ridiculous
Prejudices (and it is indeed an amazing thing to conſider, how far ſome pitiful
Prejudices do, in many Caſes, pervert the Minds of many wiſe and good Men
from approving, or purſuing the beſt Deſigns) I ſay, ſince many are prejudiced
againſt the word <hi>Societies,</hi> call them, if you pleaſe, <hi>Catechumens,</hi> being the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Term of the Church of Chriſt, for theſe your Diſciples, and I defy any
then to except againſt them; for I am ſure no good Man can gain-ſay, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Thing.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43314:3"/>
               <hi>FIRST,</hi> It is moſt indiſpenſibly your Duty to call Young People together,
and to give them proper and ſuitable Inſtructions, their Youthful Years being
the very Critical time of engaging them firmly to God; for if left to themſelves
at that Age, it is very great odds, but their natural Propenſity to Evil, which is
then in the Highth, and the Allurements of bad Company, which are then moſt
buſy, will Enter them, and bind them cloſe in the Service of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi>
and the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> And let any of you, as you are the Miniſters of Chriſt, and will
anſwer it at the dreadful Tribunal, take heed how you let them alone then to
themſelves to be the Slaves of Satan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SECONDLY,</hi> It is highly expedient, that you ſhould, for their better
Conduct, put them under ſome <hi>prudential Rules.</hi> And I do recommend to you,
for that purpoſe, thoſe which you will find in the <hi>Short View of the Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
in and about London,</hi> herewith ſent you, wherein you will ſee, that thoſe
here in <hi>England</hi> have form'd to themſelves ſuch Rules as deſerve our higheſt
Approbation: And, with ſome little Alterations, agreeable to the Circumſtances
of your parts, you may regulate the matter with reference to the <hi>Catechetical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties</hi>
(for ſuch the <hi>Religious Societies</hi> ought all to be) with you in the <hi>Plantations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIRDLY,</hi> I do aſſert, That every Parochial Miniſter ought to be preſent with
them at their Meetings, to Inſtruct, and to direct them what they are to Read;
to examine them, in order to know their Improvements, to take care they do not
warp towards Error or Schiſm, and to prevent Seducers from coming amongſt
them.</p>
            <p>The danger of the two latter, I know is all that thoſe who are the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd,
have to ſuggeſt againſt them. But whoſe fault is it, if their Clergy come
not near them, tho it ſhould be ſo, that they either warp of themſelves, or are
ſeduc'd by others? (as the contrary is moſt evident) Nay, why then, with greater
Reaſon, ſhould not every <hi>Parochial Miniſter</hi> be always preſent with, and preſide
at their Religious Conferences. This, My Reverend Brethren, I do conjure you
to do; and as I lay my Heart upon no one thing ſo much, as your forming theſe
<hi>Catechetical Societies</hi> within your reſpective Cures, as the only means to train up
a better Generation, than the wretched one, now in being; ſo having found the
extent of your Pariſhes to be vaſtly too large to have all ſuch Youth meet you
at one place, whether at the Church, or elſewhere, I deſire you to quarter out
your larger Pariſhes into as many Diſtricts as you ſhall find neceſſary for their
convenient Meeting together, and to appoint ſo many ſeveral Days and Places for em
to meet you (every Sunday in the Afternoon at Church, being always one
of your Days and Places;) and this, if you ſhall do, tho' I have ſeem'd in the
following Catalogue to provide only Books for one, or two of thoſe Claſſes in
each of your Pariſhes, yet you ſhall not want the like number of Books for as
many <hi>Catechetical Societies</hi> as you ſhall be able to raiſe. And the Good God, to
the terror of Satan, and all his Adherents, ſucceed you in theſe your Labours, and
Endeavours.</p>
            <p>To Second you in which, I have ſent you a <hi>Paſtoral Letter, perſwading
Youth both to an early Entertainment of Religion; and, in order to that, to put
themſelves under the Conduct of their reſpective Miniſters.</hi> And as I would
have you to give theſe Letters into the Hands of the moſt ſerious Youth in your
Pariſhes, and ſuch as are likelieſt to be influenc'd by them, in order to form them
into ſuch a <hi>Claſs</hi> or <hi>Society of Catechumens;</hi> ſo I beſeech you to apply to them
to this purpoſe by theſe Letters, with all poſſible Expedition, leaſt that one of
theſe poor Souls, for want of our ſecuring him to God betimes, be pre-engaged
to the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe I am abſolutely of your Opinion, that could you procure ſome skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Perſon in the Country, to teach your <hi>Catechumens</hi> to ſing the Pſalms Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially,
as ſet to the moſt approved Tunes (and Mr. <hi>N.—S.</hi> and Mr. <hi>T.—P.</hi>
being both skilful in Church-Muſick, will ſoon train you up one, or two
Maſters for the purpoſe) the Entertainments of <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> eſpecially according
<pb facs="tcp:43314:3"/>
to the <hi>New Verſion,</hi> would wonderfully invite the Young People both to enter
into a <hi>Catechetical Society,</hi> and would charm them into a conſtant attendance
on it. I would therefore have you make it part of your Buſineſs at thoſe
Meetings of the Youth, to have them firſt taught to Sing by Note, and then
afterwards, I would have you both open, and cloſe up your <hi>Catechetical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi> with a Pſalm. This is, with St. <hi>Paul, to Catch them by Guile;</hi>
and I am ſure will be an <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>unſinful pious Fraud.</hi> And as for the
Pſalms themſelves, you have a ſufficient <hi>Delectus</hi> for your purpoſe to begin with,
at the end of the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant.</hi> And I will take care to ſend you a more
compleat Collection afterwards.</p>
            <p>And when, upon the whole, you ſhall hereby have train'd up a conſiderable
number of the Youth of your Pariſhes, to a very good pitch of Knowledge,
and ſhall have ſeaſoned them by your Religious Diſcourſes with them, and
Pious Directions given them; ſo that they become both Knowing and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voat
Chriſtians; immediately upon that, I beſeech you, according to your
laſt <hi>Reſolution</hi> upon this Head, to appoint your <hi>Monthly Sacraments,</hi> and to
make it your ſpecial Care to have all the <hi>Catechumens of the Superiour Claſs,</hi>
conſtant Communicants. Hereby your Youth will be happily pre-engaged in
the Service of God. And from them, you will be always ſure to have Gueſts at
the Lords Table. And if you can inſtruct and prepare ſome of the poorer <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> ſo far, as that they may joyn in Communion with you at the Supper
of the Lord (as our Brother Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> has ſo worthily done) methinks the
Diverſity of Complections will add a Beauty to the Spiritual Entertainment:
And it may rejoyce our very Hearts to behold Minds ſo enlighten'd, in Bodies
ſo Dark.</p>
            <p>The remaining part of your Viſitation Acts relate to <hi>Preaching,</hi> to <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Application,</hi> and to ſuch Methods of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> as are moſt neceſſary to be
maintained among your ſelves.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall, at my firſt Leiſure, reflect likewiſe upon thoſe Parts ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,
in the ſame manner as here. I ſay, in the ſame manner as here; for
I ſhall not offer to <hi>lay heavy Burthens upon you, and not touch them with
one of My Fingers,</hi> but as with Relation to the Catechizing of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Youth, Care ſhall be taken to furniſh you with <hi>Catechiſms</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi>
for them; ſo with reference to the two remaining Parts, I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly
endeavour to provide you with ſuch neceſſary helps, as I can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
contrive, that ſo there may be no want of means to any of you to
Execute the moſt difficult of all your <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> and nothing to urge in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
as to the impracticableneſs of any one of thoſe Particulars, you have ſo well,
ſo much becomming your Function <hi>Reſolved</hi> upon; For this you may aſſure your
ſelves, that I am, as,</p>
