            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Should be very much oblig'd to receive a Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42666:5"/>
from you, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I could never give my ſelf concerning the Validity of your Presbyterian <hi>Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> I conceive it to be the moſt material thing in difference between us; and that it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the firſt place, there being no Impoſture like that of aſſuming to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42666:5"/>
               <hi>Preachers</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel without lawful <hi>Authority.</hi> I ſhall here trouble you with the Reaſons of my diſſatisfaction in this matter.</p>
            <p>Firſt then I muſt crave your pardon to look backward as far as your firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <hi>Ancestors,</hi> (from whom <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> does more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42666:6"/>
derive it ſelf) Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in <hi>Geneva,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> in <hi>Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> And then permit me to ask a certain Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to none of you would do us the kindneſs to reſolve, Who ſent Them to reform the Church, or (as you phraſe it) to Preach the

            </p>
            <p>This then I ſhall lay down as a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to what I have to ſay, That lawful <hi>Miſſion</hi> is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a Preacher of the Goſpel. And if ſo, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That all your Predeceſſors of the <hi>Kirk</hi> (how able ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42666:7"/>
as to other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications) wanted this <hi>eſſential;</hi> and conſequently your ſelf who derive a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from them.</p>
            <p>Grant me (Sir) a little of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, There are onely theſe Five imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble AUTHORITIES from whence they could pretend to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42666:8"/>
have received it. 1. The Spirit of God. 2ly, Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their own internal Spirit. 3ly, Or the People. 4ly, Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. 5ly, Or the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Other <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Miſſion</hi> (as namely, That of the <hi>Greek Church)</hi> you will not pretend to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:42666:8"/>
Firſt, From the Spirit of God. This you know to be the matter in queſtion, and the eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and the Allegation of all <hi>Fanaticks;</hi> it will be therefore a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demand, By what Evidences did it appeare to the World? And how ſhall the Contemners
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42666:9"/>
of your Goſpel be left unexcuſable, but by evidence of their Authority who are ſent to reveal it? In the Affairs of this World, <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> you know, muſt not want their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials; how much leſs the <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> of <hi>Religion?</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors muſt needs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42666:9"/>
have been an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie extraordinary, being to Reform the World, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run (in their ſenſe) with Idolatry and Superſtition.</p>
            <p>To this you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful gifts and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſufficient Evidences of their being Inſpir'd by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42666:10"/>
Spirit of God; and that the Converſion of many Thouſands from Superſtition to Godlineſs was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Seal</hi> to their Miniſtry. This is the Anſwer of all Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Parties of what Name ſoever, <hi>Anabaptiſts, Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, &amp;c.</hi> That they eaſily converted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42666:10"/>
body denies; but whether from Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition to Godlineſs, or onely to pride, cenſoriouſneſs, and contempt of all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is the great <hi>Controverſie.</hi> Nay, was it never made a Note, of a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, (as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Friendly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> obſerves) That though he have a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42666:11"/>
great many Faults, yet he is wrought to an Antipathy to Biſhops, Common Prayer and Surplice? And as to your ſelf, I might appeal to your Conſcience, whether you eſteem any man a right <hi>Convert,</hi> that is a FRIEND to theſe Things. As to thoſe powerful Gifts you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42666:11"/>
ſpeak of, you do not mean any thing that is miraculous, or that other Sects will not as ſoon pretend to: And truly as for the Sanctity of your whole Party, obſervable is the Confeſſion of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, in his <hi>Comment</hi> on the Thirty fourth Verſe of the Eleventh
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42666:12"/>
Chapter of <hi>Daniel;</hi> and I promiſe you not to injure him in the Quotation, <hi>Sed in illorum exiguo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero qui ſeſe ab Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolatriis Papatus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxerunt, major pars plena eſt perfidia &amp; dolis: praeclarum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem zelum ſimulant; ſed ſi intus excutias, reperies plenos eſſe fraudibus.</hi> Of that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42666:12"/>
ſmall number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> who profeſs the pure <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> the greater part is full of perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deceit; they pretend an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Zeal, but if you inſpect them narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you ſhall finde them abounding w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Frauds.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> or their own
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42666:13"/>
internal <hi>Spirit.</hi> It is abſurd; for ſo all men may become Preachers of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> that will aſſume the confidence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Let us allow this Authority for good: and then, I pray, will not <hi>Socinians, Anabaptists, Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, Fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy-men</hi> (and who
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42666:13"/>
not) enter in at this Door, and plead their Call by the <hi>People</hi> to Reform the <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> be pleas'd to tell us what <hi>People</hi> do you mean? If thoſe of your own Opinion, they will not in ſome places amount to a Fourth or Fifth part of the <hi>People,</hi> and muſt all the reſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42666:14"/>
be debar'd from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting their owne <hi>Preachers?</hi> beſides, you know, it is not the <hi>Peoples</hi> Election alone that can Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a <hi>Preacher</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> it is the <hi>Miſſion</hi> and <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of your <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,</hi> that I am now enquiring after. You cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant concerning
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42666:14"/>
the popular Election of Miniſters, that it had been diſus'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Centuries</hi> before <hi>Calvin;</hi> for the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, Factions, and Confuſions that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable <hi>People</hi> ſeldom or never agreeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Perſons</hi> to be Elected; and I am ſure there is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Scripture In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42666:15"/>
them with any ſuch power.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Or will you derive your Miniſtry from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> But all Diſſenters proclaim their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction from the ſame <hi>Original:</hi> which of them ſhall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? From Chriſt and his Apoſtles! Give me leave to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42666:15"/>
ask whether <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> or <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately? Immediately</hi> you will not ſay; if <hi>mediately,</hi> I pray in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us by whom? Or from whoſe hands did your <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Anceſtors</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their <hi>Miſſion</hi> and <hi>Ordination?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, Fifthly, Some body muſt ſend them to <hi>Preach</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:42666:16"/>
the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> Was it the CHURCH of <hi>Rome?</hi> Yes, I have heard you ſay; and is not this to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your ſelves the <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> that <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon? Quid Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto cum Belial?</hi> But the unhappineſs of it is, that this <hi>Miſſion</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42666:16"/>
Biſhops,</hi> will as ſoon Watrant the Sermons of a <hi>Popiſh Fryar,</hi> as thoſe of your Predeceſſors. And as to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Ordination</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> there is one Difficulty in it, that I confeſs I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſolve; Was it not <hi>Epiſcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> if any, they received from that

               <hi>Church?</hi> And was ſuch <hi>Ordination</hi> good and valid, yea or no? If good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will you needs aboliſh it, as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Word of God? If not, what will become of your <hi>Orders?</hi> And further, I would gladly underſtand; are any perſons ſent to go and preach
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42666:17"/>
the <hi>Goſpel</hi> after their own ſenſe?

            <p>As for <hi>Calvin; Beza,</hi> who wrote his Life, informs us, that

other Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians? could he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a power on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which he had not received, of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Miniſters? to ſay there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for it, is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that will excuſe alſo other diſſenters, pleading the ſame neceſſity of their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry;</hi> of all which, our Church is ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,

derive themſelves from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, from the Spirit of God, <hi>&amp;c.

Nor will it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you to ſay, that by this Argument the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church rejected Chriſt and his Apoſtles: The caſe not being the ſame betwixt Chriſt and the <hi>Jewiſh
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42666:23"/>
Church,</hi> and between <hi>us</hi> and <hi>you.</hi> To ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the <hi>Jews</hi> and their queſtion, <hi>By what authority doeſt thou theſe things?</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour appeals to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which he wrought, <hi>If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not me, believe the works which I do.</hi> Nor will it avail you to return the

queſtion upon our ſelves, who ſent us to Reform the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> This tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is no anſwer, but a deſiring us to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for you. Be plkas'd to know then that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was never of your froward and uncharitable humor in relation to that Church, to Reform
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42666:24"/>
our ſelves (ſaith Mr. <hi>Hooker)</hi> is not to ſever from the <hi>Church</hi> we were of before, <hi>Eccleſ. Pol. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.

a Ladder for himſelf to climb alone to Heaven.</p>
            <p>But as to your <hi>Party</hi> (Sir) I pray who gave them any Authority to <hi>Preach</hi> their <hi>Reformation</hi> to theſe <hi>Kingdomes?</hi> Give me leave to obſerve to you this paſſage in the <hi>Raco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Catechiſm</hi> there I remember the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42666:26"/>
is put, <hi>Num ii qui docent in eccleſia (Sociniana) ut ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulari aliqua ratione mittantur opus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent? Whether the Preachers of</hi> Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Doctrine, have need of any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary miſſion?</hi> The Anſwer is, <hi>Nullo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, quia nullam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam, nec inauditam afferunt doctrinam,

&amp;c.</hi> That is not at all, becauſe <hi>Socinians</hi> preach no new nor ſtrange Doctrine, but that onely which is Primitive and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Holy Scriptures. The ſame is affirmed by Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> concerning his own Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Institutions,</hi> which the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42666:27"/>
(you know) will by no means admit for truth: See <hi>Conradus Scluſelburg de Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia Calvinistarum.</hi> Indeed it had been ſomewhat, if it were not the <hi>matter</hi> in <hi>queſtion;</hi> or if <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Behemiſts,</hi> and all the <hi>Sects</hi> that ever moleſted the <hi>Church,</hi> did not urge as much for themſelvs,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42666:27"/>
boaſting of <hi>Goſpel truth.</hi> To ſay that your <hi>Party</hi> agree with us in all the <hi>Vital Articles</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> is to ſay what perhaps few of you believe; for I doubt not (if opportunity ſerv'd) every <hi>Sect</hi> of you would advance its reſpective <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as if that onely were <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and all
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42666:28"/>
other but <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Superſtition:</hi> Or if you do believe it, the more is your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs to moleſt the Church about opinions, which you do not eſteem of any <hi>vital importance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige you to conſider, whether you ought to take upon you to Reform, that is, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42666:28"/>
the univerſal <hi>order</hi> of Chriſts Church by <hi>Biſhops</hi> &amp;c.

holy Sacraments of Chriſts Body and Blood; revile the Church (whereof I cannot ſay, you but your <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> were made Members by Baptiſm) with the Names of Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Idolatry. Preach your deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Doctrine of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Reprobation, and the impoſſibility
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42666:29"/>
of keeping Gods Commandments; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce your own extemporary inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions inſtead of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy:</hi> Levy Warr againſt your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; and all this without any <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all theſe ſtrange things I ſhould think, Sir, your Anceſtors had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42666:30"/>
but need of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Miſſion. But perhaps you will Anſwer and tell us, That there have been extraordinary Prophets ſent into the World without Miracles, as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt:</hi> And 2ly, That <hi>Miracles</hi> are no certain Signs of true Prophets.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>John</hi> the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42666:30"/>
Baptiſt, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words of the Angel, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 15. he was filled with the Holy Ghoſt from his Mothers Womb; he ſhall go before in the Spirit and power of <hi>Elias</hi> (a Character to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> your Brethren will not pretend) he was a perſon propheſied of many Ages before
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42666:31"/>
his Birth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 3. The Voice of one crying in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, make ſtrait the way of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, That <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> are no certain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; <hi>becauſe there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, which ſhall ſhew great Signs and Wonders,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42666:31"/>
inſomuch that if it were poſſible, they ſhall deceive the very Elect: Wherefore if they ſhall ſay unto you, behold he is in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, go not forth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he is in the ſecret Chambers, believe it not,</hi> Math. 24. 24. That falſe Prophets can work any miracle but <hi>deceptio viſus,</hi> I do not believe. The
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42666:32"/>
meaning of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words is this, That if any other Prophet after him ſhall ariſe, aſſuming to be that Chriſt or Meſſias ſent from God, though he may pretend to ſtrange things, believe him not, go not forth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. If new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Sir, though they come with a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42666:32"/>
ſhew of miracles, are to be ſuſpected; ſhall we preſently receive all the Preachers of new Lights, that have not ſo much as the pretence?</p>
            <p>I find a late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſerting, That in holy Scripture, there be two marks by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> together, not aſun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der, a true Prophet or one newly ſent
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42666:33"/>
from God is to be known: One is the doing of <hi>miracles;</hi> The other is the not teaching any <hi>moral</hi> Doctrine adverſe to that which hath been already preach'd of old: Aſunder (he ſaith) neither of theſe is ſufficient: and for proof alledgeth two places of Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42666:33"/>
with <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. Our bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled both theſe marks, Firſt, in their Miracles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 22. Secondly, they taught no Doctrine of <hi>Morality,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to that which they found already eſtabliſhed. <hi>Chriſt came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42666:34"/>
it, ſaying none other things, then what</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did ſay ſhould come to paſs.</hi> But he Preached a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which had all the obliging Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Vertue and Goodneſs, of Peace and Love; witneſs his excellent Sermon on the Mount; <hi>non vox hominem ſonat.</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:42666:34"/>
There he preſſes the neceſſity of Moral Goodneſs, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe methinks then <hi>Calvin</hi> hath done: I ſhall inſtance a remarkable paſſage in the Second Book of his Inſtitutions, the ſeventh Chapter and fifth Section. <hi>Quod autem impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42666:36"/>
but what ſeemed to him I do not care, I call that impoſſible which never was, and which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that it never ſhall be. <note place="margin">

Alas! we are of our ſelves too prone to take an allowance of Sin, without this Licenſe from Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be ſhort, the <hi>Church</hi> of God may and ought to reform themſelves in caſe of error, or corruption of manners: But if we once admit others to do it, unauthoriz'd

            <p>Not that we deny our need of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this World of imperfection; but we give heed to the admonition of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 10. 1. Verily I ſay unto you, he that enters not by the

               <hi>For grant (ſaith Biſhop</hi> Sanderſon) <hi>for the ſuppreſſion of Idolatry, in caſe the Church will not do her Office, that it is lawful for any unauthoriz'd Perſons (ſuch as</hi> Knox, <hi>&amp;c.) to take upon them to reform what they think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs; there can be no ſufficient cauſe given, why by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

This is our preſent caſe; you a private Perſon, pretending to no extraordinary things, ſay all things are amiſs; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate (and he a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian too) is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yea, perſwaded in his Conſcience, that you do all things amiſs; who ſhall be Judge?

            </p>
            <p>From all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes I perſwade my ſelf, your <hi>Anceſtors</hi> were no Prophets ſent from God, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Divine <hi>Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

that they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſent from God; and whereas you ſay, that you Preach no other Doctrine then that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it is the anſwer of <hi>Socinians, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c. and will ſerve every mans turn as well as yours. But in the laſt place, cannot you juſtifie your ſelves by the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42666:43"/>
Sobriety and vertue of your Lives? By the Loyalty of your Actions? It is a great controverſie, and I ſhall not take upon me to pronounce my own ſence of it; but you have heard of King <hi>James</hi> his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the matter, <hi>Ego a Puritanis non ſolum a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuo <note place="margin">In praefacione Monitoria.</note>

            <p>Thus I have given you the reaſons of my diſſatisfaction,

cerning the validity of your Presbyterian <hi>Miſſion;</hi> and I muſt confeſs that I have here expreſſed only ſome wiſhes, not any hopes of convincing you; all my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that perhaps ſome unprejudic'd perſons will believe, that your Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian KIRK hath no advantage, in point

of a ſolid Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, over <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>

               <hi>Some of them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to preaching betimes, and have not the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and opportunity to look much into contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, underſtand very little of the true ſtate of the queſtion betwixt the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>and us; and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42666:46"/>
yet to ſhew their Zeal againſt Popery, are forward enough to be medling with it in the Pulpit; but with ſo much weakneſs and impertinency, that they leave the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worſe then they found it; and the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if he brought any doubts with him, to go from Sermon more diſſatisfi'd then he

came. Preface to</hi> 14. <hi>Sermons, Printed</hi> Anno 1657. <hi>Sect.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>Now, if you pleaſe, let us confer a few words about ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers matters, firſt, concerning that <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of yours, that nothing is to be done about the Worſhip and Service of God, without expreſs war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or precept in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42666:47"/>
holy Scriptures: and I pray inform me where has our bleſſed Saviour or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles enjoyned a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi> for publick prayer? Hath the Spirit any need of a <hi>Directory?</hi> what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine warrant can you produce for your Singing to God in a ſet <hi>Form,</hi> &amp; refuſing to pray in a ſet <hi>Form?</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:42666:48"/>
for ſpeaking to him your ſudden and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary thoughts, but ſpeaking to the people with a ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and compoſed Sermon? In which of the Goſpels are to be found thoſe three ſignificant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies required at the taking your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? Firſt, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42666:48"/>
we muſt be unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Secondly, that we muſt ſtand up. Thirdly, with our right hand lift up bare? what expreſs Scripture have you for your form of publick pennance, called the ſtool of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of yours (as hath been already obſerved by the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42666:49"/>
Friendly debate) makes that unlawful which the Scripture allows; in which we find many holy men doing thoſe things (without any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which he had no where commended; for inſtance, what Commandment had <hi>David</hi> for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of building a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42666:49"/>
Temple? Or <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> for keeping a Feaſt of ſeven days for the Dedication of the Altar? For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting an Altar to be aſcended by ſteps? expreſsly forbidden in the 20. of <hi>Exod. verſe</hi> 26. <hi>Thou ſhalt not go up by ſteps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mine Altar.</hi> Or what warrant had <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42666:50"/>
the Feaſt of unleavened bread ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days longer then the time appointed by the Law? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 23. If you ſay that all theſe things poſſibly were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, though not by <hi>Scripture;</hi> but now Scripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is neceſſary, ſince extraordinary inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are ceas'd: I
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42666:50"/>
pray tell us what Scripture have you for this very aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inſpirations are ceas'd? In a word, This Principle of yours, makes the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: The time, the place, the Veſture in which it ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, being no where appointed:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42666:51"/>
Do not the <hi>Quakers</hi> retort it upon your ſelves? Demanding Scripture for ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Pulpit, for Preaching upon a Text, and that by an hour-glaſs, ſtinting the Spirit; for wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cloak or Gown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing I would intreat you to reflect upon, is the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42666:51"/>
reaſon of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Revenues and encouragement of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> that which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters (if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them aright) would be at, is this, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive poverty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and methinks
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42666:52"/>
               <hi>Judas</hi> hath very well expreſſed their ſence, <hi>John</hi> 12. 4. <hi>To what purpoſe, is all this waſte of precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the feet of Chriſt? might it not have been ſold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he ſaid, not that he cared for the poor, but becauſe he had the bag, and was a Thief.</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:42666:52"/>
They do not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues there are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in a Church-man, which can have no place in the houſe of Scarcity; how little exemplary charity, temperance or humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity can be expected from a narrow eſtate: that we cannot ſay, he is a temperat man, who is ſo, having
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42666:53"/>
ſcarcely wherewithal to ſatisfie his thirſt: or an humble perſon, whoſe fortune gives him ſmall temptation to be proud. Are not all Chriſtians under the ſame obligations of humility and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Riches as the Clergy? Lay not up for your ſelves treaſures upon Earth, was ſaid to all; and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42666:53"/>
is it not true in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Prieſts muſt be attended with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der knowledg?

            <p>Give me leave to

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42666:54"/>
no neceſſity ſhall ever, I hope, drive me or mine to invade or ſell the Prieſts Lands, which even</hi> Pharo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah<hi>'s Divinity abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do. If the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of</hi> Scotland <hi>might, yet the plenty of</hi> England <hi>cannot excuſe the envy and rapine of the Church Lands. The next work will be</hi> Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am<hi>'s

Reformation, Conſecrating the meaneſt of the people to be Prieſts in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to ſerve their Golden Calves, who have enriched themſelves with the Churches Patrimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, be pleas'd to reflect on your diſpleaſure at the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:42666:55"/>
Some of you are for no Forms at all; others are for Liturgy, but it muſt be reformed. In the Hiſtory of the Reign of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>About the Year</hi> 1585.</note> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> this paſſage is obſervable: four <hi>Claſſes</hi> of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, complained of the Liturgy to the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> then Secretary of State; his Lordſhip bad them go and make a better; whereupon the firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> went and fram'd a new one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near that of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va;</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:42666:56"/>
this the ſecond <hi>Claſſis</hi> diſlikes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in ſix hundred parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; which alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was excepted againſt by the third <hi>Claſſis;</hi> and what the third reſolved upon, the fourth would not conſent to: Thus your Party expect a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which is impoſſible to be given you. As to your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit, there is a certain doubt in it, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto none <note place="margin">See the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debate.</note>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:42666:56"/>
of you would do us the favour to reſolve: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you mean praying by the Spirit of God, or by your own Spirits; if you conceive the words and matter of your prayer by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of the Holy Ghoſt, then are your prayers as much the word of God as any of <hi>David's Pſalms,</hi> or as any part of the Bible; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written from your mouths, may become Canonical Scripture. If by praying with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42666:57"/>
you only mean that you are inſpir'd with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout affections, then there is nothing in your prayers, but what others may pretend to, as well as your ſelves.</p>
            <p>In brief, Since you do not pretend to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your people with immediate inſpirations, you oblige them to a Service they know not what; to offer up prayers, whereof they know not a ſyllable, nor your ſelf neither, before you begin: if you know
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42666:57"/>
them before hand, either for matter or words, then they cannot be <hi>extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> as you would have the people believe; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the reaſon why the people fancy your prayers, is, their variety; they love not to go where they muſt be always entertain'd with the ſame expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but if the ſence of our own infirmities (which are always the ſame) cannot oblige us to pray, why ſhould a ſet of new words do it?

               <hi>uſe in all their devotions their own invention and gifts, that they wholly caſt away and contemn the Lords Prayer. I ever thought that the proud Oſtentation of mens own Abilities for Invention, and the vain affectation of variety for expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in publick prayer, merits a greater brand of Sin, then that which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42666:58"/>
they call coldneſs or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs; nor are men in thoſe novelties, leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to formal and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial tempers (as to their hearts) then in the uſe of conſtant forms, where not the words, but mens hearts are to blame. I make no doubt but a man may be very formal in the moſt extemporary variety, and very fervently devout in the moſt wonted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: Nor is God more a God of variety, then of conſtancy; nor are conſtant forms of prayer,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42666:59"/>
more likely to flat and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Spirit of prayer, then unpremeditated and confuſed variety, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract and loſe it.</hi>
