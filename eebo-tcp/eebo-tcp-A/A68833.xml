            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Arke had both the <hi>Rod</hi> and the <hi>Tables</hi> of the Law, by Gods appointment placed within it: than which, what could be more apt to expresse the satisfaction, which our <hi>high Priest</hi> was to make unto his Fathers justice, as well by his <hi>Passive</hi> as by his <hi>Active</hi> obedience? for as he felt the stroke of the Rod for us, that <note n="f" place="margin">Esa. 53.5.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The Arke had many removes from place to place, whiles it sojourned in the <hi>Tabernacle:</hi> but was brought up at last into the <hi>Temple,</hi> there to dwell upon God's holy Hill; the place of which he himselfe had said. <note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 132.14.</note> 
               <hi>This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.</hi> Where, at the first entry, King <hi>Salomon</hi> stood ready to entertaine him with this welcome, <note n="l" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 8.9.16. 2 Chron. 6.41</note> 
               <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, O Lord God, into thy resting place, thou, and the Arke of thy strength: Let thy Priests, O Lord God, be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with salvation; and let thy Saints reioyce in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Our blessed Saviour, in the dayes of his flesh, had no resting place, but continually <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 10.38.</note> went about doing good: untill at length <note n="n" place="margin">Mar. 16.</note> he was received up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and sate on the right hand of GOD. For when he had ended his progresse upon Earth, and <note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 17.4.</note> finished there that worke which his Father had given him to doe; he <note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 16.28. and 19.30.</note> left the world, and went to the Father; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his last remove unto the high Court of Heaven, <note n="q" place="margin">Act. 3.21.</note> where he is to reside untill the time of the restitution of all things. <note n="r" place="margin">Rev. 11.19.</note> 
               <hi>The Temple of GOD was opened in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and there was seene in his Temple the Arke of his Testament,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Apocalypse. If we looke to the corporall presence of our Saviour; in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Heaven must this Arke be sought for, in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place is it to be found: but if we looke to the vertue comming from him, by the operation of his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>; so we shall finde him in his Temple

upon earth, <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> present with us alwayes, even unto the end of the world: for, these were the gifts that, when he ascended into Heaven, he did bestow upon men.</p>
            <p>This the Prophet layeth downe thus: <note n="t" place="margin">Psal. 68 18.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up on high: thou hast received gifts for men.</hi> The Apostle citeth it thus: <note n="u" place="margin">Ephes. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>When he ascended up on high, he gave gifts unto men.</hi> The reconciliation is easie: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived those gifts, not to retaine them with himselfe, but to distribute them for the behoofe of his Church. So for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth us, Acts 2.33. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being by the right hand of God exalted,</hi> [there is his ascending up on high] <hi>and having received of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the promise of the holy Ghost,</hi> [there is his receiving] <hi>he hath shed forth this which ye now see and heare.</hi> [there is his giving of this gift unto men.] And for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the <hi>Word,</hi> he himselfe intimateth as much in his Commission, given to the Apostles, Mat. 28.18.19. <hi>All power is given unto mee in heaven and in earth:</hi> [there he receiveth] <hi>Goe ye therefore, and teach all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> [there he giveth this gift unto men.]<note n="x" place="margin">Ephes. 4.11.12.</note> 
               <hi>He gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints:</hi> saith our Apostle here. That herein also that might be fulfilled, which we heard to haue beene uttered, when the Arke was brought to his resting place <note n="y" place="margin">2 Chron. 6.41. Psal. 132.9.16</note>: <hi>Let thy Priests, O Lord God, be cloathed with salvation, and let thy Saints reioyce in goodnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>worke of the Ministery,</hi> how meanely soever it be esteemed in the World; yet in the estimation of our Saviour Christ, was one of the choysest gifts, that in this solemnitie of his triumphant <note n="z" place="margin">Ephes. 4.10.</note> ascending up far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all heavens, he thought fit to bestow upon his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19556:4"/>
Church here upon earth: as that which tended both to the <note n="a" place="margin">Ib. ver. 12.</note> 
               <hi>perfecting of the Saints,</hi> and to the <hi>edifying</hi> of his owne <hi>body.</hi> For as <note n="b" place="margin">Col. 1.19.</note> it hath pleased the Father, <hi>that in him all fulnesse should dwell</hi>: so the Son is also plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, not to hold it any disparagement, that <note n="c" place="margin">Ephes. 1.23.</note> 
               <hi>his Body,</hi> the Church, should be accounted <hi>the fulnesse of him that filleth all in all.</hi> That howsoever in himselfe he be most absolutely and perfectly complete; yet is his Church so neerely conjoyned unto him, that he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not himselfe full without it: but as long as any one member remaineth yet ungathered and unknit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this mysticall body of his, he accounteth, in the meane time, somewhat to be deficient in himselfe. And therefore our Apostle having, in the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately going before this Text, declared, that the Ministery was instituted <hi>for the edifying of the bodie of Christ</hi>; addeth presently, <hi>Till wee all come in the unitie of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of GOD, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words we may obserue aswell the <hi>Matter</hi> of this Building [<hi>Wee all</hi>] as the <hi>Structure</hi> of it; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also consider in the Structure, <hi>first,</hi> the laying of the foundation [<hi>In the unitie of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God</hi>] <hi>secondly,</hi> the bringing of the worke to perfection, and the raising of it to his just height [<hi>unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fulnesse of Christ</hi>].</p>

The wisedome of God foresaw this insolency long before-hand: and therfore caused a Caveat to be entred against it, even in that Epistle which was specially directed to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe. The words are plaine enough,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19556:6"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.18. <hi>If thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore must know that shee is no more a <hi>root</hi> to beare up other Churches, than other Churches are to beare up her: she may not goe beyond her line, and boast her selfe to be the <hi>root</hi> of the Catholick Church, but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be born her selfe by the <hi>root,</hi> aswell as other particular Churches are. For a streame to sever it selfe from the common Fountaine, that it may bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Fountaine it selfe, without dependance upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other; is the next way to make an end of it, and dry it up. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may doe well to think of this, and leave off her vaine boasting. <note n="o" place="margin">Rev. 18.7.</note> 
               <hi>I sit a Queen, and am no Widow, and shall see no sorrow.</hi> Other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may faile, and the gates of hell may prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: but it cannot fall out so with me.

               <hi>Be not high minded, but feare. For if God spared not the naturall branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodnesse and severity of God: on them which fell, severitie, but towards thee, goodnes, if thou continue in his goodnesse: otherwise</hi> THOU AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SO SHALT BE CUT OFF.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> therefore by their pride may get a fall, as well as others; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity may be cut off, aswell as any other congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and yet the Catholick Church subsist for all that, as having for her foundation neither <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Rom's</hi> Bishop, but <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the Sonne of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.

The <hi>Donatists</hi> were cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by our forefathers, for shutting up the Church within the parts of the <hi>South</hi>; and rejecting all others that held not correspondency with that patch of theirs: And could they thinke well then of them, that should conclude the Church within the <hi>Western</hi> parts of the world, and exclude all other Christians from the body of Christ, that held not by the same root there that they did? It is a strange thing to me, that wise men should make such large discourses of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, and bring so many testimonies to prove the Vniversalitie of it: &amp; not discern, that while by this means they think they have gotten a great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over us, they have in very truth overthrowne themselves; for when it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the point, in stead of the Catholick Church which consisteth of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Which may further be made manifest unto us by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practice of the Catholick Church her selfe, in the matriculation of her children, and the first admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them into her communion. For when shee prepared her <hi>Catechumeni</hi> for Baptisme, and by that dore received them into the congregation of Christs flock; we may not think her iudgement to have beene so weake, that shee would omit any thing herein that was essentially necessary for the making of one a member of the Church. Now the profession which she required of all that were to receive Baptisme, was, for the <hi>Agenda</hi> or practicall part, an abrenuntiation of the Divell, the World, and the Flesh, with all their sinfull workes and lustes; and for the <hi>Credenda,</hi> the things to be beleeved, an acknowledgement of the articles of the Creed: which being solemnly done, she then baptised them <hi>in this faith</hi>; intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by sufficiently, that this was that <hi>one Faith</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto her by the Apostles, as the other that <hi>one Baptisme</hi> which was appointed to be the <note n="p" place="margin">Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fidei. <hi>Aug. epist.</hi> 23.</note> Sacrament of it.</p>
            <p>This Creed, though for substance it was the same every where, yet for forme was somewhat different; and in some places received moe enlargements than in others. The Westerne Churches herein applyed themselves to the capacitie of the meaner sort, more than the Easterne did: using in their Baptisme that shorter Forme of Confession, commonly called <hi>The Apostles Creed,</hi> which in the more ancient times was

            </p>
            <p>It is a matter confessed therefore by the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> themselues, that in the <hi>Constantinopolitane</hi> Creed, or in the <hi>Romane</hi> Creed at the farthest (which differeth nothing from the other, but that it hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Filióque</hi> to the procession of the Holy Ghost, and out of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, <hi>Deum de Deo,</hi> to the articles that concerne the Sonne) that <hi>onely foundation,</hi> and principle of faith is to be found, in the <hi>unitie</hi> whereof all Christians must necessarily agree. Which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise cleared sufficiently, by the constant practice of the Apostles and their successours, in the first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of men into the Societie of the Church. For in one of the Apostles ordinary Sermons, we see, there was so much matter delivered, as was sufficient to convert men unto the faith, and to make them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Baptisme: and those Sermons treated onely of the first principles of the doctrine of Christ; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receiving whereof, the Church (following the example of the Apostles) never did denie Baptisme unto her <hi>Catechumeni.</hi> In these first principles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must the foundation be contained, and that common <hi>unitie of faith</hi> which is required in all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19556:12"/>
the members of the Church.</p>
            <p>The foundation then being thus cleared: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the superstruction, we learne from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, that some <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.12.</note> 
               <hi>build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble.</hi> Some proceed from one degree of wholesome knowledge unto another; increasing their maine stock, by the addition of those other sacred truthes that are revealed in the word of God: and these build upon the foundation, <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>silver,</hi> and <hi>precious stones.</hi> Others retaine the precious foundation, but lay base matter upon it; <hi>wood, hay, stubble,</hi> and such other eyther unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or more dangerous stuffe: and others goe so farre, that they overthrow the very foundation it selfe. The first of these be <hi>wise,</hi> the second <hi>foolish,</hi> the third <hi>madde</hi> builders. When the day of tryall commeth: the first mans <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. v. 14.</note>

               <hi>he shall suffer losse,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>but he himselfe shall be saved</hi>:) the third shall lose both himselfe and his worke together. And as in this spirituall structure verie different kindes of materialls may be laid upon the same foundation, some sound and some unsound: so in either of them, there is a great difference to be made betwixt such as are more contiguous to the foundation, and such as be remoter off. The fuller explication of the first principles of faith, and the conclusions deduced from thence, are in the ranke of those verities that be more neerely conjoyned to the foundation: to which those falsities are answerable on the other side,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19556:13"/>
that grate upon the foundation, and any way endanger it.</p>

            <p>Now from all that hath beene said, two great Questions may be resolved, which trouble manie.

For example. It is a ground of the Catholick faith, that <hi>Christ was borne of the Virgin Mary:</hi> which in the Scripture is thus explained. <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>God sent forth his Sonne, Made of a Woman.</hi> This the Papacie admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for a certaine truth: but insinuateth withall, that upon the Altar God sendeth forth his Sonne

made of Bread. For the <hi>Transsubstantiation</hi> which these man would haue us beleeve, is not an annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bread, and a substitution of the Bodie of Christ in the stead thereof, but a reall conversion of the one into the other: such as they themselves would have esteemed to be a bringing forth of Christ, and a kinde of Generation of him.

side to be so foolish, as to give credit to such a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thing. Neither may we account it to have been a small blessing of God unto our ancestors, who lived in that kingdome of darkenesse, that the Ignorance wherein they were bred, freed them from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of those things, which being known might prove so prejudiciall to their soules health. <note n="k" place="margin">Sunt enim quaedam, quae nescire, quàm scire, sit me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius. <hi>Aug.

            <p>The ignorance of those principles of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith, that are absolutely necessarie to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is as dangerous a gulfe on the other side: but the light of those common truthes of Christianitie was so great, and so firmely fixed in the mindes of those that professed the name of Christ, that it was not possible for the power of darkenesse to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it, nor the gates of Hell to prevaile against it. Nay, the verie solemne dayes, which by the ancient institution of the Church were celebrated for the commemoration of the <hi>Blessed Trinitie,</hi> the <hi>Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Passion, Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, did so preserve the memorie of these things among the common people; that by the <note n="m" place="margin">in <hi>Sylvest. in Summâ, verb.</hi> Fides. §. 6. <hi>ex Thom. in</hi> 2<hi>a</hi> 2<hi>ae, quaest.</hi> 2. <hi>art.</hi> 7.</note> Popish Doctors themselves, it is made an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grosse and supine Ignorance, that any should not have explicite knowledge of those my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Christ, which were thus publikely solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized in the Church. And (which is the principall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19556:15"/>
point of all) the ordinary instruction appointed to be given unto men upon their death-beds, was: <note n="n" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>So that where these things did thus concurre in any (as wee doubt not but they did in many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands), the knowledge of the common principles of the faith, the ignorance of such maine errours as did endanger the foundation, a godly life, and a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death: there we have no cause to make any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but that God had fitted a subject for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to worke upon. And yet in saying thus, wee doe nothing lesse than say that such as these were <hi>Papists,</hi> either in their life or in their death: members of the Romane Church perhaps they were, but such as by God's goodnes were preserved from the mortalitie of <hi>Popery</hi> that raigned there. For <hi>Popery</hi> it selfe is nothing else but the botch or the plague of that Church: which hazardeth the soules of those it sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth upon, as much as any infection can doe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And therefore if any one will needs be so foole-hardy as to take up his lodging in such a Pest-house, after warning given of the present danger; wee in our charitie may well say, <hi>Lord have mercy upon him:</hi> but he, in the meane time, hath great cause to feare, that God in his justice will inflict that judgement upon him, which <note n="o" place="margin">2 Thess. 2.12.</note> in this case he hath threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as will <hi>not beleeve the truth, but take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

            <p>The second question, so rise in the mouthes of our Adversaries, is: <hi>Where was your Church before Luther?</hi> Whereunto an answere may bee returned from the grounds of the solution of the former que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: that our Church was even there where now it is.

            <p>Thus if at this day we should take a survay of the severall professions of Christianitie, that have any large spread in any part of the world (as of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Romane</hi> and the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches in our Quarters, of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians</hi> in the South, of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and other Christians in the Easterne parts), and should put-by the points wherein they did differ one from another, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one body the rest of the Articles wherein they all did generally agree: wee should finde, that in those propositions which without all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie are universally received in the whole Christian world, so much truth is contained, as, being joyned with holy obedience, may be sufficient to bring a man unto everlasting salvation.

            <p>The danger then of this Ignorance being, by the confession of the most judicious Divines of both sides, acknowledged to be so great: the wofull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the poore Countrey wherein I live, is much to bee lamented, where the people generally are suffered to perish for want of knowledge: the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar superstitions of Poperie not doing them halfe that hurt, that the ignorance of those common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the faith doth, which all true Christians are bound to learne.

the opposite party, &amp; to move them: that howsoever in other things we did differ one from another, yet wee should joyne together in teaching those maine points, the knowledge whereof was so necessary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to salvation, and of the truth whereof there was no controversie betwixt us.

(that is, to apply our selves unto the capacitie of the common Auditorie, and to make an Ignorant man to understand these mysteries in some good measure) will put us to the tryall of our skill, and trouble us a great deale more, than if we were to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse a controversie, or handle a subtile point of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Schooles.

I say, in the hearts aswell as in the mindes: because we may not content our selves with a bare <hi>Theoricall</hi> knowledge, which is an information onely of the Vnderstanding, and goeth no further than the braine; but we must labour to attaine unto a further degree both of <hi>Experimentall</hi> and of <hi>Practicall</hi> Knowledge, in the things that wee have learned. A young man may talke much of the troubles of the world, and a Scholar in the Vniversitie may shew a great deale of wit in making a large declamation

upon that argument: but when the same men have afterwards been beaten in the world, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that they spake before they knew not what, and count their former apprehension of these things to be but meere Ignorance, in respect of that new lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which now they have bought by deare experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

               <hi>the tree of knowledge of good and evill:</hi> because it signified unto them, that as now while they stood upon termes of obedience with their Creator, they knew nothing but <hi>good</hi>; so at what time soever they did transgresse his commandement, they should begin to know <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> also, whereof before they had no knowledge, not but that they had an <hi>intellectuall</hi> knowledge of it before (for he that knoweth good, cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that which is contrarie unto it; <hi>Rectum</hi> being alwayes <hi>index sui &amp; obliqui:</hi>) but that till then they never had felt any evill, they never had any <hi>experimentall</hi> knowledge of it. So our Apostle in this Epistle boweth his knees unto the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that hee would grant unto these Ephesians, <note n="l" place="margin">Ephe. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge:</hi> shewing, that there is a further degree of knowledge in this kinde, that may be felt by the heart, though not comprehended by the braine: and in the Epistle to the Philippians, <note n="m" place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> he counteth all things but losse <hi>for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus his Lord.</hi> Meaning hereby a knowledge grounded upon deepe experience of the vertue of Christs death and resurrection, in his owne soule:

            <p>Now as there is great difference among men in their naturall growth, so is there no lesse varietie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them also in respect of their spirituall stature: there being severall degrees of this imperfect kinde of perfection here spoken of; which, according to the diversitie of times, places, and persons, may admit a greater or a lesser measure.

But, according to the measure of the gift of God, wee must know notwithstanding that it is required gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all men; that they <hi>grow in grace, and in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19556:23"/>
