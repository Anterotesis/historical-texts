            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Dyer,</hi> ſupported by the Authority of this Court, the lawes of the Country, &amp; the law of God
may rather perſwade us to expect incouragement and commendation from all prudent &amp; pious
men, than convince us of any neceſſity to Apollogize for the ſame; yet for as much as men of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

and ſuſceptible of ſiniſter and dangerous impreſſions) for want of full information, may be leſs ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and men of perverſer principles, may take occaſion hereby to caluminate us, and render us as bloody perſecutors
to ſatisfy the one, and ſtop the mouthes of the other, we thought it requiſite to declare;</p>
            <p>THat about 3. yeares ſince divers perſons profeſſing themſelves Quakers, of whoſe pernicious opinions and
practices, we had received intelligence from good hands from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and <hi>England</hi> (arrived at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>)
whoſe perſons were only ſecured, to be ſent away by the firſt oportunity without cenſure or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
although their profeſſed tenents, turbulent and contemptuous behaviour to authority would have
juſtified a ſeverer animadverſion, yet the Prudence of this Court was exerciſed, onely in making proviſion to ſecure
the peace and order here eſtabliſhed againſt their attempts, whoſe deſignes (we were well aſſured of by our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
as well as by the example of their predeceſſours in <hi>Munſter</hi>) was to undermine and ruine the ſame. And
accordingly a law was made and publiſhed, prohibiting all Maſters of Ships to bring any Quakers into this Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and themſelves from coming in, on penalty of the houſe of Correction, till they could be ſent away: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which, by a back dore, they found entrance, and the penalty inflicted on themſelves proving inſufficient
to reſtraine their impudent and inſolent obſtructions, was increaſed by the loſſe of the eares of thoſe that offended the
ſecond time, which alſo being too weak a defence againſt their impetuous frantick fury, neceſſitated us to endeavour
our ſecurity, and upon ſerious conſideration, after the former experiments by their inceſſant aſſaults, a law was made
that ſuch perſons ſhould be baniſhed, on pain of death, according to the example of <hi>England</hi> in their proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Jeſuits, which ſentence being regularly pronounced, at the laſt Court of aſſiſtants againſt the parties above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and they either returning, or continuing preſumptuouſly in this Juriſdiction, after the time limited, were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and owning themſelves to be the perſons baniſhed, were ſentenced (by the Court) to death, according to
the law aforeſaid, which hath been executed upon 2. of them, <hi>Mary Dyer</hi> upon the petition of her Son and the mercy
and clemency of this Court, had liberty to depart within two dayes, which ſhee hath accepted of. The Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
