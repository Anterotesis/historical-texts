            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Wag'd once betwixt Suburbian Cattle.</l>
               <l>Thus does a Falcon soaring rise,</l>
               <l>And at some noble Quarry flies,</l>
               <l>But stoops, when it can fly no more,</l>
               <l>At Carrion, which it left before.</l>
               <l>This Battle Read too, and the while</l>
               <l>If thou approv'st it, <hi>Shepherd,</hi> Smile.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48329:4"/>But though thou lik'st it, Laugh not out,</l>
               <l>For all the Versifying Rout,</l>
               <l>A bold and a presuming Nation,</l>
               <l>If once they know thy Approbation,</l>
               <l>Will mawl thee with perpetual Billets,</l>
               <l>And pelt thee with Poetick Pellets,</l>
               <l>Send thee more Scrawls, more various Pothooks,</l>
               <l>Than are i' th' Letter-Case of Mâ€”</l>
               <l>Thou wilt on ev'ry hand be pepper'd,</l>
               <l>For all who Write would fain please <hi>Shepherd</hi>:</l>
               <l>Nay, to take his, and <hi>Dorset</hi>'s Heart</l>
               <l>The Nine their utmost Charms exert,</l>
               <l>Their Charms of Nature and of Art.</l>
               <l>Whilst by their Looks, their Air, their Dress,</l>
               <l>They to the wond'ring World no less</l>
               <l>Than Virgin-Goddesses confess;</l>
               <l>What they aspire to by their Charms</l>
               <l>Is to be bless'd in <hi>Dorset</hi>'s Arms:</l>
               <l>Pleas'd, ravish'd with his Approbation,</l>
               <l>Tho Damn'd by all the Fools i' th' Nation.</l>
               <l>Now for one Compliment in Rhime.</l>

            <l>AS when the Ugly Face of Night,</l>
            <l>The Sun does to the Ocean fright,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Proteus,</hi> with their Train,</l>
            <l>The merry Monsters of the Main,</l>
            <l>The Red-fac'd God Carrowsing meet,</l>
            <l>And with large Draughts his Presence greet;</l>
            <l>Like Luck does at like Hours attend</l>
            <l>His Deputy at <hi>Brâ€”k-street-End:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To whom three strange prodigious Creatures,</l>
            <l>And Monsters of Amphibious Natures,</l>
            <l>Half Beasts, half Fish, together hie,</l>
            <l>Who though on Land they often lie,</l>
            <l>Yet are they never throughly dry,</l>
            <l>And when they cease to drink, they dy;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48329:6"/>Like Whales, their Bulks a Flood contain,</l>
            <l>Which in the Air they Spout again;</l>
            <l>They swallow still like Fish, (to keep</l>
            <l>The Allegory) whilst they sleep,</l>
            <l>Each gulps his Beer-glass, and i' th' fact</l>
            <l>With drowsie Nod commends the Act.</l>
            <l>Me an Acquaintance did invite,</l>
            <l>This <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Fair to see the Sight,</l>
            <l>And just at Twelve we went one Night,</l>
            <l>Where there were stranger Creatures shown,</l>
            <l>Than ever at the Fair were known;</l>
            <l>And if you think I say too much,</l>
            <l>Survey their Pictures here and judge,</l>
            <l>The first, hight <hi>Robin,</hi> a queir Spark is,</l>
            <l>A lewd Soul with a righteous Carkass.</l>
            <l>Virgin Vermillion, or True Blue,</l>
            <l>Is not of such a Saint-like hue,</l>
            <l>He Baudy talk'd with the same Faces,</l>
            <l>With the same Goggles, Whines, Grimaces,</l>
            <l>That our Enlightned Men say Graces.</l>
            <l>They who sat at th' end of the Table,</l>
            <l>Took him for Holderforth right able,</l>
            <l>And look'd with Reverence on his Visage</l>
            <l>Too grave and antique far, for this Age,</l>
            <l>To those he seem'd a Gifted Teacher,</l>
            <l>To us who heard him a rank Letcher.</l>
            <l>So Parson <hi>Hugh,</hi> with Groan and Snivel</l>
            <l>Made half his Congregation drivel,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48329:6"/>Whilst Bâ€”s set to show did tickle</l>
            <l>The other half o' th' Conventicle.</l>
            <l>This Fellow chatter'd thus uncleanly</l>
            <l>With the same Looks Folk act obseenely.</l>
            <l>When Nature conscious of a Sin,</l>
            <l>So unworthy of her, and so mean,</l>
            <l>In height of Exstacy is seen,</l>
            <l>With ugly Penitential Meen;</l>
            <l>So much for Saint, the next's an Atheist,</l>
            <l>Who for his Morals held it safest:</l>
            <l>He bragg'd, that he like Beasts should dy,</l>
            <l>And did both God and Devil deny,</l>
            <l>As Boys a days, when Succours nigh</l>
            <l>Can <hi>Rawhead</hi> Rally and defy,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Rawhead</hi> who with panick Frights,</l>
            <l>Ne're fails to make them stink a Nights,</l>
            <l>So does this wight the Devil disown,</l>
            <l>And haunted by him, when alone,</l>
            <l>Does in Revenge from's Chamber run,</l>
            <l>To swear there's no such thing at th' Sun,</l>
            <l>Yet does so stare whilst he denys him,</l>
            <l>That one would almost swear he spies him,</l>
            <l>Though as for Staring his Pretence is</l>
            <l>To look about for his lost Senses:</l>
            <l>His hagard Eyes, and fiery Face,</l>
            <l>Both are his Hoary Head's disgrace;</l>
            <l>Nature ne're join'd a lewder Phys.</l>
            <l>To such a Reverend Skull as his.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48329:7"/>So on some Hills perpetual Snow</l>
            <l>Lyes, whilst the Vine buds just below,</l>
            <l>He Urgin <hi>Ned,</hi> and Saint-like <hi>Robin,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To leave off Stumming for dry Bobbing,</l>
            <l>Did kiss and chatter too, and hug,</l>
            <l>A little nasty Female <hi>Pug,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who being Offensive to the Nose</l>
            <l>Is by <hi>Antiphrasis</hi> call'd <hi>Rose.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His fiery Snout slopt her's that Sallow,</l>
            <l>Like Flame that Lambent lies on Tallow,</l>
            <l>Which did all four to a Course dispose,</l>
            <l>And two Drabs more, being fetch'd by <hi>Rose,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They mount and box about their Lasses,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Lombards</hi> riding Post on Asses.</l>
            <l>When see the sad Reverse of Fate,</l>
            <l>Of happiest Mortals the frail State,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Robin</hi> for Gold the root of Evil</l>
            <l>Had made a Contract with the Devil;</l>
            <l>That is, had Married a curst Wife,</l>
            <l>That Hellish Plague of human Life.</l>
            <l>She having notice of <hi>Bob's</hi> Doxy,</l>
            <l>And fuming much at such a Proxy,</l>
            <l>Came thundering in, and took her Vagrant,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ipso Facto,</hi> in Guilt that's flagrant:</l>
            <l>Judge what Impression this injurious</l>
            <l>Action made on one so furious,</l>
            <l>The Drabs as soon as e're they spy'd her,</l>
            <l>Threw every one of them her Rider,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48329:7"/>Starting like Jades, that cast their Load,</l>
            <l>If once the Devil comes cross the Road.</l>
            <l>When strait advancing to her Moiety;</l>
            <l>Sweet Sir, said she, I wish much Joy to you,</l>
            <l>And your new Bride, a wish that's due</l>
            <l>To one so Kind and Just as you.</l>
            <l>With that Sh' unmercifully fisted</l>
            <l>Poor sneaking <hi>Bob,</hi> who ne're resisted.</l>
            <l>Ay me! how chang'd! he's he no more,</l>
            <l>Wh' Engag'd so bravely just before;</l>
            <l>But differs as victorious Hector</l>
            <l>Did from his pale and bloody Spectre,</l>
            <l>When Brutal <hi>Ned</hi> to help his Fellow,</l>
            <l>With all his Lungs began to Bellow.</l>
            <l>Old <hi>Bob,</hi> quoth he, Old <hi>Bob</hi> so doughty,</l>
            <l>Wilt thou be Cow'd by by such a Dowdy?</l>
            <l>Take Crab-tree here Old Boy, and Bast her,</l>
            <l>Until she owns her Lord and Master.</l>
            <l>Vile Sot said she to <hi>Ned,</hi> but such</l>
            <l>A Title honors thee too much;</l>
            <l>For Sot supposes somthing Human,</l>
            <l>Thou art a Bear, not born of Woman;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tom Dove</hi> thy Sire was, and another</l>
            <l>Furr'd <hi>Muscovite</hi> like him, thy Mother,</l>
            <l>Who having Cubb'd thee from her kick'd thee</l>
            <l>(Seeing thee so hideous) and ne'er lick'd thee:</l>
            <l>What do'st thou here now, where few venter,</l>
            <l>Till of thy Absence sure, to enter?</l>

            <l>Whilst thou devouring meat, dost cram it</l>
            <l>More nauseously than they theirs Vomit:</l>
            <l>Why should Beasts love Debauches, fit</l>
            <l>Only for Men, and Men of Wit?</l>
            <l>Whom Wine inspires with Noble Sense,</l>
            <l>That can a Surfeit recompence,</l>
            <l>Who in their Qualms a Breeding lye</l>
            <l>Children that live to Eternity:</l>
            <l>But thou a despicable Toper,</l>
            <l>Art still <hi>Ned V</hi>â€” Drunk and Sober;</l>
            <l>Diff'ring as Wild Bears do from Tame,</l>

            <l>Thou striv'st to shew thou'rt Man by Drinking,</l>
            <l>For void of of Reason and of Goodness,</l>
            <l>Thou'st nought that's Human but thy Lewdness.</l>
            <l>Spouse being resolv'd to be severe,</l>
            <l>Was running on in full career,</l>
            <l>When urg'd by his fermenting Choler,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ned</hi> threw a pot of Port to maul her;</l>

            <l>The Walls to its furious Battry yielding,</l>
            <l>The Mansion was but Paper-Building;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48329:8"/>A wretched Tenement, a Shed</l>
            <l>That never had been Furnished,</l>
            <l>Purely design'd for one to keep in't</l>
            <l>That would do nothing else but sleep in't;</l>
            <l>And that was <hi>Robin</hi>'s dreaming Soul,</l>
            <l>Which spying in its House this hole,</l>
            <l>Had frighted, like to have left its Quarters,</l>
            <l>Enrolling <hi>Bob</hi> amongst the Martyrs.</l>
            <l>Spouse who by death of Moiety</l>
            <l>Thought she had lost her Property,</l>
            <l>Tho she retriev'd her Liberty,</l>
            <l>Took up a pot of Chamber-lye</l>
            <l>And Wine at second hand, a Medly,</l>
            <l>Of odious hue and Savour deadly,</l>
            <l>And coming slily behind <hi>Ned,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Now raising <hi>Robin</hi> from the Dead,</l>
            <l>Fixt it like Armour on his Head,</l>
            <l>Whilst running down on every side him,</l>
            <l>Its foul Contents did strangely dight him;</l>
            <l>Its Fumes cast <hi>Ned</hi> into a Swound,</l>
            <l>His Armour clang'd against the Ground;</l>
            <l>Mean while his brave Virago fully</l>
            <l>Determin'd to revenge her Bully,</l>
            <l>Took two great Candlesticks and aim'd</l>
            <l>Two Mortal Blows at Spouse, but Maim'd</l>
            <l>The Atheist; who in his Affliction,</l>
            <l>Gave us his usual Benediction;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48329:9"/>For tho he God sometimes denies,</l>
            <l>Now fervently he to him crys,</l>
            <l>And prays with unfeign'd Supplication</l>
            <l>And hearty zeal for the Damnation</l>
            <l>Of the Militant Congregation;</l>
            <l>Nay, against such a riotous Rout,</l>
            <l>Himself to the Devil gave Judgment out,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Rose</hi> to revenge her Roysters Quarrel,</l>
            <l>Amongst us all threw an Oister-Barrel,</l>
            <l>And flung it too with a resolution</l>

            <l>Its clattering shels amongst us fall,</l>
            <l>Signal of universal Brawl;</l>
            <l>Then to the Table Atheist blunder'd,</l>
            <l>Himself Intrenching strongly under't,</l>
            <l>For by the noise he thought it Thunder'd,</l>
            <l>For Discord now outrageous grew,</l>
            <l>Bottles in rattling Vollies flew;</l>
            <l>Of Arms which range now finds for Mischief,</l>
            <l>O Times! O Manners! Bottle is Chief,</l>
            <l>Souls outside Clapperclawing more,</l>
            <l>Than inward Jobbernol before:</l>
            <l>Bottle in Fellowship Men uniting</l>
            <l>And fram'd for the World to take delight in.</l>
            <l>Now the curs'd Instrument's made of Fighting,</l>
            <l>And Sots are just about to Perish,</l>
