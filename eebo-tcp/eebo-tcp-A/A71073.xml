            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HOPE it will not be thought unseasonable to make an Address of this nature to Your <hi>Lordship</hi> in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Term, since the great <hi>Cause</hi> at present in Your Court (as one of late pleasantly said) is thaet between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> between our <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:49657:3"/>
while so many Witnesses are daily sworn of the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> side; it may not be improper to lay open to Your <hi>Lordship</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Cause,</hi> My Lord, which was at first set on Foot by Ambition, carried on by Faction, and must therefore be maintained by the like means; but can never hope to prevail among us again, till <hi>subjection</hi> to a <hi>Forreign Power</hi> can be thought our <hi>Interest,</hi> and to part at once with <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> be esteemed our <hi>Honour.</hi> It is a <hi>Cause</hi> much of the nature of some others depending before Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> more vexatious than difficult; and managed by such Advocates who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retained in the Cause, though they have nothing material to say for it, yet are ashamed to be silent. Who are alwayes disputing about an end of Controversies, but at the same time do their utmost to increase and
<pb facs="tcp:49657:3"/>
perpetuate them; and are ready to foment our differences that they may make use of them to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>While we have such restless Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to deal with, part of our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lyes in being too secure of the <hi>Goodness</hi> of our <hi>Cause:</hi> and methinks there can be little satisfaction in lying still or quarrelling with each other, when we know our <hi>common</hi> enemies to be at work undermining of us. But whatever repose others enjoy, my Adversaries seem to deal with me, as some do with those whom they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Witchcraft; they think by pinching me so often, and keeping me from taking rest, to make me say at last as they would have me. But the comfort is, as long as I am secure of my senses, I am of my Religion against theirs: if I once lose them or my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, I know not whether it may be my fortune to be carried to
<pb facs="tcp:49657:4"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> or some more convenient place. And in my opinion they deal with those under their care, as if they believed them not to be in their right senses, for they keep them alwayes in the dark, and think nothing more dangerous than to let in light upon them. Wherein I cannot deny, but considering the <hi>nature</hi> of their <hi>Cause,</hi> they take the most effectual course to maintain it; for it not being capable of enduring a severe tryal, nothing can preserve its reputation, but <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Credulity:</hi> which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in so great esteem among them, that if it were a Custome to Canonize Things as well as Persons, we might find those sacred names in their Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and addresses as solemn made to them, as ever were to Faith and Vertue among the elder and wiser <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not go far, for an Instance of their design to advance, even in
<pb facs="tcp:49657:4"/>
this Inquisitive Age, the Honour of these two great Pillars of their Church: For if your Lordship shall be pleased to cast Your eye on the following Discourse, especially that part which concerns the <hi>Miracles of the Roman Church,</hi> You will find fufficient evidence of it almost in every Page. When I first engaged in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie I could hardly believe what I now see, that they would ever have brought it to this issue with me, viz. <hi>That they would renounce all claim to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, if they did not produce as great Miracles wrought in their Church to attest it, as ever were wrought by Christ or his Apostles.</hi> The boldness of which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, and the pernicious influence of it upon Christianity it self, hath made me take the more pains in the examination of it. Which I have done with so much care in consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own approved <hi>Authors,</hi> that I hope at last they will grow ashamed
<pb facs="tcp:49657:5"/>
of that groundless calumny, that I do not deal fairly in the citing of them. A calumny so void of proof, that I could desire no better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a baffled Cause, than such impertinent Clamours. But if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent sayings will serve their turn, they need never fear what can be written against them. Do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed think me a man so void of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, as to expose my self so easily to the contempt of every one that will but take pains to compare my citations? Have I the Books only in my own keeping? or are they so rare that they cannot get a sight of them? How then come they to know them to be false quoted? But alas! they are men of business, and have not leisure to search out and compare Books, and therefore the shortest way is to say, that <hi>without doubt they are all false.</hi> Their numbers certainly are not so small, nor their business so
<pb facs="tcp:49657:5"/>
great, but they might have spared some to have undertaken this task particularly, if I had been faulty: and in my mind it had been of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to have freed their Church from those heavy imputations of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism, and destroying the necessity of a good life,</hi> from the Testimony of their own Authors. But if these could not move them, I desire them not to spare me in this present subject of <hi>Miracles,</hi> wherein I profess to relye on the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of their own Writers; if they shew me any wilful mistakes therein, I will endeavour to give them publick satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Were I not well assured, <hi>My Lord,</hi> of the <hi>Strength</hi> of my <hi>Evidence,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Goodness</hi> of my <hi>Cause,</hi> I should never have appeared in it before a <hi>Person</hi> of so sharp and piercing a Judgement as Your <hi>Lordship.</hi> But I have the rather presumed to offer this Discourse into Your <hi>Lordships</hi> hands,
<pb facs="tcp:49657:6"/>
and to send it abroad under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Your Name, not only thereby to acknowledge the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Favours I have received from Your <hi>Lordship;</hi> but to thank You on a more publick Account, I mean for Your late generous owning the <hi>Cause</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> in so Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a time; which not only gives a present Lustre to Your Name, but will preserve it with Honour to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>An Answer to the Guide in Controversies about Infallibility, and the Resolution of Faith.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Â§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two great Pleas for <note place="margin">The state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and the Resolution of Faith.</note> the necessity of Infallibility in the Roman Church, one to make an end of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, the other to lay a sufficient Foundation for divine Faith. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore fully examined the former Plea in the foregoing discourse, I shall now proceed to the latter; with a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to those Adversaries, who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Defence of the Cause of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> against me in this Controversie. And because all this dispute refers to the Principles of Faith, I shall undertake to shew,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:49657:9"/>
1. That the Principles laid down by them are false and fallacious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Protestant Principles defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me are sound and true.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the better examination of their Principles, I shall give a brief account of the Rise and State of this Controversie about the Grounds of Faith. The Arch-Bishops Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary in Conference with him, asked <hi>how he knew the Scripture to be the Word of God,</hi> hoping thereby to drive him to the necessity of owning <hi>the Infallible Testimony of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Roman Church:</hi> but he failed so much of his end, that the Arch-Bishop fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <q>that such a Testimony could not be the Foundation of that Faith, whereby we believe the Scriptures, to be the Word of God; and that there are sufficient Grounds for Faith without it. One of the great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments whereby he disproved that way of Resolving Faith was, that it was impossible to avoid a vitious circle in proving the Churches infallibility by Scripture, and the Scripture by the Infallible Testimony of the Church.</q> This difficulty, which hath puzled the greatest Wits of the Roman Church, his Answerer thought to avoid by saying, <hi>that the Churches Infallibility was not primarily proved by the Scripture, but by the Motives of Credibility which belong to the</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:49657:9"/>
                  <hi>Church in the same manner that Moses and the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles were proved to be Infallible.</hi> Which bold asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obliged me in a large discourse to shew these three things. 1. That this way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving Faith was manifestly unreasonable. 2. That supposing it true he could not avoid the circle by it. 3. That it was false and built on no other ground but a daring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first I proved. 1. Because an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is hereby required beyond all proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or degree of evidence; the Assent requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red being Infallible and the evidence only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and prudential Motives. 2. Because hereby they must run into all the Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they would seek to avoid, it being impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to give a better account of Faith by the Infallibility of the Roman Church, than we can do without it; both sides acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that those Motives of Credibility do hold for the Scriptures, which are by us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to belong to their Church; and if faith as to the Scriptures be uncertain if it rely on them, much more must it be so as to the Churches Infallibility: If divine Faith as to the Scriptures can rest upon motives of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, there can be no necessity of the Churches Infallibility to a divine faith; if it cannot, how come those motives to be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:49657:10"/>
ground for such a Faith as to the Church? For the Churches Infallibility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reason as to them of believing the things contained in the Scripture, it ought to be believed with a faith equally divine with that whereby we are to believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which are the instrument of conveyin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> bring for the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> Infallibility. And when they have brought men to it they cannot assure them what that Church is which they attribute this Infallibility to who in that Church are the proper subjects of it; what kind of Infallibility it is; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> when the Church doth define Infallibly: so many things are to be believed without reason, both as the persons who are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:49657:10"/>
and the manner of their definitions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Supposing this way true, the Circle still remains: which I proved by three things. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>. From the nature of the faith they enquire for a resolution of, which is not humane but Divine Faith. For the Question was not, whether by another kind of Assent they could not escape the circle; but whether they could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>o it in the resolution of Divine Faith or not? Either then the Churches Infallibility is not to be believed with a Divine Faith, or there may be a Divine Faith without an Infallible Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or this Divine Faith of the Churches Infallibility, must be built on the Scripture, and so the Circle returns. 2. From the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose faith is to be resolved; the way of resolving faith being a different thing from proving a matter of Faith to an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; granting then that to those who deny the Churches Infallibility, but allow the Scriptures, they may prove the one by the other yet this signifies nothing to the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of their own Faith, which is the thing enquired after: and yet even in proving to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> they cannot avoid the Circle, when the Question returns about the sense of those places; for then they must run to the Church; because the Church which is Infallible hath delivered this to be the sense of them.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:49657:11"/>
3. From the nature of that Infallibility which they attribute to the Church, which being not by immediate divine Revelation, but by a Supernatural Assistance promised in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it is impossible to prove this Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but by first proving the truth of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That Divine Faith must rest upon Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2.

If it be the same it can offer no reason for my Faith, unless the same thing may be proved by it self; if it be different, then God makes use of particular divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations to men different from his publick, into which they are to resolve their Faith. Suppose then the Question be thus put, why
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:49657:15"/>
do you believe that Christ shall come to judge the quick and the dead? The general Answer is, because God that cannot lie hath revealed it; but then the Question returns on what ground do you believe this Revelation to have been from God with such a divine Faith as must rest upon divine Revelation? For such you assert to be necessary.

But to assert an assent in Faith so immediate, of which no motive or reason can be assigned proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it, is a thing repugnant to the nature of our reasonable faculties, and it is to make one of the noblest acts of our understandings a meer blind and bruitish assent. All that

the Apostolical Tradition must be believed by divine faith, and the belief of it comes by the Churches Infallibility; whether any other Infallibility can secure such a faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Infallibility by Promise; for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility asserted being a security from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by divine Assistance, and that assistance only supposed to be promised in Scripture, there can be no other Infallibility here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood but that; which Infallibility by his own assertion must be believed by divine faith, which divine Faith must rest upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation; and so he believes the sense of Scripture because of the Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, and the Churches Infallibility by Apostolical Tradition, and Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by the Churches Infallibility, and the Churches Infallibility by the sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.

W.</hi> laid down.</note> in <hi>Controversies,</hi> I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my self to the <hi>Rule;</hi> no <hi>Fancies, Toys, Trifles,</hi> or <hi>Fallible Glosses,</hi> I assure you, for those <hi>E.

O what a pestilent Heretick is this <hi>Stillingfleet!</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves so many lashes beyond <hi>Atheists, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:49657:26"/>
                  <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Turks!</hi> If he had been any one of those, he might have been gently used, for never were they fairlier dealt with by any man that undertook them. But he is not so much their Friend to thank him for this kind usage: and <hi>E. W.</hi> thinks he will have enough to do to defend himself. I confess I think so too, if either of his Books against me, were to be thrown at my head; for they are very thick and as heavy as is possible. And to my great comfort, I never yet saw two such bulky books, whose substance might be brought into a less compass; for setting aside Tautologies and tedious repetitions, frequent excursions and impertinent digressions the pith and marrow of both his Books lies in this one word Infallibility. But it is time to fall to my business, for fear of more <hi>Advertisements;</hi> and Infallibility being the main design of his Books, that shall be the subject of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent debate with him. And because this <hi>E. W.</hi> is a great pretender to <hi>Principles;</hi> the method I shall proceed in shall be first to consider his Principles, and then to defend my own. For which I shall chiefly make use of his last Book, it being in effect but another edition of his former, the other as I suppose being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed of to better purposes than to be read; for I never heard of one person in England that read it over. However, what there is
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:49657:26"/>
material in it, different from the last, as to the present controversie, I shall upon occasion take notice of.</p>
               <p>The two main Principles he builds upon are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That without an Infallible Church, there can be no certainty of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Roman-Catholick Church is this Infallible Church.</p>
               <p>If he can prove these two, he shall not need any more to establish their Religion, or to overthrow ours. And I will say that for his praise that he hath brought the controversie into a narrow compass; for he confesses it is endless to dispute out of Scripture and Fathers, since witty men by their <hi>fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ble, Glosses</hi> can turn and winde them which way they please, but there is nothing so stiff and inflexible as a standing infallible Oracle in the Church, which being once believed all Controversie is at an end. But we may as soon hope to see all other controversies ended by dry blows, as this <hi>Principle</hi> proved to the satisfaction of any reasonable man.</p>
               <p>The main proofs for the necessity of the Churches Infallibility, which he insists upon are these. 1. <hi>That there can be no Divine Faith without it.</hi> 2. <hi>There can be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as to the Canon, or edition, or sense of Scripture.</hi> 3. <hi>There can be as little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:49657:27"/>
                  <hi>as to the sense of the Fathers or the Primitive Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there can be no divine Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</hi> This he frequently insists upon in both his Books; and with so much vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as <hi>to make the deniers of Infallibility to overthrow all Faith and Religion.</hi> Which being a charge of the highest nature, ought to be made good by the clearest evidence. Whether that which <hi>E. W.</hi> produces, be so I shall leave any one to judge, when I have given an Account of his Principles as to this matter. In his first Book called <hi>Protestancy without Principles,</hi> he begins with this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and lays down these assertions, upon which all his Discourse is built.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Gods infallible Revelation requires an infallible Assent of Faith; or an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble verity revealed to us forcibly requires an answerable and correspondent infallible as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Faith in us: the contrary</hi> he calls <hi>wild Doctrine; this subjective infallibility,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>he offers very wisely to prove from those places of Scripture, which speak of the assurance which Christians had of the truth of their Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This infallible assent of Faith doth require infallible Teachers; for infallible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and infallible Teachers are correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi> And in the second Chapter, he goes
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:49657:27"/>
about to prove it, <hi>because, if Christs infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrine be only fallibly taught, no man hath certainty what it is; and seeing what is fallible may be false, Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may not be taught at all; which is infallible and cannot be false; and he that should abjure this fallible Doctrine, doth not deny therein Christs Doctrine, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be upon that account an Heretick.</hi> But to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Disc.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. p. 24, 27.</note> make Faith Infallible, he asserts, <hi>That every Preacher sent by the infallible Church, as a member conjoyned with it, is infallible in his Teaching: and on the contrary, whosoever renounces an Infallible society cannot teach with certainty Christs infallible Doctrine. From whence</hi> he saith, <hi>follows an utter ruine of Christian Religion.</hi> In his third Chapter he further proves, <hi>That if the Church were fallible in her Teaching, God would oblige us to believe a falsity; because God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands men to hear the Church, and if the Church may erre, then men are obliged to believe a false Doctrine taught by her. And all other means short of this Infallibility would be insufficient for preserving Christian Religion in the world.</hi> In the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he comes to <hi>a particular consideration of divine Faith, and from thence proves the necessity of infallibility. Faith,</hi> saith he, <hi>requires two things essentially, an object</hi>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:49657:28"/>
                  <hi>which is Gods Revelation, and a Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this object; by Vertue of which the elicit act of Faith follows in a believer, and intellectually lays as it were hold, both o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Gods Revelation and the thing revealed.</hi> Now to prove the necessity of such an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proposition in order to divine Faith, ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> lays down some abstruse Propositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Gods infallible Revelation avail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the measure and degrees of certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the assent are according to those which the Proponent gives to the Revelation. If he teaches doubtfully, the assent is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if probably, the assent is probable, is infallibly, the assent is infallible:</hi> the reason which he gives of this, is, <hi>because an object revealed receives its light from the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, as an object of sight doth from the light of the air. As long therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>as the infallibility of a Revelation stands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from me, for want of an undoubted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication made by an infallible proponent, it can no more transfuse certainty into Faith, than Fire at a great distance warm; that is, no more than if it were not certain in it self, or not at all in Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:49657:28"/>
3. <hi>From hence</hi> he saith, <hi>it follows that Protestants can only doubtfully guess at what they are to believe, and consequently never yet had nor can have Divine, certain and infallible Faith. Because they cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>rom inferiour motives can have. For all Moral Certainty is at least capable of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and may deceive us: Gods infallible veracity cannot be false nor deceive if Faith rest upon that Motive, and if it rest not there, it is no Faith at all. Nay he asserts, that supernatural Faith is more certain and infallible, than all the Metaphysical Sciences which nature can give us;</hi> For which he gives this plain reason, <hi>Because the infinite veracity of God which only supporteth Faith with greater force, energy, and necessity transfuseth into it, a supereminent insalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, supereminent,</hi> he saith, <hi>and above all</hi>

But of this subject at large after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. At present it may suffice to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. 1. That no proposition of Faith is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed sufficient by <hi>E. W. but where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent doth work Miracles:</hi> and therefore we may safely question the Churches Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition till we see such Miracles wrought by her, as were by Christ and his Apostles. <hi>For thus,</hi> saith he, <hi>Christ our Lord Sent by</hi>

                  <hi>his Eternal Father, thus the Apostles sent by Christ and the Church ever since (all shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

For if their Church work such miracles as Christ and his Apostles did to attest their divine commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the evidence from thence to believe her infallibility ought to over rule the opinions of such who say she hath erred; in case the doctrine attested by Christ and his Apostles and that of the Roman Church do not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict each other. 2. Although this exterior Proponent prove himself so commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned yet by the Progress of Faith laid down by <hi>E. W.</hi> this is not enough to beget an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty of Faith. <hi>For,</hi> he saith, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the exteriour proposition only a natural apprehension of their credibility succeeds; then a judgement of credibility, then the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Will; but yet no infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty till the illustration of Divine Grace comes.</hi> So that it evidently follows according to <hi>E.

                  <hi>if it be defensible it's impossible to declare, how Faith it self or the illustration previous, can proceed from the Holy Ghost. For did the Spirit of God work with a soul, when it believes, the certainty of Faith, would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, go beyond that assurance, which is only humane, moral and fallible.</hi> I think that I escape well, that <hi>E. W.</hi> hath not transcribed a great part of <hi>Bradwardin de CausÃ¢ Dei</hi> against me; for I plainly see, he takes me for an Absolute Free Willer, and a denier of the Grace of God. It is true indeed, I set aside the consideration of Divine Grace in this matter, but I assure him, not that I questioned the Truth or necessity
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49657:34"/>
of it; but because it was not pertinent to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his business. For to what purpose should we argue about that which can only serve for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Not opposing this <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> to the <hi>concurrence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace,</hi> but to an <hi>external infallible Proponent.</hi> I took it then for granted on both sides, that the Grace of Faith doth not come meerly from <hi>our selves,</hi> but that <hi>it is the Gift of God,</hi> that whereever God doth immediately concur he doth direct the mind to the belief of what is certainly True, that there might be unaccountable ways, whereby an inward certainty might be produced, and so firm an adherence to the Truth believed, which all the arguments and torments in the world could never shake, of which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Martyrs were undeniable Instances; But this internal perswasion could be made no matter of debate, nor any argument to convince another, any further than the effects of it did manifest that it came from God:
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:49657:35"/>
yet withal I did not Question, but faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an act of the mind of man which is rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and discursive, had sufficient grounds to proceed upon, and such which without any absurdity might justifie mens belief to any prudent or considerative men, and to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest enquiries of a mans own mind. Now concerning these Grounds the Question was put by me; taking in then the efficiency o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Divine Grace, this is the true state of the Controversie, whether the spirit of God may not by moral arguments work in mens minds such a certain assent of Faith, as the Scripture requires for Salvation? or whether in order thereto, an Infallible Testimony of the Church be necessary? But because the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the operation of the Holy Ghost doth rather perplex the controversie, than explain it; since this was granted on both sides, I thought it better to leave it out and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the dispute as it ought to be only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the necessity of an infallible Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church, which is asserted by my Adversaries, and denied by me.</p>

of attacking it, (of which a short account is given in the entrance of this Discourse,) I must now more largely defend.</p>
               <p>I shewed this way to be unreasonable: and that upon these grounds,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because an assent is hereby required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all proportion or degree of evidence for the act of Faith being according to <hi>E.

And it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to say, that the Infallibility of the Churches Testimony makes the Assent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; for Assent is not according to the objective certitude of things, but the evidence of them to our understanding.

Nay sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that Person Infallible in saying so, yet if the other hath no means to be Infallibly assured that he is so, his Assent is as doubtful as if he were not Infallible: Therefore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Testimony of the Roman Church to be really Infallible, yet since the means of

believing it are but probable and prudential' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Assent cannot be according to the nature of the Testimony considered in it self, but according to the reasons which induce me to believe such a Testimony Infallible. And in all such cases, where I believe one thing for the sake of another, my Assent to the object believed is according to my Assent to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium on which I believe it. As our light is not according to the light in the body of the Sun, but that which presseth on our Organs of Sense. So that supposing their Churches Testimony to be Infallible in it self, if one may be deceived in judging whether it be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible or no, one may be deceived in such things which he believes on that supposed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. It being impossible, that the assent to the matters of faith, should rise higher, or stand firmer than the assent to the Testimony upon which those things are believed. But now to prove the Churches infallibility, they make use only of the motives of credibility, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves grant can be the foundation only of a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible assent.

And therefore all the fault of these men does not lie barely in making the assent to be more certain than the motives of Faith; but in requiring so strictly in one act of Faith a proportionable certainty to the assent and not in another. For what is there I beseech <hi>E.

               <p n="3">3. The main thing is to consider what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the evidence of credibility hath upon the act of faith? For <hi>E. W.</hi> asserts <hi>that all that results from thence is only a judgement of credibility, but that the act of faith it self relies wholly upon other principles;</hi> and by the help of the distinction of these two he labours to avoid the force of my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus then the matter stands, it is agreed that faith must have rational proofs antecedent to it, but these proofs he must say do not perswade men to believe, or which is all one, have no influence upon the act of Faith. If all that were meant by this talk were only this, that we are then said properly to believe when we fix our assent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods testimony, but that all acts of the mind short of this may not properly be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed believing, but by some other name, this would presently appear to be a controversie about words, which I perfectly hate. But
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:49657:49"/>
more must be understood by such men as <hi>E. W.</hi> or else they do not speak at all to the purpose; for the Question is, whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring an infallible assent of faith to the Churches Infallibility upon motives confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly fallible, an assent be not required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all proportion or degree of evidence? to this he answers, <hi>that this argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon ignorance of the nature of faith which doth not discourse as Science doth: and he grants that the motives of credibility have not the same certainty that faith hath.</hi> What then can hence follow, but that faith is an unreasonable assent, and hath no grounds; or that it may be stronger than the grounds it proceeds upon? But if it appear, that faith must have grounds, and that the assent of faith can be no stronger than the grounds are, then it follows that they are very unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in requiring an infallible assent of faith to the Churches Infallibility barely upon the motives of credibility.</p>
               <p>Â§. 7. 1. That faith must have grounds, <note place="margin">Of the grounds of faith.</note> If a man had not to deal with persons who have confounded their own understandings with an appearance of subtilty, one would think this as needless a task as to prove that man is a reasonable creature; for if faith be an assent of the mind, taking it as strictly
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:49657:49"/>
and properly as they please, it must have the nature of a rational act, which it cannot have unless it proceeds upon reasonable grounds. The grounds I grant are different in several assents, but it must always have some. Those which are accounted the most immediate assents have the clearest and most evident reason, such as the assents to first principles are, as that the whole is greater than the part. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for conclusions drawn from them, the readiness and firmness of the assent is proportionable to the evidence of their connexion with those principles from whence they are drawn. In other things that depend upon the evidence of sense, the reason of our assent to the truth of them, is from the supposition of the truth of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and that we are so framed as not to be imposed upon, in matters that are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with due circumstances conveyed to our minds by our Organs of sense. But if there appear an evidence of reason overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the certainty of sense, <hi>Scepticism</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follows and the suspension of all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the truth of things conveyed by our senses; for no man can then be certain of any thing by the evidence of sense, but only of the <hi>appearance</hi> of things. I may be certain, that things do appear with such difference of colours, and tasts, and smells; but I cannot
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:49657:50"/>
be certain that there are really such differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the things themselves. If therefore the <hi>Scepticks</hi> arguments should prevail upon any mans mind so far, as to make him questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether sense be a certain <hi>medium</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the truth of the things to his mind, it is impossible that man should yield a firm assent to the truth of any thing on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the evidence of sense. So that still, assent proceeds upon the grounds of reason which satisfie the mind, that all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces considered it ought not to suspend any longer. Let us now consider such things which are not so evident of themselves, nor conveyed by our senses; and unless we distrust all mankind we have reason to believe some things to be which we never saw our selves, and this is the fundamental ground of that we call believing; which is nothing else, but <hi>taking truth upon trust;</hi> or receiving a thing as true upon such testimony which I see no reason to question. If I see any reason to doubt either the skill or fidelity of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon whose credit I am to rely; it is impossible for me firmly to believe upon their Authority; if I see none, then on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I believe what they say; wherein it is as evident that my assent is according to the grounds I proceed upon, as that two and two make four. What is it then that hath thus
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:49657:50"/>
confounded these mens minds, to make them to contend that the act of divine faith is of such a nature that nothing like it is to be found in any other act of the mind? Must we cease to be men by being Christians? or where the strongest reason is most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, must there be none at all? to what end then were there arguments ever used to perswade men to believe Christianity? were those ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments able to perswade men or not? if they were, then men did believe upon the strength of those arguments; and is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for men to believe upon the strength of arguments and yet those arguments have no influence upon the act of faith? This is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible nonsense and fit only for those to write who believe contradictions; for such an act of faith indeed can have no reason for it. But to come closer yet to our matter: <hi>The Churches infallibility is to be believed,</hi> saith <hi>E. W. with divine faith;</hi> is there any ground for that act of faith, or not? If there be none, shew what obligation to believe there can be, where there is no ground for it: if there be, I desire to know, whether they are able to perswade me or not; if not, shew then why I ought to believe on insufficient grounds; if they be, may not I then believe upon those grounds? and if I do, doth not that act of faith rely upon those grounds<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:49657:51"/>
Besides, of those who plead for the necessity of the Churches infallibility, I desire to know on what account they do it? Is it not, that faith may have a sufficient Foundation to be built upon, which in their opinion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without such infallibility? and yet after all this, must not faith stand upon this ground? Why then are, <hi>Scotus, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi>

Upon these grounds a skilful Painter may make a shift to bungle and to draw some rude uneven strokes by the help of his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and a good light; but if he would be sure not to miss making an excellent Piece he ought to shut his eyes or darken his Room, for then to be sure that fallible thing called

But of all things I wonder if this be the whole nature of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith to believe no man knows why nor wherefore, (for if he doth, his faith ceases to be faith being built upon reason) why all this ado is kept about an infallible Church and motives of credibility? cannot a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without reason at first as well at last? cannot faith fix upon Gods Revelation for it self, without troubling those motives of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility to no purpose? If a man hath a mind to leap blindfold from a Precipice, why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he do it without so much ceremony? must he have all his attendance about him, and his Gentleman-usher to conduct him to the very brink of the Rock, and there bid him Goodnight? If all these motives of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility contribute nothing to the act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, what use are they of in such a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where Faith is look'd on as the great Principle of practice and the means of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:49657:54"/>
we believe other things which are uncapable of being seen by our senses, as the Joys of Heaven and the Torments of Hell; and as to such things faith supplies the want of the Evidence of sense to us; and by it our minds are assured of the truth of them though we do not or cannot see them. Which is all that is intended by this description of faith; but how doth it hence follow that our faith must be an <hi>immediate, inevident, obscure assent,</hi> on which all the arguments that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men to believe, can have no influence? May not I believe that Christ died and rose again, and will come to judge the quick and the dead, because I see all the reason in the world to perswade me to believe it, from the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of those who saw him and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his doctrine to us, and have given the greatest evidence of their fidelity? Doth the strength of the argument hinder me at all from believing what I did not see? I had rather thought the more obscure the object had been, (for it is little better than nonsense to call <hi>an act of faith obscure),</hi> the greater necessity there had been of strong evidence to perswade a man to believe; not such evidence as doth arise from the nature of the thing, for that is contrary to the obscurity of the object, but such as gives the greatest reason to believe from the Authority of those on whose Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:49657:55"/>
I rely. So that the greatest clearness and evidence as to the Testimony is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the nature of Faith; this only shews that in Christian Religion we do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> proceed by meer evidence of sense or rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous demonstrations in the things we assent to; but that the great things we believe are remote from sense and received upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Revealer; yet so, as that we assert we have as great evidence that these things were revealed by God, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was capable of; and such evidence we say ought to perswade any prudent person. This is all which the description of faith so much alledged doth imply; which was never intended for an accurate definition of it; for as <hi>Hugo de sancto Victore</hi> saith of it, <hi>non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat quid est fides, sed signat quid facit;</hi> it doth not shew what faith is, but what it doth; by making things future and invisible to have as great power and influence on mens minds as if they were present and visible. And when the <hi>Fathers</hi> speak of the obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith, they do not mean an assent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grounds, but the belief of things out of our view; and that obscurity is understood by them in comparison with the clearness of a future state: or in opposition to the way of proving things by meer reason without Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. So <hi>Cardinal Lugo</hi> truly answers the

Testimonies of Fathers to that purpose, by saying <hi>that when they exclude reason and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>

                  <hi>from faith they take them as they are opposed to Authority; but in as much as they suppose the mysteries of Christian faith to be believed for the sake of Divine Revelation, a discourse is thereby implied from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God revealing to the mysteries belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Neither is such <hi>discourse</hi> only requisite, but that in the first place which doth assure men of the truth of this Revelation; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, the other must proceed.

                  <hi>is incompatible with that merit and obsequiousness of faith; which God requires of his rational creatures who are to walk to Heaven by an humble and dutiful faith.</hi> A very <hi>humble saith</hi> certainly that hopes to <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> by believing! And very <hi>dutiful</hi> in expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so large a reward for doing it knows not

what! We think it our duty to believe firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatever God saith; but withal we think it our duty to enquire carefully whether God hath said it or no before we believe: and according to the evidence we have of this we assent to the former. <hi>But this is not to proceed Nobly with God,</hi> saith <hi>E. W.</hi> Brave man! It hath been reported of a <hi>Hector</hi> in this Town that a little before his death he said <hi>he hoped God would deal with him like a Gentleman:</hi> It seems <hi>E.

We poor creatures, are contented to do our duties, and take it as a great Favour, for God to accept of the best we can do: We dare not so much as think of such terms of kindness and favour from us to God, as <hi>to proceed Nobly with him.</hi> Neither do we believe, that God is so hugely pleased with the blind and the lame, when they are offered in sacrifice to him. Whatever <hi>E. W.</hi> imagines, it is no such <hi>Noble proceeding</hi> to believe infallibly upon confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly fallible grounds. For that is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case, he grants that the motives of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility are not infallible, and that there are no other motives in order to faith above these, and yet he supposes we ought to oblige
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:49657:56"/>
God by giving an infallible assent upon these Motives. But the bottom of all is <hi>That our Faith ought to be suitable to Gods infallible veracity, which Faith immediately rests up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and from whence and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rom the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, infallible certainty</hi> as <hi>E W.</hi> speaks, <hi>is transfused into it.</hi> This deep speculation by no means satisfies me; for though I know it to be impossible for God to lie or to deceive; yet our question is not about believing the truth of what God saith, but about believing this or that to be revealed by him. And while the Question is whether Gods vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city be concerned in the thing, how is it possible for his <hi>Veracity to transfuse an Infallible Certainty into my Belief of it?</hi> Suppose <hi>E. W.</hi> be acquainted with as honest a man as ever lived, and one comes and tells him from him that such a Friend of his was dead, and gave him five hundred pound; I would fain know whether the unquestionable veracity of the Friend, from whom the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger saith he received it, can transfuse an unquestionable certainty in his mind of the truth of the thing, while he is yet in doubt whether his faithful Friend said it or no? If his assent here be not according to the veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Friend, unless he be first assured of the fidelity of the reporter; No more can it be in the present case of believing. For no
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:49657:57"/>
one questions what God saith, but our only doubt is whether God hath said it; and whilst one gives no infallible assent to the one, he cannot infallibly rest upon the other. <hi>But may not credible arguments as to the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be sufficient for infallible belief of the thing upon the Authority of the other?</hi> For that, I appeal to <hi>E. W.</hi> whether his belief of the thing would not in that case be according to the grounds he had to believe the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? and the Authority of his Friend would make him so much the more Question whether his name might not be abused by a Person that had a design to put a trick upon him; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if that Messenger challenged to himself so much credit that he ought to be believed without any dispute at a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>l. For in this case, the over eager affirming would give a man cause to question the more the truth of the person, if his evidence bear no proportion with his confidence. So it is in our present case: it is granted on all sides, if God reveals any thing it must be true: our enquiry is how far we are to believe that God hath said such a thing upon the credit of those who convey it to us; if they desire no more credit with us than they give sufficient evidence for, then we are bound to believe them; but if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act an infallible assen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> and offer only fallible grounds we have reason to mistrust their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:49657:57"/>
and so long as we do so, we must questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the thing which we are to believe upon their credit. If they require only an assent suitable to their evidence it would be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to deny it, but still the degree of our assent to the Revelation is proportionable to the degree of evidence that it is a divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Which Dr. <hi>Holden</hi> thinks to be so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he accounts it lost labour for a man <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Holden</hi> Analys. fidei l. 1. c. 3.</note> to go about to prove it to any one that hath common sense: <hi>viz. That no assent of divine Faith can have any greater true and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal certainty, than the assent of the medium hath, by which the object of Faith is applied to the understanding. For whatever cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty we can attribute to an intellectual as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent upon the Authority of God revealing it is necessary it should come from and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the certainty of the medium, by which this Authority of God revealing is conveyed to the understanding. For as it is impossible that a man should believe or yield assent to any thing because it is revealed by God, unless he thinks and knows that God hath revealed it; so it is impossible that he should believe the things revealed by God with greater true and rational certainty, than that by which he knows that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them. For whatever degree of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or doubt there is in the mind of a</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:49657:58"/>
                  <hi>believer of the certainty and truth of the medium, there must be the same in that assent whereby he believes the things which are proposed by that medium. Because with what degree a man doubts whether God hath revealed this or that, he cannot but doubt in the same degree of that which is said to be revealed by God. For what man in his wits doth not presently perceive that no man can be more certain of that thing which God is said to reveal, than he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that God hath revealed it; as no man can be more certain of the things done by</hi> Caesar, <hi>than they are that</hi> Caesar <hi>was; or of the mysteries revealed by Christ, than that Christ was. This he saith he had never mentioned, unless some later Divines,</hi> (such as <hi>E. W.) discoursing vainly and Sceptically, and not considering the true reason of believing, had feigned to themselves he knew not what kind of divine and supernatural certainty in Christian Faith (passing by the true and rational) which it is clearer than noon day, is but an idle and imaginary thing.</hi> Good Reader, observe the power of reason over an ingenuous mind; I know not what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment Dr. <hi>H.</hi> might have given <hi>E. W.</hi> on other accounts; but it is plain by this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course he thought <hi>a dark Room</hi> the fittest for him, since he pronounces <hi>that no man in his</hi>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:49657:58"/>
                  <hi>senses can assert the things which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently doth.</hi> Although therefore he thought this needless to be proved, yet I must proceed to shew,</p>
               <p>Â§. 9. 2. That the Assent of Faith can be <note place="margin">Of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Will in the assent of Faith.</note> no stronger than the Grounds are. For if it doth proceed upon Grounds, those are of the nature of Premises and the assent of faith as the conclusion drawn from them, and therefore must be stronger or weaker accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them. In every act of Faith which hath a particular Revelation for its object; there must be two distinct premises conceived from whence that which is the proper act of believing follows. As suppose the Question be concerning the Resurrection of the dead, why I believe that article of Faith to be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ue, the present Answer is because God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it; but therein lies the force of a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism, by which it will appear that the act of Faith follows as the conclusion from the premises. Whatsoever God reveals is true, but God hath revealed the Resurrection of the dead, therefore it is true. Now since the force of a conclusion depends upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, the assent of Faith cannot be supposed stronger and firmer than the Premises are from which it results. For however it may hold in other causes; in those which are moral and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:49657:59"/>
final, it is an undoubted Maxim of reason, <hi>That which makes an other thing to be so, must be much more so it self:</hi> As that end which makes any thing desirable for its sake, is much more desirable it self, because it is that which moves the Soul to desire the means; and so it is likewise in whatever moves the understanding to assent as well as the will to desire: but the Premises do move the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to assent to the conclusion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the consent to the conclusion must be agreeable to that of the Premises. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty hath so racked and tormented the minds of the Schoolmen, that <hi>Arriaga</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <hi>he hath heard the most Learned and</hi>

                  <hi>Ingenious among them profess they could find no way through it. While they did require an infallible assent in the conclusion, when there could be no infallible assent to one of the Premises,</hi> viz. <hi>that God hath revealed this.</hi> Which some have thought they got over when they asserted <hi>the necessity of the Churches Infallibility,</hi> as the foundation of that assent. But granting them the truth of that, yet they have given the difficulty but one remove by it, for it speedily returns again, concerning the belief of the Churches Infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:49657:59"/>
prove it. And so at last they are fain to take up with other Answers, which make the Churches Infallible Proposition of no use at all in this matter: for if the assent be said to be <hi>immediate to the Revelation,</hi> if the strength of it arises either from <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> or the <hi>pious inclination of the Will,</hi> and not from the motives of Faith, if any of these waies can solve the difficulty; then however from hence it follows that all these will equally do it without ever so much as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the <hi>necessity of the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Testimony.</hi> I shall not now trouble my self with others, but consider my Adversary who after making several attempts this way and that, at last bethinks of a good Friend in a corner, called <hi>the Power of the Will,</hi> and to this he is willing <hi>to attribute the strength of the assent, when it exceeds the motives of</hi>

Besides, this takes away any such thing as the formal object of divine Faith; for if the Infallible assent of Faith do come from the power of the Will; then to what purpose is any formal object of that assent enquired after? For the formal object doth assign a reason of believing from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it self, of which there can be none if the Will by her own Power elicit that which is the proper assent of Faith. And all other material objects of Faith may be believed in as infallible a manner by the same power of the Will.

dictate to the Will to desire a thing beyond the degree of goodness appearing to it; and by this means both those faculties would tend to their objects in a way disagreeing to their nature.</p>

What then, say I, will become of the Faith of all those who received Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations, without the Infallible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of any Church at all? With what Faith did the Disciples of Christ at the time of his suffering, believe the Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Old Testament? was it a true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith or not? If it was whereon was it built? Not certainly on the Infallible Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Jewish Church, which at that time consented to the death of the Messias, condemning him as a Malefactor and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver: Or did they believe it because of the great rational evidence they had to convince them, that those Prophesies came from God? If so, why may not we believe the Divinity of all the Scriptures on the same grounds and with a Divine Faith too? With what Faith did those believe in the Messias who were not personally present at the Miracles which our Saviour wrought, but had them conveyed to them by such reports as the womans of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:49657:61"/>
was to the <hi>Samaritans?</hi> Or were all such persons excused from believing, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not spectators? But by the same reason all those would be excused, who never saw our Saviours Miracles, or heard his Doctrine or his Apostles: but if such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons then were bound to believe, I ask on what Testimony was their Faith founded? Was the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> Infallible in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Discourse between Christ and her? Were all the persons Infallible who gave an account to others of what Christ did? Yet I suppose, had it been your own case, you would have thought your self bound to have believed Christ to have been the Messias, if you had lived at that time, and a certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count had been given you of our Saviours Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Miracles by men faithful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, though you had no reason to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them infallible: I pray, Sir, answer me, would you have thought your self bound to have believed or no? If you affirm it (as I will suppose you so much a Christian as to say so) I pray then tell me whether persons in those circumstances might not have a true and divine Faith where there was no infallible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, but only Rational Evidence to build it self upon? And if those Persons might have a divine Faith upon such evidence as that was, may not we much more who have
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:49657:62"/>

                  </gap> assert an Infallible Testimony of the conveyers of divine Revelation to be necessary in order to a divine Faith? Nay further yet, how few were there in comparison, in the first Ages of the Christian Church, who received the Doctrine of the Gospel from the mouths of persons Infallible? and of those who did so, what certain evidence have men, that all those persons did receive the Doctrine upon the account of the Infallibility of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders, and not rather upon the Rational evidence of the Truth of the Doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and whether the belief of their Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility was absolutely necessary to Faith, when the report of the evidences of the Truth of the Doctrine might raise in them an obligation to believe, supposing them not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in that delivery of it, but that they looked on them as honest men, who faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully related what they had seen and heard? and to which evidence of sense the Apostles and Evangelists appealed; so that when there <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 1. 2 Pet. 1. 16. Luk. 1. 1, 2</note> was certainly an infallible Testimony, yet that is not urged as the only Foundation for Faith, but Rational Evidence produced even by those Persons who were thus infallible, If we descend lower in the Christian Church,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:49657:62"/>
or walk abroad to view the several Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Churches at that time, where do we read or meet with the least intimation of an Infallible Testimony of the Catholick Church, so called from its Communion with that of <hi>Rome?</hi> What Infallible Testimony of that Church had the poor <hi>Britains</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on? Or those <hi>Barbarians</hi> mentioned in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who yet believed without a written Word? What mention do we meet with in all the ancient Apologeticks of Christians wherein they give so large an account of the grounds of Christian Faith, of the modern method for resolving Faith? Nay, what one ancient Father or Council give the least coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to this pretended Infallibility, much less make it the only sure Foundation of Faith as you do? Nay how very few are there among your selves who believe it, and yet think themselves never the worse Christians for it? If then your Doctrine be true what becomes of the Faith of all these persons mentioned? Upon your principles their Faith could not be true and Divine Faith; that is, let them all think they believed the Doctrine of Christ never so heartily, and obey it never so conscientiously; yet because they did not believe on the Infallibility of your Church, their Faith was but a kind of guilded and splendid infidelity, and none of them Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:49657:63"/>
because not Jesuits. And doth not this principle then fairly advance Christianity in the world, when the belief of it comes to be settled on Foundations, never heard of in the best and purest times of it; nay such Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, as for want of their believing them, their Faith must be all in vain, and Christ dyed in vain for them.</p>

yet for such persons who either morally or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly are hindred from this capacity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining Scripture, there may be sufficient means for their Faith to be built upon. For although such illiterate persons cannot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves see and read the Scripture, yet as many as do believe do receive the Doctrine of it by that sense, by which Faith is conveyed; and by that means they have so great certainty as excludes all doubting, that such Doctrines and such matters of Fact are contained in these Books, by which they come to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the nature of this Doctrine and are capable of judging concerning the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it. For the Light spoken of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not a light to the eye but to the mind; now the mind is capable of this light, as well by the ear, as by the eyes. The case then of such honest illiterate persons, as are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reading Scripture, but diligently and devoutly hear it read to them, is much of the same nature with those who heard the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Preach this Doctrine before it was writ. For whatever was an Argument to such to believe the Apostles in what they spake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an Argument to such who hear the same things, which are certainly conveyed to us, by an unquestionable Tradition: So that nothing hinders but such illiterate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may resolve their Faith into the same

Doctrine and Motives which others do, only those are conveyed to <hi>them</hi> by the <hi>ear,</hi> which are conveyed to <hi>others</hi> by the <hi>eyes.</hi> But if you suppose persons so rude and illiterate, as not to understand any thing, but that they are to believe as the Church believes; do you if you can, resolve their Faith for them; for my part I cannot, and am so far from it that I have no reason to believe they can have any.

                  <hi>the first man that believed in Christ our Lord before the compleat establishment of his Church had perfect faith resting on that great Master of Truth, without dependance on the Christian Church, for Christ alone was not the Church, but the Head of it. Faith therefore in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral requires no more, but only to rely upon God the first verity speaking by this or that Oracle, by one or more men lawfully sent to teach, who prove their mission and make the doctrine proposed by them evidently credible. In like manner the Apostles preached no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the name of the new Christian Church, whilst our Saviour lived here on earth, but testified that he was the true Messias by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of those signs and miracles which had been already wrought above the force of Nature.</hi> A very fair concession! which plainly destroys the necessity of the Churches infallibility in order to Faith. For if no more be necessary in order to faith, <hi>but to rely upon God the first verity speaking by this or that Oracle,</hi> &amp;c. how comes the infallible testimony of the Church to be in any Age necessary to faith? For God spake by Christ and his Apostles as his <hi>Oracles</hi> by whom his word is declared to us, therefore nothing can be necessary to faith but to rely upon God the first Truth speaking by them. And this we assert as well as they. But he must prove that we cannot rely on
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:49657:65"/>
God as speaking by them, unless he hath an <hi>insallible Church</hi> in every Age, if he will make this infallible testimony of the Church necessary to faith; which I despair of ever seeing done while the world stands.</p>

(of which abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant instances might be produced, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>the Considerator of my Principles)</hi> which words if they imply any Infallibility at all do necessarily prove that it is lodged in the supream Ecclesiastical Judges and no where else; so that if there were no infallibility in them it could not be supposed to be any where else; therefore I proposed the case at that time
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:49657:65"/>
when these Ecclesiastical Judges consented to the death of Christ, and my Question will not only hold of the <hi>Apostles</hi> but of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Jews</hi> among them, who might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Christ infallible, any more than the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> I ask whether such might not have seen sufficient ground to believe that <hi>the Prophesies came not in old time by the will of man, but by the Will of God?</hi> if such persons had reason sufficient for their faith without any infallible Testimony; the same I say may all Christians have of the Divine Authority of the New Testament. For if the concurrent Testimony of the disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Jews firmly believing the divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Old Testament were a sufficient ground for a person then to believe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of those Books; why may not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Testimony of all Christians afford as sufficient a ground to believe the Authority of the Books of the New, though no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Senate among Christians be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed any more infallible, than the Jewish <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin</hi> was at the death of Christ? and by this I hope <hi>E.

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:49657:66"/>
their terrible wits? What have we to do with a Churches believing the divine verities of the Old Scripture? we only enquire for the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a Church as necessary in order to others believing it. If they firmly believed and yet had no infallible Testimony of a Church at that time what can be more to our advantage than this? seeing it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that there may be a firm faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Churches infallible Testimony. <hi>Well,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>N.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>but he verily thinks, I mistook one objection for another; perhaps I would have said that the Apostles lost faith of our Saviours Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at the time of his Passion, but this difficulty is solved over and over.</hi> And then falls unmercifully to work with this man of clouts; he throws him first down and tramples upon him, then sets him up again to make him capable of more valour being shown upon him, then he kicks him afresh, beats him of one side and then of the other, and so terribly triumphs over him, that the poor man of clouts blesseth himself that he is not made of flesh and bones, for if he had, it might have cost him some aches and wounds. But I assure him I meant no such thing; yet if I had, I do not see, but after all his batteries, the argument, such as it is, would have stood firm enough; for supposing the Infallible Testimony of the Church to
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:49657:66"/>
rest in the Apostles after our Saviours death, it must have prejudiced the faith of others who were to believe that article upon their Authority, if they lost the faith of Christs Resurrection.</p>

<pb n="415" facs="tcp:49657:68"/>
so do I too. But what were these motives? <hi>To this Question,</hi> he saith, <hi>I return the strangest answer he ever heard; for I seem to make the motives inducing to faith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Rational evidence of the Truth of the Doctrine delivered and therefore I grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously complain that they destroy the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ariseth from the Rational evidence of the Christian Religion;</hi> upon which he discourses, as though by <hi>rational evidence the self-evidencing light of the doctrine, and consequently all the miracles wrought by Christ and his Apostles were to no purpose.</hi> Have not I reason to applaud my good fortune that I have met with so ingenuous an Adversary?

                  </gap>vidence of Christianity, which is destroyed by the doctrine of the Roman Church, while transubstantiation is believed in it. For what assurance can there be of any object of sense such as the miracles of Christ were and his Body after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; if we are so framed not only that our senses may be, but we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are actually deceived in as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per an object of sense as any in the world?

can we have, when any thing is true? For if a thing so plain and evident to our senses may be false, <hi>viz.</hi> that what I and all other men see is bread; what ground of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty can we have, but that which my senses and all other mens judge to be false may be true? For by this means the <hi>criterium</hi> both of sense and reason is destroyed and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all things are equally true and false to us; and then farewel sense and reason and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion together. These things I there largely insist upon; which is all very silently passed over, the <hi>Schools</hi> having found no answers to such arguments; and therefore they must be content to be let alone. But however, though arguments cannot be answered I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire they may not be mis-represented; and that when I fully declare what I meanby <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidence,</hi> such a sense may not be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my words as I never dreamt off.</p>

Here his common-place-Book again fails him, and therefore wanting his Compass he roves and wanders from the point in hand. He tells me <hi>it is hard to guess at my meaning, for I name not one article thus assented to. Perhaps I would say, that the verities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in some Books of Scripture called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocanonical known by their own proper signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or motives, as the Harmony, Sanctity, and Majesty of the Stile, may be believed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Testimony of an Infallible Church.</hi> Well, he doth not know what I meant, but he knew an Argument, he had an Answer ready to; and therefore that must be my meaning. But are not my words plain enough to any one that reads them? And what a vast measure of faith, say I, is necessary to believe the Papal Infallibility; for unless a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the particular Roman Church to be the Catholick Church, unless he believes that Christ hath promised an infallible assistance to the Pastors of the Church, and that not as separate, but as assembled in Council; and not in every Council, but such as the Pope calls and presides in and confirms, he cannot
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:49657:72"/>
believe this Doctrine of Infallibility. Nay further, he must Infallibly believe the Church to be Infallible, though no Infallible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be brought for it; that this Church doth judicially and authoritatively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her sentence in matters of Faith though we know not what that Church is which must so pronounce; that he Infallibly know that this particular sentence was so pronounced, though he can have no other than moral means of knowing it; and lastly, that the Infallibility must be the first thing believed, although all these things must be believed before it. Could any man well in his senses after reading these words imagine that I meant <hi>the self evidencing light of the Scriptures</hi> again? But they write for those that believe them, and that never dare look into the Books they pretend to consute.</p>
               <p>Yet he hath a mind to prove the name of <hi>Roman Catholick Church</hi> to be no <hi>Bull:</hi> which I said in a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> was like <hi>German universal Emperour:</hi> This gives a new start, another common-place Head is searched, <hi>Title, Catholick Church,</hi> there he finds ready the old weather beaten Testimonies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Your Faith is renowned the whole world over:</hi> ergo <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> are all one. A plain demonstration! What need they talk of the <hi>obscurity of Faith,</hi> where there is
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:49657:72"/>
such convincing evidence? But what if it should have happened that <hi>S. Paul</hi> had said the same thing of the Faith of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> or <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> would it not have been a most evident demonstration that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> at that time, and was to continue so in following Ages? But Scripture though never so plain can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not serve their turn, they must have Fathers too. So <hi>E. W.</hi> brings in <hi>St. Hierom, St. Cyprian, St. Athanasius, St. Ambrose, all evidently proving that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was once Catholick:</hi> and what then I beseech him? Were not other Churches so too? But these very Testimonies, as it unhappily falls out, had been particularly and largely examined by me in a whole Chapter to that purpose. <note place="margin">Rational Account part 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> But it is no matter for that, I had not blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them out of his <hi>Note-Books,</hi> and there he found no answers, and therefore out they come again.</p>

                  </note> against this way of resolving Faith, was that it did not effect that which it was brought for, for supposing that Chuch Infallible, and that Infallibility proved by the motives of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, they do not escape the circle objected against them: Which I shewed, 1. from the nature of divine Faith as explained by them.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:49657:73"/>
2. From the consideration of the persons whose Faith was to be resolved. 3. From the nature of that Infallibility which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Church. I must now consider how <hi>E. W.</hi> attempts the clearing of these difficulties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the nature of divine Faith. I ask whether a divine Faith as to the Churches Infallibility, may be built upon the motives of credibility? If it may, then a divine Faith may rest upon prudential motives, if not, then this way cannot clear them from a circle in the resolution of divine Faith. For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded why with a divine Faith they believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God? Their answer is, because the Church which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible delivers them as such to us. If I then ask, why with a divine Faith they believe the Churches Infallibility? I desired them to answer me if they can any other way than because the Scriptures which are Infallible say so. It is a very pleasant thing to see how <hi>E. W.</hi> is miserably put to his shifts about this difficulty, for although in his former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses he had pressed the necessity of <hi>divine Faith</hi> so much, that from thence he might introduce the necessity of Infallibility; yet he now seems wholly to have forgotten any such distinction, of Faith humane and divine; although he could not but see that the force of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:49657:73"/>
my Argument did depend upon it. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his answer is, <hi>That the first act of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diss.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith whereby we believe the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility relies not on Scripture, but upon the Church it self, as the most known mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sested Oracle.</hi> Be it so: but the Question is, whether this first act be <hi>divine Faith</hi> or not; if not, it is nothing to the purpose, if it be, then divine Faith may want an Infallible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony: for this first act of Faith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Churches Infallibility hath nothing to rely upon, but the fallible motives of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, and consequently <hi>divine Faith</hi> may want an Infallible Testimony. And I say still let them answer this if they can; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apparent shuffling and running away from the Question in hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the consideration of the <hi>persons</hi> whose Faith is to be resolved: for I say, 1. The Question is not which way they will prove the Insallibility of their Church against those who deny it, but which way they resolve their own Faith of the Churches Infallibility. 2. In disputing against their Adversaries they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid the circle; for while they prove Infallibility from Scripture, the Question arises how they come to know Infallibly, that this is the sense of those places? for which they must again appeal to the Churches Infallibility in delivering the sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:49657:74"/>
which if it be not a circle, I say, there is hardly such a figure in Mathematicks. To this he answers. 1. <hi>That they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve and prove;</hi> but then if they do resolve <note place="margin">
                     <hi>N.</hi> 7.</note> their Faith into this Infallibility, it is no sufsicient answer to say <hi>they only prove it to Adversaries:</hi> which was all I intended by that first particular. But what answer doth he give to the second concerning <hi>tbe sense</hi> of Scripture? Here again he makes use of his distinction <hi>of the first and second act of Faith; the first</hi> he saith, <hi>is not at all found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">N. S, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>upon the sense of Scripture, but upon the Churches own Infallible Testimony made by it self and for it self immediately credible. Now if we speak,</hi> saith he, <hi>of another distinct, consequent, and more explicit act of Faith, when we believe the Churches Infallibility upon this ground, that she declares the Scriptures genuine sense which proves her an Infallible Oracle, there is no difficulty at all, because this very Exposition or Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scripture is ultimately resolved into (and therefore again believed upon) the same Infallible Authority of the Church, or rather upon Scripture and the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation together. For thus joyntly taken they ground Faith, and not like two disparate principles, as if we first believed the Scriptures sense independently of the</hi>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:49657:74"/>
                  <hi>Churches Interpretation, and then again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Churches interpretation to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, because the sense of Scripture known</hi> aliunde, <hi>or without depending on Church Authority, saith she is Infallible; This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> if Scripture and the Churches inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation indivisibly concur to this latter act of Faith, whereof we now speak. Here then is a Dilemma that clears all and frees us from the least shadow of a circle: we either know (or believe) the Scriptures</hi>

My objection was plain and easie, they offer to prove the Churches Infallibility by Scripture, at least as to the second act of Faith, which is alone pertinent to our purpose; I asked what way they come to believe Infallibly themselves and assure others this is the sense of those places; and in this case they are forced to return to the Churches Infalli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For in this case the mind hath nothing to fix it self upon, and therefore must suspend all assent: which must have some certain foundation to proceed upon, on which it may rest it self. As the will could not love Physick for the sake of health, if it loved health for the sake of Physick, so neither can the understanding assent to one truth for another, if it assent to that other only for the sake of the former. For then the same Proposition would be more certain than the other, as it is the antecedent by which the other is proved; and less cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:49657:75"/>
as it is the consequent proved by the other as it's antecedent: and so in different respects would be more and less certain than it self. Let us now apply this to our present case. The thing to be proved is the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, the Argument to prove it by, is the Infallible sense of Scripture; but if the Infallible sense of Scripture can be proved by nothing but the Churches Infallible interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; then it is plain that is assumed as an Argument to prove Infallibility by, which cannot be otherwise known than by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. Now let any man attend to the answer he gives: he saith, <hi>there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty at all in believing the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility upon this ground, that she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Scriptures genuine sense which proves her an Infallible Oracle.</hi> No diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty at all! Nay, that is a little strange, that there should be no difficulty at all in believing the Churches Infallibility upon the sense of those Scriptures, whose sense could not be insallibly known without the supposal of that Infallibility, which is to be proved by them. But how comes there to be <hi>no difficulty at all</hi> in this matter? <hi>Because this very Exposition or Interpretation of Scripture brought to its last principle is ultimately resolved into (and therefore again believed upon) the same Infallible Authority of the Church, or</hi>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:49657:76"/>
                  <hi>rather upon Scripture and the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation together.</hi> What a strange thing the difference of mens understandings is! That which he thinks makes it <hi>no diffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lty at all,</hi> makes it to me the greatest in the world. For by <hi>the Exposition or Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> I suppose he means, <hi>the Infallible sense of Scripture:</hi> and if this be resolved into and believed upon the same <hi>Infallible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church,</hi> then I still enquire how this Infallible Authority of the Church comes to be proved by this Exposition of Scripture the Infallibility of which doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the thing to be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> the Churches Infallibility. And if the sense internal to the letter cannot be infallibly propounded otherwise than by the Church; I would fain know what assurance any man can have of this sense but from the belief of this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interpreter? <hi>But,</hi> saith he, <hi>Scripture and the Churches Interpretation indivisibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to this latter act of Faith.</hi> This <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible concurrence,</hi> is to me an odd piece of <hi>mystical Divinity:</hi> the meaning must be (if there be any) that I believe the Church In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility by those Scriptures, from the Churches Infallibility appearing in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible sense of those Scriptures. But whence, say I, doth this appear to be the Infallible sense of them? For if the sense
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:49657:76"/>
of any places of Scripture be doubtful, theirs is; since their meaning is so doubtful, how come men firmly to believe this to be the true and Infallible sense of those places and none else? Can men come to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible sense of Scripture, without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church? if so, what need of any such Infallibility? if not, then the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible sense of these places cannot be known but from the Churches Infallibility: and therefore the Circle unavoidably follows, <hi>viz.</hi> that they must prove the Churches Infallibility by the Infallible sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Infallible sense of Scripture by the Churches Infallibility. And any man might easily guess that <hi>E. W.</hi> was in a Circle by his Conjuring, and speaking things which neither he, nor any one else can understand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I shewed, that they avoided not the circle by this way, from the nature of the <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which they attribute to the Church.

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:49657:77"/>
which are supposed in Scripture to imply it. So that still the circle returns, for they believe the Scriptures. Infallible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Churches Testimony, and the Church Infallible because of the promis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To solve this plain and pressing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> saith E.

For I do not think an Atheist would desire more advantage against the Christian Religion, than to have it grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Miracles of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were no other than such as are wrought in the Roman Church; and that the proofs of them are no more authentick and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than those of the Miracles done at <hi>Lore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Compostella,</hi> or <hi>Montaigu:</hi> and that Christ and his Apostles gave no more illustrious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their being sent from God than St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> or St. <hi>Francis;</hi> and that there
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:49657:80"/>
was no greater evidence of Christs Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead than there is of the boyling up of the blood of Christ in the Vial of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Maximin</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore not only to invalidate the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony drawn from hence for the Roman Churches Infallibility, but to preserve the honour of Christianity, I am obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the Testimony upon which the Miracles of Christ and his Apostles, and those of the Roman Church are delivered be equally credible?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the Miracles of the Roman Church be so equal (to abate him what he saith of <hi>greater)</hi> in worth, quality and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with those of Christ and his Apostles, that the Roman Churches Infallibility is as much attested by them, as Christ and his Apostles was by theirs?</p>
               <p n="1">1. I shall enquire into the credibility of the Testimony on both sides. Two things are agreed to make up sufficient credibility in a Testimony; <hi>viz.</hi> the knowledge and fidelity of the persons who deliver it. If they speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they were certain witnesses of, and never gave suspicion of fraud and deceit, and offered the highest ways of proof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their own fidelity, then it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:49657:81"/>
thing to disbelieve them. This is the case of those who recorded our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and his Apostles Miracles, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who either saw them wrought themselves, or had them delivered to them immediately by them who saw them; they published them to the world in that Age wherein they wereca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being disproved by persons then living in the same places where they were wrought, and were notorious enemies to the persons who did them, who were concerned to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for their own justification the least fraud or imposture in those matters.

                              <hi>The Church of our B. Lady of</hi> Loreto <hi>was a Chamber of the House of the B.

Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>was born, and bred up, and afterwards there received the salutation of the Angel</hi> Gabriel, <hi>and in the same Chamber she educated her Son Jesus Christ to the Age of twelve years. After the Ascention of Christ to Heaven the Virgin</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>remained upon earth with the Apostles and other Disciples of Christ who seeing many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mysteries performed in the said Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, did by the common consent of them all decree, to make a Church of that Chamber to the honour and memory of the B.

Virgin, which is there to this day. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Church was inhabited and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with much devotion by the Christian people in those parts in which it stood as long as the people remained Christian.

Therefore the Angels came and took it from thence and carried it clear over the Sea into the parts of the territory of</hi> Recanati, <hi>and there placed it in a Wood which belonged to a Noble Lady who had the command of the City of</hi> Recanati, <hi>and was Owner of the Wood whose name was</hi> Loreta, <hi>and from her the Church took its name of St.</hi> Maria de Loreto. <hi>In that time by reason of the great concourse of all people to that Wood in which the Church remained abundance of robberies and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs were committed there; and therefore the Angels again took up the Chappel and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to a Hill belonging to two Brothers where the Angels set it down; these Brothers getting a vast revenew by the resort of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims thither and the oblations by them made, fell to a great discord.

The substance of his story is the very same with the Table of <hi>Teremanus,</hi> only inlarged with some more improbable circumstances, as that the Trees made lowly reverences and bowed themselves to the Chappel in its pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; (but it seems they bowed so low that they could never recover themselves after; being I suppose of great Age when they made this obeysance) that, when the new Wall was built for the support of the Chappel; the Walls of it would not endure the others being too near, but made the new Wall by degrees know its due distance, so that at last a Boy might be put in between them: that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 16.</note> the Image of our Saviour being taken out to be set in a more conspicuous place, it went of its own accord into the Chappel again, so that after several attempts they were fain to give over their design. I confess these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances do not tend much to the making the story it self more credible; but what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath <hi>Tursellinus</hi> found out for so strange a Miracle? He often quotes <hi>Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Angelita,</hi> but he writ in <hi>Clement</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venths
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:49657:85"/>
time, and dedicated his History of that Chappel to him; but the main prop of all this story is the Tradition of <hi>Loreto,</hi> and the <hi>Table</hi> of <hi>Teremanus,</hi> whom he highly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 28.</note> commends for his integrity and prudence, who was Governour of the Chappel in the time of <hi>Pius</hi> 2. about the year 1460. and to his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies <hi>Tursellinus</hi> appeals for proof of the matter of fact. And was ever so great a Miracle better attested than this? We will out of meer kindness, set aside the Testimony from Visions and Dreams; but then could we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any thing less than that some persons of credit who had seen the Chappel in its march over the Sea, were resolved to observe, where such <hi>a Chappel in the Air</hi> would at last fix it self; or that some that saw it pitched upon the ground without any Foundations, should presently fill the Country with the noise of it, as such strange things are very apt to do; and that such witnesses being strictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined should have left a deposition written by them for the satisfaction of future Ages. In stead of which we have two plain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen brought in to give testimony to a thing done in the time of their Grandfathers Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers: neither do they both give testimony to the same thing; but one of them saith, <hi>his Grandfathers Grandfather</hi> (not <hi>his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> as <hi>Tursellinus</hi> hath it) saw the Chappel, while it was in the Air carried by Angels over
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:49657:86"/>
the Sea. Is not this a substantial witness, that attests what his Grandfathers Grandfather saw, without any other evidence of it, than that he heard so? <hi>Tursellinus</hi> saith, <hi>that it was not only to</hi> Teremanus <hi>that they attested this by word,</hi> but <hi>they did swear to it:</hi> which adds very much to their credit conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the nature of their Testimony; but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks <hi>Teremanus</hi> himself should not have forgotten that. All the force of this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony lies upon one man, who is reported by his great Grandchild to have seen the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel carryed by Angels over the Sea. But suppose he did see something moving upon the Sea, while he was cutting Wood, or feeding his Cattle in the fields of <hi>la Marca di An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona;</hi> was he sure it was the Chappel of <hi>Loreto:</hi> did he see the Angels carrying it? might not a plain Countryman mistake a little about the colour and shape of Angels? might not a Ship under sail in the Adriatick Gulf be taken by such a man for a House carryed by Angels with white Wings? are such Miracles so little regarded by the people of <hi>Italy,</hi> that no proof could be produced for it, but what two Affidavit-men said, that they had heard what their Ancestors almost two hundred years before had seen or heard? Is it possible the memory of such a Miracle should be so near being quite lost? were there no Writers in that Age to record it and

               <p>
                  <hi>A certain Priest of</hi> Dalmatia <hi>being hugely devoted to the blessed Virgin of</hi> Loreto, <hi>was taken Prisoner by the Turks; who would have forced him to renounce his Religion, which he would by no means hear of; but still called upon Christ and</hi> Mary; <hi>they being</hi>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:49657:88"/>
                  <hi>enraged at him asked of him what he meant to use those names so much; he told them they stuck to his very entrails; upon which they threatened that they would pull out his entrails if he did not immediately curse them both. Which they resolving to do, the poor Priest made a vow to the blessed Virgin of</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto, <hi>that if he lived he would go in Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage thither. At which they being more enraged cut open his breast and pulled out all his entrails, and gave them into his hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ready to sink, and bid him go and carry them to the Lady of</hi> Loreto. <hi>The Priest presently goes on his way, and after many days journey, comes safe to</hi> Loreto, <hi>having his entrails in his hand. Whereever he came great flocking of people there was about him,</hi> (as we may easily imagine) <hi>and to our Ladies servants here he shews his naked breast, and his entrails taken out; and after having offered up his devotions to the blessed Virgin, in the sight and embraces of her he breathed his last.</hi> Is not this a swinging Miracle; and deserving credit beyond those of Christ and his Apostles? To ask how a man could breath without his Lungs, or live without a Heart, or by what vessels the circulation of blood was then performed? or any such unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward questions, were but to gratifie carnal reason too much, where nothing is required
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:49657:88"/>
but meer Faith. And such men have certainly great store of that or rather of folly and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that can dare to call these <hi>Legends</hi> by the name of <hi>Authentick monuments or unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Testimonies.</hi> This is a very hopeful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the search into <hi>these Monuments;</hi> but I have several things further to object, against this way of proving Miracles by <hi>Tables</hi> that are hung up in such places as the <hi>Chappel</hi> of <hi>Loreto</hi> is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That any extraordinary accident that befalls a person, if he either chanced to think upon the <hi>blessed Virgin</hi> of <hi>Loreto,</hi> or pray to her, or at least tell those so, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to have it believed, this immediately passes for a Miracle. There are very few persons in the world but at sometime or other of their lives do meet with extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, either from diseases, or other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. If any of these, had lived in those parts and had been possessed with the same superstitious follies, immediately any such passage of their lives, if they had gone to <hi>Loreto</hi> after it and there acquainted the <hi>Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary</hi> or <hi>Confessor</hi> with it, it had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the <hi>Tables,</hi> and had been preserved (as a Tooth-drawer doth Teeth) for the reputation of the place. The far greatest part of the Miracles mention'd by <hi>Tursellinus</hi> are of this kind. The first Miracle, by his
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:49657:89"/>
own consession which brought the Church of <hi>Loreto</hi> into reputation was the cure of <hi>Pius</hi> the second who being troubled with the Gout, <note place="margin">

I know not what kind of Miracles the Lady of <hi>Loreto</hi> works; I am sure Christ and his Apostles never wrought such. We use to say that a Miracle is <hi>a perfect work;</hi> and is dying of a disease a miraculous cure? <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Ciac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius</hi> in his life take no notice of a cure, much less of a Miracle, but say that upon some intermission he undertook his journey where he dyed of his disease. Yet <hi>Turselli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> saith, <hi>The fame of this cure brought great reputation to the Lady of</hi> Loreto: which till that time <hi>(viz.</hi> for one hundred and sixty years after the miraculous Translation) was known only among the inhabitants of the Country about <hi>Ancona;</hi> and scarce the least
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:49657:89"/>
knowledge of it was passed into the neighbour Countries, which is the reason he gives why <hi>Vincentius, Antoninus,</hi> and the <hi>Italian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> take no notice of it: and those who did, as <hi>Blondus,</hi> yet <hi>do not mention the Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lest they should seem to utter vain and incredible things.</hi> A very substantial reason I confess. But after this time Miracles grew more frequent, as the superstition and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of people did increase. If a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of a dangerous sickness, if <hi>Julius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">l. 2. c. 2. c. 12, c. 24, c. 27. l. 3. c. 15 16, 17, 18, 24. 26, 27. l. 4, 5, 6, 7, 17, 18, 19, &amp;c.</note> the second escape being shot by a Cannon bullet, if <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh escape with his life in the sacking of <hi>Rome,</hi> if others are delivered from great dangers either by Sea or Land, in what way or kind so ever it be, if they do but send or go to <hi>Loreto</hi> afterwards, all these are there recorded for Miracles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this way of Testimony is liable to the greatest exceptions. For, the Priests who make these <hi>Tables</hi> are easily abused by the confident affirmation of persons who come and tell them great stories of Miracles wrought at the invocation of the <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Loreto;</hi> as in all likelihood <hi>Riera</hi> the Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary of <hi>Loreto</hi> was, by many who came to him, who were persons of no reputation at all. As the <hi>Jew</hi> that told the formal story, <hi>of his being delivered at</hi> Nazareth <hi>out of prison, by calling upon his Countrywoman,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>the Lady of</hi> Loreto; <hi>who thereupon appeared to him with her woman called</hi> Lucia <hi>waiting upon her, (whom she bid to knock off his chains,) and opened the prison doors and led him to the Sea side, and shewed him a ship ready for his passage, and bid him make hast to</hi> Loreto <hi>and be there baptized.</hi> And we may think he obeyed her will, for he told <hi>Riera,</hi> that he came to <hi>Ancona</hi> in two days. Yet this man was received with great joy and the Miracle highly magnified; and which was more, for all that we can find, verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. And no doubt the <hi>Venetian Courtesan</hi>

That she was set upon in her way thither by her companion, who desperately wounded her in many places and cut her throat; and she just in the very nick of expiring called upon the Lady of</hi> Loreto <hi>for help; who presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to her and took her in her lap and stroked her wounds and immediately cured her body, and filled her soul with heavenly Joy.</hi> Was not the blessed Virgin very kind to a Courtesan? But all this was presently believed at <hi>Loreto;</hi> and as an impregnable evidence of the Truth of it, she shewed a <hi>shining list about her neck upon the skin;</hi> which was a demonstration she was healed
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:49657:90"/>
by a divine hand. For St. <hi>Winifred</hi> and others had just such a one when their heads were joyned to their bodies again. And are not these <hi>Authentick Testimonies and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Monuments?</hi> Is the Testimony of the whole Christian Church to be compared to that of a Jew and a Courtesan? But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the persons who delivered these things to them were such as had a great credit; (and so they had need to be when the reputation of a Miracle depends upon their single Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,) yet is it not possible to suppose that the Priests for the reputation of their House, may help out a lame Miracle with an advantagious circumstance or two? it being for so good a Cause as the honour of their Church. Especially when such infinite riches come by it, as may be seen by <hi>Turselli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his History of the <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Loreto;</hi> whose Book is made up of Miracles and Riches: and in truth the greatest Miracle there is the riches of that Chappel since it gained reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World. They had need of a very untainted credit, to have their Testimony ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on their bare words, when there is such a reward for Lying. Men need not ask <hi>Cassius</hi> his Question <hi>cui bono?</hi> For any one may easily discern that, that compares the Tables of Miracles and the vast riches accruing by them together. The honest Heathens thought
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:49657:91"/>
a persons Testimony was then to be relyed upon; when there was no reward for false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <q>

                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> thought, it was a good argument of mens fidelity, if they affirmed a thing <hi>postquam nullum mendacio pretium;</hi> when there was no advantage to be got by it. But I am sure this can never hold in these <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Testimonies</hi> of the Miracles of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church; Rich Jewels, Silver shrines, presents of all sorts, and vast endowments may tempt men to strain a little in such trifles, as a few circumstances, which can easily change an ordinary accident into a Miracle, Nay persons of great honour and reputation, (beyond ten thousand such Priests whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is so deeply concerned in the belief of these things,) have affirmed that they have seen Tables hanging up in one of the Churches mentioned by <hi>E. W.</hi> of a miraculous cure wrought upon a lame person, whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have seen immediately aster, so lame as to use crutches. Therefore I hope such Testimonies as these, for meer shame, will never more be compared with the Miracles of Christ and his Apostles: who had no <hi>Diana's</hi>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:49657:91"/>
to attend upon, nor expected <hi>any silver shrines.</hi> Not that I compare the blesfed Virgin to a Heathen Goddefs, but I may safely enough, the nature and reward of the attendance on both, and the means to draw riches to their Temples. Can any one imagine if all the Miracles of Christ and his Apostles had been done in this manner, and the Testimony of them only taken from <hi>Tables hanging upon Walls,</hi> that ever Christianity would have prevailed upon the ingenuous part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? No, it was because these Miracles were wrought publickly by Christ and his Apostles in the view of enemies; and they who attested them did not fit to receive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents and tell tales, but ventured their lives as well as fortunes, to give testimony to the truth of these things; and offered as much satisfaction as sense and reason could require in these matters. But if they had nothing to shew but Tables hanging upon the Walls of their Temples; the Heathens would have told them, they had as good evidence for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles among them.

                  </gap> such foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as these are, compared with the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Christ and his Apostles. If they had done no more than shewed such tricks to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world, it might have remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Paganism to this day. The miracles wrought by Christ or his Apostles tended to the great benefit and advantage of mankind, and were not cunningly managed in a corner; for a solemn shew at a certain season of the year; but the gift of healing the sick and the gift of tongues, in which consisted chiefly the Testimony God gave to his Apostles, were things of real advantage to the world and lay open to the observation of every one. But the world is apt to suspect and not without reason, these useless and secret miracles; if they be true they signifie no good to the world, if they be false they do unspeakable mischief to Religion. Our Saviours Blood was never shed to shew tricks with, and <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> was hardly at leasure at our Saviours pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to gather up his Blood as it dropt from him. But what will not these men say and profess to believe too! Certainly there were never more shameful impostures than about Reliques and Miracles in the Roman Church; and when some of the wiser men of their own communion abroad shake their heads and are ashamed of them; our <hi>S. C's</hi> and

                  <hi>E. W' s</hi> magnifie them still, as though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> were as capable of being made Fools as ever. I pity the weakness and credulity of some, but I abhor the hypocrisie and fraud of those, who do not believe these things themselves, and yet would make others believe them. Gentlemen, Religion is a grave and serious thing, and a severe account must be given to God of any thing we say about it; God will never think himself ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the falshood and hypocrisie of men; and that Church of all others in the world shall never draw me to its communion which cannot be upheld without abusing mankind, and the most excellent Religion in the world. If you have any miracles to shew, do them as Christ and his Apostles did in the midst of their enemies and upon them too; can you do them for a better end than our conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? was not this the end God designed mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for? and how comes he to change his patent among you, with whom they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done among Friends and in corners: Where they may be shewed with advantage among ignorant people who have no skill in Opticks nor judgement to know the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the boyling of a thing from a natural cause and by a miracle. For truths sake, if your Church, hath such a power of miracles as Christ and his Apostles had, never send us

to <hi>Loreto</hi> or <hi>Compostella,</hi> or St. <hi>Maximins Church</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> nor refer us to your <hi>Tables</hi> and <hi>Legends,</hi> those are things in no request among us, whatever they be with you; but we have many sick and wounded persons and many dead; come and cure all manner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases with a word, in an instant, perfectly, and openly; raise those who have died of a known incurable disease, and are carried out to be buried or have lain in their Graves as Christ did: or else out of honour to Christ and Truth, and for meer shame avoid such rude and impudent comparisons of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of your Church, with those of Christ and his Apostles.

                  <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Collius</hi> see <hi>no cause for so great a miracle; but he thinks there is as much reason for it, as for the multiplication of the Wood of the Cross;</hi> and I think so too. But yet he hath another reserve, which is, <hi>that these several Prepuces are really nothing but so many parts of the Umbilical Vessels, which are sent up and down for the consolation of the faithful.</hi> And no doubt they tend very much to it; especially when they mistake one thing for another. And why may not then that which goes for the Blood of Christ be the blood of some other person; especially since the blood of Christ is shewn in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places besides? But that we may not however doubt of the truth of both these, St. <hi>Brigit</hi> saith in her <hi>Revelations, that the</hi>

Yet he tells us, <hi>some are of opinion, that there is no other blood of Christ upon earth, besides that in the Eucharist: and others that all the blood of Christ which was shed in his passion, was resumed at his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and therefore he rather inclines to think, it is some of the blood he shed in his</hi>

No, it is said, it was at the time of his Passion and therefore this answer cannot serve. How then come such great quantities of this Blood to be seen? not only in St. <hi>Maximins</hi> Church but at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Mantua,</hi> and several other places mentioned by <hi>Ferrandus.</hi> To this, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers with <hi>Biel that Christ had a whole legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wounds</hi> 6666. and <hi>Alanus de Rup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> hath undertaken to cast up just how many drops he shed <hi>viz.</hi> 547500. And can there be any reason in the world to question the credibility of the Testimonies of such persons who are so exact and punctual in their calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? Far be it from us in the least to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from that inestimable love which the Son of God expressed in shedding his Blood as a Sacrifice of Propitiation for us. We adore, and celebrate that sacred mysterie of our Redemption by the Blood of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lamb. It is the Blood of Christ we glory in and hope for Salvation by; but not as kept for Reliques, or preserved in Vials to make a shew of; much less to abuse mankind with a pretence of that Sacred Blood, when there is not the least shadow of reason to believe it.</p>

               <p>Thus the story is related in the <hi>Roman Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary. After Christs Ascension to Heaven,</hi> Martha <hi>with her Sister</hi> Mary, (whom they suppose to be <hi>Mary Magdalen) and with her Brother</hi> Lazarus <hi>and their servant</hi> Marcella, <hi>and</hi> Maximinus <hi>one of the seventy Disciples of our Lord with many other Christians were put into a Ship by the Jews without any Sail or Oars, that they might perish by Shipwrack: but by the Providence of God the Ship came safe to</hi> Marseilles: <hi>by which Miracle and Preaching the inhabitants of</hi> Marseilles <hi>and of</hi> Aix, <hi>and the neighbour people were converted: and</hi> Lazarus <hi>was made Bishop of</hi> Marseilles, <hi>and</hi> Maximinus <hi>of</hi> Aix. <hi>But</hi> Mary Magdalen <hi>having accustomed her self to prayer and a contemplative life, retired into a hollow Cave of a very high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; where she continued thirty years, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all conversation with men, and every day was carried up by Angels, to hear the Choire of Angels Sing.</hi> This is contained in the fourth and fifth Lessons on <hi>July</hi> 29. in the present <hi>Roman Breviary:</hi> but we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that this story was not always in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Breviary;</hi> for those who reformed it under <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth had left it out; but since it hath been thought fit to be restored again;

thing which St. <hi>Antonin</hi> instances in, was St. <hi>Dominicks power over Devils;</hi> and in truth he was very extraordinary in this. <hi>Jansenius</hi> hath already put together several instances to my hands. It seems the Devil <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jans ib.</hi> l. 2. c. 10.</note> used to trouble him in several shapes; but he was never more vexed with him, than when he flew up and down while he was Preaching to the Sisters (so my Author calls them) in the shape of a <hi>Sparrow.</hi> He perceiving the Devils cunning, called to Sister <hi>Maximilla</hi> to catch him and deliver him to him. She did so, who had no sooner got him into his hands but he falls to the pulling him crying out still <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theodorie. vit. Dom.</hi> l. 3. c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Enemy, Enemy.</hi> Till at last he left not a Feather upon him, and then insulted over him and bid him fly now if he could. The poor Sparrow hop'd up and down till at last he got under a Brass Lamp before the Altar of the blessed Virgin, and down he tumbles that: when behold a mighty Miracle, the Lamp hanging by a Chain fell not to the ground, and which was more, not a drop of oyl spilt; but at St. <hi>Dominicks</hi> command the Lamp was put in its right place; and the Sparrow disappeared. But the Devil was never so abused as when he appeared in the shape of a <hi>Monky,</hi> when St. <hi>Dominick</hi> was writing late at night; and the Devil was shewing Monky-tricks round about him:
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:49657:107"/>
Saint <hi>Dominick</hi> nodded to him to stand still and hold his Candle for him. The Devil could not yet leave his old tricks, but at last the Candle was almost burnt out; and the Monkys Tees began to burn, then he made a lamentable noise; still St. <hi>Dominick</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him by his nod, (for he would not vouchsafe to speak to the Devil) to stand still, which he was fain to do, till his Toe was burnt, and then St. <hi>Dominick</hi> soundly lashed him and sent him going. I would not be thought to pick these things out of <hi>old Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends,</hi> that are disowned by themselves; but I assure the Reader, these things are not only contained in the ancient and approved Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of St. <hi>Dominicks</hi> life, but in <hi>Nicol. Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius</hi> the latest and most elegant of them; whose Book was Printed at <hi>Antwerp</hi> A. D. 1622. And he further tells us, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil finding no good was to be done this way, was resolved to set upon him by main force; and finding him once so intent at Prayers that no noise would disturb him, he takes a huge stone from the top of the Church and throws it at his head, but hit only his Cowle. But when he saw he could not stir him with all this, he went sneakingly away. <hi>This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,</hi> he saith, <hi>in the Church of St.</hi> Sabina, <hi>where the stone is still to be seen, and is of the bigness of a great Holland Cheese,</hi> saith

If he met with possessed persons he had a trick that he could make them confess what he had a mind to. For we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the blessed Virgin among many singular favours she had shewed to St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> had taught him such a way of praying, as was never known before, the most effectual against Devils and all sorts of enemies that could be: which is sometimes called the <hi>Psalter</hi> of the <hi>blessed Virgin,</hi> sometimes only the <hi>Rosary</hi> consisted of one hundred and fifty <hi>Ave Marys,</hi> and fifteen <hi>Pater Nosters.</hi> This excellent device was revealed to him, after his Body had had three days conversation with Bryers and Thorns in the Woods near <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse when the blessed Virgin,</hi> saith <hi>Alanus de</hi>

Yet one time the Devil, who owed him a spight, was like to have been too hard for him; when he was condemned to be hanged for a Spy; and was upon the Rack, and there confessed himself a Traytor, but by good fortune the <hi>F.

But although St. <hi>Francis</hi> had not that power over him that goes about <hi>like a roaring Lyon;</hi> yet he had an extraordinary power over a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>Wolf,</hi> as appears by the story of his miraculous conversion by him: <hi>Wadding</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the story very briefly, having a mind to be at the end of it; but he agrees in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <note place="margin">

St. <hi>Francis</hi> moved with a pious zeal not to kill but to convert this Wolf, out he goes at the gates of the City, with no other Armour than what he could presently make with his fingers, <hi>viz.</hi> the sign of the Cross; the people were got upon the tops of their Houses to see the issue of this encounter: the <hi>Wolf</hi> comes with open mouth towards him,

St. <hi>Francis</hi> takes him to confession, laying open before him the horrid cruelties he had committed; but at last offers terms of agreement between him and the City; the Wolf by the moving of his tail and ears plainly shewed that he understood and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his offer. St. <hi>Francis</hi> then tells him he knew he did all this to satisfie his hunger, therefore he would take care he should be provided for, if he would promise he would never hurt any body again. The Wolf bows his head in token of consent; and when St. <hi>Francis</hi> held out his hand to make the bargain sure, the Wolf put his right foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand; (very well understanding the way of contracts). Upon this the Wolf qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly walks along with him towards the City; the people seeing that, flocked in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance about him, St. <hi>Francis</hi> makes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sermon on the occasion, and at last assures them of the conversion of Brother

               <p>Â§. 8. Before I dispatch this first head in <note place="margin">Of the miracles related of the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Sain's.</note> shewing upon what uncertain reports mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are received and believed in the Roman Church; I shall give an account of some of them nearer home, by which we may judge how far the Miracles boasted of by <hi>E. W.</hi> ought in point of credibility to be compared with those of Christ and his Apostles. I hope none will deny that there are some bounds to be set to our belief of reports con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning miracles: for although Gods omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency hath no bounds, yet we are not to think that God doth equally imploy his power in all things, nor at all times, nor as often as men shall please to say he doth it. In many cases it is very hard to determine the farthest extent of the power of nature; and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to shew what is a miracle and what not; for the power of meer natural causes may lie secret and hidden from us; yet from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual observation of the course of nature a certain sphere may be fixed, within which
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:49657:114"/>
the effects of nature are contained. As that a body being once truly dead, cannot of it self come to life again; that there are some diseases at such a height as to be incurable by natural means; in these cases the raising of such a body to life, the curing of such diseases being done frequently, publickly, and in an instant are great arguments of a miraculous and divine power. And this we say was the case of the miracles of Christ and his Apostles: but from hence men ought not to abuse mankind; and because the power of God is unlimited, therefore to say that the most extravagant, foolish and idle imaginations of men, because they have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed without proof for miracles among credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous people, must still be received for such. For is it reasonable that because we believe that nothing is impossible with God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must not question that so many Saints walked with their heads off, or did such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant things as the makers of the <hi>lives</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> tell us? For it was not only St. <hi>Denis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> of whom that is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but our own Ecclesiastical stories will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with many other Instances of a like nature.

                     </gap>o that degree, that they would not so much as remember their Saints.</hi> Which is a very likely thing. But of all the miracles of this kind commend me to those of St. <hi>Cadoc:</hi> one time, when he was building an Oratory, an <hi>Irish</hi> artificer came to his assistance, who being envied by his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">Capgrav. <hi>F.</hi> 53. 1.</note> workmen, they very maliciously cut off his head and tied a great stone to his body and so threw it into a pond, next morning the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed artificer brings his head in his lap and the great stone at his back; and all bloody shews himself to St. <hi>Cadoc,</hi> then the Head (to whom it belonged to speak) thus addressed it self to the Saint. <hi>O servant of God set my head on my shoulders again, and I will tell thee all the things which thou knowest not about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:49657:117"/>
Which he had no sooner done, but the head told the whole story, and having done so expired. But as remarkable was his raising the Gyant <hi>Can</hi> at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who told him that he brought his Soul out of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. f.</hi> 54. 1.</note> Hell; and being so useful a man, upon the prayers of St. <hi>Cadoc</hi> he lived a notable dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and labourer there a good while after. Have we not now very great reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve these Miracles? and is not the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Legendaries, from whom these things are reported, equal to the Testimony of all Christians? and are not the Miracles themselves as credible and likely to be true as those of Christ and his Apostles? But if these do not satisfie, what can we be able to say, to <hi>Count Wallen Earl of Northumberland,</hi> who being beheaded for rebellion against <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, his head sixteen years after his death, saith <hi>Capgrave,</hi> was found fastened <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. f.</hi> 278.</note> to his body and only a bloody list about his neck where it was cut off. It seems Rebells are as capable of these Miracles as Saints. We need not at all wonder now that when he was beheaded while he was saying the <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> his head went through with it, after its being cut off. This would hardly go down for a Miracle, when we have such choice of so much better and plainer Miracles, related by those <hi>Anthentick Historians;</hi> from

While the Child lay thus, before nine days were passed, an Angel came to him, and brought him a Brass Bell, and put the Childs mouth to it: and when the Child was hungry it turned it self and sucked of the Bell; which afforded nourishment sweeter than any milk: and of so subtle a nature that he voided no excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus he continued till he could walk, and the swaddling cloaths in which he was wrapt, grew to him as bark to a Tree just as he grew. Afterwards a wild Doe came twice a day and filled the Bell with Milk, thus he continued eighteen years, being taught to read by an Angel.

               <p>Are not these now pregnant instances how much these Saints exceeded Christ and his Apostles in their beginning to work Miracles so much before them?</p>
               <p>But withall we never find that Christ and his Apostles wrought such trifling Miracles. To pass over the Resurrection of <hi>Robin-red. breast,</hi> methinks it was an occasion somewhat with the meanest to save School-boys from whipping, as <hi>Capgrave</hi> tells us some of his Saints have done, witness the Boy at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> that ran for Sanctuary to St. <hi>Adrians</hi> Tomb at St. <hi>Augustins,</hi> whither his Master <note place="margin">Capgrave f 1.</note> pursued him; and resolved to whip him, till a white Dove appeared on the top of the Tomb, and by stretching out his neck and wings begged pardon for him? then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster fell uppon his knees to the Saint and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed his fault; and so the Dove flew away.
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:49657:121"/>
But he escaped better now than at another time, (if he were the same Master) when whipping the boy however that had fled thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his arm was held stretched out all that day till he fell upon his knees to the boy, and asked him pardon and by his intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he recovered the use of his Arm.

                  <hi>following the same Bishop St.</hi> Ivo <hi>appeared in a very reverend form and with great bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to a Carpenter called</hi> Ezi <hi>and told him who he was; commanding him to signifie to</hi> Ednoth <hi>Abbot of</hi> Ramsey <hi>that he should tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate his and his companions bodies from thence to his Monastery. But the poor man not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the boldness to relate this vision, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him the second time repeating the same commands; which he still neglecting to perform, at the third apparition the Bishop smote him on the side with his crosier, telling him that the pain of that stroke should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, till he had performed what had been enjoyned him. The man awaking presently after, found as grievous pain in his side as if a sword had pierced it. Thus was he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to declare his vision to the Abbot, which as soon as he had done he was freed from his pain. But the Abbot would give no credit to what the man told him, but calling him clown and fool, said, must we translate and venerate the ashes of I know not what Cobler? the night following the holy Bishop appeared to the Abbot, and said, rise quickly, for I whom thou scornfully calledst Cobler have brought thee here a pair of Boots that will last a good while.

                  <hi>with care to make them sit smooth and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som. Presently the Abbot waking felt such horrible pain in his Legs, that he was not able to walk or stand, and fifteen years did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

(It may be questioning whether ever there was any such Saint or no; or calling him <hi>Girdler,</hi> as we may think by his punishment.) to him St. <hi>Ivo</hi> appeared and asked him if he knew him, he trembling, answered no. The Saint replied <hi>I am</hi> Ivo <hi>whom thou lately saidst thou didst not know and hinderedst men from keeping my Feast; Here, take this girdle and by this token remember me;</hi> and girding it about him he left him. The Monk waking found himself as it were girt with an Iron girdle, and was under horrible pains and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases till by visiting St. <hi>Ivo</hi>'s monument he recovered his health. Thus, these miracles end in some honour to a shrine or monument, which may reward the <hi>Monks</hi> well for the use of their inventions to delude the people. But did ever Christ or his Apostles testifie their sanctity by giving men such <hi>Boots</hi> and <hi>Girdles</hi> as St. <hi>Ivo</hi> did? Did they ever vindicate the honour of their Festivals in such a manner? It's true, when persons openly lied and cheated, they were once struck dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place; and when others profaned the holy institution of the Lords supper they were severely punished; but what is this, to the questioning the body of such an unknown Saint as St. <hi>Ivo?</hi> What is this, to the hindring men from keeping his Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val? Were the other such fit ends for God to
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:49657:124"/>
imploy his power in working miracles as these?

thing, viz <hi>to shew that the credibility of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in the Roman Church is taken away by the Testimony of persons much more credible than themselves.</hi> For if the most impartial Witnesses utterly deny, that there is any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison to be made between the miracles wrought in the Church in latter-ages with those wrought by Christ and hls Apostles, If persons living in the communion of that Church, have asserted such things concerning their miracles, as sufficiently discover, that their Testimony is not to be relied upon; then I appeal to the judgement of any man whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not intolerable impudence in any to parallel the mlracles of that Church with those of Christ and his Apostles?</p>

But why,</hi> saith he, <hi>were miracles use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then and not now? because the continual working of miracles would lessen faith, and our Saviour saith, Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed. But if thou wilt not be convinced without signs, thou maist see signs, although not such as Christ and his Apostles wrought,</hi> viz. <hi>the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of prophesies;</hi> several of which he there mentions. <hi>Why then,</hi> saith he, <hi>do not all believe now?</hi> to which he gives this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>that the first Christians did not believe only on the account of the miracles they saw, but by seeing the holy and exemplary lives of those who wrought them; It is,</hi> saith he, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the want of the primitive sanctity rather than miracles which makes men yet continue in their insidelity: let those that have a mind to be saved search the Scriptures, wherein they will find both the miracles they wrought and the holy conversations which they led. But if a man be found that hath any foot-steps left of the ancient wisdom he presently leaves the City and conversation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himself to the mountains, a fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is made for this to prevent the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of devotion; as though it were not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

               <p>From these Testimonies of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> thus laid together we observe these things. 1. That the main intention of miracles was to convince unbelievers. 2. That the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith being established, there was no longer any necessity of the power of miracles. 3. That though there were not any such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; yet God out of his abundant kindness, was pleased to do some extraordinary things among them in their time. 4. That in disputes about the true Church they never appealed to the Power of miracles; but to the Scriptures whose Doctrine was already confirmed by Miracles. 5. That those out
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:49657:153"/>
of the true Church might make as great a pretence to miracles, visions and revelations as those who were in it, as appears by the Donatists. 6. That some kind of miracles were wholly ceased then in the Church, as the gift of tongues and the common miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cures of diseases by those that preached. 7. That those which did then remain, were not in any respect for number or quality to be compared with those of Christ and his Apostles; as the cure of one blind man at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

They who think otherwise of Christian Religion do not know it; but design to make a Religion out of truth and falshood.</hi> Thus far that ingenuous man. By whom we see what the opinion is, which the more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious Persons in the Roman Church have of these <hi>Monkish tales and impstoures;</hi> yet they generally are for keeping them up in as much credit with the people, as they can, and discountenance those who go about to undeceive them. But is not the Testimony of these things by their own confession very credible the mean while, and fit to be compared with the Testimony upon which the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Christ and his Apostles is received in the Christian Church? It is hard to think that such men do believe Christianity in their hearts that dare publish such impudent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons.

The Abbot and Monks seeing the people make such resort thither, were willing to have it believed that miracles were wrought there.

As God never works miracles to convince obstinate Atheists, so neither doth he to gratifie the curiosity of old Women and Pilgrims; but if ever he do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> it, it is to lay a sufficient foundation for those to believe, who are otherwise destitute of the means of faith. But if such persons who are imployed upon the work of converting Infidels do want the Testimony of miracles, I know no reason to believe that he imploy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And thus much may suffice for comparing the credibility of the Testimony on which miracles are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, with that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we believe the miracles of Christ and his Apostles. Enough one would think, not only to stop the mouth of <hi>E. W.</hi> for the future, but even of Impudence it self.</p>

Some persons, among whom the Historian himself was one, asked him how he knew these things; he told them, that an Angel appeared to him in the night, and told him all the things he desired to know; and lifted him out of his bed, and after many discourses, they parted very lovingly. Although some of them suspected the imposture, yet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops who consecrated the Church with great Pomp, and applause of the People, who were innumerable, solemnised the translation of these Relicks. And although afterwards the wiser sort found out the cheat, and that the Body was taken at a venture in the night out of a Grave, yet the work of miracles went on as well as if the Martyr had been there, and the People still continued in the belief of it.

might not be discovered, and yet be sufficiently known; at first they thought of <hi>Francfort,</hi> then of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> but at last they pitched upon <hi>Bern,</hi> as most convenient, by reason of the simplicity and ignorance of the People. Four Persons were imployed as the chief Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in it, although with the consent and knowledge of the Provincial; the first was <hi>Johannes Vetter</hi> the <hi>Prior</hi> of the <hi>Convent,</hi> the second <hi>Stephanus Bolshort</hi> their Preacher, the third <hi>Franciscus Ulschi</hi> the <hi>Sub-prior,</hi> the fourth <hi>Henricus Steinscer</hi> the <hi>Procurator</hi> of the <hi>Convent.</hi> Not long after, an occasion happened for them to begin their design, a plain simple Taylor called <hi>Johannes Jets<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the <hi>Sub-prior</hi> in the night threw stones into his room, and made dreadful noises to affright him with the apprehension of Spirits disturbing him; the next day they gave him Wax Lights and holy Water and some sacred Relicks to arm him, so that he might have the courage to talk with the Spirit, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him what he was to say to it.

fright, so that he durst not answer as he was instructed; then the Spirit comes and seizes upon his Throat, as though he were going to choak him, at which he cryed out and desired to know how he might help him; for he was told it was the Soul of one in Purgatory that came for relief; then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit told him he must discipline himself for eight dayes till the blood came, and cause eight Masses to be said for him: and to say himself fifty <hi>Pater Nosters,</hi> and as many <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s for him, and at every one to kiss the ground in remembrance of <hi>Judas</hi> his kiss to Christ, and then he should be delivered: all this he promised to discover to his Superiors; the Spirit bid him not be affrighted, for he was to come again six dayes after, and to bring others with him: Immediately these things were publickly performed, and mighty flocking of the people there was upon the noise of it, and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> were cryed up to the great disgrace of the <hi>Franciscans.</hi> Against the next time, (when <hi>Stephen</hi> whom they appointed his <hi>Confessor,</hi> had found him, not mistrusting in the least any trick in it) they told him they would certainly try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was a good or evil Spirit, by two pieces of the <hi>Blessed Sacrament</hi> which they would have ready against the time the Spirit was to appear again.

               </p>
               <q>Speluncam Dido, Dux &amp; Trojanus eandem.</q>
               <p>At which (for there is an unknown quality in these words for casting out Devils) the Devil threw the Woman down, and going out of her cryed, <hi>O thou Son of</hi> Loyola, <hi>like a Lyon thou sendest me to Hell, but I beseech thee send me any where else;</hi> then <hi>Ignatius</hi> taking pity on the poor Devil, bid him go whither he would, so he possessed no body after: at which the Woman was delivered: and as the Jesuit <hi>Turrian</hi> said, she was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout servant of <hi>Ignatius</hi> all her dayes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time, a servant of Cardinal <hi>Farnese</hi> was possessed with a sullen Devil, that was resolved not to be cast out, but only by <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius;</hi> he was then called by the People, and he told them, <hi>he knew that Devil well enough,</hi>
                  <pb n="649" facs="tcp:49657:185"/>
                  <hi>he thinks to laugh at me and you too, but he shall be deceived.</hi> Therefore he gives a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Order one of the <hi>Beads</hi> of his <hi>Rosary,</hi> which was consecrated by <hi>Pius the fifth,</hi> and bid him come behind the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed person (was that fair dealing to come behind the Devil?) and to touch him, and say softly, <hi>I adjure thee in the name of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> Mary, <hi>and by command of my Father</hi> Loyola, <hi>and by the virtue of this blessed Bead to be gone.</hi> Immediately the Devil cryed out, that <hi>Loyola</hi> tormented him; but no persons saw him there abouts: the Devil then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained himself saying, that his Bead was of more force than all their Exorcisms; and so left him.</p>
               <p>The same Author tells us of his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that at <hi>Landsperg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> there was a Carter that went to his Parish Priest and told him, that the Devil did often drive him to his doors, but would not go in himself, nor let him go in; not long after, this sellow was taken and condemned for Thievery, but he pretended he was possessed with a Devil; the <hi>Jesuits</hi> hearing of it, came to him, and made use of all their Exorcisms, but to no purpose. At last the Rector of the Colledge remembring <hi>Ignatius</hi> his cunning way of coming behind the Devil, follows his method, and with an <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> commands the Devil
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:49657:186"/>
in the name of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> to be gone, but the obstinate Devil told him plainly he would not be gone, unless the man were saved from hanging. Forthwith, the <hi>Jesuits</hi> got his Pardon, and the Devil was presently gone, and the man went away and laughed in his slieve, and told others afterwards, he counterfeited being possessed, only to escape hanging. But however the <hi>Jesuits</hi> boasted of this as a great miracle, and commended the use of <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s very highly for this, and sold abundance of them (as Mountebanks do their Medicines) to the People, that were willing to be cheated. And one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society called <hi>Lutz</hi> made a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the People on the occasion of this miracle, in commendation of <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s. Many other such stories he relates of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we are not to imagine, that these subtle <hi>Jesuits</hi> only cast out Devils thus in other Countreys, for we have sufficient evidence of this Faculty of theirs here at home: For which we are to understand, that in the years 1585. and 1586. the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in <hi>England</hi> finding it necessary to animate their party to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a design then in hand, thought nothing would tend so much to it, as pretending to some great miracles. And nothing being more easie to be managed for the deceiving
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:49657:186"/>
the People, than the casting out of Devils, where they never were, this they resolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To this end they gave out, that the places where they intended to act this Scene were mightily haunted with Spirits, then they made choice of fit Persons to shew their tricks upon, which were hypochondriacal and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered men, and some hysterical and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Women, who had all of them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on such as were fast friends to the design: twelve Exorcists were imployed to act their parts in this Scene under <hi>Weston</hi> or <hi>Edmonds</hi> the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> who was the chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver and Manager of it. It happened that three of the Maid servants had been Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants; these they told that the Protestants are possessed with Devils, and that no good could be done to them till their Baptism was set right. Then to work they go with them, as to their Baptism, with their Latin Charms, their Salt, Spittle, Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and gave them new names. This being done, they took all occasions to tell them strange stories of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcisins in forrain Countreys, the manner of the fits of possessed persons, and the words they spake, and the sights they saw, how they roared at the approach of any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Relicks, how they could not abide the sight of the Sacrament, or the Priests, how they would greatly commend Hereticks, and
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:49657:187"/>
complain that they were burnt if the Priests did but touch them. By this they very well understood their parts, and they were soon put upon shewing their skill in acting them; for at the first Mass that ever one of the Maids saw, she was put into the <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> and they bound her with Towels, then one of the Priests read in his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Exorcising,</hi> but finding no alteration in her, but only from her fear, they made her drink about a Pint of Sack &amp; Sallet Oyl being hallowed and mingled with Rue and some kind of Spices, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Holy Potion.</hi> The Maid loathed the taste of it, which they told her came from the Devil, who hated nothing more than that Holy Drink, but she was forced by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to drink it up. Then she grew very sick and giddy, and fell into a cold sweat, which made her begin to believe her self pof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed. After this they burned Brimstone with other things, and made her hold down her face over the smoke of it: which they did, till they made her look black in the face. By this horrible usage, the Wench fell first into a rage, and spake she knew not what, then it intoxicated and benummed her senses, and at last she fell into a swound: and when she came to her self, told them they had almost killed her; and some of them after this usage (which was common to all whom they
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:49657:187"/>
would have believed to be possessed) were resolved rather to make away themselves, than endure i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> again. They had invented pretty names for the Devils which possessed them, <hi>Frateretto, Fliberdigibbet, Hoberdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, Tocobatto, Kellico, Porterichio, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tubizanto, Maho, Modu, &amp;c.</hi> When ever they cryed out with pain and ill usage, they still said, it was the Devil in them, so that at last they were forced to comply with them, and to say just as they would have them for their own ease. Then the work went on well, and the Devil commended the Queen and the Protestants, but declared a great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Holy Water and Relicks, especially of <hi>Campians</hi> Thumb and <hi>Brians</hi> Bones, when they applyed them to them. All the dreams they had in the night passed for Visions; and as often as the Exorcists pleased, what ever they said or did was not by themselves, but by the Devils in them. But at last, when some of their own party disliked their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and they were in great fears of having their horrible imposture discovered, they soon dispossessed all the Devils out of them. Then their care was to prevent discovery by these persons, whom they disposed of in several places, and fed with money and promises, and kept from their Friends, and sometimes threatning them, that if they confessed any
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:49657:188"/>
thing, the Devil would possess them worse than before: and withal told them, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Oath they might say any thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse themselves; but <hi>Harrington</hi> a Priest, that had taken to himself one of the Wenches af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, under pretence of marrying her; told <hi>Friswood Williams</hi> which was her right name, that if she were examined upon Oath, the Church did dispence with her, so as she might answer what she thought good not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding; because an Oath did not bind her to confess any thing that might tend to the dishonour of their Priesthood, or of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
               <p>Before this imposture was discovered, it did the Priests very great service, for <hi>Anthony Tyrrell</hi> one of the <hi>Priests</hi> in his examination confessed, that in the compass of half a year, they had gained five hundred persons to their Church; and some said three or four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. And the Priests had written several Books concerning the miracles wrought by them, full of most notorious forgeries, as appeared by the particular examination of the Persons pretended to be dispossessed by them. <hi>Tyrell</hi> said that <hi>Weston</hi> the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> had written a Quire of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Visions</hi> of <hi>Mainey</hi> one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons out of whom he said he had cast out Devils; and another Book to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:49657:188"/>
of this power in their Church, and to shew the vertue of holy Relicks especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their late Tyburn Saints, <hi>Campian, Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>in, Brian</hi> and <hi>Coltam.</hi> This business making so much noise put the Persons in Authority upon enquiring more strictly into it; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at last seized upon some of the Persons concerned in it, in their several examinations upon oath they confessed the whole cheat, as I have delivered it from them. Their exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations were entred upon Record in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>High-commission,</hi> and afterwards published <hi>A. D.</hi> 1604. with a particular declaration of the whole imposture. In which any person may satisfie himself of the Truth of what I have reported, and abundance of circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which I have omitted. <hi>Tyrell</hi> the Priest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his oath <hi>June</hi> 15. 1602. declared in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session written with his own hand, that having perused the examinations of <hi>Sara Williams</hi> and <hi>Friswood</hi> her sister, of <hi>Anne Smith</hi> and of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Mainey,</hi> he was fully perswaded that they have deposed the truth in such points whereof they were examined belonging to their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed possession or dispossession. The effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, saith he, is, <hi>that they were drawn by our cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning carriage of matters, to seem, as though they had been possessed, when as in truth they were not, neither were any of the Priests ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in my Conscience of their dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>

For the general conceit,</hi> saith he, <hi>among all the Priests of that Order is, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any thing, which being confessed doth turn to the dishonour of the Catholick Church of</hi> Rome: and concludes his confession with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that they do not account it evil, (as I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily think) to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

While the Physitians were by, she lay very still, but she no sooner thought them gone, but she was at her old tricks. Then these Physitians were shut out and others brought in, who would be more favourable to the design; and by these a certificate was drawn up attested by themselves that she was really possessed; and an Abbot affirmed that when she was held by six men she got above their heads four foot into the air and there stood. When this account of her was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, <hi>Marescot</hi> confuted it answering all their arguments and giving an account of all the strange Symptoms which were s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Clermont</hi> and his Brother carried her away to <hi>Avignon,</hi> and refused to obey the summons sent them by the Parliament; and the King sent to Cardinal <hi>Ossat</hi> his Ambassador at <hi>Rome</hi> to acquaint the Pope with the whole matter, before they came thither: It happened that <hi>sirmondus</hi> was then with Cardinal <hi>Ossat,</hi> him he imploys to the General of the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Jesuits</hi> (who were suspected to be friends to the Brothers who had been bred up in their Society) that if they medled in this matter, it would be their greatest hindrance to their restitution in <hi>France,</hi> which they had then good hopes of.

dispossessed. Thus we see what intrigues and designes are carried on by such impostures in the Roman Church; that when such things escape examination they pass for Miracles, but when they are throughly searched into, they appear to be meer cheats and impostures.</p>

Among which were two notable Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I cannot omit: One was the <hi>Rood</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> at <hi>Boxley</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> which being made with divers vices to turn the eyes and move the lips was shewed publickly at St. <hi>Pauls Cross</hi> by <hi>John Bishop of Rochester</hi> and there broken and pulled in pieces. The other was at <hi>Hales</hi> in <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> where the Blood of Christ brought from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept (as was affirmed) for divers Ages, had drawn many great offerings to it from remote places: and it was said to have this
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:49657:192"/>
property, that if a man were in mortal sin, and not absolved he could not see it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise very well: Therefore every man that came to behold this Miracle confest himself first to a Priest there, and then offering some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Altar, was directed to a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel where the Relick was shewed; the Priest who confest him (in the mean while) retiring himself to the back part of the said Chappel, and putting forth a Cabinet or Tabernacle of Chrystal, which being thick on the one side that nothing could be seen through it, but on the other side thin and transparent they used diversely: For if a rich and devout man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which yet (as my Author a Clerk of the Council to <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth and living in those times affirms) was proved to be the blood of a Duck every week renewed by the Priests, who kept the secret betwixt them.

               <p>I leave it now to the judgement of the Reader, what credit such Miracles deserve, which are reported by Persons who think it lawful to lie in these matters, and which, where strict examination hath been made, have been discovered so often to be notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impostures? And this may abundantly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the first particular, which was the comparing the Miracles of the Roman Church with those of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in point of credibility.</p>
               <p>Â§. 12. 2. I come to compare them as to <note place="margin">Their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do not prove their Churches Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> the Testimony given by them to Infallibility, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether the Miracles supposed to be wrought in the Roman Church do equally prove that Church Infallible as those wrought by Christ and his Apostles did prove them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="664" facs="tcp:49657:193"/>
For clearing of this I shall premise these particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is agreed on both sides, that the miracles wrought by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, did sufficiently prove that they were Teachers sent from God. For we are assured by the universal Testimony of all Christians (not contradicted by their greatest Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) that the first Preachers of the Christian Religion did work so many, so publick, so great miracles, that all impartial Persons could not but look upon them as persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately sent by God. And Christ himself declared <hi>that this was</hi> the end for which he did those miraculous works, <hi>that men might</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 11. 5. John 5. 36. 15. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>believe by them that God had sent him,</hi> that without these <hi>men might have had an excuse for their Insidelity,</hi> that <hi>his works did bear witness of him;</hi> And his Evangelist declares, <hi>that this was the end for which these miracles are recorded, that men might believe that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">20. 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Jesus was the son of God.</hi> Afterwards, when he was risen from the dead and he sent abroad his Disciples to preach the Gospel, he told them that <hi>God would bear them witness by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 16. 17, 18. Heb. 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>divers signs and miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost,</hi> of which we have a full account in the Books of the new Testament. As to all which miracles we have not the least ground of suspicion of any fraud or imposture, being
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:49657:193"/>
publickly done in the presence of enemies, and written in a time when the Testimony of Writers might be easily contradicted, and when all imaginable way's were used to make the first Witnesses of these things to recant their Testimonies, by the greatest severities and persecutions: in stead of which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with great resolution and laid down their lives rather than weaken the Testimony which they had given. Thus we see such great and extraordinary effects of Divine Power which we ought to call miracles, were wrought by Christ and his Apostles on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to confirm their own Authority that they were Persons sent from God, and therefore could not deceive the World in the doctrine delivered by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Authority and Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles being thus confirmed by the miracles wrought by them, there cannot be any such necessity in succeeding Ages to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the same doctrine by miracles. For if it were once fully proved by those miracles then wrought, there can want nothing further to establish the faith of succeeding Ages than a certain conveyance of those miracles to them. Those miracles being wrought for the benefit of succeeding Ages, as well as of that present Age: And if those miracles would not serve for the Ages following as well as that present
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:49657:194"/>
time, it might with as much reason be said that then they did serve only for those who saw them. For on the same ground that Persons then, in regard of distance of Place, were bound to believe although they did not see them wrought; so likewise are others in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of distance of time, only supposing the certainty of conveyance to be equal. But it is with much advantage to us, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Testimony of so many Ages, and the effects of the doctrine confirmed by those miracles upon so many nations of the World, not with standing all the Power and subtility which were used against it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The less the necessity and the greater the pretence to miracles, so much more reason there is to suspect them. Because God, we are certain, doth not imploy his Power in going beyond the common effects of nature to little or no purpose. When we see, that in all the writings of Scripture miracles were very sparingly wrought, unless it were for the confirmation of a new Religion, as that of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ;</hi> if asterwards we find such abundance of miracles pretended to, that no Age or Country of one sort of men, but give out that multitudes of these are done among them, what, must we think that God hath changed the Method of his Providence? and not rather, that God is true, but such
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:49657:194"/>
men are liars, or through ignorance and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity take those for miracles which are not so.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Those cannot be true miracles which are pretended to be wrought to confirm a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contrary to what is already confirmed by miracles. For God will never imploy his power to contradict himself; he may in the establishing of one Religion foretel the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of another afterwards in its room by his own appointment as in the Gospel succeeding the Law; but the latter miracles in this case do not contradict, but rather confirm the doctrine of the former; but when he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that no other Religion shall come into the world after that which is confirmed by miracles, as it is with the Christian Religion, then to suppose miracles wrought to confirm any doctrine contrary to that, is to suppose that God by miracles should contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Therefore although in the beginning of a Religion, the doctrine is to be proved by miracles, yet that being once supposed, miracles afterwards are to be tryed by the doctrine. And then though an Angel from heaven should preach or offer to confirm any other doctrine by miracles than that which was first confirmed by Christ and his Apostles, we are bound to reject that doctrine and to suspect those miracles not to be from God.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="668" facs="tcp:49657:195"/>
5. Where false and lying miracles are foretold by a doctrine confirmed by true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; there can be no reason to believe upon such miracles till they are evidently distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from such as are deceitful. Now this is plainly the case in the Christian Religion, Christ himself hath foretold that <hi>men shall arise doing such great wonders in imitation</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>of him as should deceive if it were possible the very elect;</hi> and his Apostles: <hi>that his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est enemies should appear with all power and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>signs and lying wonders.</hi> Can any thing be now more reasonable than after such fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings for us to examine all pretences of miracles, by trying whether they can be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently distinguished from all deceitfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of miracles; which may be wrought by a power less than divine? For in this case the evidence must be such, as the persons concerned are to judge by; to tell them any distinctions which they cannot proceed by in the judgement of miracles, is to speak imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, where rules of Judgement are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If the continuance of the power of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles be asserted to prove the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in every Age, there must not only evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof be given that such miracles are wrought, but that they are wrought for this very end. For if God may work miracles for
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:49657:195"/>
another end, either to shew his Providence in general, or particular Regard to some men, then the meer proving miracles cannot be sufficient, but it must be shewed that these miracles could be wrought for no other end, but to prove the Church infallible.</p>
               <p>These things being premised I now come to shew.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the Roman Church, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give any evident distinction between the miracles they pretend to, and such which we are bid to beware of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they can never prove that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought in their Church could be wrought for no other end, than to prove the infallibility of their Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the Roman Church they cannot give any evident distinction between their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and such as we are bid to beware of. For which we are to consider, that scarce any Religion or superstition hath obtained in the world, but it hath pretended to be confirmed by some kind of mirac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>es; which in it self is no more a prejudice to true miracles than sophistical arguments are to true reasoning. But those who pretend to miracles in a Church which is founded on a doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by undoubted miracles must give such evidence of the truth of them, as may appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently distinguish them from all false pretences.
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:49657:196"/>
For if they give no other answers to such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of miracles as they condemn in others, but what will destroy the Authority of the miracles asserted by themselves, then they can prove no more the Churches infallibility by their miracles, than either Philosophers; Heathens, or Hereticks could do by theirs. If the bare pretence of miracles would serve, for all that I know <hi>Pythagoras</hi> might deserve at least as much esteem as St. <hi>Francis,</hi> or St. <hi>Dominick;</hi> for the Scholars of the one delivered as unanimously the report of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as the Disciples of the other could do. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his taming the <hi>Daunian Bear,</hi> (reported saith <hi>Porphyrie</hi> in his life by ancient Writers of good credit) and charging him <note place="margin">Porphyr. vit. Pythag.</note> never after to hurt any living Creature, was to my understanding as great a miracle as St. <hi>Francis</hi> his taming the Wolf. And his whispering the <hi>Tarentine Bull</hi> in the ear and perswading him to eat no more bean's, (who for his great abstinence afterwards was called <hi>the sacred Bull)</hi> was altogether as good an argument of the restoring the State of Innocency to him, as the command over brute Creatures was to St. <hi>Francis,</hi> or any other Legendary Saints. The Rivers saluting him (whether it were called <hi>Caucasus</hi> as <hi>Porphyrie</hi> hath it, or <hi>Nessus</hi> as <hi>Laertius,</hi> and <hi>Jamblichus,</hi> or <hi>Cosas</hi> as <hi>Aelian,</hi> or what ever were the true
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:49657:196"/>
name of it) was as great an argument of his Sanctity, as the Trees in <hi>Tursellinus,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Chappel of <hi>Loreto</hi> were of the miraculous sanctity of it. Why should not his being seen at the same time at <hi>Metapont</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Tauromenium</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> be as great a wonder, as the being seen in several places at once has being reported of several of the Romish Saints? Why should not his <hi>gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thigh</hi> be as miraculous, as the restored Leg at <hi>Zaragosa?</hi> unless the <hi>Priest Abaris</hi> be proved a falser witness, than <hi>Hieronimus Brizids;</hi> or the people of <hi>Zarogosa</hi> less su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected of partiality, than the <hi>Greeks,</hi> at the <hi>Olympick</hi> games: at which some Authors tell us <hi>Pythagoras</hi> shewed his <hi>Golden thigh.</hi> Why should St. <hi>Francis</hi> his <hi>Asse</hi> that stood still to hear him preach, be more miraculous, than the <hi>Asse,</hi> which <hi>Suidas</hi> reports, heard <hi>Ammonianus</hi> his <hi>Lectures?</hi> Why should the <note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the making faith credible by miracles doth suppose those miracles to be first certainly known to be such; but in this case, if the power of the Devil can extend so far, as that no certain difference can be assigned between true and apparent miracles, but from the Churches approbation, how is it possible the Church should be certainly known by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, if the miracles cannot be certainly known but by the Church? So that for us to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the miracles done by Hereticks and those in the Catholick Church, we must appeal to the judgement of the Catholick Church; and yet our way to know, which is the Catholick Church saith <hi>E.

<pb n="679" facs="tcp:49657:200"/>
did discover the imposture, when true miracles were wrought in opposition to them, as in <hi>Pharaohs Magicians</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus:</hi> otherwise God would not permit evil men to work miracles. 3. That God hath given a most certain rule for the tryal of miracles <hi>viz. God is faithful and cannot deny himself:</hi> and therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Author of miracles whereby things contrary to each other are confirmed. Wherefore saith he, if a saith once esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by miracles be impugned by other miracles, we are to believe the latter mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to be meer imposture. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, <hi>that Jesus Christ is not yea and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cor. 1. 19, 20. Gal. 1. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>nay, but a Yea and Amen;</hi> and <hi>although we or an Angel from heaven preach another Gospel, let him be Anathema:</hi> See the wisdom of the Apostle: He brings us back to the first preaching, which was not lightly established but with innumerable miracles, which were most certain and most manifest: from whence he concludes that all others that are brought to confirm any doctrine contrary to this ought to be rejected. But of what sort? even though an Angel or an Apostle should preach another doctrine; for, saith he, among things impossible, that is the most impossible that God should lie: which is far more impossible than that
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:49657:201"/>
an Angel should; and consequently what God hath once attested by miracles, can be less salse than when an Angel hath attested; or the Apostle spake this, that by this means we may discover the Devil, when he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms himself into an Angel of light. 4. If any true miracles were wrought among Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Infidels, as it may be some were; yet none were ever wrought to confirm any falshood or error, but for some truth, or some benefit to mankind, among which he reckons the miracles of <hi>Claudia</hi> the <hi>Roman Lady</hi> and of the <hi>vestal virgin</hi> to give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to their innocency. After this he descends to a more particular examination of the miracles of Hereticks and false Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and as to these he lays down these propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. 1. That miracles are of two kinds, some strictly and properly so called, which are effects exceeding all created Powers, either as to the substance or the manner of them; as the curing a man born blind, the raising the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others, are such as exceed the common power of nature, although there may be some secret and hidden causes of them that may lie within the compass of nature. The first sort he saith, are the only undoubted testimonies of truth; but the other may be wrought by the Devils power, either by local motion, or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:49657:201"/>
of the power of natural Agents. Of this sort, saith he, are the miracles done by false Christs and false Prophets and by Antichrist; and among these he reckons all manner of cures, when the diseases are not wholly incurable. 2. He saith that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this later sort are equivocal signs and may be referred to different causes, and therefore nothing can be determined by them considered in themselves; because they may be done by a different power and for a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent end. When they are done for osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or delight, or curiosity, they cannot have God for their Author; much less when they are wrought to confirm a false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or for an evil end: therefore when such miracles are wrought for confirmation of an error they have not God but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for their cause. For although they be aequivocal of themselves, yet the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them to an evil end such as the confirmation of an error is, takes away all aequivocalness in them. 3. He asserts, that true and proper miracles in the first sense, although most commonly wrought by good men as Gods instruments, yet may sometimes be done, by wicked men, and Hereticks and Infidels. For which he instances in <hi>Balaam,</hi> and those our Saviour mentions, who should boast of the miracles they had wrought in
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:49657:202"/>
his name, which Christ doth not deny, but only rejects them for being workers of iniquity; and in <hi>Judas,</hi> who wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles with the other Apostles, although we do not read that the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> or <hi>Joseph,</hi> or <hi>John</hi> the Baptist ever wrought any. He observes from St. <hi>Austin</hi> that God gives this power of miracles to evil men when he denies it to good. 1. Lest the power should be attributed to the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or seem to take its vertue from thence. 2. Because miracles are not wrought for the good of the efficient, but for the good of others. 3. Lest men should set a higher value upon miracles than upon true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and vertue. For, Saith he, this is a false consequence, such a man does mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, therefore he is approved or his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; such a place miracles are wrought in, therefore such a place is approved; for by this consequence, wicked men, Hereticks and Infidels would be approved, of whom it is certain that they have wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. 4. Such kind of miracles though they may be done by Hereticks can never be wrought sor the confirmation of error; for that were to charge God himself with falshood; but miracles of the other sort he grants may be wrought for the confirmation os errors, because they are such as do not
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:49657:202"/>
exceed the Devils power: and in this case to know whether they come from God or the Devil, must be taken from the end for which they are wrought;</q> as he shews from S. <hi>Austin.</hi> From which discourse of <hi>Lingendes</hi> it follows, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s any; nay God himself may use them as his Instruments to confirm Truth by; but we are sure God cannot imploy his Power to confirm a falshood. Since therefore we are forewarned that men shall appear with such signs and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, <hi>as would if it were possible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very Elect;</hi> since no distinction can be made from the things themselves between the effects of a created invisible power, and of a divine in most things which pass for mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; since Hereticks may be Gods instruments in the most divine miracles for a good end, it necessarily follows that the pretence of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles is far from proving the truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church wherein they are wrought, till it be made appear, that they are truly divine miracles, that they are wrought for this end to prove this Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and that the Churches infallibility

doth not contradict any part of that doctrine which hath been already confirmed by the miracles of Christ and his Apostles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They can never prove that the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought in the Roman Church, were wrought for no other end but to prove the Infallibility of their Church. When Christ and his Apostles wrought miracles to prove their Infallibility, they wrought the miracles themselves, and declared that this was the end for which they were wrought that men might believe <hi>that they were Teachers sent from God;</hi> but there is nothing like this in the miracles of the Roman Church: They are generally pretended to be done at some Shrine or Monument, or by a vision of some Saint, and among the most credulous people, but by no means for the satisfaction of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels or Hereticks, whose very presence is enough to spoil a well contrived miracle; but supposing the things true which are reported, what doth a restored Leg to a poor Boy at <hi>Zaragosa</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> signifie to the proof of the Roman Churches Infallibility? or <hi>Father Marcellus</hi> his cure at <hi>Naples</hi> by a vision of <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verius,</hi> to the proof of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourths Creed? If they will prove any thing by this way of miracles, let their Missionaries here among us, whom they account Infidels and Hereticks, do the same things that Christ and his Apostles

to return to <hi>Zacchias: miracles,</hi> saith he, <hi>are made so common among us, as though God had nothing else to do with his Power but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the course of nature by it at the beck of any idle fellow; as it God did not manage his power, as he does all things else, with infinite wisdom; as if God imployed his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power without great and most urgent causes. For when it was necessary to shew his power for the confirmation of the Christian Religion and the Satisfaction of unbelievers, then all persons might see the wonderful works of God: but now,</hi> saith he, <hi>when the Truth of Christianity is known it would be to no purpose for God to shew so many miracles. But whence then comes it, that so many miracles are still talked of? This arises,</hi> saith he, <hi>from the devotion of some who attribute ordinary effects of nature to a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Power; and from the Superstitious folly and fraud of others who will not endure any thing cryed up for a miracle should be ever questioned by any; but say, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, Atheistical,</hi> and which is somewhat worse, <hi>heretical to do it.
