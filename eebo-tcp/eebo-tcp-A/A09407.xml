            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, if poyſon be giuen to anie

or if any haue vnawares, as manie
times it chaunceth, taſted any dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of the ſicke man, and in ſome conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Lyquor let him drinke it vp,
and if the poyſon haue béene but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

time the Venom haue béeue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
and carryed to the inwarde
veynes yet being well couered in his
bedde, he ſhall happily driue it out by


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11129:7"/>
ſweating. The Lyquors that are
moſt méeteſt to take it with, are theſe:
the water of <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi>
Dyuils bitt, ſwallowwort.</p>
            <p>The water of the rootes of the

            <p>Secondly, againſt the plague it
may be vſed in the like maner, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when it is to be giuen vnto ſuch

neither muſt you omit to take a little

by the playſter.</p>
            <p>Herewithall muſt you remember
after the receit of the medicine to take
a toſte wet in very good vinager, and
to cauſe the patient to holde it to his

            <p>Fourthly, it doth wonderfully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage
the paynes and raging of the

            <p>Ninthly, if this earth be put in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
playſter ſtéeped in any lyquor, or
receiued any wayes into the body, it
perfectly cureth al paines, inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:11129:11"/>
Tenthly, it healeth Itches, Scabs,
Rybes, Skuruineſſe, Mangies, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch filthy diſeaſes of the ſkinne
and maketh the ſkinne ſmoth and
white, if ſo be it be diſſolued in ſpring
water or plantyne water, if the foule

            <p>Laſtly, this earth of ours doth
helpe the quinſey, inward inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
vlcered Lungs, and ſuch other
inward diſeaſes, if a dramme of it be
taken in any water proper to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
and likewiſe it cureth all Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes,
and Illyacke paſſions. Theſe
are in effect the vertues of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
earth, as farre as I haue hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
had experience. Other vertues of
this bleſſed earth doubtleſſe there are
many, which I leaue to the experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the learned Phiſitions. Onely
this I will tell them, that this earth
is of the nature of the Sunne, or of
Golde, for it groweth in no place
but in the golde mynes in the midſt
of the rockes, as doth the precious
ſtone. (I meane the yellow earth, for


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11129:11"/>
the white is in the ſiluer mynes, and
likely it is that euery mettal elſe hath
his proper vole or earth as I geſſe,
for as yet I haue not fully vnderſtood
it.) Whereupon it is called by <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi>
in the firſt parte of his great
Surgery and in other places, the
greace of the Sunne, becauſe it hath
in it ſome ſhewe of fatneſſe. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
I haue had of ſome ſkilfull Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſts
two ſortes of earth, the one
drawen from golde, the other from
ſiluer very like vnto theſe of ours,
which ſo being, out of all doubt that
earth of ours being as it ought to be
prepared and applyed, will cure all
thoſe gréeuous diſeaſes that golde it
ſelfe being prepared according to Art
will cure, which I leaue to the ſearch
of the wiſe and learned Phiſitions:
For my ſelfe it ſufficeth to haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the way to others, whereby they
may garniſh and aduaunce the glory
of God and our Countrey.</p>
            <p>In fine, theſe and other many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes
ſondry Doctors haue dayly
found out, eſpecially in the falling


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11129:12"/>
ſickeneſſe, wherein they haue founde
by good tryall and experience that
diuers infected with that diſeaſe, by
taking of this earth gotten in the
golden myne, haue béene throughly
deliuered, ſo as they haue not anie
time after béene touched with it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I heartely deſire
all ſuch to whoſe handes this earth
hath come, and who haue had any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of it, that if ſo be they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to haue any other experience of
it eyther by themſelues or others,
than a number of learned men haue
tryed (whoſe witneſſe of great credite
yea, euen of Magiſtrates and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before whom it hath béene tryed
I haue ſet downe,) that for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
of the diſeaſed, brotherly chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and commodity of the vniuerſall
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Chriſt, they would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to ſend mee word of it hither into
<hi>Sileſia,</hi> where I remaine in a towne
called <hi>Kupfferberg,</hi> or to aduertiſe
the famous &amp; moſt learned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
D. Ihon <hi>Montanus</hi> Doctor in
Phiſicke, now dwelling at <hi>Striga.</hi>

Touching the names of both the
white and the yellow earth, to ſpeake
ſomething thereof, I truſt there is no
man that can iuſtly be offended with
me, in that I haue termed the white
earth digged out of the ſiluer mines,
by the name of mynerall vnycorne,
wherein I haue not ſo much here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
mine owne fanſie (though it
may be permitted to the Inuentors
to giue names to ſuch things as they
haue found out) as the counſell and
aduiſe of the beſt Myners, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Phiſicke, who commonly giue
names according to the effect &amp; qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the medicine, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the outward ſhape or ſhewe
onely, as the vnlearned vſe to doe:
Or becauſe I haue called the yellow
earth the greaſe of the Sunne, being
gotten out of the golde mynes, and
afterwards with great diligence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.
For I haue found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the yellow earth hath the
ſame force and vertue in curing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
that golde it ſelfe hath: as the
white hath the vertues of ſiluer. So


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11129:13"/>
as good reaſon to mee it ſéemes, to
name them according to the thinges
whereof they take their force. If
theſe names diſpleaſe any man, the

he had a moſt excellent kinde of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra

great force againſt ſundrie diſeaſes:
but alſo a moſt vndoubted remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all manner of venemous poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as had béene prooued by ſundrie
witneſſes vpon a great number of
dogges, which made me alſo deſirous
to ſée the triall of it. It happened at
the ſame time, that one called <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del

by our Iuſtices, confeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
guilty of a great number of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries:
And therefore brought to the
barre was condemned to bee hanged.
Being yet deteined in priſon, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to his eare that there was ſuch
a medicine, ſo ſoueraigne againſt
ſundrie ſickneſſes, and the moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

his friends, of which there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
no ſmall number, deſiring for the

life, that being thus condemned, hee,
might haue giuen vnto him the moſt
deadly poiſon that might be deuiſed,
whereby a perfit triall might bee had
of the worthines of this medicinable
earth. And in this reſpect, not onely
for this pittifull requeſt of his: but
alſo for the commoditie and benefite
of all Chriſtendome, (if ſo be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
prooue anſwearable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
pardoning the offender, wee
graunted his life vpon that condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Therefore the day of the date of

Countie <hi>George Friderick</hi> of <hi>Hohen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe,</hi>

mingled with Conſerue of

a dram of the <hi>Terra Sigillata</hi> in olde
