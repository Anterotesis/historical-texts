Wherein are briefly exhibited, amongst many other things, the rigidly-Presbyterian both principles and practice. A vindication of Grotius from Mr. Baxter. of Mr. Baxter from Mr. Barlee. of Episcopal divines from both together. To which is added an appendage touching the judgement of the right Honourable and right Reverend Father in God, Iames Lord primate of Armagh, and metropolitan of Ireland, irrefragably attested by the certificates of Dr. Walton, Mr. Thorndike, and Mr. Gunning, sent in a letter to Doctor Bernard.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A Manifeſtation by ſeverall Inſtances, that Dr. Bernard never pretended to prove the <hi>Negative</hi> to that which was <hi>Affirm</hi>'d by T. P. concerning the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>late Primate</hi> as to the controverted points. That matter is ventilated in ſeverall Letters to Dr. Bernard. In the firſt it is evinced, that T. P. ſpake ſafely of the ſaid Primate, on which ſide ſoever the Truth might lye; and that the caſe of Mr. Barlee is very ſad on all hands. The ſame things with more advantage are evinced in the ſecond. The third Letter ſheweth, that the Primates Honour was advanced in the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his change. The Aſperſions caſt upon the Primate by Mr. B. as well as on Biſhop Overall, with whom the Primate at laſt concurr'd. The great Harmony and Agreement between the judgement of the Primate as it is lately ſet forth by Dr. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, and the Doctrin deliver'd in the Books of T. P. The fourth Letter doth make a <hi>parallel</hi> of the Primates judgement with the writings of T. P. in 13 particulars. Then ſheweth the <hi>inconſiſtence</hi> of the Primates judgement with M. B's in 15 particulars. wherein is alſo included <hi>Bp. Andrews</hi> his vindication. The fifth Letter exhibiteth the three <hi>Certificates,</hi> by which T. P. was induced to believe and publiſh the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates change: the firſt from Dr. Walton; the ſecond from Mr. Gunning; the third from Mr. Thorndike. Vpon which, ſatisfaction is required of ſuch Calviniſts, as have adorn'd their Doctrins by unjuſtly uſurping the Primates Name. His Grace of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh is farther proved to have changed his former judgement, by the Iriſh Articles concluded A. D. 1615. and by the late account which Dr. Bernard gave of it. To which is added the Primates care, that Dr. Iackſon's writings might be preſerved. And Mr. Baxters Cenſure of St. Auſtin, as <hi>unſound,</hi> and <hi>againſt Scripture,</hi> in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, wherein 'tis collected from Dr. Bernard, that the Primates judgement agreed with Auſtin's.</p>

               <p>Mr. B's Abuſes of <hi>other</hi> men, (as well as of <hi>me,</hi> and of <hi>himſelf,)</hi> eſpecially of his <hi>own Party;</hi> and his incomparable miſtakes in thoſe of the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> the <hi>late Primate, Bp. Davenant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>§. 1. Mr. B. taking it for granted, upon the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Fancy, that he had done me ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſavour, <hi>concludes</hi> from <hi>no-premiſſes, that I</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>diſcover my ſelf to be a Monster of ingratitude for having</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of my being a <hi>Monſter</hi> of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to <hi>Mr. B.</hi> becauſe he abuſed his beſt friends without my conſent, and was reproved by me for it.</note> 
                  <hi>written a tedious letter to him,</hi> and made that uſe of his Anſwer which he expreſſeth <hi>ch. 2. p. 50. lin.</hi> 14, 15. &amp;c.]</q> Where the ingratitude doth lye, I ſhall leave it to be conſider'd by this impartiall account of that whole matter. When I had publiſhed a <hi>true</hi> Copy of my Notes to prevent the publiſhing of a <hi>falſe</hi> one, I was told, (which ſince I find was true) that Mr. Barlee had a deſigne to print as much of that falſe one as he thought might be uſefull to do his work. Againſt this I thought fit to preadmoniſh him in a letter. Adviſing him firſt, to live in ſilence, and not to trouble the Preſſe with breach of charity or peace. Or if that might not be, that he would then keep cloſe to the proper ſubject of debate; and neither call me by <hi>ill names,</hi> nor affirm any thing to be <hi>mine,</hi> which I had already ſo very <hi>heartily</hi> and ſo <hi>knowingly</hi> diſown'd. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving voted me already to be a Papiſt, and a Pelagian, (and a Socinian into the bargain) ſhould he proceed to aſperſions from I knew not what <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> copied out with <hi>his Ink,</hi> why might he not accuſe me of having ſaid <hi>Maſſe,</hi> or of any thing elſe which might be matter of <hi>ſequeſtration?</hi> With how much reaſon I did this, <hi>both</hi> his books have made appear. For
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118909:49"/>
what I ſuſpected only as <hi>poſſible,</hi> he hath abundantly <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,</hi> notwithſtanding all thoſe premonitions, with which my ſelf and others did very affectionately oblige him. But the word <hi>ſequeſtration</hi> did ſo <hi>ſting</hi> him (as he pretended) that he <q>wonder'd <hi>(in his next letter)</hi> at my monſtrous unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe, for repreſenting him to my miſgiving fancy, as if he had nothing of an Eccleſiaſtick, of a Chriſtian, of a Gentleman, of a Scholar, of a Neighbour left in him.</q> So great a <hi>ſin</hi> did he reckon a <hi>ſequeſtration.</hi> He farther added, that <q>even then when his principles did ſeem moſt to lead him to the liking of the ſequeſtration of unworthy Eccleſiaſticks, yet even then he was ſo much for Eccleſiaſtica Eccleſiaſtice, and juſta juſte, as that, he bleſſed God for it, he never had, nor ever would have, nor ever in that way hoped to have, any hand or finger in that pye. Now comes the jeſt.</q> For having Noted <hi>ſequeſtrations</hi> with ſuch a <hi>black Coal,</hi> and ſtartled at the mention of ſuch a <hi>Bugg,</hi> as if he thought it a <hi>Scarlet ſin;</hi> and being afterwards put in mind, <hi>who</hi> they were that grew <hi>luſty</hi> upon that very <hi>Dish</hi> which he thought <hi>Poyſon,</hi> (and <hi>bleſſed God</hi> that his <hi>finger</hi> was <hi>never in it;)</hi> he tells the world even in <hi>Print,</hi> 
               <q>that <hi>ſome of his friends</hi> (his deareſt Friends and Patrons too)</q>

               <q>
                  <hi>but he did not think of them when he wrote what he did.</hi>
               </q> Who ſaith he did? or who can think it? Had he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd at <hi>that inſtant</hi> what now he tells us, he would not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have <hi>us'd</hi> them as accidentally he did. He would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have leſſen'd and <hi>excuſed</hi> that Fact, then have <hi>loaded</hi> it (as he did) with ſo many <hi>heavy aggravations.</hi> What he ſaith, <hi>he never heard of his three ſpeciall Friends,</hi> and the <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> which he makes betwixt <hi>having a finger in the pye of ſequeſtring, and living upon</hi>

After that the Religion reſtored by King Edw: the ſixth was ſoon overthrown, &amp;c. we in Scotland felt the effect of it. Whereupon Mr. Knox writes to the Queen Regent, that ſhe was ſupreme head of the Church; and charged her, as ſhe would anſwer it before Gods Tribunall, to take care of Chriſt his Evangill, and of ſuppreſſing the Popiſh Prelates, who withſtood the ſame. But how long, trow you, did this continue? Even ſo long, till by her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Popiſh Biſhops were repreſſed, Himſelf and his Adherents were brought in and well ſettled, and by
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118909:50"/>
theſe means made ſtrong enough to undertake the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Reformation themſelves. Then loe, they began to make ſmall account of her ſupremacy, nor would longer reſt on her Authority; but took the cauſe into their own hand, and according to that more light wherewith they were illuminated, made a further Reformation of Religion. How they uſed that poor Lady my Mother, is not unknown, and with grief I may remember it. Who, becauſe ſhe had not been otherwiſe inſtructed, did deſire only a private Chappel, wherein to ſerve God after her manner, with ſome few ſelected perſons: but her ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was not ſufficient to obtain it at their hands. And how they dealt with me in my minority, you all know. It was not done ſecretly, and though I vvould, I cannot conceal it. I vvill apply it thus.</q> And then putting his Hand to his Hat, his Majeſty ſaid; <q>My Lords the Biſhops, I may thank you that theſe men do thus plead for my ſupremacy. They think they cannot make their party good againſt you, but by appealing unto it: as if you, or ſome that adhere unto you, vvere not vvell-affected tovvards it. but if once you vvere out, <hi>and they</hi> in place, I knovv vvhat vvould become of my ſupremacy. No Biſhop, no King, as before I ſaid. Neither do I ſpeak at random, vvithout ground: for I have obſerved ſince my coming into England, that ſome preachers before me, can be content to pray for James King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Faith; but as for ſupreme Governor, in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and over all perſons (as vvell Eccleſiaſticall as Civill) they paſſe that over vvith ſilence; and vvhat Cut they have been of, I have aftervvards learn'd.</q> Thus far King James.

            </p>
            <p>In a word; 1. That the <hi>Scotish Presbyterian Diſcipline</hi> doth utterly overthrow the rights of Magiſtrates, to convocate ſynods, to confirm their Acts, to order Eccleſiaſticall affairs, and to reform the Church in their Dominions; 2. That it robs the Magiſtrate of the laſt appeal of his ſubjects; 3. That it exempts the Miniſters from due puniſhment; 4. That it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the ſupreme Magiſtrate to their extremeſt cenſures, and the ſaddeſt effects of them; 5. That it robs the Magiſtrate of his diſpenſative power; 6. That it takes from the Magiſtrate his civill power about Religion; 7. That it challengeth this exorbitant power to it ſelf by no leſſe then the pretenſe of <hi>Divine Right;</hi> 8. That it makes a monſter of any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth wherein it is ſuffer'd to prevail; 9. That it is moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to Parlaments, and indeed deſtructive to them; 10. That it is cruell and oppreſſive to particular perſons, whoſe tender conſciences will not ſuffer them to comply; 11. That it is hurtfull to all <hi>orders</hi> and ranks of men; the Reader may eaſily collect out of their own Relations of it in their <hi>Books of Diſcipline.</hi> Or if the Reader ſhall think thoſe Books too big, and not very eaſily to be met with, he may help himſelf a nearer way, by conſulting that little <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> (cheaply bought and ſoon read) intitled, <hi>A fair warning to take heed of the Scotish Diſcipline,</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>page,</hi> that I ſpeak of a <hi>converſion</hi> or change of judgement in <hi>Philip Melanchthon</hi> and my <hi>ſelf,</hi> whom yet I meant not to call <hi>Apoſtates.</hi> Nay, thirdly, I did not <hi>expreſſe</hi> a change of judgement in any <hi>one</hi> of the ſix who are expreſly named by Mr. B.

Fifthly, or if I had ſaid any ſuch thing, I had ſaid no worſe of <hi>them,</hi> then of <hi>Melanchthon, King Iames, Bishop Andrews, Dr. Potter, Dr. Godwin,</hi> (the Author of the Jewiſh Antiquityes) <hi>Tilenus, Mr. Hoard,</hi> and diverſe others, who are known to have improved their younger judgements into that which <hi>Mr. B.</hi> doth call <hi>Arminian.</hi> And ſixthly, by the ſame way of erring which Mr. B. here uſeth, we may ſay that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was defamed by <hi>himſelf</hi> for an <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> by having writ his <hi>Retractations.</hi> Seventhly, my deſigne in that place was to ſhew that I ought not to be called an <hi>Arminian,</hi> for profeſſing the Doctrin of <hi>univerſall Grace and Redemption,</hi> becauſe the <hi>anti-Arminians</hi> (ſo many of them as were the <hi>moſt learned)</hi> did hold that <hi>Doctrin</hi> as well as <hi>I.</hi> Nay I ſhew'd it to be the Doctrin of St. <hi>Hilarie</hi> and <hi>Proſper</hi> (I might have added, <hi>of all the Fathers)</hi> many hundreds of years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Arminius</hi> was <hi>born.</hi> Of which <hi>two Fathers</hi> Mr. B. durſt not take any notice. Eighthly, in ſtead of ſpeaking to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by proving that point to be <hi>Arminian,</hi> or by proving that thoſe perſons were not <hi>aſſertors</hi> of that point, he runs away with this <hi>impertinence,</hi> that thoſe ſix men were <hi>no

            <p>§. 9. 1. His account of <hi>Teſtard</hi> (p. 71.) is only this, that <hi>he hath nothing of him in his ſtudy,</hi> but that the learneder he <note place="margin">Of Teſtard, &amp; Camero for univerſall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> was, he was the likelyer not to differ from the <hi>Gallican Church.</hi> of which he appeals to a <hi>Nationall Synod</hi> held by the Proteſtants at <hi>Charenton</hi> 1623.] But firſt he cites not the words, either in <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> And ſecondly, his words are the leſſe likely to be true, becauſe in that very Synod, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Camero</hi> was approved, both by <hi>Durant</hi> the Praeſident, and all the reſt of that <hi>Body,</hi> after his <hi>conference</hi> with <hi>Tilenus,</hi> wherein he declared his opinion of <hi>univerſal Redemption,</hi> and that in ſuch a full <hi>ſenſe,</hi> as gave occaſion to <note n="b" place="margin">Spanhem. exercit. p. 59.</note> 
               <hi>Spanhemins</hi> to call it <hi>Arminian,</hi> and <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and finally <hi>rejected</hi> by the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Dort.</hi> Thirdly, if <hi>Testard</hi> did differ from other Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> doth it follow from thence that he did <hi>not</hi> differ? yet this was that which I implyed. And others did differ as well as He, and were accuſed before <hi>Synods</hi> of thoſe very things which Mr. B. doth forge in <hi>me.</hi> Fourthly, it was demonſtrated by <hi>Camero,</hi> and ſince by <hi>Daille,</hi> that the <note n="c" place="margin">In precibus publicis.

By what I have read of his <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> labours, I am induced to believe, that his <hi>piety</hi> and his <hi>learning</hi> were very equally <hi>match't.</hi> I do admire the <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſſe</hi> of the man, who eſpous'd the miſeries of all <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> and was not ſollicitous how <hi>much</hi> he <hi>ſuffer'd,</hi> for his indeavours to promote the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> ſo that his enemyes, in time, might <hi>enjoy</hi> the <hi>fruits</hi> of his <hi>affliction.</hi> If <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> might ſay of his own <hi>method and deſign,</hi> that, <hi>were the principles which he hath diſcerned betwixt the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran and the Calviniſt received according to their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they would quiet the now-contending Chriſtian world;</hi> how much more may I ſay the ſame thing of <hi>Grotius</hi> (as to the caſe in hand) with whom Mr. Baxter will confeſſe himſelf not worthy to be named? As for Grotius, how ſenſible he was of the ſeverall <hi>corruptions</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and how he laid himſelf out upon a deſign of <hi>Reformation,</hi> as well as <hi>peace,</hi> it is not uneaſy to collect from the 10 <note n="*" place="margin">In particular the ſeventh and the eighth.</note> 
               <hi>firſt pages</hi> of his <hi>Votum pro pace.</hi> How <hi>illegally</hi> he was dealt with, for having been <hi>faithfull</hi> to his <hi>truſt,</hi> in his native Country, he hath <note n="a" place="margin">Grot. Vot. pro pace p. 55. to p. 63.</note> ſufficiently made appear. With how much <hi>meekneſſe</hi> and <hi>aequanimity</hi> he did ſupport his injuryes, hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with admiration both from his <hi>writings</hi> and his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</hi> And had he accompliſhed his <hi>wiſhes</hi> (which were not <hi>empty</hi> wiſhes neither) there had not been in all the world, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Papist,</hi> or a <hi>Puritan;</hi> either <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> or <hi>profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Theologie then had been a <hi>practicall ſcience.</hi> They who now are but <hi>Talkers,</hi> had then been <hi>Followers</hi> of Chriſt. As <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> and <hi>Heretick,</hi> ſo <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and <hi>Rebell,</hi> had been but <hi>Names.</hi> To ſum up all in a word: <hi>Melanchthons</hi> and <hi>Grotiuſes</hi> had fill'd the Church; and men had found out a way of <hi>Loving God,</hi> without believing it <hi>needfull</hi> to <hi>hate</hi> their <hi>neighbour.</hi> I know that <hi>Grotius,</hi> as a <hi>Peace-maker</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> hath labour'd to ſhew his <hi>moderation,</hi> as well to <hi>them,</hi> as to <hi>theſe;</hi> and to <hi>excuſe</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:118909:60"/>
many things, at leaſt <hi>à Tanto,</hi> to which he muſt not be thought to have afforded his <hi>Approbation. Melanchthon</hi> did the very ſame, and was <hi>hated</hi> for his pains, as <hi>himſelf</hi> complained to <hi>Camerarius</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi> Nay his <hi>moderation</hi> provoked <hi>ſome,</hi> to give him out a <hi>ſlye friend to Popery.</hi> But <hi>Grotius</hi> went farther in his charitable deſign. And he who attempted a <hi>Reconcilement</hi> of <hi>two</hi> great <hi>enemyes,</hi> vvas not in prudence to declare a perſonall <hi>enmity</hi> to <hi>either,</hi> but to <hi>mitigate</hi> the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi> and <hi>animoſityes</hi> of <hi>both;</hi> and to inſiſt on thoſe things, whether <hi>faulty,</hi> or <hi>indifferent,</hi> which he deſir'd might meet with (in either party) an <hi>interchangeable pardon,</hi> and an <hi>interchangeable complyance.</hi>

himſelf the name of Chriſtian, he is yet to be baniſhed from the Communion of the orthodox.</q> From which words of that pious and learned Prelate, Mr. B. may be pleaſed to obſerve 4 things. 1.

That he reckons this among the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> placing the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt <hi>before</hi> it, and placing <hi>after</hi> it the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our <hi>bodyes.</hi> 3. That the Truth of <hi>this</hi> is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived</hi> from the Truth of the Articles going <hi>before.</hi> 4.

            <p>THat it concerns me very <hi>neerly</hi> to perform my <hi>promiſes</hi> to my Reader, and ſo to <hi>communicate</hi> the <hi>Grounds</hi> of what I have publickly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Eſpecially</hi> p. 61. lin. 14, 15, &amp;c.</note> Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> hath made apparent; for if I have <hi>wronged</hi> ſo <hi>great</hi> a <hi>Perſon,</hi> it is by ſo much the <hi>greater wrong,</hi> and exacteth from my conſcience by ſo much the <hi>greater repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Nor can I but take it very <hi>kindly</hi> from ſo Reverend a Perſon as Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> that by <hi>oppoſing</hi> what I reported in that particular, he hath given me an <hi>Occaſion</hi> to ſhew the <hi>Truth</hi> in its <hi>Luſtre,</hi> (which till <hi>now</hi> was exhibited in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a <hi>thick vail)</hi> by laying upon me a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> to <hi>clear</hi> my ſelf. To clear my ſelf (I ſay) not from any <hi>aſperſions</hi> which Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath caſt upon me, (for there are <hi>none</hi> in his letters, if <hi>rightly taken,</hi> and <hi>applyed,</hi> he hath rather open'd a way to my <hi>vindication)</hi> but from the ſiniſter and irrational uſes, which Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> and his <hi>peers</hi> (if yet he is not a <hi>peerleſs</hi> perſon) have had the <hi>skill</hi> or the <hi>unskilfulneſs</hi> to make of thoſe letters, againſt the intention of Him that writ them. It is not therefore my purpoſe to clear my <hi>ſelf,</hi> or my <hi>Informers,</hi> or the precious memorie of the L. Primate, by a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ofeſſed work of <hi>Hoſtility</hi> againſt thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Dr. <hi>Bernard;</hi> but rather by ſhewing that thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118909:77"/>
were ſo <hi>warily</hi> written, as to have nothing in them of <hi>hoſtile</hi> againſt <hi>me,</hi> or <hi>mine:</hi> not pretending to prove my <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> to have been <hi>falſe,</hi> but alledging ſome <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> by which it might <hi>ſeem</hi> to be unlikely, and obliging me thereby to prove it <hi>eminently true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, he ingenuouſly profeſſeth, that as <hi>it is hard to prove a Negative,</hi> (p. 47.) ſo, <hi>according to my Caveat, he doth not take upon him to do it,</hi> (p. 56.) but immediately adds, <hi>He underſtands not the Ground of my definitive ſentence,</hi> &amp;c. (ibid.) And therefore the utmoſt I have to do, is to make my <hi>Ground viſible,</hi> that an obſcure Truth may not ſuffer for want of a <hi>right underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath candidly profeſſed, that <hi>he took not upon him to prove the Negative</hi> of what I ſaid, <hi>(p.</hi> 56.) ſo he profeſſeth <hi>to be content that I enjoy my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if I cenſure not him for not forſaking his own.</hi> (p. 57.) And ſure he cannot but be inclinable to <hi>agree</hi> with me in the <hi>end,</hi> who differs from me in the <hi>way</hi> upon ſuch <hi>amicable Termes</hi> of <hi>Reconcilement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Though Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> was willing (as well he might) to <hi>put the Belief of my Affirmative</hi> to ſome kind of <hi>Stand,</hi> (at that time of the day, whilſt yet he knew not the <hi>Ground</hi> upon which I marched) yet he pretended not to do it by any other then <hi>probabilities</hi> (p. 58.) And we know that <hi>probabilities</hi> do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly in the <hi>middle</hi> twixt <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood;</hi> it is not in their <hi>Nature,</hi> and ſo belongs not to their <hi>Office,</hi> to make a <hi>proof,</hi> but to ingender a <hi>perſwaſion;</hi> They are proper to <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> ſpeaking in <hi>genere Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rativo,</hi> not to thoſe who intend a <hi>Scientifical Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And ſuch was the <hi>modeſty</hi> of that reverend Perſon, that he profeſſed only to <hi>ſtick to his perſwaſion</hi> (not to his <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> or <hi>aſſurance,</hi> which in that caſe was <hi>impoſſible) confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> (as he goes on) by <hi>probable Teſtimonies, that there was no ſuch change in the Primate near his Death,</hi> (p. 61.) where he confeſſeth that his <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> were no more then <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,</hi> and ſuch as only begot a <hi>perſwaſion</hi> in him; nor doth
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118909:77"/>
he ſeem to be <hi>perſwaded,</hi> that the Primates judgement was <hi>never</hi> changed, but that it was not <hi>near his Death.</hi> And if it was <hi>longer</hi> before his Death, then I ſuppoſed it to have been, I am extremely <hi>glad</hi> of it, becauſe abundantly <hi>happy</hi> in that miſtake.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> affirmeth (the <hi>third</hi> time alſo) a naked <hi>Improbability</hi> of what I ſaid, <hi>(p.</hi> 69.) ſo he <hi>ſeemed</hi> to believe, that I had <hi>no other witneſſes</hi> of what I ſaid, then <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 64. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>p.</hi> 70, 71.</note> ſuch as were preſent at his <hi>Sermon,</hi> wherein he taught, <q>
                  <hi>that by the death of Chriſt all receive this benefit, that they are ſaveable, or put into a Capacity of ſalvation, that termes of peace are procured for all mankind, that all mens ſins are become pardonable, mercy attainable,</hi> and the like.</q> From whence I eaſily gather, that had he been timely enough acquainted with the <hi>other evidences</hi> which I received, he had not oppoſed his <hi>probabilities</hi> againſt ſuch pregnant and cogent <hi>proofes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, whereas it is ſaid by Dr. <hi>Bernard, He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually with the Primate when laſt in London,</hi> (p. 48.) he muſt not be thought to mean, that he was <hi>never abſent,</hi> but that he was preſent very <hi>often:</hi> for it appears that he was abſent, when his <hi>Grace</hi> and Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> diſcourſed together of theſe affairs. Nor am I moved in the leaſt meaſure at what he <hi>ſeemeth</hi> at leaſt to <hi>intimate,</hi> p. 52. becauſe he <hi>ſeemeth only</hi> to do it, but doth it <hi>not.</hi> A perſon of his <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> could not be ſo extravagant, as to put ſpeeches into my <hi>mouth,</hi> which never proceeded out of my <hi>thoughts.</hi> I did not only never ſay, (no not ſo much as in a <hi>Dream)</hi> that the <hi>L. Primates Opinion was wholly for Arminius,</hi> but expreſly ſaid he was an <hi>Anti-Arminian</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> doth acknowledge by his recital of <hi>my words</hi> p. 50.) I only ſaid that <hi>he aſſerted univerſal Grace and Redemption, as well as Arminius;</hi> meaning a <hi>ſalvability, procured for all without exception:</hi> more then which I look not after, nor do I care to have granted: And I am ſure my L. Primate affirmes no leſs, even in that which Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath <hi>publiſht</hi> of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:118909:78"/>
him. All which doth not hinder, but that in ſeveral <hi>other things</hi> his Grace did <hi>differ</hi> from <hi>Arminius,</hi> as I and my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have alwaies done. It is ſufficient for the honour of that exceedingly learned and pious man, (I mean <hi>Arminius)</hi> that though he wanted not his <hi>Errors,</hi> (as what man living can be without them?) yet he was <hi>Orthodox</hi> in the <hi>main;</hi> and more <hi>exact</hi> in his <hi>Iudgement,</hi> as well as <hi>life,</hi> then your <hi>other Presbyterians</hi> are wont to be.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, what is ſpoken by Dr. <hi>Bernard (indiſcriminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)</hi> of <hi>univerſal Grace and univerſal Redemption</hi> p. 64, 65. (betwixt which two there is a very wide <hi>Difference,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the one does evince the other) I am not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in: It having never been my opinion, (nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with it) that <hi>the ſame meaſure of Grace was equally and alike conferred and applyed to Iudas, which was to Peter:</hi> But on the contrary, that though <hi>All</hi> have a <hi>ſufficient,</hi> yet <hi>ſome</hi> have a <hi>more abundant meaſure;</hi> one hath <hi>five Talents,</hi> another hath <hi>two,</hi> a third but <hi>one; everyone according to his ſeveral exigence or ability (Mat.</hi> 25. 15.) and according as the <hi>Maſter</hi> is pleaſed to <hi>deliver out his goods</hi> (v. 14.) but he that hath <hi>leaſt</hi> hath <hi>ſufficient,</hi> if he <hi>hide it not in the earth</hi> (v. 18.) but rather <hi>trade with it</hi> (v. 16.) according to the <hi>purpoſe</hi> of him that <hi>lent</hi> it, (v. 15. 19. 21. 27.) As he who had five Talents did gain five more, <hi>(v.</hi> 15.) and as he who had but <hi>two</hi> did alſo gain his <hi>other two</hi> (v. 17.) ſo he who had <hi>one,</hi> and onely one, might have gained <hi>one more,</hi> if he had not been a <hi>wicked and ſlothful ſervant,</hi> (v. 26. 30.) As he who improved his <hi>two</hi> Talents into <hi>four,</hi> received the very <hi>ſame Euge</hi> (v. 23.) with him who impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his <hi>five</hi> to <hi>ten,</hi> (v. 21.) ſo had the third ſervant improved his <hi>one</hi> Talent into <hi>two,</hi> he had alſo received that bleſſed ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Lord <q>

yet conſidered in <hi>its ſelf,</hi> 'tis <hi>not a little,</hi> and compared with <hi>other</hi> ſumms, it is a very <hi>great deale;</hi> for a ſingle Talent is no leſs then a <hi>hundred eighty ſeven pounds and Ten ſhillings,</hi> which is a <hi>vaſt</hi> ſumme of mony in <hi>ſome</hi> mens <hi>purſes</hi> and <hi>eſteems.</hi> A <hi>Talent</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> is infinitely <hi>more precious</hi> then one of <hi>Mony:</hi> And whilſt I thankfully acknowledge, that my <hi>Talent of Grace</hi> is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for me, (though a farr leſs <note place="margin">Mat 20. 15.</note> meaſure then God hath given to ſome of my Brethren) mine <hi>eye is not evil</hi> becauſe I ſee that my <hi>Maſters</hi> is very <hi>good.</hi> I do not <hi>envy</hi> my Brother for having <hi>five</hi> to my <hi>one;</hi> but am heartily <hi>thankful</hi> for <hi>his Abundance.</hi> So farr am I from believing, that Gods Grace is diſpenſed <hi>to all alike,</hi> that I fear thoſe <hi>profeſſors</hi> have <hi>leſs</hi> then others, who have proudly adventured on its <hi>Incloſure.</hi> I ſay therefore again, that I am not <hi>concern'd</hi> in thoſe words of Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>ſame meaſure of Grace common to Iudas with S. Peter:</hi> and by ſo much the leſs, becauſe he candidly profeſſeth, <hi>(p. 65.) that he would not be underſtood to interpoſe himſelf in the controverſie, or to affix thus much upon Mr. Pierces judgement;</hi> of which, if <hi>his</hi> Readers will but take a due notice, as well as <hi>mine,</hi> I ſhall be freed from the danger of being <hi>injur'd</hi> by their <hi>miſtakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> concludeth his ſecond Letter to Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> with a great <hi>Civility</hi> to my ſelf, and with a very <hi>courſe Complement</hi> to my <hi>Delator,</hi> profeſſing to have <hi>appeared</hi> in this affair, neither <hi>in patronage of Mr. Barlee, nor out of any oppoſition to Mr. Pierce,</hi> (p. 71.) Which as it was <hi>more</hi> then I expected from a perfect <hi>ſtranger</hi> (whoſe Favour too had been courted by the renowned <hi>Raiſer of falſe Reports)</hi> ſo from a perſon of that <hi>Temper</hi> which ſince I find him to be of, I could in reaſon expect no <hi>leſs.</hi> And how many advantages ſoever other men may have over me in <hi>other</hi> kinds, yet in offices of <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>mutual Forbearance,</hi> I am very unwilling to come <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 2.

               <hi>behind</hi> them; but will ſay of Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> a reverend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (as <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot</hi> in another caſe) <hi>why ſhould ſtrife <note place="margin">Gen. 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Perſon, whom I laboured only to vindicate from Him who <hi>did.</hi> But as I heartily <hi>intended</hi> the Primates <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> in what I publickly ſpake of him, ſo I cannot yet think that my intentions were miſguided, or have miſſed of the mark at which they aim'd. For Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> had printed ſuch things of the Primate, as did imply him a patron of thoſe ſad Doctrines which he aſſerted. And becauſe I was inform'd by ſeveral perſons (for learning and Piety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond exception) That though his Grace in former times was univerſally thought to be the prop of thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> aſſerted, and I oppos'd, yet in the latter part of his life he declared his averſion to thoſe opinions, and his perfect Concurrence with Biſhop <hi>Overal;</hi> I thought it my duty to make this known, that ſo Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> might be defeated, His <hi>Grace</hi> righted, the <hi>common people</hi> diſabuſed, and many <hi>learned men</hi> profited by that <hi>example.</hi> And <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> (as I <hi>did)</hi> that my Lord <hi>Primate</hi> his <hi>Grace</hi> had once in times paſt been extremely different in his judgement from <hi>Biſhop Overal,</hi> as having embraced the way of the Anti-Remonſtrants, how could I poſſibly do leſs then conclude from thence his <hi>change of judgment?</hi> But I have <hi>thirdly</hi> been inform'd, that the cauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure conceived againſt me, is not my ſaying that the Primate was at laſt of the opinions which I am of (in theſe points) but my implying his having been <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> by my affirming his <hi>change of judgment.</hi> And again, for this cauſe I am to give you great thanks; it being moſt ſuitable to my wiſhes, that his <hi>Grace</hi> may be proved to have been <hi>alwaies</hi> of the judgement which I am of, and that by conſequence he <hi>never chang'd it,</hi> and that I (by conſequence) was much <hi>miſtaken</hi> on the <hi>right</hi> hand, as Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> and his Abetters were <hi>more</hi> miſtaken on the <hi>left.</hi> In the mean time it is evident, that what I ſpake of him in my books, was <hi>ſafely</hi> ſpoken in all <hi>reſpects.</hi> For what I ſaid that I was <hi>told,</hi> I was told <hi>indeed,</hi> and that by excellent perſons, whom I ſhall name when time ſerves;

how truly or falſely, <hi>viderint illi.</hi> And this muſt be granted me by all the world, That my Lord Primates opinions in the declining part of his life were either changed, or not changed, from what they formerly had been. If they <hi>were,</hi> it is happy for <hi>me</hi> that I did not err in what I publiſht; and if they <hi>were not,</hi> it is much <hi>more</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py I was miſtaken, and miſinform'd: for as 'tis much for my purpoſe, that ſo eminent a Prelate was perfectly orthodox at the <hi>laſt,</hi> ſo it is more for my purpoſe, that ſo eminent a prelate was <hi>alwayes</hi> orthodox. On which ſide ſoever the Truth doth lye, it will reflect very ſeverely upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Mr <hi>Barlee.</hi> For if my L.

            <p>IT had (it ſeems) been happy, if your firſt Letter to me <note place="margin">The firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> had not finally miſcarried; for then I ſhould have given you ſuch a ſatisfactory Account, as would (I think) have prevented, (at leaſt have altered) your reſolutions of ſending Letters to Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> concerning me and my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>To the next part of your Letter I have theſe things to ſay. Firſt that I did the very thing which you are ſorry I did not. For before I durſt publiſh what I had heard of the Primate, I did conſult with ſuch perſons, who (I did verily believe) could beſt inform me, (as having been converſant with him to that very purpoſe) and were moſt worthy to be believed, (as being perſons of great fame for Life and Learning.) Next, I deſire you to conſider, how unjuſtly diffident I muſt have been, if I had not believed what I was told by ſeveral grave perſons, at ſeveral times, as from the Primates own Mouth, in private partly, &amp; partly alſo in publick, and all atteſted to me under hand and ſeal, which upon fit occaſion they will be ready to make good too. How impoſſible will it be thought, that three or four di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſons, all of the Prieſthood, and of unqueſtionable Integrity, ſhould either by chance or by conſpiracy, write the very ſame fiction (if it were ſuch) to the very ſame party, who is not intimate with either, and to one of the number a perfect ſtranger? Nay, what if my witneſſes are (ſome of them) ſtrangers to one another, and of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary veracity, that each is <hi>inſtar multorum?</hi> will any man blame me for my belief, and not rather believe them as I have done? When the thing by me aſſerted is matter of Fact, it cannot poſſibly be proved with more advantage
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:118909:81"/>
to me, or ſatisfaction to ſuch as judge, then by ear-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes upon Oath: whereas the Negative to that is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be proved by any mortal, that I ſuppoſe no oath can be admitted. What the Primate <hi>hath</hi> ſaid to you, you may very well remember, but you cannot remember what he hath <hi>not ſaid.</hi> Nor can you know many things which he ſaid to others, much leſs can you know he <hi>never</hi> ſaid them. All which I recommend unto your timely conſideration, becauſe I am kinder to your credit then to be willing that you deny what can dilucidly be proved; which I therefore ſuppoſe you will not do. And if in ſtead of a denial of what ſhall be proved by my informers, you affirm ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in derogation to it, it will be expected that your proofs be as good as mine. If they are not, it will redound to your prejudice; and if they are, it will not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to mine: but all the diſhonour will be the Primates (which God forbid) if he ſhall be found to have breathed both hot and cold, by declaring himſelf at once for two opinions, whereof the one is not conſiſtent with the other. I have ſaid (and ſhall prove) that he declared for that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which I am of; and if afterwards you ſhall ſay (what you will alſo prove) that he declared for <hi>another</hi> inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with mine, you alone in that caſe will caſt a cloud over his name. And if we differ about the time of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, (you placing it in his <hi>former</hi> years, as I in his <hi>laſt,)</hi> that indeed will ſalve <hi>his</hi> Honour, but withal it will make as much for <hi>mine</hi> as I can wiſh, becauſe it will help me to prove his <hi>change.</hi> In the mean time I am glad that you affirme the Primate not to have been of Mr. <hi>Barlees</hi> judgement; which is as much to the ruine of his Correp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Correction, (where he uſeth that Reverend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prelate as one of the heads of his party in theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs) as I need wiſh it in that particular. I am as ſorry for that heat which you ſay you find betwixt me and Mr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> as I am glad that I do not find any in my ſelf. 'Tis true indeed, I was forced to clear my ſelf from his <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:118909:81"/>
and to diſown his ugly <hi>Names,</hi> as well as to vindicate the <hi>Truth</hi> from his adventures. But in the repelling of his <hi>Fire,</hi> I do not remember that I was ever once <hi>heated.</hi> And if you have ſeen what ſtuff I had to deal with, I ſuppoſe you will think I could not have uſed him with greater mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But I find my ſelf tedious; and therefore my thanks to you for your promiſe to ſend me that which you have publiſht, ſhall put an end to this large trouble from</p>

But firſt let me acknowledge (by way of anſwer to your letter) that you have indeed afforded me ſo much <hi>reſpect,</hi> (above what you have given to Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> (in your ſecond Letter directed to him) as I cannot be <hi>offended</hi> with any want in that kind. Nay you farther <hi>load</hi> me, in one paſſage, with ſuch a <hi>weight of commendation,</hi> that I know not how I
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118909:82"/>
can <hi>ſupport</hi> it, but by <hi>his credit</hi> who <hi>laid it on.</hi> You have obliged me beſides with a righteous conſtruction of my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi> which have <hi>aimed</hi> at the <hi>promotion of peace</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> In which reſpect I am deſirous, that even whilſt we differ in ſome few things, we may be as they who agree in all. I ſhall not ſnatch at occaſions of having controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with you, though there is nothing more pleaſant then to diſpute with perſons of ſo much <hi>Temper.</hi> And had my Neighbour of <hi>Brockhole</hi> either embraced your <hi>Advice,</hi> or taken his Copy from your <hi>Example,</hi> by how much more ſtrongly he had oppoſed me, I ſhould have loved and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued him ſo much the <hi>more.</hi> But ſo ill is the uſe which he hath made of your <hi>Letters</hi> and of your <hi>Name,</hi> and ſome expreſſions in your book do reflect ſo ſternly upon my Credit, and (which is more) upon my cauſe, that I think it concerns me either to clear what I have done from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any way <hi>injurious</hi> to the memory of the <hi>Primate,</hi> or (if I cannot do that,) to make ſome <hi>ample ſatisfaction</hi> for having wronged it. That I <hi>intended</hi> no more then his greateſt <hi>Honour,</hi> all the world is my witneſs, for as much as I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him to be of that judgement, which all men are of who have the higheſt of my eſteem: And to grow out of that which I think is <hi>error,</hi> to the poſſeſſion of that which I think is <hi>Truth,</hi> is not <hi>inconſtancy,</hi> but <hi>improvement,</hi> as I interpret. When I left thoſe Doctrines into which my Teachers at firſt betrayed me, I cannot ſay I <hi>revolted,</hi> but I was rather <hi>ſet free.</hi> To be <hi>fickle,</hi> is one thing; but to <hi>grow</hi> and <hi>increaſe,</hi> is quite another. Whatſoever I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as an honour to my cauſe, I could not chooſe but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to their honour alſo, by whom I could think my cauſe was honoured. When I ſay that <hi>King Iames,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Andrews, Philip Melanchthon, Tilenus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> Dr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> and many others whom I could name of eminent learning and integrity, did turn away from thoſe Tenents which are called <hi>Calviniſtical,</hi> in exchange for thoſe other which unconſidering perſons do call <hi>Arminian,</hi> I make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt

I commend them for bowing to the ſceptre of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign truth: And this doth juſtifie my <hi>Intentions</hi> in all I ſaid of our Reverend Primate. But the queſtion ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains concerning matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> whether his <hi>Grace</hi> did <hi>change</hi> his <hi>judgement</hi> from what it formerly had been. I began in the <hi>affirmative,</hi> but you ſay <hi>No:</hi> And both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with good reaſon, becauſe we are <hi>diverſely informed,</hi> unleſs we can ſhew by ſome <hi>Inquiry</hi> where lyes the <hi>Error.</hi> I grounded my <hi>affirmative</hi> upon the <hi>Difference</hi> which I found betwixt the judgement of the Primate when he writ the Hiſtory of <hi>Gotteſchalc,</hi> and that account of his judgement which I had from thoſe Perſons who are of <hi>vaſt Importance</hi> in my eſteem. To tranſcribe their <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates,</hi> which they have <hi>ſeverally</hi> given me under <hi>Hand and ſeal,</hi> of what they <hi>ſeverally</hi> heard from his <hi>Grace</hi> his <hi>mouth,</hi> is too large a task in the preſent haſt that I am in; nor am I ſure that you deſire it.

               <hi>Mr. Barlee for the large expreſſions of his affection to the late Archbiſhop of Armagh, and the readineſs to clear him from ſome injury done him by Mr. Thomas Pierce:</hi> whereas it ſeems very evident, by that account which <hi>you</hi> give of the <hi>Primates judgement about the true intent and extent of Chriſts Death,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> is <hi>leſs</hi> qualified for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops vindication in that affair, then any man in the world in all reſpects. I beſeech you bear with me whilſt I give you my reaſons. 1. Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> in his laſt book, declares <note place="margin">ch. 3. p. 15. lin. 19. Cor.

that <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Chriſts death</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> which you have now printed from the <hi>Primates own Hand.</hi> He directs me to him as to a <hi>choice orthodox writer</hi> (in the <hi>Barlean conceipt</hi> of the word <hi>Orthodox,)</hi> beſides what he <note place="margin">p. 194.</note> doth in other places, which I have not leiſure to ſearch after. 3. But now you tell him in your Letter, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates <hi>judgement was in a middle way, different</hi> as well from Mr. <hi>Barlees,</hi> as from <hi>mine.</hi> Whether from mine, we ſhall <note place="margin">p. 52.</note> ſee anon. But if at all, I am ſure much <hi>leſs</hi> then from my neighbours. In the mean time it is demonſtrable, that if Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> was in the <hi>right,</hi> when he vouched the <hi>Primate</hi> for <hi>his opinions,</hi> I was alſo in the <hi>right,</hi> when I ſaid that the Primate had <hi>changed his judgement.</hi> And for this your book ſhall be my warrant, as well as the Primates own words, <hi>That he concurred with Biſhop Overal.</hi> Next I pray Sir conſider; whether any <hi>one Paragraph</hi> in <hi>all my books</hi> (touching the <hi>true intent and extent of Chriſts Death)</hi> is any way diſſonant from what now you publiſh, and that (ſay you, very truly, without all Queſtion) from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates <hi>Letter of Reſolution to the requeſt of a Friend.</hi> Firſt, I have nothing in behalf of the <hi>two extremes</hi> (p. 2, 3.) in any part of my writings. Next, I have jumped with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in what I publiſht, (before I had the poſſibility of ſeeing that which you have ſent me) not onely much to my comfort, but truly almoſt to my Admiration. For his <hi>Grace</hi> writes thus: <q>

            <p>IAm heartily glad to find in your laſt (what I expected) ſo much Candor and equity as there you ſhew; both in <note place="margin">The fourth Letter.</note> comparing the Primates judgement with the ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of my books to which I pointed, and in granting the near approches of the one to the other. And although your
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:118909:85"/>
words are, that <hi>you have found me much inclining to the judgement of the Primate;</hi> yet I ſuppoſe your meaning is, that you have not found wherein we <hi>differ.</hi> Differ we may in explications, or inferences, or endeavors of Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (where it is more to be wiſhed, then poſſible to be had.) And ſo the Primate and you may differ; nay ſo great Authors may o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ten differ from themſelves, by their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>eſſayes</hi> to make agreement between their brethren. But as to <hi>the true intent and extent of Chriſts Death,</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the <hi>end</hi> and the <hi>effect,</hi> there is a very pleaſant Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony betwixt us both. I will firſt demonſtrate wherein we agree, and then I pray (Sir,) tell me wherein we differ. 1. I agree with his Lordſhip in an utter diſlike of the <hi>two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes</hi> (p. 4.) both Mr <hi>Culverwells</hi> on the right hand, and Mr. <hi>Barlees</hi> on the left. 2. I do perfectly agree to the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Doctrine</hi> (p. 6.) not ſo much as deſiring that it ſhould be expreſſed in other words, then thoſe his Lordſhip there uſeth, to wit, <hi>That by vertue of this oblation God is made placable unto our nature, but not actually appeaſed with any, untill he hath received his ſon. And that all men may be truly ſaid to have an Intereſt in Chriſt, as in a Common, though all do not enjoy the benefit thereof, becauſe they have no will to take it.</hi> 3. I do fully agree to what he ſaith of Gods <hi>Intention, to make the nature of man a fit ſubject for mercy, and to prepare a medicine for the ſins of the whole world, which ſhould be denied to none that intended to take the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it,</hi> p. 16. lin. 2. and 8. where Gods <hi>intention</hi> is ſincere, as well as univerſal, but it is <hi>conditional</hi> of mans <hi>intention.</hi> 4. I agree to what he ſaith <hi>p. 35, 36. That the general ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt prepares the way for Gods mercy, by making the ſins of all mankind pardonable, the interpoſition of any bar from Gods juſtice notwithſtanding, and ſo puts the ſons of men onely in a poſſibility of being juſtified.</hi> Now, Sir, that by the death of Chriſt <hi>all</hi> men have the <hi>benefit</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>ſalvabiles,</hi> or are put into a <hi>Capacity of ſalvation,</hi> or that Termes of <hi>peace</hi> are <hi>procured</hi> for <hi>all mankind,</hi> or that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118909:85"/>
for <hi>all mens ſins mercy is attainable,</hi> (as your ſelf have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it in your ſecond Letter to Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> p. 64.) is as much as I have ever contended for in my writings. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vability for all without exception,</hi> as it is the <hi>main</hi> thing in the Primates Tenet, ſo it is alſo the <hi>main</hi> in <hi>mine.</hi> For 5. Actual pardon is quite another thing; and readily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>me</hi> to be an effect of Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection</hi> (Rom. 4. 25.) and of the conſequents thereof, as his <hi>interceſſion</hi> (Ro. 8. 34.) ſo that this is a <hi>fifth</hi> thing wherein I agree with that Reverend Primate. 6. I agree to what he ſaith, <hi>p. 21. That Chriſt obtained Remiſſion of ſins, not for the Reprobate, but elect only; and not for them neither, before they be truly regenerated and implanted into him. For election being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the purpoſe of God reſting in his own mind, makes no kind of alteration in the party elected.</hi> And you have read in my writings, that though in reſpect of the <hi>end,</hi> Chriſt dyed <hi>intentionally</hi> for <hi>all,</hi> yet in reſpect of the <hi>event,</hi> he dyed <hi>effectually</hi> for the <hi>elect only.</hi> 7. I agree to the <hi>reaſon</hi> which the Primate gives, why ſo many are <hi>damned</hi> forwhom Chriſt <hi>dyed</hi> with ſuch a <hi>merciful and pure intention;</hi> even becauſe they <hi>refuſed</hi> what was <hi>ſincerely prepared for</hi> them, <note place="margin">p. 8.</note> 
               <hi>ſincerely offered</hi> to them, <hi>ſincerely intended</hi> to do them <hi>good,</hi> and not harm: but they had <hi>no will to take it;</hi> they <hi>would</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 16. p. 6. p. 10. p. 16. p. 8. p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>not come,</hi> when invited; they <hi>intended not</hi> to take the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit offered; <hi>Arich price was put into the hands of a fool, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had no heart to uſe it,</hi> Prov. 17. 16. <hi>He was not diſpoſed to take the benefit of it.</hi> 8. I agree alſo in <hi>this</hi> (p. 12. and 13.) That they who <hi>miſs</hi> of the <hi>Redemption</hi> which was <hi>purchaſed by Chriſt,</hi> which <hi>lay open</hi> to them, and to which they were <hi>invited,</hi> had not been <hi>excluded from it, had they had a mind to accept of it,</hi> and <hi>would they have liſtened to the motion of it, when a true tender of it was made by Gods Embaſſadours.</hi> And for the reaſon of this I give the old maxime, <hi>Nemo tenetur ad impoſſibile,</hi> or (to expreſs it with Biſhop <hi>Davenant) Impoſſibilium nulla eſt obligatio.</hi> The <hi>Tender</hi> is <hi>not true,</hi> nor the <hi>intention ſincere</hi> in him that <hi>offers,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sentent. <hi>Dav.</hi> p. 3.</note>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:118909:86"/>
if he who muſt be <hi>damned</hi> for <hi>not accepting</hi> is not allowed ſo much as a <hi>poſſibility</hi> to <hi>accept.</hi> And therefore (9.) I agree with the Primate in what he ſaith <hi>p. 16. That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſts mercy, he may be counted a kind of univerſal Cauſe of the reſtoring of our nature, as Adam was of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praving of it.</hi> Now that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> doth not take its <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular effects</hi> in the <hi>impenitent,</hi> is not becauſe it is <hi>no cauſe,</hi> nor becauſe it is not <hi>univerſal,</hi> but becauſe of the <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> in them that <hi>periſh.</hi> Its <hi>univerſality</hi> is very <hi>perfect;</hi> it being in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as in the <hi>firſt:</hi> the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> is not excluded from her ſhare in the <hi>firſt;</hi> no more then <hi>Iudas</hi> (the ſon of perdition) from his ſhare in the <hi>ſecond.</hi> 10. I agree to that part of the Primates Doctrine, <hi>p.</hi> 22. that <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins is not by our Saviour impetrated for any unto whom the merit of his death is not applyed in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> 11. I agree with the Primate, <hi>that Mr. Amesinclined too much unto the other extremity,</hi> p. 23. <hi>that the Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans drove the Calviniſts or Anti-Arminians unto this extreme Abſurdity, to ſay that the greateſt part of mankind were bound in Duty to believe a lye,</hi> p. 24, 25, 26, 27. and that, <hi>as Mr. Culverwell, ſo any man elſe, would flye</hi> rather into <hi>any</hi> error, <hi>then yield that Chriſt in no manner of wayes dyed for any Reprobate, and that none but the elect had any kind of Title to him.</hi> p. 26. Nor do I mean only a bare <hi>ſufficiency</hi> for the <hi>Reprobate</hi> in the Death of Chriſt; For (12.) I agree with the Primate, that to preach a bare ſufficiency cannot yield ſufficient comfort <hi>to a diſtreſſed ſoul, without giving a further way to it,</hi> p. 31. And let the diſtreſſed ſoul be what he will, he is not <hi>bound</hi> to believe a <hi>lye,</hi> any more then <hi>Barnabas</hi> is bound to <hi>preach</hi> one. And to demonſtrate that the Primate doth mean exactly in <hi>his</hi> writing, as I did in <hi>mine,</hi> he doth <hi>illuſtrate</hi> his <hi>meaning</hi> by the very <hi>ſame caſe;</hi> and that in a way as extraordinary, as if he, or I, or both together, had been purpoſely overruled by the <hi>providence of God</hi> to ſtop the mouth of our Correptory Corrector. I pray, Sir, compare the 32. <hi>page</hi> of the <hi>Primates judgement,</hi> with <hi>ch. 3. p. 96. of my</hi> Div. Philan, <hi>defended,</hi> and you will
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118909:86"/>
find the <hi>King of Spain</hi> (in both thoſe places) ſhewing the <hi>folly</hi> of thoſe men, who ſay that Chriſt did dye <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all, but not <hi>intentionally</hi> unleſs for the <hi>elect.</hi> You cannot eaſily imagine, how much contentment I have taken in this <hi>concurrence</hi> of our <hi>minds,</hi> either by <hi>miracle,</hi> or by <hi>chance,</hi> or I know not how <hi>elſe.</hi> Nay (13.) I agree with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in the point of <hi>Application</hi> p. 11. if it is ſo <hi>underſtood,</hi> as that it may be <hi>reconcileable</hi> with <hi>p.</hi> 6. and 8. and 10. and ſo it will be very <hi>happily,</hi> by being underſtood of <hi>Gods gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace to believe and perform the condition,</hi> (which is Gods proper way of <hi>applying</hi> the <hi>Remedy</hi> unto us) and our <hi>making good uſe</hi> of that <hi>Talent</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> (which is <hi>our</hi> way, through grace, of <hi>applying</hi> the remedy unto <hi>our ſelves)</hi> that as in the <hi>offer</hi> it is <hi>general,</hi> ſo it may be <hi>particular</hi> in the <hi>acceptation.</hi> And that this is his Lordſhips meaning as well as mine, I find <hi>demonſtrated</hi> by himſelf, <hi>p. 39, 40. No mans ſtate is ſo deſperate, but by this means it is recoverable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and this is the firſt comfortable news that the Goſpel brings to the diſtreſſed ſoul:) but here it reſteth not, nor feedeth a man with a</hi> [bare] <hi>poſſibility, but it brings the word of comfort nigh unto him, even to his mouth and heart, and preſents him with the medicine at hand, and deſireth him to take it; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done accordingly, the cure is actually performed;</hi> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not, if he <hi>will</hi> not take it at Gods <hi>intreaty.</hi> The <hi>medicine</hi> then remains in its bare <hi>aptitudinality,</hi> and doth not <hi>actually cure</hi> him. What is the reaſon? becauſe there is not a <hi>concurrence</hi> of the <hi>mans</hi> deſire unto his <hi>Makers;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>ſubmitteth</hi> not his <hi>will</hi> to the merciful <hi>will</hi> of his <hi>Redeemer,</hi> according to that of our bleſſed Lord, [How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>would</hi> I, and ye <hi>would not?]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a <hi>parallel</hi> of our concurrences in opinion as to the matter in hand. And I have done it ſo much the rather, becauſe you ſay very piouſly, that <hi>if you were miſtaken in me, you will be ready to acknowledge it to my advantage.</hi> You did not probably judge of me by what you found in my writings, but by what you heard from byaſt

Be pleaſed therefore to reflect upon ſome paſſages in your Letters to M. <hi>Barlee:</hi> as <hi>p. 52. l.</hi> 2. where you ſeemingly imply me to have ſaid, <hi>that the Biſhop was wholly for Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;</hi> whereas I did not onely <hi>not</hi> ſay it, but I ſaid he was <hi>not</hi> ſo: and <hi>lin.</hi> 8. where you place his <hi>judgement in this point in a middle way different both from mine and Mr.</hi> Bs. without ſhewing what it is in which the Primate and I do differ; but leaving the Reader to imagine, that I do differ from him as much as Mr. <hi>Barlee:</hi> next <hi>p.</hi> 58. where you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply me to have <hi>intimated the Primates penitency of his ſins;</hi> which as I never meant in the place you allude to, ſo my words have quite another ſound with them, and import the <hi>contrary.</hi> Again <hi>p.</hi> 65. you clearly <hi>imply</hi> me to <hi>make no difference betwixt the grace given to Iudas and that to Peter,</hi> although you ſay a little after, <hi>you do not affix thus much upon my judgement.</hi> The Primate might be <hi>changed,</hi> yet not to that <hi>pitch.</hi> Again, p. 61, 69, 70. you reflect upon me very <hi>ſeverely;</hi> and I am ſure you will ſay ſo, when I ſhall prove by your Teſtimony, and by his Lordſhips own, (as well as by others) that he did indeed admit of a <hi>change in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I would do it now preſently, but that my letter is grown ſo long; and I muſt haſten to the next part of yours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Barlee tells you in a Letter, that in the main he doth alſo perfectly agree with the moſt venerable Primate.</hi> Which I can prove to be <hi>impoſſible,</hi> unleſs he will ſing a Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>both his books.</hi> But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or the doing of that, it is not enough that he ſees his errors, unleſs he hath alſo a ſingle heart to take off the ſcandals which he hath given: which he cannot do in a private Letter, becauſe the ſcandals were given in print. It would be a good jeſt, to hear him <hi>name the main things,</hi> wherein his perfect agreement with the Primate doth conſiſt. If he ſpeaks knowingly, and in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, he doth alſo, for the <hi>main,</hi> agree perfectly with <hi>me:</hi> And if ſo, for what reaſons hath he rayled againſt me ſo voluminouſly, as againſt an <hi>Arminian, Maſſilian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pelagian, Papiſt, Carpocratian, Socinian, Atheiſtical Lucianizer, &amp;

ſexcenta hujusmodi?</hi> It appears by my Notes (the <hi>firſt</hi> thing I printed) how inoffenſively I provided both for my credit and my cauſe; I mean my credit in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my cauſe, and in the candid management thereof; no other credit do I pretend to. And how Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> fell foulely from my opinions to my perſon, Thouſands have ſeen, and ſtood amazed. It it were not a needleſs (perhaps an unexcuſable) expence of time, <hi>I</hi> believe <hi>I</hi> could ſhew you, that Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> differs from the Primate in the 13 parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, wherein I ſhewed my agreement with his Lordſhips Doctrine. How Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> did differ from your account of the Primate, in his Correptory Correction, <hi>I</hi> gave you ſome touches in my laſt. And as my Time or memory will permit me, <hi>I</hi> will preſent you with ſome examples of Mr. <hi>Barlees</hi> Hoſtility againſt our renowned and Reverend Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. 1. In the ſecond chap. of his ſecond Volume, <hi>p. 72. (lin. 4, 5, 6, 7. from the Bottom)</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that I and the Arminians do maintain the end of Chriſts Death to have been the procuring for men a ſalvable condition onely or a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of being ſaved, rather then any actual ſalvation.</hi> Now though <hi>I</hi> ſaid no ſuch thing in the place by him cited <hi>(Philan. c. 3. p.</hi> 63.) or any where elſe, as <hi>I</hi> remember, yet <hi>I</hi> have ſaid in <hi>effect</hi> what the Primate ſaith in plain <hi>Termes,</hi> (p. 4, 21, 34, 35, 36.) <q>
                  <hi>That by vertue of Chriſts Death God is made placable to our nature, but not actually appeaſed with any, no not with the elect, before they be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 4. p. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>regenerated</hi> (which St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not, untill it was <hi>late;</hi> nor the <hi>Thief</hi> on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> untill it was <hi>later)</hi> but <hi>by Chriſts ſatisfaction, he made the nature of man a fit ſubject for mercy,</hi> p. 34. the <hi>ſins of all mankind pardonable,</hi> p. 35. <hi>and ſo put the ſons of men only in a poſſibility of being juſtified,</hi> p. 36.</q> Or, as his Grace doth elſewhere ſpeak, <hi>Chriſt provided good things for all</hi> (even for the worſt) p. 8. ſo as the <hi>Reprobates</hi> in <hi>refuſing</hi> what was <hi>truly tendered</hi> to them, <hi>can blame none but themſelves,</hi> p. 34. So that you ſee Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> hath concluded the <hi>Primate</hi> an <hi>Arminian,</hi> as well as <hi>me,</hi> nay <hi>more</hi> then me; becauſe it was <hi>He</hi> that <hi>ſaid</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:118909:88"/>
what <hi>I conſent</hi> to, but <hi>never ſaid.

Mr. Barlee.</hi> Nor will it avail him to ſay, that he ſpake of the <hi>end</hi> of Chriſts Death, not of the <hi>effect peculiar</hi> to it; for (beſides that even ſo he is oppoſite to the Primate, <hi>p. 35. lin.</hi> 10.) he interprets himſelf by <hi>actual ſalvation,</hi> as that is oppoſed unto a <hi>ſalvable condition.</hi> And if he meant any otherwiſe, he doth not only ſpeak <hi>ignorantly,</hi> but in the depth of that ignorance he <hi>wrongs the Arminians</hi> in a moſt horrible degree. And though <hi>I</hi> diſſent from <hi>Arminius</hi> in <hi>many</hi> things (as Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> confeſſeth, and maketh to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) yet <hi>I</hi> agree with him in <hi>ſome,</hi> as doth alſo our Rev.

Nor do <hi>I ſtrive</hi> to differ from him, as if <hi>I</hi> thought him an ill man, for I find him a moſt grave and learned writer, and <hi>I</hi> read he lived a very ſtrict life; and as he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Presbyterians in point of Doctrine, ſo at laſt he ſaw the miſchiefes of their Diſcipline alſo, and did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a <hi>Reformation.</hi> But however <hi>I</hi> honour his great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and good life, as without all doubt the Primate did; yet neither <hi>He,</hi> nor <hi>I,</hi> can therefore be ſaid to be <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> tells us <hi>(c. 2. p. 76. lin. 4, 5. from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom) that he hath ſet down the Primates opinion in his Hiſtoria Gotteſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now Sir, if you ſhall poſſibly deny that His Grace was ever of <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement, as to the matters above mentioned, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not be concerned to prove the contrary, but rather taking you at your word, <hi>I</hi> ſhall require all thoſe who have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gain credit to their <hi>Calviniſt-Opinions</hi> by their unjuſt uſurpation of that venerable <hi>Name,</hi> that they make him ſatisfaction for having done him ſo great a wrong. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom, <hi>I</hi> am ſure, Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> is one: who either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured the Primate in a very high meaſure by urging Him as a <hi>patron</hi> of what he held againſt <hi>me,</hi> or elſe I righted him very highly by making known his <hi>change</hi> of <hi>judgement.</hi> And certainly you will ſay, that you were very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, when you acknowledged your ſelf <hi>much Mr. Barlees Debtor, for his (I-know-not-what) Readineſs to clear the Primate from ſome injury done him by Mr. Pierce;</hi> becauſe, you know, he neither <hi>did</hi> clear the Primate, nor was <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of clearing him; nay (farther yet) that he had <hi>injured</hi> the Primate, and that he had injured <hi>you</hi> alſo, by having injured that <hi>Account</hi> which you have publickly given of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118909:93"/>
Primates judgement, (it being <hi>irreconcileable</hi> with <hi>that,</hi> for which he vouched him in his Book extremely often.) Nay farther yet, you know my own great <hi>Readineſs</hi> to clear the Primate, and that I am <hi>qualified</hi> for the work, and that in all my Letters put together I have <hi>actually</hi> cleared him. And though it ſeemeth very ſufficient to ſerve my turne, that if ever the Primate had been exactly of the opinions which Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> affirmed him to have been of, he <hi>went off and departed</hi> from thoſe opinions; and if he was never of thoſe opinions, he was grievouſly injured by Mr. <hi>Barlee:</hi> yet I have more to alledge in mine own behalf, then what is abundantly ſufficient for the defeating of Mr. <hi>Barlee.</hi> For let the <hi>Terminus a quo</hi> be what it will, from which the Primate departed, unto the <hi>Terminus ad quem</hi> of which I ſpeak, it is clear that he admitted <hi>a change in judgement,</hi> on ſuppoſition if he removed from one opinion unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and even <hi>that</hi> change in judgement of which I ſpake, on ſuppoſition that he departed from that which is called Mr. <hi>Calvins,</hi> in adherence unto <hi>that</hi> which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claredly am of. That ſo he did in good earneſt, appears to me by a <hi>Certificate</hi> which I received from <hi>your ſelf:</hi> For in your ſecond printed letter to Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> p. 67. you ſay the Primate <hi>was appointed by the Synod at Dublin A. D. 1615. as a principal Perſon to draw up the Articles of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, which fully determine the points we ſpeak of.</hi> But the 32. <hi>Article</hi> agreed upon by that Synod is in effect the very ſame with the 7. <hi>Article of Lambeth;</hi> and ſaith in plain termes, <hi>That there is not ſuch a ſufficient meaſure of Grace vouchſafed unto every man whereby he is enabled to come unto everlaſting life.</hi> It is not ſaid in that Article, that <hi>every man is not actually ſaved,</hi> or <hi>not effectually brought unto life everlaſting;</hi> but that every man <hi>is not enabled to come:</hi> which is as much as to ſay (if I am able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it) that <hi>every man is not put into a ſavable condition,</hi> or <hi>doth not receive a poſſibility of coming to life everlaſting.</hi> For if the <hi>former</hi> had been the ſenſe, it had amounted only to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118909:93"/>
this, that <hi>every man in the world is not one of the elect, but ſome are Reprobates; all are not ſaved, but ſome are damned:</hi> which is ſo <hi>jejune</hi> a ſaying, and ſo unneceſſary a Truth to have a place in that <hi>ſuccinct Body of credenda,</hi> that I cannot imagin it to have been the thing meant. And we know, <hi>to be enabled,</hi> is juſt the ſame as <hi>to be render'd able;</hi> and to be <hi>render'd able,</hi> is to <hi>receive a capability;</hi> which is clearly alſo imported by <hi>a ſufficient meaſure of Grace,</hi> as the word <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>effectual.</hi> And if this is the meaning (as I conceive it needs <hi>muſt)</hi> then the <hi>contrary</hi> to <note place="margin">* p. 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, 31, 35, 36, 38, 39. and <hi>p.</hi> 64.</note> this is often aſſerted by the Primate in <hi>your account of his judgement of the true intent and extent of Chriſts Death.</hi> Again you ſay in your firſt printed letter, <hi>(p.</hi> 45.) That <q>there is <hi>one Doctrine of Calvins, which muſt be exempted from my univerſality, and which will not be found to have been rejected by the Primate, viz. that Maſſa corrupta was the object of predeſtination.</hi>
               </q> Which how it can conſiſt with the Primates words to my <hi>three informers</hi> (mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their <hi>Certificates)</hi> as I cannot poſſibly diſcerne my ſelf, ſo I conceive that no man living will ever be able to demonſtrate. Nor indeed can it conſiſt with that Account which you have given in the <note n="*" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>above-cited pages.</hi> For if Chriſt did dye for <hi>all mankind,</hi> to procure for all a <hi>ſalvability,</hi> to make the ſins of all <hi>venial,</hi> to put them all without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of being <hi>juſtified,</hi> and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of being <hi>ſaved,</hi> of which they that fail to reap the benefit do only fail for this reaſon, <hi>becauſe they have no will to take it;</hi> (which are the Primates expreſſions) if, I ſay, <hi>Chriſt dyed for all the ſins of the whole world both actual and original</hi> (as ſaith the <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>our Church,</hi> to which the <hi>Primate</hi> hath <hi>ſubſcribed)</hi> how can the greateſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind be abſolutely reprobated, or but paſſed by <hi>in maſſa,</hi> without reſpect unto their <hi>Actual ſins?</hi> For if that can be true, Chriſt dyed not for them; the <hi>paſſing by</hi> being <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to the <hi>giving of Chriſt for their Redemption.</hi> In ſtead of which, the <hi>Calviniſtical writers</hi> do ſolemnly uſe Gods
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:118909:94"/>
               <hi>offering</hi> of Chriſt, not <hi>for</hi> them, but <hi>to</hi> them, who were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by in <hi>that maſs.</hi> And this they labour to reconcile with the <hi>full intention</hi> of God Almighty, that they <hi>to</hi> whom he is <hi>offered</hi> ſhall not <hi>poſſibly enjoy</hi> him. Of which what reaſon can they imagin but only this, that they think he was not <hi>offered for</hi> them, ſo as to make their ſins <hi>pardonable,</hi> and their perſons <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>Mercy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not here take a view of what <hi>Infuſions</hi> have been received by ſuch <hi>Miſtakers</hi> as Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> from his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips <hi>Hiſtory of Gotteſchalc,</hi> and from his <hi>celebrated Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi> whether printed <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>without</hi> his leave, (nor was it, you know, till very <hi>lately,</hi> that you proclaimed the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between his <hi>reputed</hi> and <hi>real</hi> works.) And as I will not do <hi>that,</hi> ſo will I not make any <hi>compariſons</hi> betwixt the Doctrines of Biſhop <hi>Overal,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Gotteſchalc:</hi> I having already made it apparent, that as my <hi>Certificates</hi> were helpful to me for the making good what I had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht of that great name, ſo <hi>you</hi> and I (thus put together) have alſo been helpful to thoſe <hi>Certificates,</hi> for the making good of thoſe things, whereof they have certified a <hi>Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold knowledge;</hi> which as a <hi>threefold Cord</hi> being not eaſily to be <hi>broken,</hi> I ſhall hope will be ſo happy, as to draw your ſuffrage to make it ſtronger. I know not what ſhould ſcare you from a concurrence, except a <hi>ſhew</hi> of <hi>diſhonour</hi> which a change of judgement may ſeem to carry along with it. But that I am ſure hath no place <hi>here;</hi> for to change ones judgement upon juſt Grounds (as well from <hi>good</hi> to <hi>better,</hi> as from <hi>evil</hi> to good) is the moſt honourable mark of a mans mortality, and I think <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>True lovers of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I am able to let you alone, Sir, (how much Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſoever is at my elbow to pluck my pen from my paper) I will tell you what I read lately in the <hi>life and Death of Dr. Iackson,</hi> compoſed by the ſtrict and impartial hand of Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> then whom I do not believe there lives a more conſciencious and punctual ſpeaker, as being one who
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118909:94"/>
might have written Dr. <hi>Iacksons</hi> life from his own, had it been poſſible for a man of his ſingular modeſty to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his own merits: which I ſay to this end, that you may certainly believe what he relateth, concerning <hi>the Care which the Primate took</hi> (being a Mourner at the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of that Rare Man) <hi>to have the writings of Dr. Iackson very religiouſly preſerved;</hi> that ſuch ineſtimable <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> might not be wanting to poſterity, but might performe their proper work of bringing Religion into its wits: whereas had his Lordſhip been Calviniſtical (as Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> would fain have made him by his notorious <hi>creative</hi> Faculty) he would rather have taken care that ſuch books might have been buried with their Authors Body, and in a Grave ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times deeper. For Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> doth ſomewhere tell us, that <hi>Doctor Iackson</hi> was the <hi>Father of Engliſh Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> (my <hi>Lord his Grace of Armagh</hi> it ſeems was one of his <hi>children) and miſerable is England, if ſuch mens writings as</hi> 
               <note place="margin">c. 2, p. 46, 47.</note> 
               <hi>Dr. Iacksons and Caſtalio's are become as pleaſing to the dainty wits amongſt us, as ever Titus Veſpaſian was, who was ſtyled Deliciae humani generis.</hi> So zealous was the good <hi>Primate</hi> (if Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> hath any <hi>Truth</hi> in him) to contribute his care to our <hi>undoing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now as ſoon as I have told you, that I meant Dr. <hi>Godwin,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Roman and Iewiſh Antiquities,</hi> (whoſe Chriſtian name I think was <hi>Ioſeph)</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by reading the Remonſtrant writings, as Dr. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Potter</hi> of pious memory had been a little before him; that I am not the Author of <hi>Tilenus examined before the Triers;</hi> that if ever I go to London (which I have hardly ever done willingly) I ſhall gladly make an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with you; and that if I puniſh Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> it ſhall be meerly in my <hi>defence,</hi> and very much <hi>leſs</hi> then he <hi>deſerveth;</hi> I think there is nothing in your Letter, to which any more can be expected from</p>

               <p>A Poſtſcript to this laſt Letter ſent to Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> together with it.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ONe thing comes into my mind ſince the ſubſcription of my Letter. You ſay in your firſt printed letter to Mr. <hi>Barlee, That</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 45.</note> 
               <hi>the Doctrine of S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>was it which was confirmed by the Primate,</hi> and ſo elſewhere (I think) to that purpoſe. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Account of the Controv. about perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp;c. in ſetting down the fourth opinion p. 4, 5.</note> hath publickly avowed, that S. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> opinion was for the <hi>final falling away of ſome effectually called, regenerated, juſtified, and ſanctified.</hi> And becauſe <hi>ſome are ſo immodeſt as to deny it,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>he asked the Reverend Bp.</hi> Uſher, <hi>in the hearing of Dr.</hi> Kendal, <hi>whether this were not plainly the judgement of</hi> Auſtin: who anſwered, <hi>that without doubt it was.</hi> Then he addes many places out of <hi>Auſtin</hi> by which this appears. And whereas he judgeth this opinion of <hi>Auſtin</hi> to be <note n="*" place="margin">P. 15.</note> 
               <hi>unſound,</hi> nay <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to many Texts of Scripture,</hi> he doth obliquely in ſo doing <hi>defame</hi> the <hi>judgement</hi> of my <hi>Lord Primate,</hi> in caſe he concurred therein with <hi>Auſtin;</hi> as <hi>I</hi> cannot but think he <hi>did,</hi> both by what was ſpoken by his <hi>Grace</hi> to Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and by what you have affirmed in the place <hi>above-cited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, Good Reader, I have accounted for what I ſpake in my former writings, touching the judgement of that Venerable and Learned Prelate. Not out of any the leaſt deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of breaking Peace or Friendſhip with Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> (whoſe <hi>publick Letters</hi> notwithſtanding had made it <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> for me to do ſome <hi>juſtice</hi> unto my ſelf, in a way <hi>as publick:)</hi> but partly to perform what I had <hi>publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi> to make appear; partly to gratifie the importunities of ſome, who would needs have me <hi>publiſh</hi> what <hi>I</hi> could ſay of this <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> that they who had met with my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> onely, might be acquainted with my <hi>Grounds too;</hi> and partly to demonſtrate to the moſt <hi>contrary-minded,</hi> that I
