            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Seeing a man in the <hi>Pillory;</hi> he ſaid, That certainly there muſt be a great deal of pleaſant Oratory in it, or elſe men would not have their Eares nailed to it.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, That Antiquaries love every thing as <hi>Duch-men</hi> do Cheeſe, for being mouldy and Worm-eaten.</p>

               <p>Being asked by one, how he ſhould uſe Tobacco that it might do him good, he anſwered, You muſt keep a Tobacco ſhop, and ſell it, for certainly there are none elſe find good in it.</p>

               <p>Of all Trades he ſaid, A Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer was the moſt unconſcionable,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47794:104"/>becauſe his Trade was to take away that, whereby every man gets his living. And that a Hangman's Profeſſion was the moſt contemplative of all others, becauſe he never was to work, but he was put in mind of his own end.</p>

               <p>That Colliers and Mine-workers ſhould be well acquainted with all <hi>Philoſophical Secrets</hi> of the Earth, becauſe they have deeper knowledge in it then any others.</p>
               <p>That Drawers and Tapſters ſhould be men of great eſteem, Becauſe they are men not only of an high Calling, but alſo of a great reckoning.</p>
               <p>Of all Knaves (he ſaid) there was the greateſt hope of a Cobler, for though he be ever ſo idle a Fellow, yet he is always mending.</p>
               <p>One time ſeeing a tall Man, he ſaid, That for certain he muſt needs be a great <hi>Polititian,</hi> becauſe he had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reach.</p>
               <p>He ſaid a ſquint eyed Man could not

               <p>That Glaſiers might be choſen, and concluded good deciders of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, or Arbitrators, For they ſpend moſt of their time in compoſing of quarrels.</p>
               <p>That Carpenters were the Civilieſt and honeſteſt of all men, For they never do their buſineſs without a Rule.</p>
               <p>That Phyſicians of all men had the beſt on't, For if they did well, the World did proclame it, if ill, the Earth did cover it.</p>
               <p>That Vintners are very raſh fellows, becauſe they draw upon all occaſions: and ſo expert at their Weapons, that they let very few go away ſcot-free.</p>
               <p>That Fidlers are very unfortunate in their occupation, For they never do any thing, but it is againſt the hair.</p>
               <p>That Trumpeters are ever ſubject to Diſtempers, For commonly when they are moſt in health, they will fall a ſounding.</p>
               <p>That Oſtlers and Horſe-courſers are happy men, For let the World go how it will, and let there be never ſo much alteration in times and perſons,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47794:105"/>yet they are ſtill to be accounted Stable-men.</p>
               <p>A perſon Drunk one day, railing at him, he told the Company he matter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not any thing what he ſaid in his Cups, For he ſpake nothing that he could ſtand to.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, ſome Taylors were like Wood-cocks, becauſe they lived by their long Bills.</p>
               <p>That a Priſon is a good Inſtrument of Reformation, for it makes many Rogues and Lewd Fellows, ſtaid men.

               <p>That Coblers might be ſaid to be good men, becauſe they ſet men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and are ever employ'd in mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, that a Tavern and Houſes of Entertainment were the only place for men to thrive in, For he ſaid, He had ſeen many a ſcore made there.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:47794:106"/>
               <p>That Carriers are wiſe men, for they will not meddle with any thing, but they will know of what moment and weight it is.</p>
               <p>That Painters were cunning Fellows, For they had a Colour for what ever they did.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, that Court-gallants had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be good Schollars, By reaſon they were deep in many Books.</p>
               <p>One was ſaying to him, that ſome Letters in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet were longer then any other whatever: That's not ſo, ſaid he, for in ours we have one, an <hi>L</hi> long.</p>
               <p>That Glovers get a great part of their living, by cutting Purſes, and are never puniſh'd for it.</p>
               <p>Seeing on a time a man with a great Noſe and thin Beard, he ſaid that the ſhadow of that mans long Noſe hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the growth of his Beard.</p>
               <p>Hearing of a Wench (that was bred on the Alms of the Pariſh) who had left one of her Baſtards to be kept by them alſo, I commend her, ſaid he, for her gratitude; having done like the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Stork in <hi>Holland,</hi> for it is reported of them, that they never depart but
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47794:106"/>leave one of their young behind them, in recompence of the kindneſs they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their Land-lord.</p>
               <p>He was wont to ſay, that the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe</hi> ſeems a Fool, and is ſo; the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> ſeems wiſe, and is a Fool; the <hi>French</hi> ſeems a Fool, and is wiſe; the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> is wiſe, but cannot ſhow it; and the <hi>Dutchman</hi> would be wiſer, were it not for his Liquor.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid he, may ſick perſons be called Patients, ſince they ſuffer ſo much by their Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, that Soldiers in Peace, were like Chimneys in <hi>Summer.</hi>

                  <p>IT is cuſtomary among the Nobility, and perſons of great quality in <hi>France</hi> to lye in Chambers apart from thoſe of their Ladies. Now there was a Lord (ſhall be at preſent nameleſs) who notwithſtanding his Lady was as eminent a Beauty as moſt was in <hi>France,</hi> yet he muſt (forſooth) follow the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Countrey; now when at any time he had a deſire to enjoy the ſwear embraces of hit lovely conſort,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47794:131"/>riſing from his own bed he would ſtead out in the dark in his Shirt, making no noiſe, and knocking at his Ladies Chamber dore ſoftly, ſhe knowing his cuſtome gave him admittance; now beſides the Mode, he had another reaſon (as he ſaid) to approve thereof, becauſe it lookt ſo like whoring. Having performed the neceſſary and obliging duty of Marriage Bed, he returned to his own Chamber there to ſpend the reſidue of the Night in an undiſturbed repoſe. One of this Lord's <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> taking notice of this humour, concluded that he might have the ſame admittance into his Ladies Chamber, and participate of the ſame Pleaſures by the ſame means his Maſters humour had inculcated into his thoughts. Upon a ſerious conſultation with himſelf, he concluded that Night beſt for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing his Deſign, in which his Maſter had viſited his Lady; about an hour after he reſolved to put his luſtful Project in Practice; which he did ſo well by imitation that he got entrance: Your own thoughts may inform you how they ſpent the time, without my putting the modeſt to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yagant
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47794:132"/>expence of bluſhes. All I ſhall ſay is, That this Fellow performed his part ſo vigorouſly and ſo often, that when he went from her, he left her all wonder and amazement: and that which encreas'd her <hi>admiration</hi> was not only his profound ſilence, although ſhe urged him to ſpeak to her with all the melting Rhetorick ſhe could deviſe, but the coming of her husband twice as ſhe ſuppoſed; whilſt ſhe was thus ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating with her ſelf being left alone, her Husband ſtimulated more than ordinary by ſome provocatives he had taken the day before, comes and with his acuſtomed knock and whisper demanded entrance, ſhe knowing her Lords voice aroſe and let him in; as he was about to proſecute his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed enjoyment, his Lady begg'd him to forbear, urging that he was much to blame to be ſo inordinate in his deſires: <hi>what</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Could not you my Lord (ſince you find ſo great an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) be content to have out done your ſelf this night by ſo many repetitions, but that you muſt again expoſe your body to the injury of the cold in ſo ſhort a time again;</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a third time, in leſs than two hours?

Having laid a while (in which time he ſtudied to divert his Lady as he could) he got up, and being come into his own Chamber he could not reſt there long, but putting on his Breeches and a Gown went into all his Male-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Chambers that were about him, making, along as he went, a ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry with his Noſe in every Bed, for it ſeems this Lady was well ſented. There was one of whom he at length might have ſome grounds of ſuſpition; becauſe, beſides his complection which never fail'd of ardent inclination to the Female Sex, he was both a handſome and a very ſubtle Fellow, but he could not tell which Bed he lay in; by chance
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47794:133"/>groping up and down in the dark he ſound his Bed, and pulling up the Cloathes ſmelt a perfume he was very well acquainted with; and from thence judged this muſt be the Rogue that had done him this diſhonour; wherefore that he might be ſure to know him the next day, he took out of his Pocket a pair of Sizers, and ſnipe off one of his Whiskers, for then it was the Faſhion to wear them. This Fellow was a wake, and by this knew very well his Maſter, and his Deſign, firſt by ſmelling, and then by marking him, that he might be known the next day, to prevent which as ſoon as his Maſter was gone, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſtarts up; and going into all the Chambers aforeſaid, cuts off (from every one that had any) that Whisker that was on the ſame ſide of the Mouth that his was on, and returns to his own Bed. The Servants getting up next morning, and ſeeing each others right Whisker gone, ſtood ſtaring one upon another like ſo many diſtracted Bedla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, not knowing what to ſay, or whom to accuſe. In ſhort, one that was known ſufficiently to be an arch Rogue was ſuſpected, and thereupon

He went and told the Officers what he intended ſuch a morning and ordered them to be ready in ſome ambuſh very near him, for he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned not but he had ſtudied the means infallibly to draw the Gentleman out of doors. The Smith having bought him a rope over night, got up very early the next morning much about the time the Gentleman uſed to look out of his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, having got upon his Grindſton, he threw a Rope croſs a Beam in his own ſhed, where he might be eaſily ſeen by the oppoſite Gentleman, and having made it faſt above, he put the nooſe about his neck, and then extending his hands to Heaven, with elevated Eyes, he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay his Prayers, the Gentleman ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, out of meer pitty and commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration, ran out with all the ſpeed he could, the Bayliffs ſeeing that, ran out
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47794:143"/>and ſurpriſed him; the Smith hearing a noiſe, endeavoured to turn about to ſee what was the matter, and in that motion, ſlipt from the grindſtone, and there hung; the Bayliffs being buſied, and over-joy'd upon the ſeizing their Priſoner, never minded what became of the Smith, but going away with their Priſoner to ſecure him, left him hanging as the juſt reward of ſo foul a Treachery,</p>
                  <p>Another Smith living in the Countrey, there was a neſt of Hornets in the Thatch of his Hovel, who had made their way quite through, and as he was at work on a long Curtain rod red hot, an Hornet ſtung him; at firſt he minded it not very much, but preſently after came another, and ſtung him in the face, this ſo enraged him that looking up and ſeeing them all buſy in the thatch, cry'd out are ye there ye Devils, i'le ſet fire in your Arſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; hereupon he ran with the rod to the Forge, and heating it again, he ran it up at them, and withal running through the thatch ſet it a fire, and ſo revenging himſelf on his enemies he half ruin'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by burning down his own Hovel.</p>

                  <p>A few days after this new married Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leman got his (ſuppoſed Maiden) Wife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his company, and having repeated his former delights, he told her, he would go into the Country, giving her directions where to ſend to him, and that if ſhe prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Child, and that her Parents ſhould diſcover it, as that they would quickly do, that then ſhe ſhould diſſemble the greateſt grief imaginable, and when preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed very much to diſcover the Father, ſhe ſhould then confeſs it was ſuch a one, who had formerly made Love to her but her Parents would not accept of the Motion; as for the reſt ſaid he, leave the whole management to me.</p>

                  <p>This return netled them to the heart, and ſhow'd it their Daughter with all the opprobriums that can be uttered.

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47794:153"/>with ſeveral other things which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed highly to his advantage, that the old Gentleman was willing to admit of a Parley with his Son-in-Law that muſt be; and as he was about to ſpeak with leſſer anger than before, he was prevented by the young man, ſaying, <hi>Sir, come end your cruelty all at once, I am ready to accept of that Marriage of the Stake you propoſed laſt Night to your Daughter: if I cannot live with her I love, I ſhall rejoice to dye with her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The old man was all amazement, to hear what ere he ſaid at home in private ſhould be known abroad; at length he collecting himſelf, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſomewhat calm'd his paſſion, he told the young man ſince he ſaw the Stars did fight againſt him as to this Marriage, he ſhould have his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conditionally he would tell him how he came by this ſtrange intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, whether the Devil, or his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did aſſiſt him in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this the young man replyed, <hi>That he came not to the knowledge of what he ſaid ſecretly elſewhere, nor his Daughter, but by humane means, and that he would tell him how, ſo be it he would forgive the Perſon. No, no,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:47794:153"/>never</hi> (cry'd the old man, in a great rage) <hi>I will firſt ſee him rot in an Hoſpital, or be Hang'd at Tibourn, and be Damn'd rather than do it; Nay then</hi> (ſaid the young man) <hi>you are to Blame, Sir, to be ſo uncharitably cruel againſt your ſelf; for from you, and you only we received this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence; you were the Porter, or Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that carryed Letters between us:</hi> how! how can this be (with much Wonder cry'd the old man); to convince you (ſaid the other) I will now ſhow you a Letter in your Portmantue that this Night by your means will be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your Daughter, and thereupon taking the Cloak he ſhewed him the rip in the Cape, wherein they mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveighed Letters to each other.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort the old man was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely pleas'd with the Stratagem, and in a little time lov'd the young man more than he hated him formerly, and gave him his Daughter with a vaſt ſome of mony down at the Marriage day, and in leſs than twelve months did his Son and Daughter the kindneſs to leave the world, and leave them all he had.</p>

               <head>A PREACHMENT ON MALT.</head>
               <p>CErtain Townſmen of <hi>Priſal,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from a merry Meeting at a certain Ale-houſe, met in the Fields a Preacher, who had lately made a bitter Sermon againſt Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, and amongſt other opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words, called them Malt-worms, Wherefore they agreed to take him, and by violence compel him to Preach a Sermon, and his Text ſhould be <hi>MALT.</hi> The Preacher thinking
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:47794:166"/>it better to yield, than contend with them in their cauſe, began his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as followeth.</p>
               <p>There is no Preaching without Diviſion, and this Text cannot well be divided into many parts, becauſe it is but one word, nor into many Syllables, becauſe it is but one Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; It muſt therefore be divided into Letters, and they are found to be four, <hi>viz. M, A, L, T,</hi> Theſe letters repreſent four interpretations, which Divines commonly do uſe thus, <hi>M.</hi> Moral, <hi>A.</hi> Allegorical, <hi>L.</hi> Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>T.</hi> Tropological.</p>
               <p>The Moral Interpretation is well put firſt, and firſt to teach you boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Men ſome good manners, at leaſt in procuring your attention to the Sermon; Therefore <hi>M.</hi> Maſters, <hi>A.</hi> All, <hi>L.</hi> Liſten, <hi>T.</hi> to the Text.</p>
               <p>An Allegory is when one thing is ſpoken, and another thing meant; The thing ſpoken is Malt, the thing meant is the Oyle of Malt, commonly
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47794:167"/>call'd Ale, which to you Drunkards is ſo precious, that you account it to be <hi>M.</hi> Meat, <hi>A.</hi> Ale, <hi>L.</hi> Liberty, <hi>T.</hi> Treaſure.</p>
               <p>The literal ſenſe is as it hath been often heard of heretofore, ſo it is true according to the letter, <hi>M.</hi> Much <hi>A.</hi> Ale, <hi>L.</hi> Little, <hi>T.</hi> Thrift.</p>
               <p>The Tropological ſence applyeth that which now is to ſomwhat follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either in this world, or in the world to come, the thing that now is, is the effect which Oyle of Malt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth and worketh in ſome of you, <hi>viz. M.</hi> Murther, in others <hi>A.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, in all <hi>L.</hi> Looſe living, in many <hi>T.</hi> Treaſon, and that which hereafter followeth, both in this world and in the world to come, is <hi>M.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, <hi>A.</hi> Anguiſh, <hi>L.</hi> Lamentation, <hi>T.</hi> Trouble.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now come to a concluſion, and withal, to perſwade you boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious men to amend, that ſo you may eſcape the danger whereinto many of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:47794:167"/>you are like to fall, but I have no hopes to prevail, becauſe I plainly ſee, and my Text as plainly telleth me it is <hi>M.</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> that is, a Thouſand Pound to a Pot of Ale you will never mend, becauſe all Drunkards are <hi>L.</hi> Lewd, <hi>T.</hi> Thieves, but yet for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging my Conſcience and duty, Firſt towards God, and Secondly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you my Neighbours, I ſay once again, concluding with my Text, <hi>M.</hi> Mend, <hi>A.</hi> All, and <hi>L.</hi> Leave, <hi>T.</hi> Tipling, otherwiſe, <hi>M.</hi> Maſters, <hi>A.</hi> All, <hi>L.</hi> Look for, <hi>T.</hi> Terrour and Torment.</p>
               <p>By this time the Ale wrought in the Townſmens Brains that they were between Hawk and Buzzard, nearer ſleeping than waking, which the Preacher perceiving ſtole away, Leaving them to take their Nap.</p>
