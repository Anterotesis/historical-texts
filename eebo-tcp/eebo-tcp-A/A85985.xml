         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It's probable, that in ſuch a large field, ſo plentifully ſtored, the beſt Reapers may leave ſome Gleanings for their followers. The Lord of the Harveſt hath often employed many of his Servants among all Nations, in the various ſucceſsions of his Church, to promote his bleſſed work of Peace by their Pens, as by all other due Means.

Senſe of Duty in ſuch a Juncture and Turn of Affairs prevailed with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the publication of the Libertine School'd: and Chriſts Soveraign Antidote againſt ſinfull Errors, not long ago. The ſame ground hoth now brought forth theſe Papers, to ſerve as a whet-ſtone, though dull in it ſelf, to the ſharpening of all the Lords Friends, that their abilities and Opportunities may be improved to the uttermoſt, for Chriſts Intereſt, in this great Work of his. I would not be idle as long as its day, nor neglect any advantage afforded of doing God and his people ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. My hearts deſire is, that the leaſt cauſe of offence may not be given to the leaſt of Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by any expreſsion or carriage of mine.

The two great Ordinances of the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, are moſt concern'd in this Buſineſs of Peace, and moſt endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by the enemies thereof.

He went up and down, in performing of his Mediatory function, doing good, and ſpeaking Peace to their ſouls and bodies. A famous Sermon of his is epitomized in the context foregoing and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.

            <p>Three ſpecial parts are ſignally obſervable in theſe words, 1. A bleſſed thing, <hi>Peace.</hi> 2. The bleſſed Perſons imployed about it, <hi>Peace-makers.</hi> 3. Their bleſſed Property dignifying them, <hi>they ſhall be called the children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thence accordingly flow three propoſitions.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Explanation muſt unfold the Terms: the word, Peace, in Hebrew, <hi>Shalom,</hi> is derived from a Root that ſignifies ſerenity, quiet, perfection; it imports comprehenſively, what the Greeks expreſs by various phraſes, <gap reason="foreign">

There is a Belzebub, a Prince of Devils, the ſtrong man that

keeps all in Peace, under his Rule. As Satanical ſpirits do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure together, ſo are too many wicked Wretches combined with them, either directly, or collaterally. Witches and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers are become Satans ſlaves, by explicite Compact. All wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons, are his Inſtruments, though many of them more implicitly. Conjunction in ſin, is a conſpiracy, though often coloured with ſpecious pretences of good fellowſhip. Many are daily found to do the Devils work, in plotting miſchief and tempting others to ſin. The beſt of their Peace is but conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <note place="margin">Eſa. 28. 15. 2 Kin. 9. 22. Eſa. 57. 21.</note>in all ſinfull aſſociations. Whilſt they make a Covenant with Hell, and find no trouble in Satans drudgery, what Peace can they expect? <hi>There is no Peace ſaith my God to the wicked.</hi> All ſuch Peace is but nominal and aequivocal. Our Text excludes all ſuch.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a good Peace, Peace in good, which is intended here: This is the ſweet agreement and harmonious Correſpondency of things in conformity to Gods Will, their Soveraign Principle, Rule and End. The Creatures <hi>eſſe</hi> and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is given it in order to its <hi>operari</hi> and working. That work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſtill to be ſutable to their Being, according to that Rule, which the Being of Beings doth by his pleaſure appoint thereto, for its proper end. Whilſt things thus move in their reſpective Sphere, Peace is maintained in a mutual accommodation to each other. Man is ſpecially concerned in this Peace, and that in a treble reſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is an Eternal Peace, Peace with God.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="3">3. External Peace with men is anſwerable to our ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, both religious and civil.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a Religious, Eccleſiaſtical Peace, which is the tuning of Gods People into a due compoſure and Chriſtian Correſpondence in the affairs of his Church and Worſhip. This Peace are we often minded of and preſſed to, that having <hi>Salt</hi> in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> we may have Peace one <hi>with another.</hi> The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <note place="margin">Mar. 9. 50. 1 Theſſ. 5. 13.</note>of Chriſts body, though different and diſtant, are thus to be at Peace, as in the Church myſtical Inviſible, ſo in the Church Political viſible. They muſt ſtudy the things that are for Peace,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114746:16"/>
wherein they may edifie one another. They that agree in the <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 19.</note>main of Chriſtianity, ſhould labour to agree and help one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the means thereof. All the living ſtones of Chriſts ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5, 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Epheſ. 2. 20, 21, 22</note>houſe, that are duly ſet on him the foundation, ſhould be regularly ſquared, to comply with each other therein: Schiſms and Convulſions are alwaies bad, but worſt of all here. Though we may not joyn with Gods people in that which appears evil to us; yet that difference muſt not hinder us from cloſing with them in ſuch things which they and we do account needful and good. This Peace includes not Approbation of evil, nor doth it exclude due Adminiſtration of regular Cenſures, private or publick. We are herein to imitate Chriſt our Head, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of no evil, and ſtill adminiſters all due cenſures; yet is not, in the leaſt, hindred thereby from bearing with his children and ſervants, in forbearing them, as he ſees convenient. He keeps peace with them, whileſt he chides and frowns, threatens and corrects; ſo ſhould Chriſtians do, after his pattern for each others good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A civil Peace bears its proportion to our reſpective ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either political in the State, or Oeconomical in the family. To this Peace we are all called, being bid and bound to ſeek and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15. Heb. 12. 14. Rom. 12. 18. Ier. 29. 7. Pſalm 34.</note>follow it hard, not only with the gentle, but alſo with the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. As we are men, ſubject to humane frailties, and willing to be born with, ſo muſt we think the like of others. No poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick fabrick can ſtand without this. The Laws of Nature and of Nations, are ſubordinate to the Laws of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for the cementing and maintaining hereof. This Peace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not any Commiſſion of evil, or omiſſion of duty, but only that which tends to an orderly accommodation of mutual Relations, for good, againſt evil.</p>

Induction might eaſily be made by pregnant inſtances in each particular branch, were it needful, in ſo clear a point. The experience of all Ages, publick and perſonal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies it more then ſufficiently. This Sun-light needs not the help of our Candle.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Demonſtration and Ground of this truth may be contracted into a threefold Reaſon, from the Author, Nature, and Adjuncts thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Peace is a bleſſed thing, becauſe the bleſſed God is the peculiar Author and Cauſe thereof, conſidered both eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and perſonally.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 7, 9. 2 Cor. 13. 11. 1 Theſ. 5. 23. Heb. 13. 20.</note> 1. God eſſentially conſidered is the God of Peace; that's his Title of Honour frequently proclaimed by his Heraulds and Embaſſadors. What's Peace but the congruity of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in each creature, to that end, whereto the ſupreme Mover hath appointed their reſpective Beings? All Good muſt needs be from the firſt and chief good, being ruled by him, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, as it comes from him. The more of true Peace there is found anywhere, the more of God, and Bleſſedneſs ſtill. Gods excellency is ſhadowed out to us by Divines in a triple Method of exemption, eminency, and cauſation. Thus God is declared to be infinite, unchangeable, &amp;c. he is moſt juſt, moſt wiſe, &amp;c. and he is the Cauſe of Cauſes, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, governs and ſupplies all things by a conſtant Influx of Providence, being alwaies the proxime immediate Cauſe to every action. His divine cauſality runs as a ſtring through all ſecundary Cauſes, to knit them to their reſpective operations and effects, which he ſuſpends and orders at his will. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency of creatures to his will keeps the Peace and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs ſo far; their breaking of rank, and forſaking their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſtation and motion, brings the Jar and Woe, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Peace. Sin and ſorrow come in at ſuch a gap, whileſt the rational creature looſens this Bond of Peace in any Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114746:17"/>
God himſelf challenges a ſpecial intereſt in this great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as the Author and Ruler, Supporter and Promoter, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer and Preſerver, Proprietor and Diſpoſer thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God perſonally conſidered is the God of Peace, which makes it to be ſuch a Bleſſing. In the divine Trinity a perfect Peace ſhines moſt gloriouſly. Unity and Order, the great Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Peace appear therein, by the beams of that eternal Brightneſs. Unity of Eſſence, and Order of Perſons hold forth that tranſcendent Peace in the divine Trin-Unity. There are <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 7.</note>three that bear Record in heaven, the Father, the Word and the Spirit; and theſe three are one. Here is priority, not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority; <note place="margin">Ordo Originis, non regiminis.</note>a co-ordination, though no ſubordination. Theſe three divine Perſons, have a diſtinct, as well as a conjunct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 8.</note>into Peace; there are three that bear Record on earth, agreeing in one alſo, towards Peace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God the Father is the Head-ſpring, and Original Source of Peace to man. It flows from him primarily to us; thus the Apoſtle teaches us to expect Grace, Mercy and Peace, from God <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 2.</note>the Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God the Son is the grand Treaſurer of our Peace, which he receives from the Father for us. You have him therefore ſtill joyned to the Father in the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the great Charter <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 2. Epheſ. 2. 14.</note>of our Bleſſedneſs. Grace and Peace coming from the Father, deſcend likewiſe from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. He is our Peace, in the very abſtract, both Efficiently and Meritoriouſly, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively and Objectively, Originally and Completively, by whom the Father ſpeaks and gives Peace ſtill.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> 3. God the holy Ghoſt is the Author of our Peace alſo, that gives life and ſtrength thereto. Peace is the fruit of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, who ſpeaks and acts ſtill from the Father, and from the Son. He ſhall take of mine ſaid Chriſt, and declare it to <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 14, 15.</note>you: All that the Father hath is mine. He is the Spirit of Unity and Order, that compoſes mens ſpirits to the receiving and promoting of Peace, in all the waies he appoints and bleſſes, that the Unity of the Spirit may be kept ſtill in the Bond of Peace. Thus the Bleſſedneſs of Peace is rationally drawn from <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 3.</note>the bleſſed God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:114746:18"/>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. The next ground is drawn from the Nature of Peace, which abundantly demonſtrates its bleſſedneſs. Doth it not conſiſt in an harmonious compoſure of Things, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating all their motions to their proper ends, in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Lords will? is not ſuch an agreement moſt pleaſant and beautiful, moſt honourable and profitable? How excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently appears ſuch a Symmetrie in all things Natural and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial? how much more in things moral, ſpiritual and divine? Unity and Order are the choice ingredients of this Peace, the chief materials and integrals thereof, and are not theſe of ſingular worth indeed? the former affords ſubſiſtence and ſtrength, the latter regulates and improves all in all due moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? is not ſuch a correſpondence between God and man, a moſt happy thing? How bleſſed is the match that joins earth <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 17.</note>to heaven, and the creature to the Creator! Is not the calm ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ity of our ſouls, a ſingular bleſſing? is not the ſociable conjunction of men, in the pleaſant waies of true Wiſdom, an eminent Mercy? all that excellency, which may be found in good things below and above, is uſed often in Scripture Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to ſet out the Nature of this ſingular Peace. This melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tuning of Perſons and Things, cannot but afford a moſt bleſſed Muſick to judicious ears. Peace is truly that eminent good, wherein center all other kind of good. <hi>Platonicians</hi> ſpeak of a raviſhing melody, reſulting from the Heavens order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motions, which would fill men with admiration, were their ears but tuned thereto. Peace is the marvellous conſent of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, the choice reſult of their United, Orderly poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and products. That <hi>anima mundi</hi> and univerſal Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence mentioned by Philoſophers, doth in a ſober ſenſe illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Nature of this Peace, which, in ſubordination to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, compoſes the creatures into their proper ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſpoſes of all in regular motions. This Symmetry is the perfection of every Fabrick Spiritual and Political, giving due proportion to the whole and parts in their well-ordered Union and Communion: it is in reality, <hi>vinculum univerſi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that keeps the unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:114746:18"/>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. The bleſſed adjuncts thereof demonſtrate the ſame in an ample manner. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruth and Righteouſneſs, Grace and Mercy, Joy and Bliſs, are the choice companions and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants thereof.</p>
            <p>Truth and Peace are the bleſſed twins, that lovingly embrace each other in the Kingdom of Chriſt. When he gives an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract <note place="margin">Pſal. 85. 8, 9.</note>of his gracious All-ſufficiency, engaged to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſumme of mans duty, challenged by Gods Mercy, is the Love of Truth and Peace. This is the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs whereby a Chriſtian is to ſteer his courſe towards true Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>edneſs.</p>
            <p>Truth conforms all Beings to the divine underſtanding, and Peace ſquares their Workings to the divine Will, for ſuch ends as his Truth declares to them. They are aptly repreſented by a pair of compaſſes, centred by Truth, and moved about by Peace. The girdle of Truth is buckled with Peace. This golden chain leads all things to God, from whom they came, by a tranſcendent way of circulation.</p>
            <p>Righteouſneſs is as dear a Siſter to Peace, yea as a Mother and a tender Nurſe thereto. They come down together from <note place="margin">Pſal. 85. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Rom. 14. 17.</note>the God of Heaven, to bleſs the earth with all deſireable good. Righteouſneſs indeed is the eldeſt ſiſter, yet inſeparably atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Peace. Righteouſneſs gives to God and man their <note place="margin">Pſal. 45. Pſal. 72. 27. Heb 7. 1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Iſa. 32. 17.</note>due, Peace looks to the orderly preſerving thereof. When the Lord Jeſus appears to men as King of Righteouſneſs, he acts alſo as the King of Peace. The work of Righteouſneſs and the effect thereof in his Kingdom of Nature and Grace, is aſſured Peace and laſting quiet. The experience of all Perſons and Places hath ever found this made good by the righteous God. As far as Righteouſneſs did ever extend in Morals, or Spirituals, ſo far hath Peace been extended alſo. The Roman and Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an States for many hundreds of years were made ſenſible of this. The righteous God loves Righteouſneſs, his countenance <note place="margin">Pſal. 11. 7.</note>doth behold the upright, to bleſs them with all the bleſſings of Peace.</p>
            <p>Grace and Mercy bear likewiſe as dear and near a Relation

               </gap>dictions ſent to Gods people by the Prophets and Apoſtles. Gods favouring Grace towards them, and his renewing Grace, in planted in them have ſtill Peace for a bleſſed Aſſociate. They are Imparted and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied together, as their choiſe Portion. Often is Mercy ſubjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that Grace; to denote the undeſerved favour of the Lord ſhewed to his people in miſery. Thus Grace and Peace, Grace, Mercy and Peace go hand in hand to excite, direct and enable Gods people to every duty, in each relation.</p>
            <p>Joy and Bleſſing do accompany Peace, on the ſame account; <note place="margin">Phil 4. 7. Rom. 5. 1. 2, 3.</note>when the Lord ſpeaks Peace to his, he beſtows on them the Bleſſings of Peace. Thus the Peace of God, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Being juſtified by faith, we have Peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and rejoyce in hope of the <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note>Glory of God. This Peace of God keeps them, as with a Garriſon, in the ſenſe and comfort of his love to bring forth the fruits of his Spirit.

The Aſſe is obſerved by Naturaliſts to be of all Brutes the moſt brutiſh and heady; thence raſh and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſinners are expreſſed by the wild Aſſe, ſnuffing the wind at pleaſure; and the Aſſes colt traverſing its wayes in a perverſe <note place="margin">Iob. 11. 12. Ier. 2. 24.</note>headineſs. Thus Schiſm acts with brutiſh raſhneſs, like the fool that will not be convinced by the beſt reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Violence is another Mark of Schiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> carrying the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with impetuouſneſs and fool-hardineſs, like a ſtubborn horſe, rending all to pieces that would keep him within Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian bounds. Ignorance breeds confidence in ſuch, which begets Impudence and violence. As in ſtrong convulſions, the limbs are forcibly ſnatched and racked out of their proper ſeat in the body natural by the ſtrength of malignant humors, or vapors; ſo doth Schiſm boiſterouſly rend many a member from the body of Chriſt, as thoſe poor wretches, mentioned in the Goſpel, that were poſſeſſed with unclean ſpirits, were violently tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by them, and hurried away from their place and work, through fire and water into woful Extreams. So deals Schiſm with many often. The raging fierceneſs of a phrenetick diſtracted <note place="margin">Mar. 1. 26. Luk. 9. 42.</note>Patient ſadly repreſents the turbulent ſtate and ſtormy carriage of this dreadful evil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Uncharitableneſs is alſo the note of this wofull Schiſm. As it oppoſes Juſtice, Prudence and Modeſty, ſo doth it deal with Love. Schiſm will not be kept by the ſtrength of Divine or

Schiſm knows not how to bear with the weak, and manifeſt the bowels of Chriſtian ſympathy towards the ſickly children of Gods houſe. Its ſtill in <hi>Solomons</hi> ſenſe, over-righteous and <note place="margin">Eccle. 7. 16.</note>over-wiſe, through ſelf-deceit and ſelfl-love.

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. There is a good ſeparation from evil; and an evil Separation from good. The former is commanded and commended of God; the later forbidden and threatned.

They muſt withdraw from every Brother who walks diſorderly, much more from that Anti-chriſtian Church, where the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelacy hath caſt out Chriſt, to ſet up his pretended Vicar in his ſtead.

Sin is not to be approved or countenanced, but to be declared <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 2. Iud. 3. Rom. 15. 14 2 Theſſ. 3. 15. Heb. 3. 13.

Thus Gods people are bid to plead with their Mother, to contend for the faith, to admoniſh one another with mutual watchfulneſs, &amp;c. that they may not be partakers of other mens ſins, but ſtill keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Chriſt and <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 3.</note>his Apoſtles did ſo in the Jewiſh Church, though exceedingly corrupt till that ceremonial adminiſtration of the Lords gracious Covenant gave way to the Evangelical diſpenſation thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The evil that Conſcience ſtartles at in the Church, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fundamental, or circumſtantial, as to ſalvation. That evil which deſtroyes the foundation, not holding the Head, when obſtinately retained, after all due convictions, renders a Perſon and Society, unfit for Chriſtian Communion deſervedly, who are to be accordingly dealt with. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> withdrew from the Jews, obſtinately rejecting Chriſt, and ſeparated the <note place="margin">Act. 13. 46. Act. 19. 9.</note>Diſciples. Thus the reformed Churches did orderly proteſt againſt Apoſtate <hi>Rome,</hi> aad ſeparated from them. In this caſe the <hi>Heretical</hi> Society is the Schiſmatick; for as in <hi>Martyrdom,</hi>

Thus when a rotten member contracts an Heretical Gangrene, which makes him fall off, or to be cut off from the Church, he himſelf is the <hi>Schiſmatick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The circumſtantial evil, which offends any perſon in the Church, is variouſly conſiderable in Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline, according to the weight of that Truth it ſeems to oppoſe. Some are of far greater moment then others, and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 23. 1 Cor. 11. 34. Col. 2. 5. 1 Cor. 14. 40.</note>challenge ſutable care and carriage. Some circumſtantials are Indefinite and indifferent in themſelves, to be regulated by Chriſtian prudence in every Society and meeting, as the geſture of the body, length of time ſpent in the exerciſe, &amp;c. where <note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Other Circumſtantials are definite and parts of Worſhip, Inſtituted of the Lord, as the keeping of the firſt day of the week for a Chriſtian Sabbath, ſinging of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114746:21"/>
Pſalms, ſolemn Prayer, &amp;c. which are not indifferent, but neceſſary to be obſerved according to Scripture Rule. He that ſcruples any thing about ſuch, ſhould uſe the beſt means of Information, private and publike, with much humility and ſobriety, diligence and teachableneſs. If after all, he cannot be ſatisfied, he may forbear that particular thing, which his conſcience cannot meddle with, ſtill keeping Communion <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 16, 17.</note>in the reſt. This is the Apoſtles Doctrine, as far as we <hi>have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, and mind the ſame thing; if any be otherwiſe minded, the Lord will reveal that unto him</hi>

               <p n="5">5. If any Chriſtian ſhould find the Church, whereof he is a Member, growing worſe daily, and not admitting of any advice &amp; help for amendment, but obſtinately refuſing to rectifie what is palpably evil, ſuch a man is to be very cautious in that caſe, that in deſiring leave to depart to ſome other ſociety, (where <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3. 15.</note>he may ſerve God with purity and freedom) that all proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings therein may appear to flow from cordiall Love to Chriſt, to his Ordinances and people, with all due reſpects to thoſe alſo, from whom he departs, ſtill owning what ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of good in them with hearty grief for what is amiſs, that he may avoid the ſtigmatical Brand of a ſchiſmatick, in the performance of his duty.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Schiſm from the Church is either univerſal or particular. Univerſal, when Perſons divide from all Chriſtian Societies and People, that do not own their particular way. Such was the ſeparation of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> beſides that of the <hi>Arrians, Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Aceſians, Circumcellians,</hi> and many others, divers whereof were alſo heretical. Such is the Schiſm of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church now apoſtatized from the very foundations of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they verbally profeſs, but collaterally and effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy and renounce by their Antichriſtian additions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, Traditions and Corruptions.</p>
               <p>A particular Schiſm is a ſinfull diviſion from ſome particular Church (whereto a Chriſtian had his Relation) or from ſome Member or Members thereof. The former is a Schiſm from the Body; this later in the Body; a ſad inſtance whereof appeared
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114746:22"/>
in the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> ſharply reproves and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 1 Cor. 3</note>preſcribes a fit cure unto again and again. The grudgings and Rudiments of this ſad diſtemper bewrayed themſelves by divers Symptoms alſo in moſt of the Chriſtian Churches, even in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical daies, and the ſucceeding Primitive Times, witneſs the many cautions and hints given in their Epiſtles, and the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Eccleſiaſtical Records. The ſad experiences of the Reformed Churches in former and later Seaſons, eſpecially in theſe Nations, afford numerous Inſtances thereof ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deplored.</p>

What comes from God, the cheif good, muſt needs be proportionably active for God, in all poſſible good. A bleſſed Peace cannot but have a ſpreading Influence into every Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Condition and Occaſion. Being the effect of Divine Grace, it cannot but act ſtill graciouſly, and produce effects anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its ſtock and nature. The ſeed and the fruit muſt needs reſemble each other. As much as our Peace hath of Grace in it, ſo far will it conduce to the preſervation and augmentation, the Corroboration and excitation of every Grace, in our ſeveral places. It will appear in the way of faith and love, ſincerity and ſelf-denyal, prudence and patience, diligence and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, zeal and courage, meekneſs and lowlineſs, thankfulneſs and obedience. Such a Peace will ſtill be found in that gracious Train of Divine Virtues, which ſtill accompany the God of Peace in his progreſs among the Sons of men. Is thy Peace thus actively productive in a gracious way? Doth it make thee more humble and wiſe, more faithfull and fruitfull in thy general and particular Calling? Doth it ſtill direct, quicken and enable thee to do more for men with God, and for God with men, in every motion of thy proper Sphere? Art thou more vigorous and induſtrious in improving Gods mercy, and performing thy Duty, according to the Inſtructions of Gods Will ſummed up in the firſt and ſecond Table of his gracious Law? Doſt thou ſo acknowledge him in all his wayes and thine, in every Ordinance and Providence, that he may direct thy <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 6. Iſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 64. 5.</note>paths, to the diſcharge of a good Conſcience, in honouring and enjoying him? Is there no duty, thou wouldſt willingly neglect, no Mercy thou wouldſt forget, no Temptation thou woudlſt not reſiſt, no Corruption thou wouldſt not mortifie, no Affliction thou wouldſt not bear, no ſin thou wouldeſt not forbear for his ſake, through the conſtant ſupplies of his Holy Spirit? Is not thy Peace like the worlds Peace, that renders men more ſecure and

               <p n="1">1. The ſenſe and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is wrapped up in the words, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cleared, when we have but opened how this Peace-making is to be underſtood. The Greek expreſſion <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, imports a kind of humane efficiency, variouſly expreſſed in Scripture dialect. God makes Peace as the ſupreme Agent, man as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Inſtrument under him. God works it, as the Primary cauſe, man as a Secundary, acted by him in every motion. God effects it, by over-ruling the minds and hearts of men; Man, by directing and perſwading, in offering Reaſons and Motives ſuited to ſuch minds and hearts. God can do it without means at his Will, but uſually by Bleſſing the means appointed by him; Man, by the diligent improving of thoſe means, whereon the Lord hath promiſed his Bleſſing. According to the nature
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114746:30"/>
of the Peace, ſuch is mans way of working towards it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With reſpect to eternal Peace with God. Man is ſaid to make his Peace, when he follows the Lords directions in order thereto, through the efficacious help of Chriſts renewing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, cloſing with Chriſt by a lively faith upon Goſpel terms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him, cleaving to him, reſting on him, and ſurrendring <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 13.</note>up himſelf to him, according to the conjugal Articles of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Covenant. Thus, whileſt a man is exerciſing Faith and Repentance in an obediential love, that he may through the Spirit, die unto ſin, and live unto God in Chriſt, he is ſaid to make his Peace with God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of internal Peace, a man is ſaid to be the maker thereof inſtrumentally, when he obſerves the Lords inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons through Chriſts ſanctifying Spirit, in purging himſelf from <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1. 2 Cor. 13. 5.

Whileſt he is thus ſearching of his heart, viewing of his waies, and waſhing his conſcience in the blood of Chriſt often, that he may behold therein, as in a Cryſtal Glaſs, the Lords image by due reflexion, he is then ſubordinate unto the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the clearing of Peace in his conſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In relation to external Peace, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical. Man is then a Peace-maker, when he is carefully diligent to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and improve the multiplicious means appointed of God thereto, according to the variations of his proper ſtate and opportunities, through the ſupplies of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This Peace-making then is a multiplicious Act of the whole man, flowing from a gracious principle within, whereby all the powers and parts of ſoul and body are ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The Truth of this Propoſition, in the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of it, that it is ſo, appears ſufficiently from the Word and Providence of God, made out to man in all ſucceſſive Generations. The God of Peace by his manifold precepts and promiſes, prefigurations and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114746:30"/>
propheſies doth largely make out the Duty and Dignity of his Peace-makers. The friends of God were alwaies the friends of his Peace, and were ſtill bleſſed of him ſo far as they cordially promoted the ſame. Thence the royal Prophet, by the Spirit of Chriſt, gives ſuch a charge unto all Gods people; <hi>Pray for the</hi>

                  </gap>icall oblations did ſet out that way of making Peace in man, and among men, as well as for man, which the grace of God carries on gradually, by rendring man ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereto. Every one therefore was by the Law of God to bring his oblation to the door of Gods houſe, laying his hand thereon giving it to the Prieſt, that it might be ſet on Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and ſent up to heaven, with the mixed perfume of the Lords providing. Thus the Goſpel-Law expreſſed to their faith, how every one ſhould contribute his beſt, and bring all to Chriſt, on whom and through whom, acceſs to God, and acceptance with God was peculiarly to be looked for, in order to all kind of Peace and Good. The Lord is therefore ſaid to have ſmelled therein a ſweet ſavour of Reſt, (which the noiſom ſmoak of ſo many creatures burnt on the Altar could not of it ſelf afford) to teſtifie his being well-pleaſed in and through Chriſt, our true Peace and reſt. He therefore appointed, that the blood of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ſhould be frequently ſprinkled on the people, by the hand of the Prieſt, to teſtifie the communication of all, through the Lord Jeſus, our ſingular High Prieſt, imparted to all his. He likewiſe ordered, that part of the Sacrifice ſhould ſtill be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114746:31"/>
eaten of by the Offerer, in a Feſtival mannner, to repreſent their participation in the bleſſings of Peace procured by Chriſt; Yet he excepted the whole Burnt-offering, whereof none was to eat, that they might underſtand, how that in the buſineſs of ſatisfaction and meritorious impetration, no creature ſhould have any ſhare with Chriſt, whoſe arm alone brings Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by his own intire and ſole oblation. All Sacred Perſons, Things and Actions then did ſtill repreſent Evangelicall truths, concerning this bleſſed Peace, and the bleſſedneſs of true Peace-makers. That <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Law cloathed the Things of Chriſt with a vail and Garment, well becoming the Churches infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. By the perſonal coming of Chriſt the vail was removed, to give unto all a more plain diſcovery thereof, in this new edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his gracious Covenant. The Goſpel therefore ſpeaks moſt fully to this very point, preſſing all Gods people to the great Duty of ſuch Peace-making, and demonſtrating the choice Bleſſedneſs attending thereon. The fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is thus ſown in Peace of them that make Peace. What Chriſt himſelf declared with many Arguments, was further promoted by all his ſervants, in their Ambaſſy from the God of Peace, that a good Peace might ſtill be followed by the friends <note place="margin">Iſa. 52. 7. Rom. 14. 15.</note>of God, and Bleſſedneſs improved thereby. Their feet were beautiful, who publiſhed Peace, and promoted it.</p>

               <p n="4">4. No wonder if Chriſt threaten fire and ſword to the world, which is ſo directly oppoſite to him.

               <p n="5">5.

                  </gap> of this Point is clearely drawn from the Bleſſedneſs of the work it ſelf, which cannot but impart a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Bleſſing to the Lords Work-men. The Bleſſedneſs of Peace hath been already demonſtrated, in an ample manner. This work of Heaven is never deſtitute of Heavens Bleſſing. What was ſaid of virtue by the Philoſopher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that its both Work and Wages, carrying meat in its mouth, is verified of this bleſſed Peace. Its Chriſts work, they are his Work-men, he hath a ſpecial Intereſt in them both, and a ſpecial Bleſſing for them ſtill in making them a Bleſſing to others. Such Peace-makers enjoy a ſingular Bleſſing in themſelves, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it. They communicate alſo a choiſe Bleſsing, even in Temporals to others, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> comments on this place. Yea, They are choiſe Inſtruments of Chriſt, to convey ſaving Mercies, by the Goſpel of Peace, as <hi>Baſil</hi> Interprets the words. Peace-making is Chriſts Work ſo peculiarly, that he is called our Peace in the abſtract, who breaks down all partition Wals, by the virtue of his croſs, whereon he ſlew the Enmity, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile <note place="margin">Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

This Bleſſed Work removes and prevents all Curſes; it brings and declares, offers and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, increaſes and cheriſhes, reſtores and crowns all Bleſſings poſsible. So far as he honors any ſervant of his, in making uſe of them Inſtrumentally about this work of his, ſo far happineſs attends them therein. Though he needs no help, yet is he pleaſed to make uſe of Helpers, againſt the mighty Enemies of Peace. He takes kindly, and graciouſly rewards the cordial contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his People thereto, though never ſo ſmal. All his Servants are called to Peace, and implyed about it in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stations. His Preſence and Bleſsing cannot be wanting where he ſets his friends on work on his account. He loves to walk in his wonted Road, and to act ordinarily by men and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114746:32"/>
means, having to deal with rational Creatures, not with blocks and Bruits. Wiſe and good men will not imploy ſervants, but they will help and own them in their work. The bleſſed God employes not his children and ſervants, without his aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and favouring Grace, about this work of his. To impoſe a hard Taske, and to refuſe ſtraw, is the property of an <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Tyrant; our gracious God is no ſuch hard Maſter; he reaps <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 24.</note>not where he hath not ſown, though idle ſervants may charge him with cruelty. Chriſt is moſt benign in his Influence, to every Soul, that ſincerily minds his ſervice. He that feeds Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and Enemies, is not like to neglect or forſake his friends. He that bountifully bleſſes with Temporals, the very worſt of men, that oppoſe his Peace; will not he ſurely bleſs with his right hand his peculiar People, entruſted by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, wherein his Honor and his Intereſt, are ſo ſignally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>

How much do Chriſtians wrong themſelves and others in every reſpect ſpiritual and civil, by needleſs quarrels!

Strange fire coſt <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> dear, though ſuch eminent Perſons, in ſuch an eminent Work.

               <p n="2">2. Hence alſo have we a vindication of peaceable Chriſtians They that know the God of Peace, and the Peace of God beſt, are moſt forward to advance Peace-making. It is not from a low luke-warm Spirit, as many miſtake it, but from the moſt rational grounds. There is nothing ſo rational as Grace, which makes the beſt uſe of Divine Reaſon, which appears herein very eminently. They are moſt zealous after Peace, who are moſt rationally ſenſible of Gods Honor, and mans good. The Apoſtles would have Chriſtians ſtill to ſtudy how to be quiet, and to do their own Buſineſs with as much calmneſs <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4. 11. 1 Tim. 2. 2.</note>as they can. Is it not much better to live in a ſerene, then in a tempeſtuous Air? Peace is the Health and due complexion of of Souls and Societies. Is it not much to be preferred before a crazy ſtate and jarring diſtempers? The <hi>Thebans</hi> were a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Nation, witneſs their ſucceſs under <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas;</hi> yet was Concord ſo much eſteemed with them, that they deified it, and conſecrated a Temple thereto, as the <hi>Romans</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Thoſe poor Heathens by their dim natural Light, ſaw often farther then many now in the Sun-ſhine it ſelf. It was Satans Policy to carry them to extreams, in diſguiſing the Truth with many fables and Idolizing Creatures; yet was there much of Truth and Good covered with their many Poetical Vails, and Philoſophical Mythologies. Is it not a great ſhame, that Chriſtians ſhould come ſhort of <hi>Pagans,</hi> in that which they have ſo frequently ſtill with ſo much advantage preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them?</p>

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:114746:34"/>
Extreams are ever nought that forſake the golden Medium of Virtue. There was but little reaſon and religion in that Law of <hi>Solon,</hi> which baniſhed moderation from the <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note>
                  <hi>Athenian</hi> ſtate, by ordering that in every Tumult and faction, all perſons unengaged and neutrally impartial ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.

Thoſe <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> Mixtures of truth and falſhood, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Papiſts into a mongrel Hotch-potch are ſtill, as they were, juſtly ſuſpected and diſowned by judicious Chriſtians.

we not neglect any means of convincing them by ſpiritual and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſonings with all prudent zeal. The ſofteſt words will beſt ſet out the ſtrongeſt Arguments.

Is not this the fruit and the ſad Symptome of a blinded mind, and a hardened heart? What groſs Ignorance and ſupine careleſneſs reign among multitudes, that neither know, nor deſire to walk in the wayes of Peace?

They that have moſt of notional Knowledge, and a gilded Profeſſion, yet are found groſly unacquainted with the practical Myſteries, and experimental Power of Godlineſs. They ſpeak of ſuch things,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114746:35"/>
as blind men of colours, and as Geographers of <hi>terra incognita,</hi> and <hi>del fuego,</hi> at random and gheſs. The Power as well as the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23, 25.</note>Wiſdom of a crucified Peace-maker is folly to the Greek, and ſcandal to the Jew. There are not many wiſe, not many noble, not many rich ones called to this Peace, to ſeek and to embrace it. <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6.</note>The greateſt number of our glorious Profeſſors have but ſipped of his Heavenly Gifts, and taſted but externally of the good Word of Peace. Their partaking of the common Gifts of the Holy Spirit puts for a time a luſtre of excellency on them, which makes them flouriſh like the ſtony and thorny ground, among fooliſh Virgins. The unclean Spirit doth upon deſign, <note place="margin">Mat. 13.

This ſeems to be an Epidemical diſeaſe of this ſeaſon. The Lord awaken every ſecure, ſelf-conceited Hypocrite. Such may have a flaſh and ſhew of Peace, as of Godlineſs; but they are ſtrangers to the ſubſtance and ſolidity of both. Preſumption and ſecurity are eaſily miſtaken for true Peace with God, and in the Conſcience. Such ſouls never came off freely and fully to the Lords Jeſus, upon marriage Contract. There was ſtill ſomething reſerved ſecretly, they would not part with. Some darling corruption, ſome cloſe <hi>Daliah</hi> made them break off the Treaty of marriage before Concluſion. Something they ſtand upon, that will not comply with the Grace and Peace of Chriſt. They do but cheapen and bid this and that, as the fooliſh Chap-man; they come not off <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 45, 46.</note>roundly with the wiſe Merchant, who chearfully ſold all to buy the Pearl out-right. Theſe are very loth to part with their All, and accept of Chriſts All. Something they would give, that they can beſt ſpare of their natural, ſinfull, and religious ſelf. But to deny all, and to give up All, this is accounted hard <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note>and unreaſonable. There is much of Chriſt they would gladly take, as ſuting their carnal ſelfiſhneſs; but the ſtrictneſs of his

yoak, and ſcandall of his Croſs, they cannot reliſh and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. Thus whilſt they ſtand parlying with Chriſt again and again, they weary him out, grieve his Spirit, and provoke him to forſake them quite. Then Chriſts refuſes are Satans Delights. He ſeiſes on all ſtrays, and lives upon ſuch wracks. They go down a pace the many ſteps of Hell, being hurried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſlippery ground, wherein the God of this World, the Prince of darkneſs claims a Dominion. Oh!

But they are no friends to a cordial Peace; they know not how to deny themſelves for the publique good. If their will be croſſed, and their hopes blaſted, If their luſts be touched, and their wayes traverſed, then Church and ſtate ſhall be ſure to ſmart.

The heart of all by corrupt <note place="margin">Ier. 17. 9.</note>Nature, is deceitfull above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it? ſaith the Lord himſelf. God it ſeems is not of your mind. The wayes of a fool are right in his own eyes, <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 15. Rom. 7.</note>and therefore abomination to the Lord, who ſearches the heart. The beſt Hearts judge themſelves moſt for their reliques of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and all ſin. They who have moſt Grace, feel their corruption, and bewail it moſt.

What if you be not ſo baſe as the worſt?

Are not Cancers and Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes in ſecret parts, moſt dreadfully ominous? Every one is naturally a ſelf-flatterer, deſirous ſtill of others flatteries, as that famous Ape in the Apologue. But are not the faithfull <note place="margin">Pſalm 141. 5.

Doth it trouble you that they are holy, and deſire to be ſuch, that they may beſt reſemble their Father in the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Are you troubled at the Scripture-dialect, that calls them Saints, Brethren and Siſters, that they may be further ſtirred up to act as ſuch, and to own each other in ſuch a Relation, with moſt entireneſs and mutual helpfulneſs? What if Hypocrites creep in among them, againſt their knowledge and will, ſhould it reflect on all? Would you be content to be counted and called knaves, becauſe ſome of your profeſſion do ſometime prove ſuch? is it ſtrange to ſee weeds among good corn in the Spring?

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> God forbid we ſhould be ſo vile: What, are we dead dogs, that we ſhould do ſo, and be reputed ſuch? We own Chriſt and his Peace, and its for his ſake that we abhor and oppoſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of rebellious Schiſmaticks, that would over-turn all by their new Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw</hi> 1. We wiſh a hearty <hi>Amen</hi> to your prayer, that none of you may appear ſo vile. <hi>Haſael</hi> little thought <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:114746:38"/>
ſtriving to turn up its very bowels. Its a ſink of all filthineſs, a Den of ravenous beaſts, a bed of poiſonous Serpents; which lie ſtill for a while, but will make wofull work, when ſtirred to the purpoſe. Its a Hell on earth, full of direfull fiends, whilſt ſin and Satan have the rule thereof. Till your heart be changed, it may be as bad with you, as with the worſt, if God reſtrain you not. No man hath the command of himſelf, further then Gods hand enables him thereto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you own Chriſt and his Peace, in Truth, you'l <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quid verba audio, cum facta video.</hi> Mat. 26. 49. Iohn 19. 3.</note>find the benefit thereof. But words are but wind, when the heart and life do give them the lie. The traiterous Jews and bloody <hi>Romans</hi> gave Chriſt good words too in the very worſt of their villanies. Do not you give Chriſt more blows then good words? are not you real Butchers of his Peace, whilſt you ſeem verbal Profeſſors thereof? whilſt you do cheriſh his worſt enemies, and oppoſe his friends, ſent on his Errand, is this to love Chriſt? Whilſt you deſire what he ſtill diſdains, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain what he delights in, is this to own him? Whilſt you turn your back upon the word and wayes of his Peace, do you own his Peace? If you can prefer any creature or luſt, either direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or indirectly, before him and his Peace, you own them not in Truth. What think you of that diſobedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that knows his Maſters will, but will not do it? Is not <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 47.</note>he like to bear the more ſtripes? Did you own Chriſt, you would not diſown thoſe Things and Perſons that bear his Image, and promote his Peace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You again ſay, [they are not his friends, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of rebellious Schiſmaticks, that would over-turn all.] Its pitty that ſuch perſons ſhould be found, or owned under the name of Chriſt. Its alſo too clear by ſad experience, that many ſuch are ranging among us. But you had need beware, that <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 20.</note>you miſtake not Light for Darkneſs, and Darkneſs for Light, that you put not bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter. There is a woe denounced againſt ſuch perverſe Over-turners of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things. Ponder well therefore what it is you diſlike and oppoſe in them. Is it not that purity and power of his Word and Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they own and promote? Do not you think them too rigid and ſtrait laced for your looſe and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114746:38"/>
wanton Spirits? Are not you afraid of leſſening your ſinfull pleaſures, profits and credit, if they ſhould bear ſway? Are not you ſecretly moved with envy and indignation at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Chriſts Name by them? Do not you feel ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Truth they declare, gnawing your conſcience, and ſtabing your heart? Are not the Perſons, often ſo nicknamed, humble and holy, meek and yielding, ſtill deſirous to promote true Peace? Is it indeed for evil, or for good, that you malign and oppoſe their work? Were it for ſin in them, you would abhor your ſelves and your Companions, much more then you do them, for your ſins exceed theirs notoriouſly. Were it not for their good, that you oppoſe them, you would honor and practiſe that good to better purpoſe. But is not your caſe much like that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees?</hi> They adorned <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 29.</note>the Tombs of the Prophets, ſpeaking well of the times and perſons paſt; But they maligned and ſtill perſecuted the living Prophets, and ſervants of Chriſt, who taught the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Thus ye ſpeak well of our firſt Reformers, and Preachers that are dead, and cannot now touch your conſcience; but do not you ſlight and oppoſe the liviug Prophets and Miniſters of Chriſt, who tread in their ſteps, and teach the ſame Doctrine of his Word and Peace?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You call their Way [a new Religion, that would over-turn all,] But are not you deceived and groſly miſtaken? There are indeed too many old errors raked up out of Satans old dung-hill, ſet out with a new dreſs, and paſſing for new Light. Such a new Religion would indeed over-turn all, if but let alone, and is juſtly to be abhorred of all. But that which you miſ-call, is it not the Religion of the new Teſtament, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the gracious Edition of the Lords Covenant? Is it not that Truth of Divine Scriptures, wherein both Old and New <note place="margin">Ier. 6 16. Iohn 14. 6. Heb. 10. 20.</note>Teſtaments agree? Is it not the good old way of believing <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> of all the Patriarcks, Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, renewed by Chriſt for Evangelical uſe? Is not Truth <hi>ancienter</hi> then error, as much as God is elder then the Devil? Suppoſe it brings ſomething new to you in Doctrine, Worſhip or Diſcipline? Doth your Ignorance make it a new Religion? Or is every leſſer difference in the things of Chriſt a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114746:39"/>
new Religion? Suppoſe it come to reform things amiſs in your perſons and families, as in Church and State? Is the redreſs of things an over-turning? Is weeding of the ground, and dreſſing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, hurtfull or uſefull? Are not you content to have your body troubled with Phyſick to purge out ill humours, and recover health? Will not you be willing that Gods Phyſick ſhould work effectually on your ſelves and others? Suppoſe your own and others Corruptions be thereby over-turned by the Root; will not Church and State be the better for it, and your ſelves alſo? If you get no good, and ſee little Peace from this Goſpel of Peace; you muſt blame your own and others Luſts, ſtill ſet in oppoſition thereto. Is not mens folly ſignally noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that oppoſe Gods Word and his Miniſters; and then complain of the Breach of Peace? Is not their miſery of the like magnitude, that abuſe and oppoſe both the meſſengers and meſſage of Peace, like the mad and wretched Patient, that abuſes both Phyſitian and Phyſick? Doth not your complaint <note place="margin">1 Kin. 18. 17, 18. 1 Kin. 21. 20.</note>of the Lords ſervants reſemble that of <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Elijah,</hi> calling him the Troubler of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his enemy? May they not anſwer you, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did to him? As <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> are they become your enemies, becauſe they tell you the Truth? <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 16.</note>Whilſt you are enemies to the Peace-makers of Gods own ſending, what can you expect from the God of Peace?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have here alſo a juſt reproof to the profeſſed friends of Peace-making. There is altogether a fault among ſuch, even the beſt of them. Our deadneſs and dulneſs, our backwardneſs and frowardneſs about it deſerves ſharp Rebukes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No wonder if we miſs of the Bleſſings of Peace, that take ſo little pains about Peace-making. Yea, we not only neglect our duty, and omit much good, but we alſo commit very much evil, which hinders the good that we ſhould promote. Its our ſin, let it be our ſhame and ſorrow, that we have done ſo little about this great Work. The many Rebukes ſent by the Apoſtle to the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Phillipi, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus,</hi> and other places, ſhould be preſſed home upon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, to awaken and humble us. Our ſins therein are the more provoking, becauſe of our near relation to the God of Peace that calls us to this work. If it be ſo dreadfull, to be thus
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114746:39"/>
abuſed by ſtrangers and enemies, how much worſe is it for Chriſt to ſuffer this from his neareſt friends, and deareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? How ill do we take it from our menial ſervants, when they do neglect any ſpecial Buſineſs committed to their care? Peace-making is the work whereto Gods ſervants are peculiarly called, the neglect whereof muſt needs diſpleaſe him much. Our Peace with God is often much ecclipſed and clouded through our own default, and neglect of the means appointed to us, for acquaintance with the Lord, our Peace. How much help might we afford to others, to the making of their Peace, if we were but faithfully induſtrious? The Lord is pleaſed to honor his ſo <note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 19.</note>far, as to create the fruits of their lips to be Peace, Peace for the good of many. Should it not grieve us much, that we diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him ſo much in that work, for lack of prudence, activeneſs <note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 15. Iſa. 61. 1, 2. Iſa. 56. 2. Luk. 4.</note>and zeal? Chriſt himſelf made it his chief buſineſs to ſpeak words of Peace to the troubled ſouls, and comfort his Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in reviving thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> contrite Spirits; how unl ke are we to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about that very thing? Do not we too often act like Peace-breakers, rather then Peace-makers, with reſpect to our own and others conſolation, by omitting good, and committing evil? The Peace of his Church is moſt dear to him, who ſpent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25 26.</note>was ſpent for that very end. But doth it not appear of little worth to us, conſidering how little we do for it? It offends us much to ſee our families diſturbed, with brawls between our children and ſervants; yet what ſad jarrings do we too often behold and occaſion in the Lords family with little feeling, and leſs helpfulneſs. It would trouble us much to feel Convulſions in our own bodies, but how little are we ſtirred by ſo many convulſive motions in the body of Chriſt? Our ſinfull cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are ſtill breeding the malign humours, which cauſe ſuch direful ſymptoms therein. Our Pride and Paſſion, our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and folly, our ſelf-ſeeking and ſelf-conceitedneſs, prove the ſad grounds of many diſtempers. Our dividing Principles and practiſes are ſo many and ſo prevailing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the abuſes ſhewed to Chriſts natural Body by the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Crue, are moſt deſperately revived thereby upon his myſtical Body. It much aggravates our ſins, and Chriſts ſufferings, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers themſelves of his own Body, have a chief hand therein.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114746:40"/>
To be a ſelf-murtherer, a <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> is horrid to think of. How much worſe is it, to be murtherers of Chriſts Body, of our ſouls and others, as far as in us lies! Our unchriſtian jars are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narural, that <hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves would be aſhamed of them. <hi>Infidels</hi> of all ſorts agree in their wayes, Chriſts followers are ſtill diſagreeing. We are too ready to lay the blame on others, whereas we ſhould charge it on our ſelves, each of us. What <note place="margin">Ammian.

Thoſe luſts of ours that diſturb the Church, have the like ill Influence upon all our civil Relations. Satan hath a great ſtroak in all our diviſions, and finds it beſt fiſhing in ſuch troubled waters. The leaſt ſpark of Ingenuity cannot but make the hearts of Chriſts friends to break and relent at theſe conſiderations. But ſome think and ſay.</p>

The more ſhame for us, that have let them grow ſo long on us, till they be thus radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated within, and ſpreading as ſo many ulcered Cancers, and dreadfull Gangrenes.</p>

We ſhould not imitate our fooliſh children, that will be ſtill juſtifying themſelves, though they be guilty, and charging of others.

               <p n="3">3. Though we are bid to contend mightily for the faith, yet are we alſo bound to ſpeak the Truth in love, and to avoid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16. 1 Tim. 6. 5.

There is a good contention for Truth againſt the Subverters of it, carried on graciouſly; and an ill contention, about leſſer things, and againſt Chriſts friends, carried on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Gods work is never well done with the devils Tools. He never needs, nor likes Satans help. Mans wrath doth not fulfill <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 20.</note>the righteouſneſs of God.

               <p n="6">6. Take we a view of our Behaviour and actual Endeavours. Doth the language of our Life ſpeak us to be bleſſed Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers? Is our carriage towards all above us, about us, under us, tending thereto, and an enemy to diviſion and to confuſion? Do we ſtill labour for Unity and Order, the very ſinews of Peace in all Civil and Spiritual reſpects? Do we recommend it to others alſo, by all effectual courſes that may be?

Do we ſtrive to cure others reproaching Genius, as <hi>Philippus</hi> of

                  <hi>Macedon</hi> did, by gratifying of a good Souldier, who had been too much neglected? Do we manifeſt by our dealings with men, that what ever we ſay and do to them, is in love to their good, and from fear of their hurt? Do we avoid needleſs and <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 5.</note>perverſe Diſputes, the breeders of ſtrife, whilſt we explain and apply the Truth with purity and Power? When we are forced to contend for the faith, is it ſtill in the demonſtration of that Heavenly Spirit, whoſe Wiſdom is firſt pure, and then <note place="margin">Iam. 3. 17, 18.</note>peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated? Is the fruit of Righteouſneſs thus ſown in Peace, to teſtifie us to be Peace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers? Do we labour to manifeſt moſt Peace to mens perſons, whilſt we are ſignifying war againſt their Luſts? Do we appear to act as wiſe Phyſicians, tendring the Patients moſt, when we are moſt ſet againſt their ill humours and diſeaſes? Do we beware of wreſting mens words beyond their Genuin ſenſe and Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by ſuſpicious jealouſies and reflective conſtructions, as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to be prejudiced our ſelves in that way? Do we diſown that Sophiſtick Spirit that lies at the catch of every tripping word? Are we ingenuous in all our debates to aim at Truth, not at victory? Are we as thankfull to have our own miſtakes recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as we are ready to rectifie others? Do we ſtill ſtrive to make the beſt conſtruction of others thoughts and acts, till the worſe do more plainly appear? Are we candid in our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, wiſhing as <hi>Cato,</hi> ſo to carry it as if every man had a window open to look through our houſe, and our very heart? Are we diligent in the uſe of all means appointed of God, to get and keep Peace in every Relation, in every occaſion, in every condition? Is this our induſtrious Activeneſs manifeſted by a conſtant exerciſe of ſelf-denial, and all the Graces of Gods Spirit, which are the womb and the breaſts of Peace? Is it our continual care effcctually ſtill to mortifie and purge out the many corruptions of our hearts, which are the ſworn enemies of Peace? If it be poſsible, as far as in us lies, do we endeavour <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note>to have Peace with all men? Do we therefore carefully attend the proper duty of our general and particular Calling that in each reſpectively, we may punctually give God and man their Due? Do not we willingly neglect any thing, which might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or propagate Peace, whether eternal, internal or external?

                  <note place="margin">Act. 24. 16.</note> Is <hi>Pauls</hi> exerciſe our continued Recreation, that we may have alwaies a conſcience void of offence, both towards God and Man? Though the Market of Peace be at a dear Rate, yet do we not grudge any thing for it, that is not ſinfull and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt?</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may hence alſo take relatively an eſtimate of others preſent ſtate, and a Prognoſtick of their future caſe, whether Oeconomical or Political, Military or Eccleſiaſtical. So far as any Soul or Society are from Peace-making, ſo far are they from the Bleſſedneſs attending the ſame. The more of this good work is found among men, the more evidence ſtill of the Lords Bleſſing. Such as the Peace is, ſuch is the Bleſſing, whether internal or external only, whether ſpiritual or ſeeming. The Records of all Ages, and of all Nations demonſtrate it fully. We need no ſtar-gazing Mountebanks to caſt a figure for a cheating Prediction. Do but prudently view the various Aſpects of mens Spirits in their multiplicious Motions towards Peace: Obſerve but thoſe many conſtellations of all ſorts of People in the firmament of publique affairs, both in Church and State, with the Planetary revolutions of private Relations, in their reſpective Spheres. Compare theſe Providential paſſages with the experiences of all, or any other place and ſeaſon, by the certain Rules of Divine Wiſdom, recorded in Scripture, and your concluſions duly drawn from thence will be clear and ſure, whether, for good or evil. God indeed reſerves his Soveraignty ſtill to act as he pleaſes, with or without means, by them, or againſt them. It is his free Grace can ſave with a notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens unworthineſs and unpreparedneſs. Yet as he himſelf walks in his own Road of Scripture and Providence, ſo doth he teach us, thus to obſerve him, in obſerving our ſelves and others therein, to teach us aright what we may regularly expect, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all Events to his ſupream Ordering. The crazy conſtitution of things among us, and the many Symptoms of our inveterate complicate diſeaſes, in all the parts of this great Body, redner our condition very ſuſpicious to all wiſe Phyſicians.

The great Climacterical year comes on a pace on all ranks of men; none of us is certain of an hour longer for our ſelves, or others. What ever becomes of the greater world; our Microcoſm, our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive World cannot be far from its diſſolution. The right Improvement of ſuch a perſonal and publique Trial may prove to all of ſingular Uſe, and quicken our Pace into thoſe waies of Peace, which are ſure to be ſtill accompanied with Bleſſedneſs from the God of Peace. So ſhall our Hopes over-poiſe our fears in all Spirituall and Civil Relations.</p>

               <p>Choiſe Conſolation flows from this Truth to all true Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers. Chriſt aſſures them of a Bleſſedneſs ſtill commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to the work they attend. Such are like to meet with very much trouble, that will be faithfull to God and his work, in this and all things elſe. He therefore provides ſutable refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they may not be diſmaid and diſcouraged. The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt meet with many a Brunt in this warfare for Peace, among ſuch mighty and numerous enemies, ſo full of malicious Cruelty and deſperate rancor. Friends themſelves prove often unfriendly, and oppoſite to the Lords Champions, through miſtakes herein. He therefore gives a bleſſed <hi>Viaticum,</hi> that they may not want any proviſion or protection, anſwering their Work. Peace is the Health of the body Politick and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, as Health is the Peace of the body natural. Much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and toil, much attendance and watching the procurement thereof will ſtill require. The Lord therefore lets all Phyſicians know, and other attendants called to this cure, that they ſhall not want his Bleſſing therein. This is a cordial againſt all faintings and diſcouragements riſing from within, or from without us. This will arm us againſt all Temptations and all corruptions, againſt all Afflictions and Perturbations from men, or from Devils. Theſe things ſaith Chriſt to all his Diſciples, that in him they <note place="margin">Iohn. 16. 33, 34.</note>may have a bleſſed Peace; in all the world we ſhall have Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,

Chriſt himſelf, the great Peace-maker, could not perfect his work without infinite coſt, trouble and oppoſition. Yet went he through all with Faith and Patience victoriouſly into a Triumphant Peace. As we are called to be his followers in the work it ſelf, we may be ſure to enter with him into a Bleſſed Peace in the faithfull diſcharge of our Duty. What can he want that hath the God of Peace, and the Peace of God for his Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Work and Protection ſtill?

               <p>Hence alſo ariſes a forcible Excitation to preſs all ſorts to this Eminent Work. The Dignity ſhould ſufficiently enforce the Duty. Such Divine wages attending Divine Work, ſhould abundantly commend the ſame to any perſon that hath not made wrack of his Reaſon and Religion at once. All perſons are ſo nearly concerned therein in their reſpective Capacities, that the very naming of Chriſts words and work, ſhould be a ſufficient Exhortation to them. Motives of all ſorts have been enlarged on by many choiſe Pens, to this very purpoſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we refer the ſtudious Reader. Our intended brevity bids us contract and ſay much in few words. Do we yet need cogent Arguments, and prevailing conſiderations? Take but a re-view of the hints already given about the Bleſſedneſs of Peace, and Peace-making, and your heart cannot but be mightily ſet on work towards it. If any ſhould deſire or need any further Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet let ſuch but obſerve how much Gods Intereſt, Mans Advantage, and their perſonal good are concerned therein. Was it not the prime and proper work of Chriſt? Is it not the chief work he cals Chriſtians to? Can any Pleaſure, Profit or Credit worth the looking for, be wanting thereto? Do not all the Divine Attributes ſhine moſt eminently about all the parts and friends of this work? Are not all hmmane Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies centred in and cheriſhed by the ſame? Is it not as Beautifull and Radiant, as it is needfull and expedient?</p>

It ſignifies largely the whole Complex of the Evangelical Period from Chriſts time to the End; ſtrictly, the later part thereof which is alſo called the laſt day, the great day of the Lord, that day known to the Lord. This ſolemn Day hath two eminent parts <note place="margin">Zech. 14. 6, 9.</note>alſo; the Morning and the Evening thereof. 1. The firſt part is a cloudy, ſtormy morning, like the Reign of <hi>David,</hi> full of Civil and Forraign Wars, attended with varieties of troubles and diſcords. A time its of ſtrong deluſions and direfull divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of wofull defections, and renewed provocations from men; though of ſpecial Illuminations and Salvations from <note place="margin">Hag. 2. 6, 7, 8. Izek. 21. 27. Heb. 12. 26, 27.</note>God. Secondly, The latter part and Evening thereof is like to be of a various Mixture, attended with ſtrange Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſhaking of Nations, and overturning of all things, untill Chriſt come into his Right, to clear up all, and fill his houſe with Glory. In the Evening time it ſhall be Light, when <note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 7.</note>in natural Probabilities, all things incline rather towards mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. The Zeal of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall do this, that he <note place="margin">Zech. 14. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then ſhall the Lord be one, and his Name one, when he gives them one Heart, and one Way, that they may ſerve him with one Lip and ſhoulder. The Lord will thus gradually accompliſh all thoſe precious and glorious Promiſes, which have a ſpecial Aſpect on theſe latter dayes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Propagation, Settlement and Glory of the Kingdom of Chriſt. Should not all this be a wonderfull encouragement to every Chriſtian, to have the honor and the happineſs of being a faithfull and ſuccesfull Inſtrument therein? The Lord loves to act by men and means, though he needs them not, and never ties himſelf to them. He bids his people be very active, and ſelf-denying in this very ſeaſon, that by reſtoring health <note place="margin">Ier. 33. 6.</note>and cure to them, he may therewith reveal the abundance of Truth and Peace. When Chriſt is owned and ſerved thus as <note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note>our <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> our King of Righteouſneſs, he will ſoon appear to be King of <hi>Salem,</hi> a King of Peace, and ſettle his People in his <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the viſion of Peace.

               <p>Secondly, The Work of Reformation is a ſingular Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this bleſſed Peace-making.

This latter part thereof challenges this Work of Reformation in a peculiar way, as Reformation challenges Peace-making. Our ſolemn Covenants and Engagements ſo frequently renewed for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation before God and Men, do preſs us thereto. Our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Profeſſion, and the very Name of all Chriſtian Churches, recovered out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sodom of Antichriſtian <hi>Romiſh</hi> Pollutions, require juſtly of us further Reformation. How much hath been declared by all ſorts of Perſons, to expreſs their Duty, and excite each other to Reformation of all things amiſs in Church and State, in publique and private, will ſtand on Record to Eternity, though it be too much forgotten, even of the beſt. Peace-making is ſtill a chief part thereof, and a chief help thereto. Should it not quicken our deſigns and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, our deſires and Labors to the moſt induſtrious purſuance of it? Is not the abſence and eſtrangement from Peace, the great evil of theſe dayes? Are not our diſcords and diſorders the Bane and Poiſon, the ſores and diſeaſes, the ruin and Peſt of all ranks among us? Are not our jars and unchrſtian Wranglings a continual eye-ſore to God and good Men? Do not thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Diſſents, and uncivil Contentions blaſt our budding

hopes of all temporal and ſpiritual Good, threaning deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all our Comforts? Doth it not concern all to reform ſuch abuſes as faſt and as far as they can poſſibly? Shall we not be charged as wilfull ſelf-deſtroyers, if we neglect it? Will not all Nations cry out juſtly on us? Shall we not be the ſcorn and mirth of all evil men and devils, the ſorrow of all good men and Angels? Secondly, Is not Peace-making as great a furtherance to Reformation? Is not this the ſure, ſweet and ſpeedy way to unite our ſtrength, and to manage it to the beſt advantage for good againſt evil, at home and abroad, in all Civil and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Regards? Do not ſinfull diſſents diſtract our minds, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect our hearts, diſable our hands, and divide our ſtrength from the Lords great Work? Doth it not fare with us, when divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note>aſunder, as it did with <hi>Sciurus</hi> his Arrows, eaſily broken one after another? Is not an orderly uniting of Gods people, as ſtrong and durable a means of preſervation in every reſpect, as that Bundle of Arrows, which the ſaid <hi>Sciurus</hi> gave unto his ſons, to let them underſtand the good of Peace, and the evil of War? This Cable-roap, thus orderly twiſted by united ſtrength, is of laſting uſe; if you do but once take it into <note place="margin">Eccle. 4. 9.</note>pieces, how weak doth it become? Two are better then one, and a three-fold Cord is not eaſily broken, ſaid the wiſe Man, by good experience. His Kingdom (the Throne and the Type of Chriſt) flouriſhed in a triumphant way, whilſt Princes and people kept cloſe to their God, and to each other in all his wayes, according to his word. As ſoon, and as faſt they diſjoyned and diſordered themſelves, ſin and ſorrow increaſed on them to their total and final deſtruction. Peruſe all Records, ſacred and humane, for a further Illuſtration of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Do not Reformers need all poſſible help from one another in the cauſe of Chriſt, and of the Publique? Is not their work maligned and oppoſed by multitudes of enraged enemies, both humane and diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal?

Do they not ſtill carry in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, Legions of Traitors, of rebellious Luſts, that are ſtill plotting and ſtirring againſt the Lord Chriſt, and his gracious Work?

Do not <hi>Germany, Poland and Swedland, Denmark, Holland, France</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> teſtifie it by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Tokens? Should not we ſympathize and unite with them, on all rational Grounds of Piety and true Policy? Is not their Intereſt twiſted with our own in Chriſts Intereſt? Are not the Papiſts now combining in all parts to root out, if they can, both our Profeſsion and its Profeſſors? Have they not kept their late fourty Hours faſting, Devotion and their Jubilees, and Convocations, which are frequently renewed to that end? Are <note place="margin">Their Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences and Pardons, their Proceſſions.</note>we ſtill aſleep in the midſt of ſtorms? Do not their horrid plots ſo oft revived in our own Bowels, ſound a loud alarum to every Conſcience? Shall we ſtill contend, till an Enemy come and ſeize upon all?

            <div type="part">
               <head>Let all then be throughly perſwaded to this grand Duty of true Peace-making, in each branch thereof.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Make your Peace with God inſtantly; effectually Review our former Inſtructions about it, ſent unto you from thr Prince of Peace. Delay not, diſſemble not, diſpute not with him. Sinners of all ſorts, conſider your caſe, how ſinfull, wofull; know your unworthyneſs and inſufficiency; feel it at you heart, bewail it to him; open your ſores, cry loud after him; lie at his feet, hearken to his Word; attend his Spirit, neglect none of his wayes, embrace his Offers, look up to Jeſus Chriſt, get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance on conjugal terms; make no reſervation, yield up all to him, that your Peace with him may be made ſure of.

3. Attend alſo Peace Eccleſiaſtical, as the Lord gives abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and opportunity. Each of us in our place ſhould do our utmoſt under Chriſt our Head, for the good of the whole, and every member. Our duty is fully cleared out, and ſtrongly preſſed to, as by Chriſt himſelf, ſo by all his Apoſtles; we learn of them the particulars belonging to us, in all homage due to our Soveraign, our husband and Maſter, our Lord and King. That muſt direct us in our peaceable care of his whole Body, to cheriſh and honor, ſupport and ſupply it with all Sympathy and due ſupplications, anſwerable to that Relation we bear to each part, and the Church it ſelf. Thus every one walking order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.

All theſe incorporated into an <hi>Engliſh</hi> frame by their ſucceſſive Wittagen-Motes, and State Conventions, made up by the common Laws; whereunto have been joyned all the Statute Laws, ſince the ſolemn Title of Parliament given to ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of State, till this day.

of this Country, by the Wiſdom of former and later Rulers; which all do yield ſpecial Inſtructions for the due making of a Civil Peace. When Magiſtrates ſupreme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, give up themſelves thus, to regulate and execute all ſuch good Orders, in ſubordination to Divine Statutes, this Work goes on a main. Inferiors alſo have their ſhare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in a due obſervance of the ſaid good Laws, ſutably to their ſeveral Capacities, whether in the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or in particular Corporations, and Societies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

Conjugally between man and wife; Parentally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Parents and Children; Deſpotically between Maſters and Servants. This bleſſed work is to be attended, that all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Duty and Love may be ſeaſonably and effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed therein, ſutably to the Lords Will, made known to his Word.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what is to be done about theſe various Kinds of Peace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In each of them there are two main Eſſentials of ſingular Import, to be accordingly minded ſtill, Unity and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unity is the great Principle that muſt knit into one the different parts of every Society. God alone is one pure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Being, one perfect, Infinite, unchangeable, eternal Act. Creatures are finite, compounded Beings, whoſe parts require <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2, 3, 4.</note>Union towards Communion. Rational Beings, as men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, muſt look firſt to their Relative Union unto God, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Being and Source of all Beings, that they may not want Peace with him, and in themſelves. Cloſing with him, and keeping cloſe to him, are then mainly to be attended in and through Chriſt, who muſt uphold the Elect Angels, and recover his Elect among men. Among all natural Things, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſtill the great Peace-maker. This makes the ſweet Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Body, when every part is joyned to each other by fit
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114746:49"/>
Ligaments, that the whole may be kept in Peace under its Head. Thus alſo in things artificial, as in Muſick, Building, and all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, Union effects that due agreement of many into one, in a fit way of Correſpondency, whence a ſutable Peace. Thus with all Societies it is, whether Spiritual, Political, or Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. There muſt be Union for due Communion, anſwerable to their ſeveral conſtitutions. Their Being and ſtrength, ſupport, and life depend hereupon. So far as any departs from Unity, he departs from Peace. Therefore did the Philoſophers account the number of 2 accurſed, becauſe it was the firſt dividing <note place="margin">This diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not of Species but of Adjuncts.</note>Number. The Church of Chriſt is ſuch a Body, as needs this moſt peculiarly, whether conſidered as inviſible and more myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or as viſible and more Political.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church inviſible, myſtical, conſiſts of all the Elect of God effectually called, being <hi>Coetus vocatorum,</hi> part whereof is triumphant in Glory, part militant in Grace. The Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cements them into one, under Chriſt their Head; thence are <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note>they ſaid to be one Spirit, being <hi>glued</hi> to the Lord, as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal elegantly phraſes it. As by faith regenerate perſons are united to Chriſt; ſo by Love, are they knit to his Body. Peace is thus made and kept, when we cordially love every Chriſtian, bearing his Image, upon his account, with a ſingular, conſtant, efficacious Love, without partiality, ſelf-reſpects, or Hypocriſie; When we no ſooner perceive that <hi>aliquid Chriſti,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> was wont to phraſe it, that reſemblance of Chriſt, though it ſeems never ſo ſmall, and a <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> but our affections are endeared to ſuch an Object by gracious Sympathy, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear united to Chriſt himſelf, being thus knit to the members of his Body. This unfained Love of the Brethren, with a pure <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 22. Eph. 5. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore are we bid to love the Brother-hood, and love as Brethren, not in word and Tongue, but in deed and in truth, to teſtifie our ſpiritual Reſurrection, from a ſinfull death, into the life of Grace by the Spirit of Chriſt, incorporating of us unto himſelf. Nothing ſhould keep us from this bleſſed Union, either in others, or our ſelves. If they be poor and weak, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der corruptions and various diſtempers, yet we ſhould own them by this endearing love, becauſe they are his, and our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114746:50"/>
We deſpiſe not the members of our Bodies, when infirm and diſeaſed, but pitty and tender them the more. What though they be diſtant by place, or Opinion, Intereſt, or Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from us? Yea, though they ſeem to be oppoſite and ſet againſt us! that ſhould not eſtrange our heart from them. <hi>Calvin</hi> would ſtill expreſs his endeared reſpects to <hi>Luther,</hi> as to an eminent ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, though he was too much and often abuſed by his violent Spirit and blind zeal. We ſhould not be overcome of evil, but ſtill labor to overcome evil with good. Though others corruptions cannot ſuffer them to be ſo free and frequent with us, or hearty to us; yet the Grace of God in us ſhould own whatever is of his Grace in them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and actively. This Unity of the Spirit ſhould thus be <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note>efficaciouſly kept in the Bond of Peace, among all the members of Chriſts Body myſtical.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church of Chriſt is conſiderable as a Body Political and viſible. The many controverſies about it we heartily wave, wiſhing that all others might do the like ſtill for the Peace thereof. It admits alſo of a double reſpect, whence its denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Catholick or Univerſal, and Particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the Church Catholick be <hi>totum integrale,</hi> or <hi>univerſale,</hi> we diſpute not; what is granted of all ſober Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans about the ſame, we would and ſhould ſtill improve towards Peace-making. There are general Rules of Faith and Order wherein all Chriſtian Societies do agree together, though they diſſent in the particular Applications, or Explications thereof. So far ſhould all Chriſtians labor to unite, and to own each other for Peace and Communion. Doth not our profeſſed Belief of the Holy Catholick Church and Communion of Saints, engage, direct and excite us thereto? Though we cannot bring all others to our particular Judgement and Practice, ſuppoſed by us to be moſt Scriptural, yet are we not bound to labor for the utmoſt degree of Chriſtian Communion, wiih all the Churches of Chriſt in the World, as far as may be poſſibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? Are not thoſe things wherein we agree with all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties (ſound in the main) ſufficient to unite us ſo far, and to make us to own each other in the wayes of Chriſt? Will not this be of ſingular help, through the bleſſing of Heaven, to

further Eccleſiaſtical Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the healing of our unchriſtian Diviſions? Have we not wrangled too long already? Is it not poſſible to find out ſome Expedients that may unite us in the wayes of Peace? Are we not tired yet with our ſinfully wofull Contentions? Can judicious Chriſtians willingly ſtill keep their diſtances and differences? Will not ſuch Fractions, Luxations and Convulſions prove bitterneſs in the latter end? If we do not ſtrive to yield one to the other, we are like to break all. We ſhall never meet without mutual condeſcenſions. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt are eſpecially concerned in this great work. Be we heartily humbled for our former evils, oppoſing this Thing ſo dear to Chriſt, and of ſuch import to his Intereſt. Labor we more for ſuch Chriſtian Aſſociations which may gradually unite our Hearts and Hands, till our Minds may be further united, ſutably to the Precepts and Promiſes of the Soveraign Peace-maker. We read of two Springs in <hi>Palaeſtina,</hi> near the famous <note place="margin">Joſephus de bell. Judaic. <hi>lib. 7.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi> Hierorym. de qu.

The choiſe Compoſure of thoſe medicinal waters gives name to the pleaſant ſtreams of <hi>Callichoc,</hi> in their further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. What a mercy were it, if the exceſs of our prejudiced Spirits, that have been hitherto ſo pernicious, might be thus harmoniouſly corrected into a ſweet and ſaving compliance? Such a bleſſed correſpondency would then be of ſingular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage towards the great Buſineſs of this Generation. Some have been too hot, and others too cold: ſome appear too mild, and others too bitter.

But ſeeing their increaſe hath occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned diſtinction of Churches, they ſhould all labor to unite ſtill to the utmoſt degree, and to <hi>maximum quod ſic.</hi> The many Shephards and Flocks of Chriſt may be thereby a mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Help.

               <p>Secondly, The Church Political viſible, as conſiderable in each particular Congregation, cals for Unity towards Peace-making. The various debates about this alſo we meddle not with, and would rejoyce to ſee all ſuch unhappy differences Scripturally compoſed by a judicious Moderation. Enough is granted by wiſe Chriſtians, to help every one unto Peace-making in all the Churches of the Saints. That all ſuch Chriſtians who live near one another, ſhould join together, as far as they can for Divine Worſhip, is unanimouſly owned. It ſhould not be any ſlight matter ſhould keep them from it. Chriſts Sheep <note place="margin">Hoſ. 1. 16. Iohn. 10.</note>ſhould not be as ſcattered Lambs, wandring in the wilds, and among the rocks, but unite ſociably for their own ſafety, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and helpfulneſs. Though Stones and Timber be of ſome uſe, when ſtanding alone; yet is it not much better to have them knit together into a Fabrick for Beauty, ſtrength and uſefulneſs?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114746:51"/>
An Arch Building, cloſely cemented by united force, is made ſerviceable to ſingular uſes, carrying with it a ſingular comlineſs. Strength and Grace united increaſe wonderfully in vigorouſneſs.

Such looſe Chriſtians are ſtill expoſed to Foxes, and Wolves, Deceits and Snares, Security and ſelf-conceitedneſs, yea to all kind of evil.

Many Duties of Chriſtianity cannot be performed without Chriſtian Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereto we are ſo frequently directed and quickened. There can be no Communion without ſome coupling and uniting Bond, to knit and cement thoſe Things and Perſons that were ſundred before. The conſent of rational creatures is the Bond of Union that glues them together, whether virtually o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, implicitly or explicitly. In Baptiſm Chriſtians were virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by a Parental conſent, given up to the Lord, and united to his people. When they grow up to years of diſcretion, is it not expedient they ſhould ſolemnly ratifie the ſame in an explicite, actual manner, as they intend to enjoy the priviledge and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duty of belonging to Chriſts family and Kingdom? However this expreſſion be made, whether by diſcourſe, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or otherwiſe, is it not needfull in theſe times of ſo much diſtraction and revolt? The expediency thereof hath been cleared by ſundry learned Pens. The Churches of Chriſt in all ages and places, have had ſome way for their adult members to teſtifie their homage to Chriſt in their proper ſtations. As Providence diſpoſes of mens abode, are they not bound to own Gods people, and cloſe with them there in the beſt manner that may be moſt uſeſul and ſatisfactory? Should not a Chriſtian be <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15.</note>alwayes ready to give an Account, or Reaſon of his hope, to any that ask him, much more to Church Guides, as there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion?
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114746:52"/>
Doth not a Chriſtians Baptiſmal Covenant engage him to uſe all poſſible means conducing to Peace-making in the Church? Is not Union towards Communion a ſpecial help thereto? How can he pretend to the univerſal Church, that regard snot the particular Church where Providence hath caſt his abode? Is it the mark of a friend of Chriſt, to neglect or ſlight Communion with his people? If there be doubts or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either given or taken about perſons, or things, there is a due courſe appointed of Chriſt to give and receive ſatisfaction <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 24. Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17. 1 Tim. 5. 22. 2 Cor. 7. 1. 1 Iohn 3. 3. 1 Cor. 5. 7, 8, 12.</note>meet. All inded are obliged to keep themſelves pure, and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy themſelves, whether perſonally, or Eccleſiaſtically, but this duty doth not intrench on others that obliges all Chriſtians, to uſe all diligence for Chriſtian Union and Communion. All Church-Officers are indeed peculiarly concerned to look to their charge, yet doth not that abſolve any private Chriſtian from attending the duty of his place, and making good his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Profeſſion. How many Unities doth the Apoſtle preſs upon <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. &amp;c.</note>the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that he might powerfully quicken them to uſe all diligence towards this peaceable way? Should not each of them have a ſtrong Impulſe upon our Spirits in theſe unpeaceable Times?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Order is the next Eſſential requiſite unto Peace-making. What Unity doth conſtitute and ſtrengthen, Order manages, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns and preſerves. Such as the Peace is, ſuch is the Unity and ſuch the Order that lead thereto, and act about it. Peace with God requires an orderly way of agreement with him, through Jeſus Chriſt. The Lords Spirit works methodically about that great matter, as alſo about Peace of conſcience. He convinces the world of ſin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgement, in order to comfort, when he comes to be their Paraclete. The <note place="margin">Io. 16. 8, 9, 10.</note>God of order will be obſerved orderly by every Chriſtain in his and their wayes. Thus towards a civil and Oeconomical Peace doth he proceed orderly, and requires his people to do the like. His Providence ſets every man in his proper ſtation, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17. Iohn 1. 16. Pſal. 147. 4.</note>and his word gives exact directions how they ſhould act therein. His Spirit qualifies all his people for every motion ſutable to their Sphere by continual ſupplies out of Chriſts fulneſs. That Almighty God, who tels the number of the ſtars, calling them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114746:52"/>
by their names, calls all Perſons and ſublunary Things to their proper work. Whiſt they keep his Orders, they further that Peace, whereon depends the Bleſſedneſs of the Univerſe and of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeveral parts. Superiors have moſt influence herein, moving in their places as Superior Planets in their higher Orbs. As their motion proves regular or irregular, ſo is their Aſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign or malign. Chriſt the King of all, the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pro. 8. 15. Pſal. 72 2,</note>moves ſtill orderly and regularly. Wh lſt by him Kings reign, and Princes execute Judgement ſpiritually, as well as providentially, thoſe mountains of his Kingdom then bring forth Peace, and the little Hils by Righteouſneſs. Inferiors alſo are taught their Duty, in orderly working towards Peace-making. There is none ſo poor and deſpicable but hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to do towards it. Their Faith and Prayer, their Gifts and Graces are alwayes of uſe in each Relation, civil and Spiritual. Often they that think meaneſt of themſelves, have moſt influx into this great work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Its ſometimes the poor unregarded Perſon <note place="margin">Eccle. 9. 15.</note>that ſaves the City from eminent dangers. The feet are help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the whole Body, and the ſmalleſt Toe doth not want its work, nor could it be ſpared. Propriety and Subordination are the Appointments of the God of Heaven. That whimſey of men that would level all to bring confuſion, appears to come from confuſed Spirits, not from the God of Order. Though men often miſtake and miſcarry both in higher and in lower places, yet doth the Lord ſtill over-rule all their diſorders to his orderly ends. What we cannot redreſs in mens ill Motions, he would have us bewail and look to him for help, with all orderly motions in our own places, towards Peace-making.</p>

All things would he have to be done decently in Order and to Edification, in every Church of his. He hath therefore left upon Record all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions neceſſary thereto, to be applyed as there ſhall be cauſe. He leaves more to humane Prudence in civil Affairs, then in Eccleſiaſtical matters. There he leaves men to more general Rules about the kinds and means of Government, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114746:53"/>
here he gives more pnnctual directions; in thoſe the external man is chiefly concerned, but here the internal. The matter and manner of Civil Government he doth often providentially alter, but the diſpenſations of Eccleſiaſtical Rule are fixed by <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1, 2. Rev. 14. 6. Gal. 1. 8. 2 Iohn 10. Heb. 12. 28.</note>him. Though he formerly ſpoke ſundry times and manners to the Fathers, yet having once ſpoken to us by his Son, he alters no more this Evangelical Adminiſtration, but curſes any that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to bring an other Goſpel. The Matter and Subſtance abides ſtill the ſame, though ſome Circumſtantials may admit of change, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> according to Rule ſtill, and in Order to Peace. New Officers, and a new Power may be by men conſtituted in the State, not ſo in the Church. In that Chriſt rules chiefly, as King of Nations, but here as King of Saints. In both he would have all ordered to his Glory, according to his Word, which appoints every one the proper limits of their general and particular Calling. As in the Body natural, whilſt all the parts move orderly in their proper place, there is harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Peace in a healthfull Temper, ſo is it in the Body Politick and Eccleſiaſtical. As the ſtrings of a Lute, being orderly ſet, wound up and touched, make a ſweet Muſick of different Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, ſo doth it appear in the right tuning of the ſeveral ſtrings in each Inſtrument, Civil and Spiritual. A confuſed heap of ſtones and rubbiſh is unſeemly, uſeleſs and weak. Its the orderly fitting of materials, both to each other, and to the foundation, that makes a building ſtrong and durable, pleaſant and uſefull. It muſt needs appear ſo in Eccleſiaſtical as in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Fabricks. It ſhould then be the care of all Church-Officers <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 20, 21. 1 Pet. 2. 5, 6.</note>and of Church-members, to ſtudy and obſerve the Orders of Chriſt, appointed for his family and Kingdom in their reſpective capacities, that Peace may be had and the bleſſings thereof.

Eph. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15, 16.</note>other, mutual ſympathy, comforts and ſupplies are frequently inculcated on us, and therefore to be as carefully performed. Rulers and ruled muſt walk exactly with accurateneſs, as upon
Tip-toes, both in Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline. All dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of leſſer moment are to be ſoberly, humbly, prudently prevented and cured as far as may be. What good may be done, or evil redreſſed by any gentler means, muſt not be handled in a

rougher way. It were abſurd to ſtruggle and ſweat about a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or any light matter. All means muſt ſtill be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to our deſigned end, according to the various caſes in hand. Thus wiſe men act in all their affairs of temporal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, much more ſhould they in heavenly things. All have ſpecial need to beware of their Luſts, which are ſtill unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and diſorderly. The ſeed of the Serpent reigning in the <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 14, 15.</note>moſt, remaining in the beſt, will ſtill bear a mortal fewd againſt the ſeed of the woman, both perſonal and ſpiritual. That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy is a dreadfull enmity, natural and conſtant, univerſal and perpetual, whence the breach of Peace both in Church and State. 'Tis therefore moſt needfull that all ſorts ſhould ſtudy and attend that excellent Order which our Soveraign doth proportion out to every Perſon in each relation. Luſtre and vigor will ſtill attend it, and render thereby the fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each Society ſingularly helpfull to each other, ſingly and jointly. Whilſt all the wheels and weights of this Clock or Watch keep their due order in regular motions, the worth and uſe thereof effectually appear. The diſordering of any part therein, hinders the whole, and renders it uſeleſs. Whilſt Order is obſerved in an Army by good Diſcipline, there is ſafety and ſtrength, honor and vigor towards ſucceſs, for friends againſt foes. The breaking of rank, and neglect of Orders, ſoon confounds all to ſhame and ruine. Thus proved it in the Chriſtians Army, after their great ſucceſs againſt the Turk in <hi>Hungaria;</hi> whilſt they kept order, they routed them all, <note place="margin">Hiſtory of <hi>Hungaria.</hi>
                  </note>having maſtered Bag and Baggage, and cleared the field: But their diſorderly ſcattering themſelves, to follow their prey, gave long after, time to the flying enemy to rally, return and put all to the ſword.</p>
               <p>Unity and Order appear thus to be the main Props and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Peace, in every conſideration.

               <p n="2">2. There are other Principles that are not ſo directly ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, yet do much endanger the Foundation, by picking at it, and waſting gradually the cement and vigor thereof, or at leaſt come near it, and are termed circafundamentals, likely to pervert both Grace and Peace, if cheriſhed and improved ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to their proper tendency, as moſt <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets, divers <hi>Antinomian</hi> points, &amp;c. If men be not very ſober and meek, judicious and humble in their inclinations towards ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they will much endanger themſelves and others with their ſuperſtructure of Wood, Hay and Stubble, ſo diſſonant from the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12, 13, 14, 15.</note>Gold, Silver and precious Stones that ſhould be built on Chriſts Foundation, in ſound Scripture-truth, though they may themſelves be ſaved, as through fire, hardly eſcaping, whilſt their traſh conſumes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Other Principles are further diſtant from the foundation, being more to the ſurface, and more circumſtantial, which ſome term ſupra-fundamentals; and yet divert Chriſtians ſeveral wayes from Unity and Order, and ſo far from Peace. Theſe admit alſo of a variable Latitude, more or leſs hurtfull, as they are variouſly owned and promoted. Theſe are largely diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by many worthy friends of Truth and Peace in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Tracts. Such are the Opinions for Univerſal toleration, cheriſhing of Diviſions and Schiſms, rigid preſſing to Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in every circumſtance of prudentially humane Impoſition:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114746:55"/>
urging liberty in lawfull things beyond the limits of expediency, raſh judging of others, as going againſt their Light that jump not with us: accounting every difference in Religion, a new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſevere engaging to one party or way in our Judgement, to the prejudice of other Chriſtians though godly and wiſe, humble and ſober, miſjudging of all alterations, though on rational and Scriptural Grounds: ſlight eſteeming of ſome Evangelical Ordinances, as if they were but external, indifferent Forms, &amp;c. Beware we of theſe and the like Principles, if we would be found bleſſed Peace-makers. Such leaven will ſour and ſwell apace in every relation to the diſturbance of all kind of Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such ill humors will ſoon degenerate into higher degrees of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefactions in mens heads and hearts (if any way cheriſhed) and diſtemper all parts and ſpirits very wofully. If ſuch weeds be not carefully eradicated and plucked up by the root, they will ſpread apace, and ſoon overgrow all to the ſpoiling and choaking of all good Plants, in all Spiritual and civil Gardens. A few ſuch mutineering Opinions and Luſts in the Kingdom of Chriſt and all Societies, will quickly increaſe facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and fractions, and augment diviſions and diſcords every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Such Arch-traitors and Seditious Principles will be ſtill plotting and ſtirring miſchief againſt our Peace, whilſt they are owned and not dealt with in an effectual way. Such ſinfull Brats are dearer to men then the fruit of their Bodies, and will be more pampered and contended for then any thing elſe. Mens Luſts and Opinions are ſo much their own, that without a ſpecial meaſure of mortifying Grace, they will ſtill be coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kered and maintained to the dreadfull prejudice of Unity and Order. Errors and Luſts go ſtill in a chain, being ſo cloſely linked and combined, that their Conjurations will prove moſt diſmal, if they be not timely and diligently ſtill looked after. Theſe unclean Spirits will rage and rant where they bear the ſway, being ſubtle and ſtrong, numerous and nimble, malign and miſchievous, vigilant and deſperate to the higheſt degree. Spirits of contention and jealouſy, inconſtancy and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, falſneſs and ſtubborneſs, raſhneſs and rigidneſs, ſelf-love and pride, envy and paſſion, with their Comrades, will rant it madly, and break all to pieces, where they are ſuffered to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114746:55"/>
and rule. The beſt find them moſt vexatious ſtill, though curbed and greatly mortified in them. How unſpeakably ſad will their pranks then appear, where the reins are laid looſe upon their necks? Such wild Beaſts and ravenous Birds can never change their Nature and bent; though they may be for a time reſtrained, nothing but their death can end their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, through the Almighty Power of Chriſts death, efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly applyed and improved through his Spirit in the conſtant exerciſe of mortification aud ſelf-denyal. Theſe cunning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are inſinuative, and diſguiſe ſtill themſelves and their Baits with various colours, wiſes &amp; methods, to deceive all ſorts. They ſtrip and rob both Truth and vertue of their beſt Garments, to adorn and paint themſelves more ſpeciouſly. Their Masks and counterfeits are very notable, plauſible and multiplicious, to the cheating of all ſorts of men, and obſtruct their Peace. Yea they will pretend to be moſt for Peace, when they intend to do moſt againſt it. As its their courſe to plunder Truth and Vertue for their own dreſſing; ſo do they likewiſe caſt their own filthy Rags on them, that the fraud may be doubled; and that Truth and Vertue being through that diſguiſe miſtaken for them, when found in their cloaths, may be diſgraced, and ſo diſabled from that bleſſed work of true Peace-makng, which the God of Peace doth call unto. Have we not all then ſpecial need ſtill to watch againſt ſuch cheating Mountebanks, who will ſtill be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like to the Prince of lyes, their ghoſtly Father, for whom they ſtill move, both internally and externally? So far as our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipels do participate of ſin and error, ſo far will they be found to malign and oppoſe all Chriſtian Order, Unity and Peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Evil Practices follow ſuch Principles ſtill very cloſe, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to our deſired Peace, by verbal expreſſions and real Actions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Verbal Practiſes, obſtructive of Peace, are to be avoided with all poſſible care. An ill Breath riſing from a rotten inſide, ſoon communicates much evil to others. This is a common and a woful evil, againſt which Chriſtians are ſo often warned, and ſhould arm themſelves diligently. Diſcord and Diſorder are found too often the fruits of polluted lips. Our tongue was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114746:56"/>
never made to ſhame God, in ſhaming others aed our ſelves, by <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 29. Col. 3. 8.</note>hindring Peace, aud promoting Jars. Let no evil Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therefore proceed out of our mouth, as the Apoſtle charges us, but that which tends to edifying. Whiſperings, Slanders, Backbitings and Tales are ſo frequently condemned in Scripture, that all ſhould be aſhamed of the leaſt inclination thereto, and appearance thereof. What pitty is it, that any Chriſtian ſhould lend his mouth to the devils fire, for to blow his Coals of Jealouſy, diſſention and diſtance! What a ſhame is it that any ones Breath ſhould throw about ſo much of Hell <note place="margin">Pro. 26. 18.</note>fire, and caſt fire-Brands, Darts and Arrows, as Inſtruments of Death, in private or publique occaſions? How ſinfully wofull is the common practice of entertaining and carrying about ſtories and reports, very often falſe, to the great prejudice of others Repute, and the breach of Peace? Why ſhould any of us contribute ſo much of our Time and Breath, of our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Conſcience to the promoting of Satans Intereſt againſt the Peace of God? To receive and return any ill report againſt our Neighbour, is with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> the Character of one that is unfit for Communion with God and his People in his Church on Earth, and in his Glory above. Our Neighbours defects are never to be diſcloſed to open Air, but when they are to be duly dreſſed by a skilfull and faithfull Artiſt. Such ſores and wounds do get much hurt by being ſo much expoſed to the Air unſeaſonably. Would we be content to be ſo ſerved <note place="margin">Pſal. 15. Pſal. 52. 2. Lev. 19. 16. Pro 18. 8. Pro. 20. 19. Pro. 26. 20, 22.</note>our ſelves? Why ſhould any ones tongue be ſharpened like a cutting Razor upon Satans whet-ſtone, to ſlaſh the good name of thoſe about us, and to wound the Peace of the great King? Is not Tale-bearing the womb and the Breaſt that begets and breeds all kind of diſorders and diſcords, by <hi>Solomons</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict? Why ſhould our Breath ſerve the devils ends in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſtorms, either in Church or State, or private Relations? Have we not all ſmarted ſufficiently by the Blaſts of ill tongues, to warn us of ſuch miſchievous Rocks, againſt which ſo many Wracks are made of Credit and Conſcience? An unſavory and infection, Breath bewrayes a great deal of inward Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and is moſt noiſome unto all perſons. Lets then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor itching Ears and Tongues, that we may ſtill prevent and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114746:56"/>
remove the great obſtructions of a bleſſed Peace. Let no expreſſion be willingly ſent forth that may hinder Peace, and cauſe diviſion. Lets make a Covenant with our mouth, as <hi>Job</hi> with his eyes, and make a good uſe of the double fence of our <note place="margin">Iob. 31. 1.</note>lips and teeth, ſo well provided by the God of Nature to keep and bind our tongues to the good behaviour, that Peace be not broken. Let not our tongues be ſet on fire from Hell, to ſet <note place="margin">Iam. 8.</note>our ſelves and others on fire. Be we heartily humbled both for our own and others ill language, and learn Wiſdom from ſo <note place="margin">Pro. 26. 4, 5.</note>much folly. If others ſpeak ill, lets not anſwer fools accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their fooliſh way; if we ſee cauſe to anſwer to the matter of it, let it not be in a fooliſh manner. Its the ſecond <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 3. Tit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 7.</note>word, and the ſecond blow that makes the fray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and maintains it. The Lords ſervant ſhould be no ſtriker, nor ſlanderer, that <note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 20,</note>he may not prove an enemy to Peace. Are not good words as cheap as bad ones? Why ſhould we delight to hurt our ſelves and others by the claſhing of Tongues? <hi>David</hi> accounted it a very great mercy to be preſerved from the ſtrife of tongues. Why ſhould we ſpeak the language of <hi>Babel, Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> that profeſs to belong to <hi>Canaan?</hi> A mans reputation is like a Venice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>glaſs, very bright and brittle, as other humane excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; its eaſily ſullied and broken, but very hardly reſtored to its priſtin Splendor and Integrity. Why ſhould the devil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo far on us as to hire our tongue to be his Scavenger to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the filth, and rake the Kennels from one to the other, that his field may be enriched thereby? Why ſhould our lips be lent to his uſe, and be made Puppets to ſport himſelf and others with Jeaſts and Taunts, with Satyrs and jears? Lets be wiſer then to play the fools thus, in obſtructing the bleſſed Peace of God, and offending the bleſſed God of Peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Real Actions tending to the breach and detriment of Peace follow the former evils, and ſhould be eſchewed with as much cautiouſneſs. All actual ſins are to be looked upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this notorious Brand, having been ſtigmatized by the Lords own hand in the whole ſeries of his Word and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Yet do they admit of many Gradations, divers of them ſhewing much more malignity and oppoſition to Peace then many others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> According to the various kinds, degrees and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114746:57"/>
means of Peace is the malignity of ſins oppoſition thereto conſiderable. Sinfull practices do employ mens hands in the Devils work, for the marring and hindering of Gods Work. Is it not pitty that our hands and feet ſhould combine with our Tongues, our Heads and our Hearts, for Hell againſt Heaven? What horrid baſeneſs to be thus unworthily hired by ſeeming pleaſure, profit or credit, into the vileſt drugery of Satan? Why ſhould our outward man be ſo far enſlaved to baſe Spirits of diſcord and diſorder, and preſſed thus the by Prince of this world to ſerve under him againſt a bleſſed Peace? Were we not redeemed with that infinite price that purchaſed and imparts Peace, that we might not be the ſervants of men in an evil way, much lefs of devils? Lets then beware of all ſuch actings as have a native Tendency and Bent to obſtruct Peace, and further wrangling. Take we ſtill heed of rendering evil for evil; or of being overcome of evil to the neglect of duty. If we think our ſelves wronged in a perſonal caſe, Grace will teach patience, meekneſs, forgiveneſs; not paſſion or ſpleen, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor or Revenge. If we ſuppoſe that wrong to reflect on the publique Intereſt, its no good way to trie a remedy by breach of publique Peace, and increaſing the evil. If that abuſe ſeem to reflect on God in his Truth and Cauſe, yet would not he have us to defend the ſame with Satans weapons, in a ſinfull way. The Lords work can never be well done with the devils tools. Though Satan may ſeem very often to ſpeak and act much good, and for a good cauſe, yet is it ſtill in an ill manner and to an ill end. He gets too often credit with Gods friends by his diſguiſed tricks, to make them ſerve his ends, in preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much unto Gods work. White Witches that ſeem to find whats loſt, and to cure the ſick, are the worſt of all, who gain moſt credit and profit to their ghoſtly Maſter, though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to do nothing but good. Satan prevails far in theſe dayes of diviſion and deluſion, contention and confuſion; we ſhould not be ignorant of his devices, but moſt watchfull ſtill. Blind zeal is ſtill his <hi>common Boutefeu,</hi> his ſad fire-brand, both in Church and State. If Satan can but make uſe of our hands to ſnatch fire from Gods own Altar, and ſcatter it round about his houſe, he hath gained enough to ſet all on fire with needleſs Diſputes. If the fire of our private houſes be not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114746:57"/>
kept on the harth in its proper place, but ſcatters abroad, beware an Incendie. Is it not ſad that we ſhould be found ſtriking in the dark at our deareſt friends, and breaking the Peace upon meer miſtakes? Is it not bad that we ſhould fall out with other Chriſtians, becauſe they are not juſt of our Temper and diſpoſition? Peace ſhould be dearer unto us then to venture its breach, or to obſtruct it upon trivial accounts. The more indiſpoſed we find others thereto, the more carefull ſhould we be of provoking them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or acting like them in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, or doing of evil. Were it not folly to bite a ſtone thrown by any at us, or to kick an Aſs, that haply kicks us? The heathen Philoſopher had learned more Wiſdom in the School of Nature by the ſtar Light, or rather candle Light of reaſon moralized. Moſt of our Contentions ariſe often from miſapplications and miſapprehenſions of Perſons and Things. Why ſhould any be found to lie at a catch, to miſconſtrue words, to pervert others ſenſe againſt their meaning; wronging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both themſelves and others? How much precious time is thus laviſhed away from better occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about nominal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences &amp; fruitleſs debates? Should we ſtill follow that ſinfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Scholaſticks, about their nice quiddities <note place="margin">Durdan <hi>and</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If <hi>Lombard</hi> and <hi>Gratian, Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> with the whole brood of their Commentators, whether <hi>Sorbonical, Jeſuitical, Seminarian,</hi> or others, miſpent their leiſure on the gnawing of ſo many contentious Bones, are not Chriſtians to redeem their time better? Solid Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is ſober, ſubſtantial, and of ſingular worth; but vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy is obſtreperous, empty and worthleſs. Why ſhould we do to others, what we would not ſhould be done to our ſelves? Why ſhould we put much ſtrength to the heaving and moving of a feather? Why ſhould we be rubbing of old ſores ſtill, and waſte our ſelves and others about things diſputable, which will not render us better, when all is done? Peace is ſuch a Bleſſing, and the work thereof ſo weighty and excellent, that we ſhould be willing to dig deep for it, and bury all our weedy corruptions in the dreſſing thereof. The ſinfull actings of our carnal ſelf, and worldly intereſt ſhould be ſo remembred with a bleeding heart, as to be ſacrificed by a ſelf-denying hand,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114746:58"/>
to the God of Peace. The <hi>Perſians</hi> were wont once a year to give up themſelves to the deſtruction of all venomous Creatures on a ſolemn Feaſt. Were but Chriſtians ſet in good earneſt once upon the Extirpation of our poiſonous Vermine, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine ſpawn, what a feſtival might we then obſerve in the Bleſſings of Peace? Thus ſhould we be carefull to prevent and remove all thoſe ſinfull evils which obſtruct and oppoſe the Peace of God, being the cauſes of all dividing diſtempers, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of our many diſcords. It concerns Patients to forbear with care what is forbidden them, as prejudicial to their health and cure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All fit helps alſo are to be uſed with care towards Peace-making, with due reſpect towards God and Man. Means are to be managed with prudence, for the promoting of a healthfull Peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Towards God, the ſupreme Cauſe and prime efficient thereof. He is the God of Peace, both Eſſentially and Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. We muſt learn therefore to ſeek unto him, to depend on him, and expect from him all the ſorts of Peace that we can deſire. His Bleſſing alone can make all means, whether proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or improbable, efficacious towards it. He can create Peace and evil at his pleaſure. 'Tis he that muſt blaſt all the enemies of our Peace. He muſt ſubdue all wrangling Spirits, mortifie all our dividing Luſts, and heal all our Breaches. He is the <note place="margin">Ier. 8. 22.</note>Soveraign Phyſician of our <hi>Gilead,</hi> who muſt make all the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom thereof, Effectual to this end. His Will and Rule are to be obſerved with all diligence, as the ſure Receipts and fit Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for all our diſtempers. He muſt make Peace within our <note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 14.</note>Borders, and he bids us to look up to him as the ſole Arbitrator, both of Peace and War. All means muſt be uſed to make Peace with him, by cloſing with Chriſt and ſubjecting to him on conjugal terms, truſting in him alone, according to his <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 135.</note>Word for the Peace deſired. Great Peace have they that love his <note place="margin">Iſa. 60. 17.</note>Laws, and nothing ſhall offend them. He will then make our Officers Peace, and our Exactors Righteouſneſs. Hath not he engaged himſelf to his People by his Word and Oath, by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Promiſes, by his hand and Seal, to communicate all Peace to them in due ſeaſon and order? Obſerve we the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114746:58"/>
preſcribed to us, and we need not doubt of a Soveraign Cure. Whilſt we are carefull in an Obedience of Faith to obey his Preceps, he will not fail to fulfill his Promiſes. Every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and Inſtitution of his, is a ſpecial Help which he hath <note place="margin">Luke 1. 79. Pro. 3. 17. Luke 2. 14.</note>promiſed to bleſs unto his People. In every Providence he will be alſo duly acknowledged, to direct our feet into the way of Peace. The wayes of his Wiſdom are all pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are Peace. The Lord Jeſus is the great Peace-maker, both in Heaven and Earth. His coming brings ſtill, with Glory to God on high, Peace on earth alſo, and good will towards Men. Promote his Intereſt, and you promote Peace, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or State, whether in publique or private Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. According as his entertainment is, ſo is our Peace like to be, internally, and externally, whether real or hypocritical. <hi>Machiavellians</hi> that do neglect him, and put him off with Idol-worſhip and Obedience, ſhall find a ſutable Peace and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. They that give him but an empty ſhell, are like to receive little better from him. The true Politicks are ſtill to be learned in the ſchool of Chriſt, under the Teachings of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spirit. They that are enemies to his Word of Peace, and Inſtructions given to his ſervants about Peace-making, may ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent it, when its too late. As without him we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo through his help we may do all Things, through Chriſt <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13. Pſal. 29. 11.</note>ſtrengthening us. Peace made in his way will be a good Peace; otherwiſe it will prove but a counterfeit one. He it is that will give Peace unto his People, and will give to them all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Peace. Let him have the Honor, we ſhall have the Comfort; he will bleſs us, whilſt we are bleſſing him. Believe and pray, waite and endeavour for a bleſſed Peace, in due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the bleſſed God, whoſe Purpoſes and gracious Thoughts of Peace, are ſeaſonably executed by him, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and creating Peace to them and for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Towards men alſo ſhould fit helps be uſed in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereto. He that hath made us rational Creatures, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points us means to be rationally uſed. All his Creatures have their Inſtinct from him, which leads them ſteadily to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Center for Reſt and Peace. Mans Reaſon is his proper Inſtinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that moved him aright to his Reſt in God, and ſo long
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114746:59"/>
had he Peace with all the Creatures. But by his Rebellion, as he broke with God, ſo they all broke with him, and his own ſelf became his own enemy. The Lord hath appointed means for recovery, through Faith in Chriſt, the promiſed Seed, for ſpiritual Peace; and through Obedience, both of Faith and Love anſwerable to each kind of Peace, in each relation. All the Vertue and Power of the means depend on Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Bleſſing, as in Naturals, ſo in Spirituals. He deals with Men, by Men, after the manner of Men. Thus all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhould be uſed in and about the means; but our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency ſhould be on him alone, whether he do grant or deny any means, that Peace may be made, and duly maintained, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and improved in an Ecceleſiaſtial, Political and Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Unity and Order muſt be with all care ſtill looked after, as was before hinted. All the means that direct and help thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſhould be exactly ſtudied and managed. The Phyſicians rules are to be obſerved, in taking all things by him appointed, towards Health and Cure. All Superiors in their ſeveral charges have their proper work cut out to their hand, and ſo have <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 24, 25.</note>Inferiors in each condition, private and publique, that they may be bleſſed in making of Peace. We ſhould therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider one another, to provoke one another to love and good Works, in all the wayes of Peace. All our Principles and our Practices ſhould be animated with that gracious Spirit, which is directly oppoſite to all thoſe ſinfull Principles and Practices, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22, 23.</note>mentioned. Our Thoughts, Words and Actions ſhould ſtill manifeſt the fruits of Chriſts Spirit, in Love and Joy, long ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which are the noble Attendants of Peace. In dying to ſin, and living to God, we ſhould attend our generation Work, among the Sons of Men. Every Grace hath its peculiar work and uſe, to be improved ſtill towards true Peace. Gifts and Endowments, internal and external, ſhould be made all ſubſervient thereto. Every opportunity is to be redeemed in the right uſe of all Abilities for effecting of it. Each of us a part muſt ſtudy, and know his own Station well, therein to maintain, and to promote Peace. We muſt be content to allow their grains to the beſt of Men, and conſider them as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114746:59"/>
ſubject ſtill to much infirmity, that we may avoid all offence-giving, and offence-taking, in order to Peace. Obſerve what is good, either morally or naturally, in the very worſt of Men, to make the beſt of it that we can towards Peace. Mind what evil remains, even in the beſt, that it may be checked and mortified to the ſame purpoſe. Make the beſt conſtruction that you can poſſible of others thoughts, expreſsions and carriage, till clear evidence demonſtrate the worſt. Forgive others much, and your ſelf nothing. Be content to bear and forbear very far, for the Bleſsing of Peace. Uſe no foul means, where fair ones will ſerve, a dextrous gentle hand is the beſt Bone-ſetter. Be very faithfull in all your dealings; in love to the perſon, and hatred to ſin. Be as favourable to men as you can, ſo their ſores be effectually ſearched and dreſſed toward a ſound Cute. Avoid extreams, mind the vertuous middle, which unites all good and ſeparates from evil. To do much good, and to hear much ill, is that property of a Peace-maker, obſerved of old by a famous Prince, out of experience. What you cannot mend with your beſt labors, bewail in ſecret, as gracious <hi>Auſtin</hi> did, till the Lord open you a door of Hope to enter into Peace. The God of Peace himſelf give you Peace alwayse, and by all means, was the ſignal requeſt of the great Apoſtle, that choiſe <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3. 16. Pſal. 34. 14.</note>friend of Peace. Seek Peace and purſue it, when it ſeems to be loſt and flying away, was the ſolemn Charge given by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> to thoſe that wiſh well to God and his People. If <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note>it be poſsible, as far as in you lies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have Peace with all men; this is a Goſpel precept, obliging us all. Only be we ſure, that it be a good Peace, a Peace in Good, not an evil Peace, a Peace in <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 11.</note>evil. Brethren, Live in Peace, fare-well, be perfect, be of good Comfort, be of one mind, live in Peace, and the God of Love and Peace ſhall be with you. This is <hi>Pauls</hi> Valedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, left with Gods Children, who are dignified with this Property of bleſſed Peace-making. That is the next point to be conſidered of.</p>

               <head type="sub">Peace-making is the dignifying Property of Gods Children.</head>
               <p>This Concluſion is conſiderable in its Deduction and Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Confirmation and Demonſtration, towards Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its Deduction is cleared by viewing the Context, Scope and Connexion of the words and ſence, parts and whole. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet down the Bleſſedneſs of Peace and Peace-making, he ſubjoins the Characters of ſuch perſons, whom God bleſſes in ſuch a Work; They ſhall be called the Children of God, ſaith Chriſt; they ſhall be known and diſtinguiſhed thereby, as a man is properly dignified and diſcerned by his name, this ſhall appear to be the Dignity and property of Gods Children. Thus the whole Text is a Divine Enthymeme, a contracted Syllogiſm; the firſt part whereof affords the Conſecution, and this latter Branch holds forth the Propoſition, from which, as from its Cauſe by an Apodeictical ratiocination, <hi>à priori,</hi> the particle For, deduces the ſaid concluſion. Gods Children cannot but be Peace-makers, and bleſſed therein.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For Explication, the genuine Import of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-dialect, is to be minded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be called, in the language of Heaven, is as much as to be and appear ſuch. God cals a Thing by <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>Deſignation,</hi> by making and appointing it, to what that name denotes; thus he cals his Children to be Peace-makers, he enables and ordains them thereto. Man is ſaid to call by <hi>Dignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and diſtinguiſhing <hi>Appropriation,</hi> acknowledging and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it to be thus truly and eminently. Thus Peace-making is ſuch a proper Dignity, and a dignifying Property of Gods Children, that they ſhall be known and diſcerned thereby, as a Perſon of Honor is by his Name, and Title of Dignity.</p>

Secondly, More ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114746:60"/>
by ſupernatural Regeneration and Spiritual Adoption: thus true Converts, made new Creatures, born of the Spirit by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt, receive the dignifying Power, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the children of God. Thirdly, Profeſſedly by federal <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 12.</note>Relation in a viſible Eccleſiaſtical Dignification; thus all Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>members, whether Infant or Adult, are called Gods <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 26. Deut. 14. 1. Ezek. 16. 20, 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mat. 8 12.</note>Children, though many of them apoſtatize afterwards from that profeſſed Adoption. Thus the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Poſterity, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods Children, all Church-members in <hi>Galatia</hi> are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſo dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; thus the Childen of the Kingdom are they called, who are caſt out at laſt. Fourthly, Moſt eſpecially by eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, thus God the Son the perſonal Word, is the Son of God. <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note>Fifthly, By a tranſcendent Generation; ſo Chriſt, as the Son of <note place="margin">Mat. 1. Luke 1. 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>Man with reſpect to his humanity, being conceived of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was born the Son of God, the child of the moſt High. Sixthly, This Title is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given by vertue of an eminent function, thus Magiſtrates <note place="margin">Pſal. 82. 1, 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>are called the Children of the moſt high; as they are alſo on the ſame account, ſirnamed Gods, by a providential Call to that Office, wherein they act as the Lords Deputies.</p>
               <p>The ſecond and third Acception of this expreſs, are proper to the Subject in hand, and ſometimes the ſixth. The gracious Children of God are eminently diſcerned by this property, which is their Dignity: ſo far as it is viſible, ſo far appear they to be Gods Children, eſpecially if they be Magiſtrates. Both their Honor and their Happineſs flouriſh wonderfully in the bleſſed performance of this ſignal Duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For Confirmation hereof, you have the harmony of all Records, Divine and Humane, ſubſcribed unto by the conſtant Experience of all men in all places. Gods Children have been ſtill remarkably diſcerned by this ſingular Work. Scripture, by ſuch illuſtrious Actings of the Lords Worthies, teſtifies it moſt eminently. The whole Series of ſacred Hiſtory ſpeaks it aloud. In ſuch a multitnde of famous Witneſſes, a few hints may ſerve in the name of all. That glorious Type of Chriſt, well known by the Title of <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> is as famouſly dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Heb. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>he Apoſtle preſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this notable parallel, attended with divers others, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114746:61"/>
the Glory of Gods only Son might be the more obſervably admired in this dignifying Property of his ſingular Predeceſſor. Chriſt himſelf appeared to be the Son of God moſt eminently by this very thing. He came perſonally to become our Peace, to purchaſe and procure, reſtore and preſerve, promote and <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 14.</note>improve all Peace for us, in and through himſelf. His glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Office called him peculiarly thereto, for which he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably qualified by the Fathers Spirit. His Sacerdotal, his Prophetical his regal Function tended all to Peace, and are ſtill converſant about it to Eternity. His whole progreſs from deepeſt humbling, to the higheſt degree of exalting, concurred thereto. All his eminent Types and fore-runners were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employed to that end. The ſucceſſive Prieſts of <hi>Aarons</hi> Linage, pointing at his Prieſt-hood, and holding it forth by ceremonial Rites, to believing eyes, made this work of his, their proper buſineſs and dignifying charge for his Honor, and his peoples good. The many Prophets whom his Spirit ſent and qualified from one Age to another, ſtill preached Peace in him and by him, whom they did repreſent. The famous Princes in their Generations, that governed his People, were his choiſe vicegerents, upon this very ſcore. All thoſe Inſtruments whom the Lord made uſe of, in bringing his People into the <hi>Canaan</hi> of Peace and Reſt, out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through ſo many changes to ſettle them there, in their Spiritual and Civil Liberties under his Government, acted to the ſame purpoſe. The whole Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Providence, from <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſt holds forth as much in all the various tranſactions of it. Each paſſage alſo of the New Teſtament, whether Hiſtorical, Doctrinal or Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, points at this dignifying property. What was ſaid and done more figuratively under the old Teſtament about this ſubject, is herein more Evangelically, as with a Sun-beam, expreſſed to us. The Peace of Chriſts Kingdom ſo much celebrated by <hi>David, Solomon, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eſay,</hi> as by all his other Prophets, is gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, and gradually fulfilled in this laſt Period, which began at his firſt perſonal coming incoatively; and will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by his ſecond coming, conſummatively. The 45. and 72. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> with the 31, 32, 33, 60, 61, 65. of <hi>Eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:114746:61"/>
the 2, 3, 7, 11, 12. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> with the many glorious Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of all other Scriptures beſpangle this Truth as eminently, as the Firmament is beſpangled with ſtarrie conſtellations. In each, in all of them are marvellouſly ſet out the Subjects and Matter, the Ground and Rule, the End and Effects of this bleſſed Peace, about which all the children of God are ſtill illuſtriouſly imployed. Ever ſince Chriſts return to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to improve and apply the fruits of his bleſſed Impetration in order to Peace, his people have been taught by his Spirit, Word and Providence, to attend with care this honourable Work, under him, for him, in conformity to him. Sacred vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes are as full of this, as the Sun of Light. Chriſt often minds all his D ſciples, that their peaceable Unity and Order ſhould be their Badge ſtill of their being his before God and Men. What they learned of him, they were as careful to practice and communicate on all occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to Peace. Numerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might ſoon be named, were it needfull in ſo clear a caſe. Their Chriſtian forbearance of many lawfull things, when not expedient; and patient bearing with weak Believers, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentles</hi> in many ceremonial and other matters, teſtified then their ſtudious Labor towards this choiſe Work. Humane Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all parts and ages give a further Atteſtation hereto. What ſingular Peace-makers appeared in the <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> and in the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> Churches, untill the ſetting up the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Antichriſt, that grand Peace-breaker, we may read at large in Eccleſiaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine, Brittans</hi> princely Lights, and all their Succeſſors, whoſe name is eternized for their piety and Heroick Actings, manifeſted this in a peculiar manner. The Primitive Fathers, thoſe worthy Champions of Chriſts Intereſt, were eminently imployed about this; witneſs their excellent Memorials. It was the man of ſin who began by time to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the reſt, and by renewed Schiſms and Apoſtacies, formed that Embryo of <hi>Roman</hi> Papacy into a compleat Son of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Faithful Endeavours fot the Peace of God were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually uſed by divers of his ſervants in the ſeveral parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Europe,</hi> againſt ſuch Antichriſtian diſcords and diſorders, as learned <hi>Mornay, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> and many more have abundantly cleared. Though in that ſtormy hour
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114746:62"/>
of Temptation and Defection they ſuffered much in their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs-bearing for ſo many years of the Beaſts prevalency; yet did they ſtill defend the cauſe of Truth and Peace, and make good their ground to the very laſt breath. Since it pleaſed Heaven to ſmile again on earth in the beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, carried on through the regions of <hi>Europe;</hi> Gods Children have been labouring daily to this very ſeaſon for Peace in Gods way. The more eminent that Proteſtants have been in the Magiſtracy or Miniſtry in <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Holland, Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> for the cauſe of Chriſt, the more ſtudious have they been of his Peace. All their Conflicts with the man of ſin, and with the ſin of man, have been on Peace-account, ſo far as they owned God to be their Father. We may appeal to our experience, beſides the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of every Nation.</p>

Its no wonder, that carnal Hypocrites prove contentious, ſeeing they carry ſtill ſo much of the Serpents ſeed, whoſe Antipathy is ſtill deſperate againſt the womans ſeed. No marvel if ſuch weeds prejudice the Lords ground, and all his good plants. Such diſguiſed Foxes &amp; Wolves under ſheeps clothing, will ſhew their teeth and bite when they ſee their time. Such Malignant humors being mixed among the good in the body Political and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, as in the natural, may lie couchant for a time, till they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a head, ripened for miſchief.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Gods own Children there remains much corruption ſtill even in the beſt, though not in all alike, which occaſions ſo many breaches of Peace in every reſpect. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf found cauſe to complain heavily of his jarring luſts, indiſpoſing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

The beſt Gardens retain ſtill ſome weeds. <hi>Canaanites</hi> will remain, and ſcattered <hi>Tories</hi> after a Conqueſt. Our beſt ſtate below is ſtill militant, both internally and externally. Sin and Self will ſtill be plotting with Satan againſt the Peace of God and Man. Mens luſt are ſturdy, ſtrong and numerous, ſecret and ſubtile, vigilant, active, oppoſing each other, in oppoſing Peace; inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are they and irreconciliable, full of malice, envy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, having as much of Hell as earth can receive. So far as they remain, though but languiſhing of a deadly conſumption, they will ſtill ſhew implacable enmity to Peace; and all favour to jar and diſorder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſtians, even the beſt, are often miſtaken about their Duty towards Peace and good. Much ignorance and infirmity ſtill do attend them. Its not eaſie, but very difficult to obſerve the right middle, that avoids both ſinfull extteams. Error is ſtill a notorious Cheat and <hi>leger de maein,</hi> cogging his dice, and ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his cards with dextrous methods to abuſe the ſimple. Many <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 14. Iude. 19. 2 Pet. 2. 18, 19.</note>of Gods people are often enſnared and engaged into a party oppoſite to Peace before they be aware. Such a pre-poſſeſſion begets a prejudice againſt others, and makes them often to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect each other for meer Hypocrites, eſpecially in ſuch a ſpring as this, wherein ſuch weeds abound every where. The path-way to Peace is uncouth and obſcure, very frequently, being much untrod and diſregarded. The means leading to Peace are often coſtly, troubleſome and harſh, whereas the high-road to diſcord and diſorder is a broad way, crouded with multitudes, and of eaſie charges for any Travellor, promiſing fair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what ever it performs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Satan is ſtill a deſperate Enemy to the Children of God, and to their peace.

Many Reproaches upon the ways of Peace doth he often caſt by his Ingineers, as ſo many thorns and ſtones of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to diſcourage Gods People. He miſ-repreſents them one to another by Calumniations, ſlanders and miſtakes. A fair var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh doth he put upon the wayes of diſcord and diſorder, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle honeſt plain-hearted Chriſtians, under ſpecious colours of Liberty and Purity, Power, Profit, Pleaſure and Credit. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe gloſſes puts he on Scriptures to wreſt them to his Ends; by Miſ-interpreting and miſ-applying them againſt their genuine ſcope and ſence, context and harmony. He will often be reformer himſelf, <hi>Jeſu</hi> like, and drives on furiouſly, that he may undo all by over-doing, whether in Church or State.

He can make ſtraight work with crooked Tools, and correct the poiſon to made it uſeful in his Providential Confections.

His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Chymiſtry knows how to extract good out of the worſt dung and vileſt kind of Evil. The ſtriking of the ſteel againſt the flint, will ſeaſonably by his Divine hand bring forth ſparks, both of Truth and Peace.

The noiſe made at the breaking in of Windows for light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will be compenſated by the Light come in. Our ſad Experiences of thoſe ſinfull Woes attending diſorder and diſcord will make us all to prize and deſire, to promote and improve Peace at a better rate. Wit ſo bought will make us wiſer for the future, then to ſlight our Peace and to venture it, as we have hitherto ſo fooliſhly done. God will over-ſhoot Satan in his own Bow, and magnifie all his glorious attributes in the creating of Peace for his People. Chriſts coming at night after many ſtorms, will be moſt welcome <note place="margin">Mar. 4. 38. 39.</note>to his wearied diſciples, though they did for a while miſtake him for a Ghoſt, and miſtruſt his Peace.

They are his children, and their Relation to him is ſufficient ground why ſuch Peace-making ſhould be their dignifying Property.

The Tranſcript of his Will he engraves on them by the hand of his Spirit; that they may tranſcribe it by the hand of Faith in the work of Peace-making.

Mind we that Axiom, which the Light of Nature diſcovered to <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the Light of Grace explains unto Chriſtians; <hi>Concordiâ res parvae creſcunt diſcordiâ maximae dilabuntur,</hi> the ſmalleſt matters flouriſh thrivingly, watered by Concord; the greateſt things waſte miſerably, blaſted by Diſcord. Suppoſe that we meet with ſower crabbed Spirits, that ſlight and oppoſe the wayes of Peace, which we would promote do not we find more cauſe of caution, care and information for compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>uſ<expan>

Should we not remember how the Lord dealt with us, to perſwade us to Peace by his long Suffering, Patience and Meekneſs, Love and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs in all the means uſed for our good? Doth not our Heavenly Father inſtruct us fully by his Precepts, Promiſes and Preſidents, how to overcome evil with good ſtill? Will not this Divine Milk quence our unchriſtian flames moſt powerfully, if duly poured on in all the Incendies, publique and private, ſo fatally increaſing among us? Suppoſe ſome of Gods own Children be infected with dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in their Intellectuals.

Suppoſe we cannot prevail with ſome of them to Chriſtian Union and Communion in ſuch an orderly way as we could wiſh. Should not Gods Children deny themſelves much, and ſtoop to the utmoſt degree of lawfull compliance, to unite and walk as far as may be in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114746:77"/>
thoſe particulars wherein we agree? Suppoſe we conceive our ſelves to be much ſlighted and wronged by others many wayes in our very Attempts for their Good and Peace; yet <note place="margin">Luke 6. 35.</note>ſhould we not ſtill imitate our Father and elder Brother on the beſt account, in bearing and forbearing, giving and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving? Suppoſe we think our ſelves peaceable and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, yet is it not poſſible that we ſhould miſtake and flatter our ſelves, through the ſinfull Reliques of our ſelfiſh Love, ſelfiſh pleaſing, and other noiſome Luſts? Have we not moſt cauſe to blame our ſelves ſtill, and be ſweeping daily before our own doors, judging of others better then our ſelves? Suppoſe that others be ſtill frowardly backward, and all probable wayes to Peace obſtructed. Should we not truſt our God, rather then deſpond, and believe in <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 19.</note>hope againſt appearing Hope, neglecting nothing wherein we may act like Children of Peace? Suppoſe we ſhould ſuſpect others of reigning Hypocriſie, upon probable Grounds; yet are not we bound to judge ſtill the beſt, till the worſt <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note>manifeſtly appear, and to take all things by the right handle ſtill, rather then by the left, making the beſt conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, that prudent Charity can poſſibly afford without Offence to God? Were it not better to venture admiſſion of ten Hypocrites, then to exclude through our Rigidneſs, one of Gods Children from that Peace, which attends Unity and Order in each Relation of his Great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Lets then labor for the Peace of God in all the wayes of Truth and Righteouſneſs, that the Holineſs, which characterize all his Children, may appear in this digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Property.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Friends of Peace are exhorted hence to carry it right towards ſtrangers alſo, as becomes Gods Children. Such as appear yet alienated from the Peace of God, eternal and ſaving, are to be pittied, prayed for, and perſwaded as far as may be. Our lips and life, ſhould ſtill afford them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments, that we are Gods Children, by the Exerciſe of this bleſſed Property. Should not we deal with ſuch as the Lord himſelf directs in his Word, and as himſelf proceeds?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114746:78"/>
Though we cannot yet have Eccleſiaſtical Peace with ſuch, yet a Political with them, as they are Men, ſhould be with all care duly promoted for Gods Honor, for the publique Weal. Grace is the beſt Teacher of good manners in all relations, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Spiritual. The meaneſt child of God hath a civil Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as well as Spiritual, wherein he muſt labor as far as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as much as in him lies, to have Peace with all men; doing good to all, eſpecially to the Houſe-hold of Faith. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal and mortification of every ſin, eſpecially of our darling corruptions, are conſtantly to be exerciſed in order thereto. Every Grace is to be furbiſhed in every condition, that we may commend the Peace of God to others, and win them gradually to the God of Peace. Political Unity and Order will be found ſignally ſubſervient to Gods Glory, and the good of Man. Should not we labour to be true Patriots, in ſhewing our ſelves to be true Chriſtians? Should not we ſtrive for that noble Temper of a publique Spirit, which is ready ſtill to ſubject its own private Emoluments to the publique Weal? If we be Gods Children, let it appear in thus acting from him, and like him, for him, and through him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Towards Enemies Gods Children ſhould act in a way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the true friends of Peace. We ſhould account none for an Enemy, that is not Gods Enemy, much more then ours. We ſhould not entertain any Enmity on a Private account, and perſonal reſpects. Chriſt teaches us to forgive and forget, though it be ſeventy times ſeven, from day to day. If any hate us, pitty their caſe, they hurt themſelves moſt. Be ſure to give them no cauſe, and to miniſter as little occaſion of Offence as may be. Love to enemies, and prayer for them upon this ſcore, Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to. Yet when our beſt is done, we ſhall ſtill meet with many enemies that will hate us upon Chriſts account, becauſe of his Grace and Work entruſted with us. <hi>David</hi> ſhews us the difference between perſonal and publique enemies, praying for the former, and againſt the latter. Yet of theſe alſo, there is a Latitude, ſome exceeding others in malice and wicked oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to God and his Peace. Do we what we can to quel their

               <p>Thus all Chriſtians in each Relation, Superior or Inferior, Spiritual or civil, publique or private, ſhould be exhorted to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for peace alwayes, by all means, in ſubordination to the God of Peace. Chriſt the Prince of Peace, ſaith enough to move every ſoul thereto; <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi>
