         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A COPY of
Mr. Aſhton's Paper,
Delivered to the
SHERIFF
AT THE
Place of Execution, <date>January 28. 1690-91.</date>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Sheriff,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving obſerved that the Method of making Speeches at the
Place of Execution was not always attended with the deſigned
Succeſſes; and thinking it better to imploy my laſt Minutes
in Devotion and holy Communion with my God, I have prepared
this Paper to leave in your Hands, as well to aſſert my Principles as
to teſtifie my Innocency.</p>
            <p>As to my Religion; I profeſs, by God's Grace, to dye in the Faith
into which I was baptized, that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe
Communion (nothing doubting of my Salvation, through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of my Saviour) I have always thought my ſelf ſafe and happy:
According to her Principles, and late much eſteemed Doctrine (though
now unhappily exploded) I have regulated my Life, believing my
ſelf obliged, by my Religion, to look upon my Rightful, Lawful
Prince (whatever his Principles were, or his Practices might be)
as God's Vicegerent, and accountable (if guilty of Male-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to God only, from whom he received his Power; and always
believing it to be contrary to the Laws of God, the Church, and the
Realm, upon any Pretence whatſoever, to take up Arms againſt him;
And let all the World take Notice, in this Belief I dye. But I have
more particular Obligations to the King my Maſter, whom I have
had the Honour to ſerve, and received many ſignal Favours from
him, for Sixteen Years paſt: So that Gratitude (a Thing not much
eſteemed at this time) as well as Duty and Religion, commanded
the utmoſt Service I could pay him. And when I had theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
That we were Born his Liege Subjects, That we had So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
profeſſed our Allegiance, and often confirmed it with Oaths,
That his Majeſty's Uſage, after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Arrival, was
very hard, ſevere, and (if I may ſo ſay) unjuſt: And that all the
new Methods of ſettling this Nation have hitherto made it more
miſerable, poor, and more expoſed to Foreign Enemies: And the
Religion we pretend to be fond of Preſerving, now, much more
than ever, likely to be Deſtroyed; There ſeems to me no way to
prevent the impending Evils, and ſave theſe Nations from Poverty
and Diſtraction, but the calling home our injured Sovereign; who,
as a true Father of his Country, has (notwithſtanding all his Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb facs="tcp:102297:2"/>
and Injuries) a natural Love and Tenderneſs for all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
And I am ſo far from Repining at the loſs of my Life, that had
I Ten thouſand I ſhould rather think my ſelf Obliged to ſacrifice them
all, than to omit any juſt and honeſt Means to promote ſo good and
neceſſary a Work. And I adviſe and deſire all my Fellow Subjects
to think of their Duty, and turn to their Allegiance, before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Judgments of God overtake them, for their Perjury and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
But certainly the Good and Intereſt of theſe Nations, abſtracted
from all other Conſiderations, will e're long convince them of the
Neceſſity of doing it.</p>
            <p>Having thus frankly delared my Principles, I know the Inference
will be, That I have Acted accordingly; and, conſequently, that I
am now <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſtly Condemned: But as I ingenuouſly own the Inference,
I as poſitively deny the Conſequence; for whatever my Inclinations
or Actings have been, yet, as to the Matter I was Sentenced to dye
for, I declare my ſelf Innocent. And I will appeal, even to the Judges
themſelves, whether or no, upon my Tryal, there appeared the
leaſt Proof that I knew a Tittle contained in the Papers: But Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
was with the Jury thought ſufficient to find me Guilty;
though, I am told, I am the Firſt Man that ever was Condemned
for High Treaſon upon bare Suſpition or Preſumption; and that
contrary to my Lord <hi>Coke's,</hi> and other eminent Lawyers Opinions.
The knowledge of my own Innocency, as to the Indictment and
Charge againſt me, was that that Armed me with ſo much Aſſurance,
and occaſioned my caſting my Life upon the firſt Twelve Men of the
Pannel, without challenging any: But though I have, I think, juſt
Reaſon to complain of the ſevere Charge given by the Judges, and
hard Meaſure I have received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to mention my cloſe Impriſonment,
the haſty and violent Proceedings againſt me, nor the Induſtry uſed
in the return of fitting Perſons to paſs upon me, the denying me a
Copy of the Pannel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet as I hope for Pardon and Forgiveneſs at the Hands of God,
ſo do I moſt heartily pray for and forgive them, and all my Enemies,
all the World; nay, even that Judge and Jury-man who did ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
(contrary to common Juſtice) expoſe themſelves to deſtroy
me. But let the Will of God be done; I rely wholly upon his Mercy,
and the Merits of my bleſſed Saviour, for Salvation; I do chearfully
and intirely reſign my ſelf into his Hands, as into the Hands of a
faithful Creator, in ſure and certain Hopes of a happy Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Bleſs, protect and ſtrengthen, O Lord God, my good and gracious
King and Maſter: In thy due time let the Virtue, Goodneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
of the Queen my Miſtreſs, make all their Enemies bluſh;
and ſilence the wicked and unjuſt Calumnies that Malice and Envy
have raiſed againſt her: Make her and theſe Nations happy in the
Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> whom, from unanſwerable and undoubted Proofs,
I know to be her Son: Reſtore them all when thou feeſt fit to their
juſt Rights; And on ſuch a Bottom as may ſupport and eſtabliſh the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and once more make her Flouriſh, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
what ſhe hath received of late from her prevaricating Sons.</p>
            <p>Forgive, forgive, O Lord, all my Enemies; bleſs all my Friends;
comfort and ſupport my dear afflicted Wife, and poor Babes; be thou
a Husband and a Father to them; for their Sakes only I could have
wiſhed to have Lived, but pardon that Wiſh, O good God, and
take my Soul into thy e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
