         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

¶Pauper. Abraham Yſaac &amp; Iacob
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy patryarkes were full riche men

Ezechie &amp; Ioſie were kynges of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

wherby as me thynketh eche man ſhol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de

myſchyef. ¶Pauper. I praye the be as
beſye to forſake thy richeſſe by enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

pouerte &amp; beggerye. For in his prayer
in whiche be conteyned moo wordes

to thy fantaſye / and leueſt behynde
what the lyſte whiche is ayenſt thy fan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taſye.
The hole prayer of Salomon
is this. Mendicitatem et diuicias ne

meo neceſſaria. Ne forte ſaciatus illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciar

nede conſtreyned ſtele / and forſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the name of my god. After the expo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſycyon
of Beda and Lyra in this texte
Salomon prayeth to god that he be
not ſo fylled with richeſſes / that he for
pryde &amp; habondaunce of worldly goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
forgete his god and endeles goodes
Alſo on that other ſyde that vnpacyen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
of pouerte compelle hym not to ſtele
neyther to forſwere hym. In whiche
prayer he refuſeth noo more pouerte / than
he dooth habondau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of richeſſe.
But his prayer Indyfferentely behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
grete richeſſe / and moche pouerte.
Alſo ſyr ſaaf thy pacyence / thou reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
the wordes of Salomons prayer
with falſe Englyſſhe and not conueny<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent.
For he ſayd not gyue me neyther
richeſſe ne beggerye as thou ſaydeſte.
But he ſayd gyue me rycheſſe and beg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gerye.
That is to ſaye / gyue me not ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheſſe
with nygardſhyppe and ſtrayt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of herte and couetyſe / whiche ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
the riche man alwaye to begge and
craue. For as I ſayd Eccleſiaſtes the .v.
ca. The nygarde hath neuer ynough.
And ſoo by theſe wordes he prayeth to
god that yf he gyue hym richeſſe / that
he ſholde gyue hym therwith largeneſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe
of herte / and grace to ſpende them
to goddes worſhyppe / &amp; to haue good
of his good by his lyfe. For as he ſayth
Eccleſiaſtes .vi. It is a grete myſchy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
and a grete vanyte that god gyueth
a man richeſſe / and goodes ynoughe
what he wyll haue. And with that he
gyueth hym no power for nygardſhyp
to haue parte therof / but kepeth theym
to the ſtraunger / whiche ſhall deuoure
all that he getteth with moche care.
Ayenſt this myſchyef and beggery of
couetyſe. Salomon made his prayer
ſayenge to the lorde / gyue me not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe

nygardſhyppe and beggerye maketh
riche men to forſake theyr god. So it

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cometh of myſcouetyſe / not of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte

¶Pauper. I preue it. Dauyd that

it nedeth hym more for to begge

And therfore the cauſe of that

               <p>DIues. Is it lefull to ſette
ony truſte or ony fayth on

ben two maner cauſes of dremes.
One from inwarde / &amp; an other from

ſterynge of mannes fantaſye or
womans in theyr ſlepe / &amp; ſuche dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
ben but fantaſyes and vanytees
And therfore ſayth Salomon. Vbi
multa ſomnia. ibi multe vanitates.
Eccle. v. Where as ben many dremes
ther ben many vanytees / for in this
maner one man ſhall haue moo dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
than ſome twenty other Another
cauſe from inwarde is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dyſpoſyco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n
of the bodye. For whan men ben col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of kynde / they dreme of froſtes &amp;

leche may knowe in parte the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſyco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n
of ther bodye / be it to helthe
or to ſekenes. The thyrde cauſe from
inwarde is the dyſpoſyco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule
For comonly men dremen of ſuche
thynges as ther ſoules &amp; theyr though<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te

waken / eyther by ſtudye / by loue / or by

<pb facs="tcp:4492:43"/>
care pryde or couetyſe. Cauſes of dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

&amp; ghooſtly. Bodely is the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſyco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n
of the ayer and of the place
about hym / &amp; other thynges beſyde
hym. And therfore in rayne weder
men dreme of water &amp; of fyſſhes / for
ofte ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes bodye chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth after the
dyſpoſycyon of the ayer &amp; of his aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge

Ghooſtly cauſes from outwar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
of dremes ben ij. maners / the one is
good / for that is god by hym ſelfe / or
ellys by angellys / &amp; that in thre ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
For ſome dreme ſo by ymagyna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon

pryncypally ſerue to wytche crafte.
Somtyme dremes come of grete be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyneſſe
&amp; trauayl that one hath whan
he is wakyng And therfor ſayth Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lomon

of ſuche thynges as they ben in

of exceſſe of mete or of drynke.
Somtyme of myſlykynge that man
hath whan he is wakyng. And in as
moche as the effecte of thynges is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of his cauſes / as ſmoke is token
of the fyre / ſoo ſuche dremes ben to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens

in this maner awyſe man may telle
by dremes cauſes of mannes dremes / &amp;
ſo by cauſes telle other preuy thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

one cauſe bryngeth forth dyuerſe effec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes

that he loued moche that woman / &amp;
but he withdrewe hym from her com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany

And alſo as clerkes ſaye in aſmoche

god is in heuen / and theyr herte and

wyſely / deuoutely / and with good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencyon

therfore Cryſte repreued them bothe.
Alſo they ſpeke to moche in theyr

texte of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
full well that halowynge in the
ſatyrdaye ſholde be tranſlated in to
the ſondaye / that is called the daye
of the ſonne. For though god ceſſed in
the ſatyrdaye from makynge of thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
of newe kynde / yet in the ſatyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye
he made the ſatyrdaye as he ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
eche daye byfore in the ſame daye.
But in the ſondaye next folowynge
he made no newe daye in kynde / for
that was the fyrſte daye / and ſoo he
reſted more in the ſondaye from wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
than he dyde reſte in the ſatyr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>daye.
Alſo after grete trauayll ought
to be more reſte. But Cryſte goddes
ſone hadde more trauayl in recreacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and redempcyon of mankynde / than
he hadde to make al this worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.
For in makynge of all the worlde
he hadde no trauayll / as ſayth ſaynt
Auſtyn / but oonly he badde it ſholde
be done / &amp; it was done anone what
he wolde. But in creaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n &amp; redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon
of mankynde he trauaylled ſoo / that
he ſwoted blood for anguyſſhe / &amp;
deyed for trauayll &amp; ſhedde his herte

he roſe from deth to lyue to comforte
all mankynde that wolde byleue in

he was &amp; is lorde of all thynge. And
ſayd to his apoſtles / that all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in heuen &amp; in erthe was gyuen to
hym in his manhode. And therfore
the ſondaye is called the lordes daye.
Dies dn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>icus. And therfor ſythen god

For as Salomon ſayth Sap<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .vi.

the thyrde tonge that doth ſo moche

is the flaterynge tonge whiche is the
worſte of all. For euery flaterer that
flatereth man or woman in his ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
/ he is a flaterer / he is a bachyter / he
is a double tonged / and ſo he may be

ne to god / ne knowe not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
&amp; waxe ſo proude that they gyue
no tale of ther euen cryſten. Alſo the
flaterer lacketh and bachyteth al tho
that he hateth / whom he flatereth ſo
to pleaſe hym / &amp; hyndereth an other
mannes name to enhaunce his name
and ſo maketh dyſcorde &amp; dyſcenco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n
Alſo flaterers be double tonged. For
as lyghtely as they prayſen man or
woman / as lyghtely they wyll lacke
theym yf they fayle of ther purpoſe
and haue no lucre by ther flaterynge
as they wende haue had. For comonly
grete prayſers be grete lackers / and
as moche as they prayſe man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
out of meſure by flaterynge / as
moche they wyll lacke hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or an other
by bachytyng. Therfor Seneca ſayth
Lauda parce. vitupera perciꝰ. Prayſe
ſcarſely / but lacke more ſcarſely. For
theſe reaſons Salomon ſayth / that
the thyrde tonge hath ſtyred moche in

ſhame and ſhenſhyp and dyſparpled
them fro nacyon to nacyon. It hath
deſtroyed walled townes / &amp; dolue vp
the houſes of grete lordes. It hath kyt
awaye the myght and the vertue of
people that were full ſtronge and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
them feble. For flaterers make
townes nacyons &amp; lordes bolde to be
gynne warres / plees &amp; debate / by whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
they come to nought. For they be
ſo blent by flaterynge and ouerpray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge
that they knowe not themſelf / but
wene to ouerlede all men tyll att

Alſo as the wyſe man ſayth / the thyr

theym and put them from theyr

Poule forbyde not vtterly ſuche aray
But they forbyde wymen ſuche aray
to vſe in pryde / or to prouoke folke to

For we fynde that ſaynt Cecyle and

&amp; wered the hayre vnder y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſolemp

tho wordes pryncypally for tyme of

in tyme of generall proceſſyon made
for nede. In ſuche tyme namely man
&amp; woman ſholde leue all tokens and

whome they ſholde praye why &amp; how
and where they ſhall praye as ſayth
the gloſe. And he enformeth them to
praye in lowneſſe / without pompe of

ſyker / that the foule ſtynkynge pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe

nyghe honde in euery perſone is now
araye paſſynge to mannes bodye and

ſo that man is more pryncypall in or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dre

ſtable and myghty and of hygher

ſayd be more vertuous and ſtable in

be that wymen kepe them ofte more

than man. For we ſee that whan men
take them to be ankeres and recluſes
within a fewe yeres comonly eyther
they falle in reuerſes / or hereſyes / or

For men truſte to moche in themſelf

For who ſoo dredeth god with loue

beſy to do his pleſaunce &amp; to leue his

ancres they doo it moro for the

no man repreue theym therof / ne wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te

And comonly men ancres haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

And ſythen they grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de theym all in

therfore he ſuffreth the tende to haue

For ſhe was ſoo fayre a woman that

Take it not ſoo harde ne ſoo

But in all thynges that Sara ſayth

An other reaſon may be this. For the

de reſonable / yet in one thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
clerkes holde ayenſt the in
that that thou ſayſt that the ſynne of
Adam was more than the ſynne of
Eue. And they argue thus ayenſt the
God ryghtfull Iuge punyſſhed Eue
<abbr>hard</abbr> for hyr ſynne than he dyd Adam
for his ſynne / but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſholde not god ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue

than y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſynne of Adam / therfore
the ſynne of Eue was more greuous
than Adams ſynne. ¶Pauꝑ. This
argument is grounded in two falſe
maximis. Fyrſte that euery punyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhynge
and vengeaunce aſſygned of
god for mannes ſynne and womans
is aſſygned after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſynne is more
or leſſe. And this maxime &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de is
falſe / wherfor thou ſhalt vnderſtande
that god punyſſhe ſome ſynne in this
worlde / and ſome in the other worlde
ſome bothe here &amp; there. In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worlde he punyſſheth euery ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
after that it is more greuous / or
leſſe greuous. But in this worlde he
<pb facs="tcp:4492:137"/>
dooth not alwaye ſo. But oft in this
worlde he punyſſheth the leſſe ſynne
harder than he doth the more ſynne.
Therfore in the olde lawe auoutrye
was punyſſhed as harde or <abbr>hard</abbr> than
manſlaughter / &amp; yet manſlaughter is
more greuous ſynne than auoutrye / &amp;
god toke more temporall vengeu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in

dyd for ydolatrye / &amp; yet ydolatrye is

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement

manſlaughter is harder punyſſhed in

poore folk be harder punyſſhed in
this worlde / than ſynnes of the grete
men. Yf a poore man ſtele an horſe / he
ſhal be hanged. But yf a lorde by

dyd grete ydolatrye / &amp; drough moche

ſynnes god punyſſhed in this worlde
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſoules be punyſſhed in this worl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſoules of the ſynners may

comonly he punyſſhed <abbr>hard</abbr> poore fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
in this worlde than the ryche folke
as by comon lawe. For the ſynne of
grete men / as in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame ſpyce of ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
is more greuous than is the ſynne
of the poore man. And therfore god
reſerueth the greuous ſynnes and the
ſynnes of grete folke for to punyſſhe
them in the other worlde / or in helle
or in purgatorye. There may no tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall
payne be full punyſſhynge for
dedely ſynne ſaue contrycyon allone.
And therfore god punyſſheth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
folke in this worlde after the
qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyte of ther ſynne / but as he ſeeth
it mooſt nedefull &amp; ſpedefull to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple

in goddes ſyght / &amp; ayenwarde. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
god melureth not alwaye pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
after the quantyte of the ſynne.
But oft he punyſſheth in this worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
them that be leſſe gylty / as moche
as theym that be more gylty. And in

               <p>ALſo the ſeconde maxime and
grounde in whiche thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte
that god punyſſhed Eue
harder than Adam may reſonably be
denyed. For in punyſſhynge of Adam
god gaf his curſe and ſayd. Curſed
be the erthe in thy werke &amp; in thy ſyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
He ſayd not curſed be the erthe in
thy werke of Eue / ne he ſayd not / cur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
be the erthe in your werke / as for
comon ſynne of them bothe / but he
ſayd only to Adam. Curſed be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> erth
in thy werke. In punyſſhynge alſo
of the ſerpent he gaf his curſe &amp; ſayd
Thou ſhalt be curſed amonges alle
thynge lyuynge vpon erthe. Alſo god
curſed Caym whan he punyſſhed hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for ſleynge of his brother Abell. But
whan god punyſſhed woman / he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
not his curſe. And we rede not that
euer god gaue his curſe to ony wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
openly in ſpecyaall. Ne god re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preued
not Eue ſo moche as he dyde
Adam. And ſo the grete repreue &amp; bla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mynge
&amp; the curſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god gaue in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſſhyng
of Adam more than he dyd
in punyſſhyng of Eue / ſhewyng well
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſynne of Adam was more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
than was the ſynne of Eue / &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
there was more ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tynacy in Adam
than was in Eue. For curſyng is not
gyuen of god ne of holy chirche / but
for obſtynacy. As I ſayd fyrſt Adam
anſwered full obſtynatly. God bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Adam pry<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cypaly for brekyng of
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement &amp; ſayd to hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
brekynge of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement was
cauſe of his nakedneſſe &amp; of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne
myſcheef / and notwithſtange
the techynge and the ſtyrynge of god
he wolde not be aknowen of his ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
/ but put his ſynne on god / and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
hym by Eue / and ſoo put ſynne
to ſynne in excuſacyon of his ſynne.
Whan god punyſſhed Adam he cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the erthe for his ſynne / whiche cur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe
tourned to woo &amp; trauayle of hym
&amp; of all mankynde whiche we maye
not flee. And therfore ha ſayd to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
/ thou ſhalt ete of the erth in tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uayle
and ſorowe all the dayes of thy
lyfe. I ſhall brynge the forth brerys &amp;
thornes / &amp; thou ſhalt ete herbes of the
<pb facs="tcp:4492:138"/>
erthe. Alſo in punyſſhynge of Adam
god gaf the ſentence of deth vpon hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; all mankynde for his ſynne. And
therfor god ſayd to Adam / y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſhalt ete
thy brede in ſwynke &amp; ſwete of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
tyll y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> tourne ayen in to the erthe.
For erthe y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art / &amp; in to erthe ayen thou
ſhalt wende. Sythen than god for
the ſynne of Adam gaf ſo greuouſly
his curſe / and blamed ſo harde Adam
of his ſynne / and for his ſynne damp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
hym and all mankynde / and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſſhed
all erthely creatures for his
ſynne &amp; dampned hym and all man
kynde to perpetuel trauayle whan he
ſayd. Thou ſhalt ete thy mete with
trauayle &amp; ſorowe al the dayes of thy
lyfe. And alſo for the ſynne of Adam
he gaf ſentence of deth to hym and
to all mankynde that is mooſt of all
paynes / it foloweth that god punyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
harder Adam for his ſynne / than
he dyde Eue for hyr ſynne. For why
in punyſſhynge of Eue god repreued
hyr not ſo moche as he dyde Adam.
&amp; he gaf than no curſe ne payne per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petuell
ſaue ſubieccyon. I ſhall ſayd
god multeplye thy myſcheues &amp; thy
conceyuynges / &amp; in ſorowe y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſhalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
thy childern / and y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſhalt be vnder
power of man &amp; he ſhall be thy lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.
God ſayd not to woman. I ſhall
multeplye thy myſcheues all dayes
of thy lyfe. For ſhe may kepe hyr cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſte
yf ſhe wyll and flee myſcheef and
payne of childern byrthe. And that
god made woman ſuget to man for
the ſynne of Eue / it was noo newe
thynge to woman. For as ſaynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
ſayth ſuꝑ Gen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.li.xi.ca.xiiij. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was ſuget to man byfore by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre
of kynde / but that ſubiecco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n was
only by loue and charyte / but for hyr
ſynne ſhe was made ſuget / not only
by loue / but alſo by nede &amp; bondage
of honeſte ſeruyle werkes to obeye to
man and be vnder his gouernaunce.
Byfore hyr ſynne ſhe was ſugette to
man only by loue / but after hyr ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
ſhe was made ſuget to man / not
only by loue but by drede &amp; by nede.
For ſhe muſte drede man &amp; ſhe hath
nede of his helpe. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of Adam &amp; of Eue / that they deſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
to haue noo ſouerayne ne gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
but god allone as clerkes ſaye.
And therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fende in gyle behyght
them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they deſyred ſaynge to Eue yf
ye ete of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tree y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god hath forbode you

for that they deſyred it lyghtely they
byleued it. For as the mayſter of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
ſayth. A thynge that is deſyred / lyghtly
it is byleued. And therfor god
ryghtfull Iuge punyſſhed them bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
in ſubieccyon of drede and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
/ and of harde ſeruage. He made
woman ſuget to man / and afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
he made man ſuget and thrall to
man for the ſynne of Adam as ſayth
ſaynt Auſten ſuꝑ Gen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.v.<abbr>ſup</abbr>. More
than euer he made woman ſuget to
man. For the ſynne of Eue as ſayth

ſynne of Adam. The ſubiecco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man
is put in for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſynne of Eue / is
the ſubiecco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wyfe ought to hyr

lordſhyp that ony man hath here in
this worlde / eyther ouer man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

grete ſorowe &amp; care. For euery ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne
in this worlde muſte care for

degree that he be of lordſhyp &amp;

of peryll / of drede / of ſorowe / &amp; care
in punyſſhyng of Adams ſynne. And
ſo both lordſhyp in this worlde &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iecco

And yf ſugettes can haue pacyence

both of bodye &amp; of ſoule / &amp; in
more gladnes of herte than be the ſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerayns
And ſo punyſſhed god Adam
as moche in maner / in that he made
hym lorde &amp; gouernour of woman as
he punyſſhed Eue whan he made hyr
ſuget to Adam. For in that god bon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
