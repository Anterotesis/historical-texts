            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>So while we pole away his natural power,</l>
                  <l>He's periwig'd with greater than before.</l>
                  <l>'Tis the best Conquest when the Prince is Lord</l>
                  <l>Of's peoples hearts by Love, not by the Sword:</l>
                  <l>For what's the King with a full pow'r to sway,</l>
                  <l>When there are left no Subjects to obey?</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>For when the Realm is in confusion run,</l>
                  <l>(As it must be, when e're the War is done,)</l>
                  <l>The people being Victors, we shall finde</l>
                  <l>As various in desires as they're in minde:</l>
                  <l>They'll be controlling still, and still aspire</l>
                  <l>To limit Legal Pow'r, not their desire:</l>
                  <l>And when their Votes are granted, are as far</l>
                  <l>From b'ing contented with't, as now they are.</l>
                  <l>Both King and Magistrate must look to raign</l>
                  <l>No longer than they do their wills maintain:</l>
                  <l>And that <hi>Great Council</hi> (if they did intend)</l>
                  <l>Can't bring the stubborn people so to bend</l>
                  <l>T' authority, that any King shall sway</l>
                  <l>By fixed Laws, they loyally obey;</l>
                  <l>No more than Pilots on the stormy Seas,</l>

               <l>HOw much you may oblige, how much delight</l>
               <l>The Wise and Noble, would you die to night!</l>
               <l>Would you like some grave sullen <hi>Nictor</hi> die,</l>
               <l>Just when the Triumphs for the Victorie</l>
               <l>Are setting out; would you die now t'eschew</l>
               <l>Our Wreaths, for what your wisdom did subdue;</l>
               <l>And though they're bravely fitted for your head,</l>
               <l>Bravely disdain to wear them till you're dead:</l>
               <l>Such <hi>Cynick</hi>-glory would out-shine the light</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Grecian</hi>-greatness, or of <hi>Roman</hi>-height.</l>
               <l>Not that the Wise and Noble can desire</l>
               <l>To lose the Object they so much admire:</l>
               <l>But Heroes and Saints must shift away</l>
               <l>Their flesh, ere they can get a Holy-day:</l>
               <l>Then like to Time, or Books feign'd Registers,</l>
               <l>Victors, or Saints, renown'd in Calenders,</l>
               <l>You must depart, to make your value known;</l>
               <l>You may be lik't, but not ador'd till gone.</l>
               <l>So curst a Fate hath humane excellence,</l>
               <l>That absence still must raise it to our sense.</l>

               <l>It wins to love, but it subdues to fear.</l>
               <l>The mighty <hi>Julius,</hi> who so long did strive</l>
               <l>At more than man, was hated whilst alive;</l>
               <l>Even for that Vertue which was rais'd so high,</l>
               <l>When dead, it made him straight a <hi>Deity.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Embassadors that carry in their breast</l>
               <l>Secrets of Kings and Kingdoms Interest,</l>
               <l>Have not their Calling's full preheminence,</l>
               <l>Till they grow greater by removing hence:</l>
               <l>Like Subjects, here they but attend the Crown,</l>
               <l>Yet swell like Kings Companions when they're gone.</l>
               <l>My Lord, in a dull Calm the Pilot grows</l>
               <l>To no Esteem for what he acts or knows,</l>
               <l>But sits neglected, as he useless were,</l>
               <l>Or con'd his Card, like a young Passenger:</l>
               <l>But when the silent Windes recover breath,</l>
               <l>When Storms grow loud enough to waken Death,</l>
               <l>Then were he absent, every Traffiquer</l>
               <l>Would with rich wishes buy his being there.</l>
               <l>So in a Kingdom calm you leave no rate,</l>
               <l>But rise to value in a storm of State.</l>
               <l>Yet I recant; I beg you would forgive,</l>
               <l>That in such times I must perswade you live:</l>
               <l>For with a Storm we all are overcast,</l>
               <l>And Northern Storms are dangerous when they last.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49752:41"/>Should you now die, that only know to steer,</l>
               <l>The Windes would less afflict us then our fear:</l>
               <l>For each small States-man then would lay his hand</l>

            <head>A SATYR AGAINST SEPARATISTS.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>I'Ve been, Sir, where so many Puritans dwell,</l>
               <l>That there are only more of them in Hell:</l>
               <l>Where silenc'd Ministers enough were met</l>
               <l>To make a Synod; and may make one yet.</l>
               <l>Their blessed liberty they've found at last,</l>
               <l>And talk'd for all those years of silence past.</l>
               <l>Like some half-pin'd, and hunger-starved men,</l>
               <l>Who when they next get Victuals surfeit then.</l>
               <l>Each Country of the World sent us back some,</l>
               <l>Like several Windes, which from all Quarters come,</l>
               <l>To make a storm. As't haps, 'tis Sunday too,</l>
               <l>And their chief <hi>Rabbies</hi> preach. To Church I go,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49752:42"/>He whines now, whispers straight, and next does roar;</l>
               <l>Now draws his long words, and now leaps them o're.</l>
               <l>Such various voices I admir'd, and said,</l>
               <l>Sure all the Congregation in him praid.</l>
               <l>'Twas the most tedious Soul, the dullest he,</l>
               <l>That ever came to Doctrines twenty three,</l>
               <l>And nineteen Uses. How he draws his <hi>Hum,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And quarters <hi>Haw,</hi> talks Poppy and Opium!</l>
               <l>No Fever a mans eyes could open keep;</l>
               <l>All <hi>Argus</hi> body he'd have preach'd asleep</l>
               <l>In half an hour. The <hi>Wauld, O Lawd,</hi> he cries</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lukewarmness:</hi> And this melts the womens eyes.</l>
               <l>They sob aloud, and straight aloud I snore,</l>
               <l>Till a kinde Psalm tells me the danger's o're.</l>
               <l>Flesh'd here with this escape, boldly to th'Hall</l>
               <l>I venture, where I meet the Brethren all.</l>
               <l>First there to the grave Clergy I am led,</l>
               <l>By whatsoever title distinguished,</l>
               <l>Whether most reverend Batchellors they be</l>
               <l>Of Art, or reverend Sophs, or no Degree.</l>
               <l>Next stand the Wall-eyed Sisters all arow,</l>
               <l>Nay, their Scal'd-headed Children they come too:</l>
               <l>And mingled among these stood gaping there</l>
               <l>Those few Lay-men that not o'th' Clergy were.</l>
               <l>Now they discourse; some stories here relate</l>
               <l>Of bloudy Popish Plots against the State:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49752:42"/>Which by the Spirit, and Providence, no doubt,</l>
               <l>The men that made have found most strangely out.</l>
               <l>Some blame the King, others more moderate, say,</l>
               <l>He's a good man himself, but led away:</l>
               <l>The women rip old Wounds, and with small tears</l>
               <l>Recount the loss of the three Worthies Ears.</l>
               <l>Away you fools, 'twas for the good o'th'men;</l>
               <l>They ne're were perfect <hi>Round-heads</hi> until then.</l>
               <l>But against Bishops they all rail; and I</l>
               <l>Said boldly, I'd defend the Hierarchy:</l>
               <l>To th'Hierarchy they meant no harm at all,</l>
               <l>But root and branch for Bishops; to't we fall;</l>
               <l>I like a fool, with reason, and those men</l>
               <l>With wrested Scripture: a slie Deacon then</l>
               <l>Thrust in his Ears, So speaks th'Apostle too:</l>
               <l>How speaks he, friend? not in the nose, like you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Straight a She-zealot raging to me came,</l>
               <l>And said, o'th'what d'you call't party I am;</l>
               <l>Bishops are limbs of Antichrist, she cries.</l>
               <l>Repent, repent good woman, and be wise,</l>
               <l>The Devil will have you else, that I can tell,</l>
               <l>Believe't, and poach th' eggs o'those eyes in Hell.</l>
               <l>An hideous storm was ready to begin,</l>
               <l>When by most blessed Fate the meat came in;</l>
               <l>But then so long, so long a Grace is sed,</l>
               <l>That a Good Christian when he goes to bed,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:49752:43"/>Would be contented with a shorter prayer:</l>
               <l>Oh how the Saints injoy'd the creatures there!</l>
               <l>Three Pasties in the minute of an hour,</l>
               <l>Large, and well wrought, they Root and Branch devour,</l>
               <l>As glibly as they'd swallow down Church-land;</l>
               <l>In vain the lesser Pies hope to withstand.</l>
               <l>On Geese and Capons, with what zeal they feed?</l>
               <l>And wond'ring cry, A goodly Bird indeed!</l>
               <l>Their spirits thus warm'd, all the jests from them came</l>
               <l>Upon the Names of <hi>Laud, Duck, Wren,</hi> and <hi>Lamb,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Canons and Bishops Sees; and one most wise,</l>
               <l>I like this innocent Mirth at Dinner, cries,</l>
               <l>Which now by one is done; and Grace by two;</l>
               <l>The Bells ring, and again to Church we go.</l>
               <l>Four Psalms are sung, (wise times no doubt they be,</l>
               <l>When <hi>Hopkins</hi> justles out the Liturgie)</l>
               <l>Psalms, which if <hi>David</hi> from from his seat of Bliss</l>
               <l>Doth hear, he little thinks they're meant for his.</l>
               <l>And now the Christian <hi>Bajazet</hi> begins;</l>
               <l>The suffering Pulpit groans for <hi>Israels</hi> sins:</l>
               <l>Sins, which in number many though they be,</l>
               <l>And crying ones, are yet less loud than he:</l>
               <l>His stretch'd-out voice Sedition spreads afar,</l>
               <l>Nor does he onely teach, but act a War:</l>
               <l>He sweats against the State, Church, Learning, Sense,</l>
               <l>And resolves to gain Hell by violence.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:49752:43"/>Down, down ev'n to the ground must all things go,</l>
               <l>There was some hope the Pulpit would down too.</l>
               <l>Work on, work on good Zeal, but still I say,</l>
               <l>Law forbids threshing thus o'th' Sabbath-day.</l>
               <l>An hour lasts this two-handed Prayer, and yet</l>
               <l>Not a kinde syllable from him can Heaven get,</l>
               <l>Till to the Parliament he comes at last;</l>
               <l>Just at that blessed Word his fury's past:</l>
               <l>And here he thanks God in a loving Tone,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Laud;</hi> and then he mounts: All's not yet done:</l>
               <l>No, would it were, think I, but much I fear</l>
               <l>That all will not be done this two hours here:</l>
               <l>For now comes to, <hi>As you shall finde it writ,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Repeats his Text, and takes his leave of it;</l>
               <l>And straight to his Sermon, in such furious wise,</l>
               <l>As made it what they call't, an Exercise.</l>
               <l>The Pulpit's his hot Bath: the Brethrens Cheer,</l>
               <l>Rost-beef, Minc't-py, and Capon reek out here.</l>
               <l>Oh how he whips about six year ago,</l>
               <l>When superstitious Decencie did grow</l>
               <l>So much in fashion! How he whets his fist</l>
               <l>Against the name of Altar, and of Priest!</l>
               <l>The very name, in his outragious heat.</l>
               <l>Poor innocent <hi>Vox ad palcitum</hi> how he beat!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Next he cuffs out Set-prayer, even the Lords,</l>
               <l>It bindes the Spirit, he says, as'twere with cords;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49752:44"/>Even with Whip-cords. Next must Authority go,</l>
               <l>Authority's a kinde of binder too.</l>
               <l>First then he intends to breathe himself upon</l>
               <l>Church-government; have at the King anon.</l>
               <l>The thing's done straight, in poor six minutes space</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> have lost their place;</l>
               <l>Nay with th'Apostles too it e'en went hard,</l>
               <l>All their Authority two thumps more had mar'd;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> might be sure o'th' Doom,</l>
               <l>Knew but this Lion Dunce they'd been at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now to the State he comes, talks an Alarm,</l>
               <l>And at th'malignant party flings his arm;</l>
               <l>Defies the King, and thinks his Pulpit full</l>
               <l>As safe a place for't, as the Knight does <hi>Hull;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What though no Magazine laid in there be?</l>
               <l>Scarce all their Guns can make more noise than he.</l>
               <l>Plots, Plots he talks of, Jealousies and Fears.</l>
               <l>The politick Saints shake their notorious Ears;</l>
               <l>Till time, long time (which doth consume and waste</l>
               <l>All things) to an end this Sermon brought at last.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What would you have, good Souls? a Reformation?</l>
               <l>Oh by all means; but how? o'th' newest fashion;</l>
               <l>A pretty slight Religion, cheap, and free,</l>
               <l>I know not how, but you may furnish'd be</l>
               <l>At <hi>Ipswich, Amsterdam,</hi> or a Kingdom neer,</l>
               <l>Though to say truth, you paid for't there too dear:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49752:44"/>No matter what it costs, we'll reform though;</l>
               <l>The Prentices themselves will have it so.</l>
               <l>They'll root out Popery whats'ever come,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>It is decreed; nor shall thy fate, O Rome,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Resist their Vow:</hi> They'll do't to a hair; for they,</l>
               <l>Who if upon <hi>Shrove-tuesday,</hi> or <hi>May-day,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Beat an old Bawd, or fright poor Whores they cou'd,</l>
               <l>Thought themselves greater than their Founder <hi>Lud,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Have now vast thoughts, and scorn to set upon</l>
               <l>Any Whore less than her of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They're mounted high, contemn the humble play</l>
               <l>Of Cat, or Foot-ball on a Holyday</l>
               <l>In <hi>Finsbury</hi>-fields: No, 'tis their brave intent</l>
               <l>Wisely t' advise the King and Parliament:</l>
               <l>The work in hand they'll disapprove or back,</l>
               <l>And cry i'th' Reformation, What d'you lack?</l>
               <l>Can they whole Shop-books write, and yet not know</l>
               <l>If Bishops have a Right Divine or no?</l>
               <l>Or can they sweep their doors, and shops so well,</l>
               <l>And for to clense a State as yet not tell?</l>
               <l>No; study and experience makes them wise,</l>
               <l>Why should they else watch late, and early rise?</l>
               <l>Their wit so flows, that when they think to take</l>
               <l>But Sermon-notes, they oft new Sermons make:</l>
               <l>In <hi>Cheapside</hi>-cross they <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Dagon</hi> see;</l>
               <l>They know 'tis gilt all o're as well as we.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:49752:45"/>Besides, since men did that gay Idol rear,</l>
               <l>God has not blest the Herbwives Trading there.</l>
               <l>Go on brave <hi>Heroes,</hi> and perform the rest,</l>
               <l>Encrease your fame each day a yard at least,</l>
               <l>Till your high Names are gro wn as gloriousfull</l>

               <l>So may your Goodly Ears still prickant grow,</l>
               <l>And no bold Hair encrease, to mar the show;</l>
               <l>So may your <hi>Morefields</hi>-pastimes never fail,</l>
               <l>And all the Towns about keep mighty Ale;</l>
               <l>Ale your own Spirits to raise, and Cakes t'appease</l>
               <l>The hungry coyness of your Mistresses:</l>
               <l>So may rare Pageants grace the Lord-Mayor's show,</l>
               <l>And none finde out that those are Idols too.</l>
               <l>So may you come to sleep in Fur at last,</l>

               <l>Your Funeral-sermon of six hours rehearse,</l>

               <l>Men may learn thence to keep two Wives, they say.</l>
               <l>Next, Scholarship and Learning must go down;</l>
               <l>Oh fie! your Sex so cruel to the Gown?</l>

               <l>This is a Conventicle-trick. What's next?</l>
               <l>Oh! with the Churches solemn Forms they're vext!</l>
               <l>The signe o'th'Cross the Forehead must not bear,</l>
               <l>'Twas only you were born to plant signes there.</l>
               <l>No Font to wash Native Concupiscence in,</l>
               <l>You like that itch still of Original sin.</l>
               <l>No solemn Rites of Burial must be shown;</l>
               <l>Pox take you, hang your selves, you shall ha'none.</l>
               <l>No Organs; Idols to the Ear they be:</l>
               <l>No Anthemes; why? nay ask not them, nor me.</l>
               <l>There's new Church-musick found instead of those,</l>

               <l>They're Rags of <hi>Rome,</hi> I think: what would you have?</l>
               <l>Lastly, they'd Preach too; let them, for no doubt,</l>
