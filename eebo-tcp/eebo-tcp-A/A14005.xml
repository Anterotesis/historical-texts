            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Before a man bee ioyned to Chriſt,
that is, before a mans effectuall vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a man and Chriſt are at oddes, are
two, are diuided, are enemies. <hi>Te were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1404:7"/>
at that time,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> that is, in
your daies of ignorance and paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,
<hi>without Chriſt, and were aliens
from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and
were ſtrangers from the couenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and had no hope, and were without
God in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after they bee conioyned and
knit together, after they haue giuen
themſelues each to other, and haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and entertained each other, they
are now like man and wife no more to
be reputed two, but one.</p>
            <p>Neither is a man to thinke that he is
a true Chriſtian, and adorned with true
Chriſtian faith and charity before hee
be vnited vnto Chriſt. But then, when
he is firſt truely coupled vnto Chriſt,
euen then, and not before, he is indued
with thoſe Chriſtian vertues, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
indeede a Chriſtian. For there
muſt be an vnion with Chriſt, before
there bee communion, or fellowſhip.
Wee are knit to Chriſt, before wee
draw any vertue from him. Before I
ſay, not in time, but in nature. So that
faith, hope, charitie, obedience, are
not vertues had before this vnion is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1404:8"/>
made, but then, when it is made, and
after wards. They go not before the
vnion, but they are giuen at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the vnion, and ſhew him, that
is vnited. Then, when Chriſt is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to come vnto a man, and to vnite
himſelfe actually to him, euen then,
and not before, hee breathes into him
the breath of life, to wit, his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who creates in him faith and loue,
and moues him to giue himſelfe vnto
Chriſt, and workes in him a certaine
ſpirituall hunger and thirſt after him,
and learnes him to feede vpon him, as
a childe on's Nurſe, or as a hungrie
man on the meat, that's ſet before him.
But more of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Coniunction is not</hi> imaginary,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 22. 23. 26.</note>
               <hi>and deceitfull, but reall, and true.</hi> The
glory, which thou gaueſt me, <hi>ſaith Chriſt,</hi>
I haue giuen them, that they may be one,
euen as we are one: I in them, and thou in
mee, that they may be made perfect in one.
And I haue declared vnto them thy
name, and will declare it, that the loue,
wherewith thou haſt loued mee, may be in
them,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 20.</note> and I in them. <hi>And againe,</hi> At

and you in me,<note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> and I in you. <hi>And
yet more,</hi> If any man loue me, my Father
will loue him, and we will come vnto him,
and will dwell with him.</p>
            <p>There are ſome, that dreame they
eat and drinke, yet indeede they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eate nor drinke: but awaking
they riſe vp hungrie, and a thirſt. Some
haue imagined in their dreames, they
haue beene married, and yet in truth,
were not. Theſe marriages are but
dreames and phanſies: but the vnion
of Chriſt and his members is true, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and demonſtrable. Indeede as
ſome phrantique men haue thought
many things theirs, which were not:
ſo Hypocrites who are like the flower
<hi>Granadelle,</hi> which is very faire to the
eye, but hath no ſmell (as <hi>Ioſeph Acoſta</hi>
writeth) and other wicked and falſe
hearted Chriſtians (who are like the
wilde <hi>Tunalls</hi> in the weſterne <hi>Indies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioſ. Acoſt. hiſt. Ind. lib. 4. c. 23.</note> the
which doe cary no fruite, or elſe that,
which is very pricking and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
may through a certaine phrenſie
of ſpirit imagine and perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
that they are true Chriſtians,
wedded and vnited vnto Chriſt, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1404:9"/>
poſſeſſed of his grace, being in trueth
cleane voide of Chriſt, and wedded to
their owne Idolls, which they dote on,
and embrace for Chriſt, as <hi>Ixion</hi> did
the cloud for <hi>Iuno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a true Vnion, or Coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of loue, among true friends, as
betweene <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Ionathan.</hi> For
(<hi>Amicus eſt alter ego</hi>) a man and his
friend are both as one; either <hi>one,</hi> or
<hi>none.</hi> If diuided, then no friends. But
this is the vnion of amity, the coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of conſent. Such a like coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is vnderſtood, where it is ſaid,
<hi>the multitude of them, that belieued,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4. 32.</note> 
               <hi>were
of one heart, and of one ſoule.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the communion iſſuing of this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
behold the goodly fruit of this
their godly coniunction by their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
charitie, an effect indeed of their
vnion with Chriſt himſelfe; <hi>Neither
ſaid any of them, that ought of the things,
which he poſſeſſed, was his owne: but they
had all things common.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For true loue rauiſhes the louer, and
tranſports him out of himſelfe into his
loue, and makes him to communicate
and diſtribute himſelfe and his vnto his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1404:9"/>
beloued for his good: whence it is
truely ſaid, that among true friends
and louers all things are in common.</p>
            <p>Now ſure it is that there is a league
of loue and friendſhip between Chriſt
and all true Chriſtian people.<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 14. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I haue
called you friends,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and ye are
my friends, if yee doe whatſoeuer I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
you.</hi> And by reaſon of Chriſts
loue to them, and of their loue to
Chriſt (ſpringing from him, as water
from a fountaine) Chriſt and they are
vnited and ioyned together in one,
like louing friends, one of them ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored
with the other, he delighting in
them, and they in him, he ſeeking their
glorie, and they his. For as hatred
parts thoſe, that are vnited, ſo true loue
vnites them, that were diuided, it
conioyneth ſoules, and cauſeth true
contentment and delight among
thoſe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 5.</note> that it hath vnited, and makes
them to ſeeke one another, and not
themſelues, or their owne thinges
onely.</p>
            <p>But yet this is not all the Coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that is betwixt Chriſt and his
Church, and the true members of it.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1404:10"/>
A friend cannot do that for his friend,
that Chriſt doth for vs, who giues vs
his very Spirit,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 17.</note> the Spirit of truth, who
dwelleth with vs, and abideth in vs:
who himſelfe alſo is in vs, as an helper
and vpholder: and from whoſe aide
and preſence no diſtance of place, or
fury of the enemie can diſioyne vs:
and from whoſe very ſacred body alſo
we ſucke that nurriture, which doth
not onely refreſh and comfort vs (as
meat doth a mans body) but as a true
caeleſtiall and liſe-giuing <hi>cordiall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires
and preſerues the <hi>ſupernaturall
ſappe</hi> of the ſoule, the <hi>radicall humour of
grace</hi> infuſed into our hearts in our
conuerſion, that tho there may bee a
ſeparation made of ſoule and body, yet
there ſhall bee no totall ſeparation of
the ſoule from God.</p>
            <p>Friends may dye, muſt die. They
are but men, and men muſt die. Duſt
we are, and to duſt we muſt returne.
Wee and our friendſhips too muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
We are ſeene a while, and after a
while wee are ſeene no more, but fall
like drops of raine into the ſea, and are
knowne no more. And oftentimes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1404:10"/>
friends fall flat out, and end their
friendſhippes before they end them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
But Chriſt and his faithfull
friends doe neuer part, the graue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
part them, neither can any ſuch
vnkindneſſe happen betweene them,
but that they may and ſhall bee recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
            <p>And whereas many men will ſhake
of their friends and acquaintance, if
they grow poore and needy, the Lord
Ieſus, tho now at the right hand of the
Father, farre aboue all Powers and
Maieſties, doth take great delight in
all thoſe, whom he hath vnited to him,
how poore or meane ſoeuer, and is a
Cheriſher of them in all their wants,
yes is troubled with them in all their
troubles, afflicted in all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and accounts himſelfe the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
when any of his poore friends are
relieued, entertained, honored. But I
paſſe on further.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Soule</hi> and body of a man are
ioyned together to make a true and
perfit man. For neither the ſoule alone,
nor the body alone, but the ſoule and
body together doe make a perfit man:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1404:11"/>
as neither the King alone by himſelfe,
nor the people alone by themſelues,
doe make the Kingdome, but the King
and the people ioyntly together. But
the coniunction of Chriſt and of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
is not of the ſame kinde.</p>
            <p>For the vnion of ſoule and body is
naturall: but our vnion with Chriſt is
ſupernaturall.</p>
            <p>The ſoule is not giuen a man in the
very act or inſtant of generation: but
afterwards, when there is ſome organ
or organs fitted for it: but Chriſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a man in the very act and article of
regeneration.</p>
            <p>The ſoule is created by God in the
body, and to euery particular body
there is a particular ſoule. For though
all mens ſoules are one in kinde, yet
they are not one in number, but haue
their numericall and particular diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.
But there are not ſo many
Chriſts, as men. There is but one
Chriſt in all belieuers. And although
Chriſt may truely in the Apoſtles ſenſe
be ſaid to be formed in vs,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note> which is
when we are reformed, and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to him, yet we muſt beware
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1404:11"/>
we do not thinke him to be formed in
vs as the ſoule is, which is formed
wholy at once, and not by degrees,
and is ſo formed in vs, as that it is not
out of vs, nor in any other body, and
did not ſubſiſt out of vs before it was
created in vs.</p>
            <p>The ſoule now framed, and being
by nature immortal is vnited to a fraile
and corruptible body, and enters vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
it with condition to depart againe
and leaue it, when God ſhall pleaſe:
but Chriſt comes not into vs vpon the
ſame tearmes, but taries with vs, and
abides in vs for euer. Hee takes the
ſoule into an heauenly manſion, where
it forſakes her earthly Tabernacle, and
forgets not our duſt, our leſſe then
duſt, which we leaue behinde vs, but
ſees it alwaies, is mindfull of it, and can
diſtinguiſh it from the duſt of beaſts,
of Reprobates, and will againe one day
blow vpon it, and make it liue againe.</p>
            <p>And whereas the ſoule and body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
knit together make one and the
ſelfe ſame perſon, ſo that the ſoule is
not one perſon, and the body another
perſon. For in a man there is (<hi>aliud &amp;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1404:12"/>
aliud, but not alius &amp; alius</hi>) diuerſitie of
natures, but no diſtinction or diuiſion
of perſon. Our Lord Chriſt Ieſus is a
diſtinct, compleat, and abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſubſiſting by himſelfe: and there
are as many diſtinct and particular
perſons of Chriſtians, as there are
Chriſtians, euery man being a diſtinct
and perfit perſon by himſelfe, as Chriſt
is by himſelfe. Indeed he and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
make but one entire myſticall
bodie, and wheras euery man ſuſteines
himſelfe, I confeſſe that Chriſt doth
vp-beare vs all with his grace &amp; power,
as a goodly Oake or Cedar doth her
branches, or as a foundation and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
do the building of ſtones, &amp; tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and other materialls, that are laide
vpon them.</p>
            <p>Chriſt (as the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 5. 1 Iohn 5. 20.</note> S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doe teach vs) is <hi>very God,
God ouer all, bleſſed for ever.</hi> Now to
Chriſt, as God, the great Creator and
Vpholder of all things,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 3. Heb. 1. 3.</note> by whom all
things were made, who vpholdeth all
things with the word of his power, All
things created are vnited (<hi>vnione depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantia</hi>)
with the vnion of dependance,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1404:12"/>
without the which nothing that is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
can laſt a moment. But as the
light depends vpon the Sunne, and is
after a ſort ioyned to it, ſo that if any
thing ſhould come betweene the light
and the Sunne, which is the fountaine
of light, the light would inſtantly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and there would bee nothing but
very darkeneſſe: and as in this Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme
of man the liuer is the ſource of
bloud, and the ſpring, by which it is
diſfuſed by veines throughout the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
and the heart is the fountaine of
the vitall ſpirits, which are thence by
arteries carried into the body, as neede
requireth: or as the head is the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of the nerues or ſinewes, by the
which motion is cauſed, ſo that if any
thing ſhould come betweene the liuer
and the veines, the heart and the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
the head and the ſinewes, that
they ſhould bee parted, of neceſſitie
bloud, ſpirits, motion, and life it ſelfe
muſt preſently decay and faile: euen
ſo all creatures in the world depend on
Chriſt, as God, and are ſo vnited to
him, that they cannot be without him:
ſo that if any thing could come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1404:13"/>
him and them, which might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their dependance on him, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
with him, they could not but
vaniſh as light, and bee brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
The very duſt of dead men
would not be duſt, but would preſently
periſh, were it not vpheld by the power
of his word. But the godly are vnited
to Chriſt more bleſſedly then thus on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For euen beaſts, yea and the Diuels
themſelues, and all damned ſoules are
thus coupled with him and depend
vpon him. Without this kinde of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they were not able to ſubſiſt the
twinckling of an eye, but muſt needes
periſh, vaniſh, and come to nothing.</p>
            <p>This therefore is not the vnion wee
treat of, which makes a man, that is, to
be well: it preſuppoſes being, but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
bleſſedneſſe: it findes nature, but
giues grace: it meets with a man, but
it makes a Saint: it finds him on earth,
but brings him to heauen: it findes
him poore, naked, wounded, ſicke and
ſuccourleſſe, but it giues him riches,
garments, ſoundneſſe, health and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
which ſhall not bee taken away
from him, whether hee will, or no, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1404:13"/>
his body, goods, good name, life, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and ſuch tranſitory and glaſſie
things, ouer which fire, water, earth,
ayre, beaſts, men, and Diuells haue a
tyrannizing power, when God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</p>
            <p>But beſides this vnion of vniuerſall
Dependance there is alſo another kind
of Coniunction, whereby not onely
all Chriſtians, but all other men alſo,
yea and all the creatures in the world
are vnited or ioyned vnto Chriſt, as
God.</p>
            <p>For the Deity by reaſon of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſitie
and ſubtilty thereof is moſt
fully, and moſt inwardly, totally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in, and to, and throughout all
creatures corporall and ſpirituall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
all things, but comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of nothing, piercing all things, but
pierced of nothing; and is farre more
thoroughly preſent, and more fully,
then either light, or heate, is in the aire,
or then the ſoule is in the body. So
that if that ſhould bee, which yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, that is to ſay, if the creature
did not depend on Chriſt, yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the all-piercing ſubtilneſſe, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1404:14"/>
vnmeaſureableneſſe of his Godhead,
he ſhould penetrate and fill all things
(it ſelfe being fill'd of nothing) and be
moſt inwardly and thoroughly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
vnto them, and ſo be in ſome ſort
conioyned with them. But this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
is common: that of true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Chriſtians and Chriſt Ieſus is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,
and proper to them.</p>
            <p>This Coniunction is of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to Chriſt, as God: but the other is
of man to Chriſt, God-Man, or Man-God,
&amp; Mediator betwixt God &amp; man.</p>
            <p>Here Chriſt is preſent by a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and thorough penetration, his
very Deity incloſing, touching and
piercing all things. But there hee is
preſent by the preſence of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
grace, yea and his very fleſh is not
away, or wanting, but preſent, as I
will declare hereafter.</p>
            <p>The Coniunction, which is by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration
and omni-preſence, makes
no man happy, as the other doth:
with the which whoſoeuer is vnited
vnto Chriſt, he is certainely in the ſtate
of grace, and liues in ſure hope of the
ſtate of glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1404:14"/>
And whereas the vnion of Chriſt
and a Chriſtian is indeed a true and
certaine vnion, and may properly bee
ſo called; this Coniunction by pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
and preſence doth not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conteine any vnion, but onely vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
indiſtancy, and an inſenſible,
but thorough, repletion of all things.</p>
            <p>There are not two Chriſts, but one:
and this one Chriſt hath two diſtinct
natures in him; one <hi>Diuine,</hi> the other
<hi>Humane:</hi> and both theſe names are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
together in one and the ſame
perſon by a perſonall vnion.</p>
            <p>But we are not ſo vnited to Chriſt,
as our nature is to the nature of God
in Chriſt. (I call Chriſts humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>ours,</hi> becauſe it is indeed ours, <hi>not
in number the ſame with any mans, but
in kinde the ſame with all mens,</hi> indued
with a true humane ſoule and body,
not being created a new of nothing,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. Heb. 2. 16. Luke 3.</note> or from another peece of clay, but
made of a woman, who came from the
loynes of <hi>Adam.</hi>)</p>
            <p>For by the vertue of this vnion,
which is <hi>Hypoſtaticall,</hi> God is man, &amp;
man is God. But if Chriſtians were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1404:15"/>
perſonally to Chriſt, then the
very name of Chriſt and God ſhould
be giuen to them, which were abſurd
to think. And which were very groſſe
and horrible, then alſo God might bee
as truely and as orthodoxally ſaid to
ſinne, when a Chriſtian man ſinned,
as it is ſaid that God died, was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and roſe againe, becauſe the man,
who is true God, in one perſon, our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt was crucified, died,
roſe againe.</p>
            <p>Though it be true that Ieſus, the
Sonne of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> be
the true and eternall Son of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and true God, yet it were falſe and
impious to ſay that the Church is the
eternall and true naturall Daughter of
God, or that euery true belieuer were
Gods naturall Son, or God, which yet
were ſo, if wee were perſonally vnited
to the Godhead.</p>
            <p>There are many <hi>Maries</hi> mothers:
but only the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of God. I doubt not but that
Chriſt is formed, and is in forming in
many a Ladies heart: but yet hee was
onely formed in that Ladies wombe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1404:15"/>
as a childe. Her childe onely is the
naturall Sonne of God, he onely is the
Word, the <hi>ſubſtantiall, the conſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and coeternall Word.</hi> But if we were
perſonally vnited to the Word, or to
the God head, or to both Godhead &amp;
Manhead in the Word, then might we
be called the Word of God, and God,
yea and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> might bee
ſaid to be our mother as well, as the
mother of God, yes and wee could not
but be full of merits, power, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
euen as Chriſt. But what pious
eare can indure to heare ſuch blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
Moreouer, though it be moſt
true,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 20.</note> which our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>I am in
my Father, and you in mee, and I in you:</hi>
yet wee muſt not thinke that wee are
hypoſtatically vnited vnto Chriſt, nor
that we are ſo in Chriſt, as Chriſt is in
his Father. This ſpeech therefore of
Chriſt muſt bee taken with a graine of
falt. <hi>For Chriſt is in his father, as being
of one and the ſelfe-ſame ſubſtance and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with his Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>being indeede the
brightneſſe of his glory, and the very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of his Perſon, and his true naturall
Sonne and ſubſtantiall image:</hi> but he is in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1404:16"/>
vs, as an helper, ayder, and ſuſteiner,
by whom we haue our ſpirituall being,
life, breath, ſenſe, and motion, and
who beares vs vp and feeds vs, as the
roote doth the body and branches of
a tree.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there is a certaine
vnion of the workeman and his toole,
of the hand and the inſtrument in it.
And thus by way of ſimilitude Chriſt
and all faithfull Chriſtians, who
are inſtruments of his praiſes, and
whom he holdeth in the right hand of
his power and protection, bearing
them as an Eagle doth her yong ones,
may be ſaid to be conioyned. And as
in an inſtrument of muſique tho one
winde giue a generall ſound, yet by
the diuerſity and diſequality of the
pipes and organes, all which the wind
filleth, the tones are varied: ſo though
one Chriſt be in all true Chriſtians, &amp;
one ſpirit be inſpired as a celeſtiall and
liuing winde into them all, yet they
differ in their tunes, actions, motions,
and iubilations, according to their
owne perſonall and particular capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and as the Spirit, who workes, not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1404:16"/>
as a naturall, but as a voluntary agent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
doth impart and diffuſe his grace.</p>
            <p>But whereas a ſword, lute, trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
and other inſtruments of Art, are
voide of life, Chriſtians are liuing and
breathing Organs, intellectuall, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and voluntary inſtruments for
Chriſt to worke with, and are liker a
mans hand, or other liue-member of
his body, then a ſword of ſteele, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſenſeleſſe and dead inſtrument,
voide of reaſon, ſenſe, life and will,
able to do no more, then it is made to
do by plaine force.</p>
            <p>And whereas the workeman doth
not, nor cannot alwaies make or mend
his toole, Chriſt doth alwaies both
make and mend his tooles. For wee
are his workemanſhip, <hi>Hee hath made
vs, and not we our ſelues.</hi> He that makes
himſelfe, is alwaies marr'd in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
And he, that teaches himſelfe,
hath a foole for his maſter.</p>
            <p>And whereas a workeman and his
tooles may part: how good or deare
ſo euer vnto him, hee may yet bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of them, and ſeparated from
them flat and full againſt his will, or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1404:17"/>
may looſe ſome one of them, or ſpoile
it through negligence or forgetfulnes,
or may throw them by, as being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with the vſe or bearing of them;
no ſuch miſchance and accident can
come to Chriſt againſt his will: hee
cannot looſe vs againſt his will, neither
is hee weary of vs, or careleſſe of our
good. Thoſe, which are his, he loues,
cheriſhes, delights in, preſerues, and
keepes faſt and ſafe for euer. But this
is not all.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a certaine Coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betweene brothers and ſiſters, and
ſuch, as are Coheires, or Partners in
ſome office: but this is either naturall,
or elſe legall, and politicall or ciuill.
But our Coniunction with Chriſt is
not naturall or ciuill, nor of humane
inſtitution, but ghoſtly, heauenly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible,
and aboue nature, either as it
was created, or as it is corrupted. And</p>
            <p>Though wee be the Heires of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 7.</note>
and heires <hi>annexed with Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> and be
called his <hi>Brethren,</hi> and therefore muſt
needes be coupled together,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 11. 12.</note> and haue
fellowſhip with him, yet we muſt not
imagine our vnion or communion to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1404:17"/>
be the ſame, that naturall brothers in
bloud haue, or which are partners of
the ſame office,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 7.</note> or inheritance. For he
is a naturall Heire, we are adopted by
grace. Indeed as he is man, he is heire
by the grace of hypoſtaticall vnion.
And that we are heires we are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnto him. For wee are Heires in
him, and by him, and not without
him, nor by our owne perſonall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Yea whatſoeuer we either are, or

yet are we no ſuch Kings and Prieſts,

and not bee like thoſe captious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

            <p>Brothers and ſiſters may die, ſhall
die: heires may fall out and vndoe one
another, or others may ſpoile their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:
and where many are heires,
their portions are the leſſe: ſome of
them may lacke and complaine of
neede. But Chriſt and his brethren,
cannot be parted, their portions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deſtroied, nor taken from them
their inheritance cannot faile, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1404:18"/>
them: but euery one of them
ſhall haue enough, and ſhall enioy it
for euer.</p>
            <p>But there is yet a neerer coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then this of Brothers or Partners,
which is the holy, honourable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable
coniunction of man and wife.</p>
            <p>By this matrimoniall coniunction,
they that were two before, are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>One.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth:</hi> 19: 6.</note> They are <hi>no longer twaine,
but one fleſh,</hi> ſaith our Maſter:</p>
            <p>And they are tuely one, and not
two, becauſe GOD the Author of
man and marriage hath ſayde it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leaue his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his mother,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Geneſ:</hi> 2: 24. <hi>Matth:</hi> 19: 5.</note> 
               <hi>and ſhall cleaue vnto
his wife: and they two ſhall bee one fleſh.</hi>
So that though all men ſhould ſay that
they are not one, but two, yea though
they themſelues ſhould ſay ſo too, yet
they are not therefore two, becauſe
man ſayes ſo: but one, becauſe God
hath ſayd it.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Non noſtrum dicere dat veritatem
rebus, ſed conforinit as eius cum mente di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinâ,</hi>
things are not ſo and ſo, becauſe
men ſay they are ſo: but becauſe they
are ſo with God, in Gods ordinance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1404:19"/>
and appoyntment.</p>
            <p>Though all men ſhould ſay golde
were not golde, yet it is golde. And
though all the Gold-ſmiths in the
world ſhould ſay copper is gold, yet it
is not golde for all their ſaying, but
copper ſtill, becauſe it agrees not with
the diuine minde, God hath not ſayd it
is gold, it is not gold in his decree and
iudgement, and therfore it is not gold.</p>
            <p>Well then, man and wife are but one,
and not two. Yes, they are two diſtinct
perſons, and not one. They haue two
ſoules, and not one: two bodies, and
not one: two diſtinct wils and not only
one. They are of two different ſexes,
and haue their owne perſonall vertues
and infirmities, <hi>He his, and She hers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet neuertheleſſe theſe two are
made one matrimoniall creature, the
man being as head, and the woman as
the body; or if you will, he being as the
Soule,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11: 3.</note> and ſhe the Body. For as Chriſt
is the head of the man, ſo man is the
head of the woman. And this is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of authority and dominion, in
which regard Chriſt is not the wiues
head, but the husbands, neither is ſhee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1404:19"/>
the image of Chriſt, but he onely.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt is the head of the Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph:</hi> 5: 23.</note>
ſo the husband is the head of his wife.</p>
            <p>And as the ſoule and body, though
things greatly differing in themſelues,
are yet coupled together by God, and
doe liue and worke together: and as
two diſtinct<note n="*" place="margin">No ſimilitude runnes on all foure.</note> riuers meeting together,
doe now mingle and blend themſelues,
and become as one common water or
riuer: ſo man and wife are (indeede not
confounded, but) vnited together, liue
together vnder one roofe, draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one yoke, take care mutually of
one another, and become by Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
one foundation and fountaine
of generation.</p>
            <p>So that here is more then a coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of affections, as vſes to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
friends, as was betwixt <hi>Damon</hi>
and <hi>Pythias:</hi> there is alſo a coniunction
of bodies, for the propagation and
perpetuation of mankinde, and that
there might alſo be a way made for the
fulfilling of the number of Chriſts my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
members, Gods adopted ſonnes
and daughters.</p>
            <p>For generation muſt goe before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1404:20"/>
and nature before grace.
Yes ſanctification muſt follow ſinne.
For Chriſt came not to call the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but ſinners to repentance: neither
did hee die for the iuſt, but for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt.
There muſt firſt bee a man, and
then a Chriſtian: firſt a ſinner, and
then a Saint: <hi>filius ſoli,</hi> before there be
<hi>filius poli:</hi> one of <hi>Adams</hi> planting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there be one of Chriſts tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
one of <hi>Eues</hi> breeding, before
there be one of the Churches bearing.</p>
            <p>Now without doubt our Lord God
and Sauiour, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
hath contracted and vnited himſelfe
vnto his people,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eoſ:</hi> 2: 19: 20.</note> and is their head and
louing husband. And therefore the
Apoſtle tels the Corinths that hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
them for <hi>one husband,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11: 2.</note> 
               <hi>to preſent
them as a pure virgine vnto Chriſt.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> is bold to ſay
that (<hi>Omnis anima aut Chriſts ſponſa,
aut diaboli adultera eſt,</hi> Euery ſoule of
man is either the ſpouſe of Chriſt, or
Diuels adultreſſe.</p>
            <p>And as in ſimple contract or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
there is a mutuall &amp; reciprocall
giuing &amp; taking made between man &amp;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1404:20"/>

and ſpirituall contract and coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betwixt Chriſt and all true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
there is a mutuall giuing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of each other.</p>
            <p>God giues his ſonne to vs, the ſonne
alſo giues himſelfe freely to vs: and
God giues vs alſo vnto his ſonne, as hee
did <hi>Eue</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> and wee alſo by his

               <hi>Willingly</hi> (I ſay)
<hi>God hauing giuen vs the will, who willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and of his owne accord ſent vs his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the promiſe made by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to her husband in the day of her
Marriage or Eſpouſals be worthily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Couenant of her God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prou:</hi> 2: 17.</note> as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſo called by the Holy Ghoſt, well
then and worthily may our vow and
promiſe made vnto Chriſt in our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
by which wee are engrafted into
him and coupled with him, bee called
the <hi>Couenant of our God,</hi> beeing made
not onely according to Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in his name and preſence,
but vnto him alſo, who himſelfe is
God, euen our God, who hath vpon his

               <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore alſo as the wife is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the name of her husband, and
no longer of her father: for to this new
eſtate belongs a new name: ſo when a
man hath ſeparated his ſoule from the
world, and hath put himſelfe into the
power of Chriſt, and hath ioyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vnto him, as a woman vnto her
husband, a new title belongs vnto him,
the name of Chriſt is now called vpon
him, and he is now no more to follow
the world, nor the carnall affections
and commands of olde <hi>Adam:</hi> but as
a wife muſt forſake father and mother,
and all, and cleaue vnto her husband
(<hi>For thy deſire</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to thy husband,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal: 45: 10. Gen: 3: 16.</note> 
               <hi>and he ſhall rule ouer

vnto Chriſt, muſt deny himſelfe,
his owne reaſon,<note place="margin">Pſal: 45: 10: 11 Matth: 16: 24.</note> and will, and worth,
and forſake the world, euen whatſoeuer
is oppoſite to the will of Chriſt. Hee
ſhould faſhion himſelfe vnto his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and cleaue vnto him, continuing
conſtant, as <hi>Penelope,</hi> and ſhould ſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1404:21"/>
chaſtely beare himſelfe, &amp; ſo diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that no other name might be iuſtly
caſt vpon him, but that hee might bee
called onely by the name of Chriſt,
whoſe hee is, and to whom alone hee
eſpouſed himſelfe.</p>
            <p>For no greater ſhame can befall a
wife, then to be called in contempt and
diſgrace by another mans name, and
not her husbands, which comes to
paſſe, when ſhe forſaketh the <hi>Guide of
her youth, and forgetteth and violateth the
couenant of her God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such goodly huſwiues were <hi>Meſſeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
the wife of Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> and
<hi>Marie</hi> of Arragon, wife to <hi>Otho</hi> the
third: but wee neede not goe ſo farre
to ſeeke ſuch weedes; they thriue too
well in euery Climate. But let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>
            <p>Albeit a woman bee allowed to
change her fathers name, when ſhee is
married, and to cleaue vnto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
yet ſhee may in no caſe change
her Chriſtian name: that ſhee muſt
hold faſt vnto death. Neither indeede
ſee wee any woman change or forſake
her name in Baptiſme (vnleſſe ſuch, as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1404:22"/>
turne Turkes and Apoſtataes) thereby
being inſtructed to bee faithfull vnto
Chriſt her heauenly husband, and to
weare his name as a garland of honour
vnto death. For ſhe is not married vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, as ſhee is to her Chriſtian
Husband, <hi>till death her doe part.</hi> For
death hath no power ouer Chriſt our
Lord, as it hath ouer vs his ſeruants,
who are but bubbles and breathes of
aire.</p>
            <p>And therefore though hee ſhould
change as many husbands, as She<note n="*" place="margin">This woman liued at Rome in the time of Damaſus and Ierom, and was at laſt married to a man, that had had twenty wiues before: and liuing to bury her, the people honoured him with a crowne of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</note>did,
who had (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth)
<hi>three and twenty,</hi> and ſo likewiſe be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by as many names, yet ſhee muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
remember to keepe faſt the Name
and Faith of Chriſt, and beware ſhee
make no change of him for Idols, like
<hi>Glaucus,</hi> that changed golden armour
with <hi>Diomedes</hi> for brazen, that ſo
Chriſt may delight in her, and in her
vertue, which (as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
faith) is the true beauty of the Soule.
For he is her Lord God, and moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
husband, in oppoſition to whom
ſhe muſt call no man husband, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
any man, nor any thing els
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1404:22"/>
in the whole world.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of this ſweet contract and
vnion of Chriſt and his Church, there
paſſe from them many louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and embraces, expreſſed by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to other really, as is euident by
thoſe patheticall paſſages of loue, that
are ſet downe in the Booke of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
(the Churches Loue ſong) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their loue to each other is moſt liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſcribed.</p>
            <p>But yet the Coniunction of man
and wife in holy matrimonie, comes
far ſhort of the coniunction of Chriſt
and his Church, and doth not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
expreſſe &amp; vnfold it to vs. For by
wedlock the man &amp; his wife are made
one fleſh: <hi>two</hi> (faith the Scripture) <hi>ſhall
be one fleſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 5.</note> But he that is ioyned to the
Lord,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> is <hi>one ſpirit,</hi> as the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.
Now all fleſh is graſſe (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
and all the glory of man
and woman,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 24</note> as fleſh and blood, is as
the flower of the graſſe, which fades
and fals away, before the graſſe it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe

            <p>
               <hi>Death ſeparateth the moſt louing

head, are free from either doing or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
ſuch barbarous cruelty betwixt

            <p>The Diuell and the World may

cannot be damned,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 2 5.</note> then not they, that
are ioyned to him, who died for them,
and roſe againe for their iuſtification.
And therefore wee may boldly ſay,
<hi>There is no condemnation to them, that
are in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Euery godly Chriſtian is endued, is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1404:24"/>

him as a wedding garment.<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 271</note>

nakedneſſe is couered, and are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
accepted of God as beautifull
and gracious, in the beauty and grace
of Ieſus Chriſt, in which they ſtand and
appeare moſt ſweet and amiable. Now
if ſuch a man can bee damned, being
lapped and wrapped vp in Chriſt, who
couers him from top to toe, them muſt
Chriſt needes bee damned with him
(which cannot bee) as a man that is
flung in the fire with his clothes on, is
burnt together with them.</p>
            <p>Many men in marrying make very
dangerous aduentures. They venture
their name, their peace, their goods,
their ſoundneſſe, yea and ſometimes
their ſoules too; for which reſpect God
forbad his people to marry with the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1404:24"/>
Heathen, for feare they ſhould turne
them from God to Idols. And this is
the caſe of many women alſo, who by
their marriages doe buy themſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and ſorrow, that whereas it is
ſayd of <hi>Iepthaes</hi> daughter,<note place="margin">Iudg. 11. 38.</note> that ſhe went
out to bewaile the daies of her <hi>virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
they may goe out and bewaile the
daies of their <hi>mariage,</hi> and that not for
<hi>two moneths only,</hi> but perchance as long
<hi>as they liue.</hi> It is good for them therfore
to look before they leap, and to ſound
before they ſaile. But men by ioyning
themſelues to Chriſt venture nothing,
loſe nothing: or if they doe loſe, they
gaine by their loſſes, and are enriched
by their calamity.<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake

            <p>Many ſore vnkindneſſes, heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and quarrels doe now and then
fall out betwixt many men and their
wiues, that ſometimes they euen loth
one another, and forſake one another.
But Chriſt neuer forſakes his Spouſe,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1404:25"/>
nor ſhee him.<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 6.</note> Hee is with her,
to ſaue, protect,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 20.</note> aſſiſt and guide her to day, and
for euer. He loueth all thoſe which are
his,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 1.</note> vnto the end he loueth them. His
couenant with them is euerlaſting.<note place="margin">Ier. 32 39. 41.</note> He
will neuer turne away from them to do
them good: but he will delight in them
to do them good, and will put his feare
into their hearts, that they ſhall not
depart from him. Hee will giue them
one heart and one way, that they may
feare him for euer. And if at any time
they ſhall fall, hee will lift them vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
as he did <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter:</hi> and
though hee doe ſometimes chaſtize
them, yet hee will not remooue his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
kindueſſe from them.</p>
            <p>Men and their wiues are ſometimes
clouen-hearted hypocrites vnto God,
and hollow-hearted one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
inconſtant, vneuen, and like the

an aſſe.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 22. Cant. 6. 8. 9. &amp; 7. 10.</note> But Chriſt and his Spouſe are
true-hearted, and holy. All the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
and true members of the true
Church,<note place="margin">Epheſ 5. 26. 27. 1 Cor. 6. 11. Reuel. 1. 5.</note> are <hi>true Saints,</hi> iuſtified and

            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1404:25"/>
Euery perſon married is not a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church, hath not the
Church for a mother: but euery one,
whether wedded or ſingle, that is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ioyned vnto Chriſt, may iuſtly call
the true Church, Mother, and the
true God, Father.</p>
            <p>Euery man and his wife are indeed
partakers of the nature of man: but
euery true Chriſtian, who is borne of
God, and is the Sonne of God, and is
eſpouſed and vnited vnto Chriſt, is
partaker of the <hi>Diuine nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> which
many a man, and his wife too, are void
of, being not the children of God, but
the ſonnes of <hi>Belial:</hi> not the members
of Chriſt, but the very limmes of the
Diuell.</p>
            <p>But yet the Churches true children,
true Chriſtian belieuers, are not ſo, in
that manner and meaſure, partakers of
the diuine nature with Chriſt, as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are partakers of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with men, as I haue ſufficiently
before declared. And beſides, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences

belong to all Chriſtians, who are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the diuine nature, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
conſolation, aſſiſtance, and holy,
happy, and ſauing operations: and are
indeed indued with a new nature,
which may be call'd diuine, becauſe it
is from Gods ſpeciall grace, and is for
his honour and glory, is according to
his will, and is oppoſite to that vicious
and ſinfull worke of the Deuill, which
hath corrupted the nature of man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the image of God, according
to which he was created. For ſure it is,
if any man be in Chriſt, hee is a new
creature, a diuine creature, the worke
of Heauen. The diuell (who raignes
in moe, then in vnmarried people) is
expulſed out of him, the ſpirit of God
is inſpired into him, and a new ſpirit,
another heart, a better heart is giuen
him: which ſpirit a woman hath not,
becauſe this or that man hath married
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1404:26"/>
her, but becauſe ſhee is ioyned vnto
Chriſt, who hath giuen himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her.</p>
            <p>There are ſome men, that neuer
truely loued their wiues, but their
wiues wealth, not <hi>Them,</hi> but <hi>Theirs.</hi>
For their riches they tooke them, and
when once they became Maſters of
them, they cared no longer for them.
And ſuch vſually proue thoſe young
ſprigges, that are grafted into olde
ſtockes. Vnhappy women, who loue,
but are not loued againe! But they
more vnhappy, who in their elder
daies, when their wombes are dead
doe giue the reines to luſt, dreaming
and doting after youthes, when they
ſhould rather bee preparing and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
themſelues for Chriſt, their
thoughts being aſcended higher then

mounting vp into the higheſt heauens,
where are perfect pleaſures, pure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
immortall ioyes, and euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contentment. But Chriſt loueth
his Church truely, expreſſing his loue
to her,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 25.</note> by laying downe his life for
her. He was ſo deſirous to clenſe her,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1404:27"/>
that he ſpared not his owne bloud, his
beſt bloud,<note place="margin">Reuel. 1. 5.</note> his heart bloud, but waſht
her in it. Here was loue indeed. Hee
did not loue her, becauſe ſhe was faire,
or rich: for ſhe was of her ſelfe (till he
came &amp; preuented her with his grace,
and made loue to her) poore, naked,
polluted,<note place="margin">Izek. 16.</note> wretched, and inglorious:
but by his loue he hath made her loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and louing: by his ornaments hee
hath made her ſhining: by his purity
he hath made her cleane: by his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
he hath made her gracious: and
with his bleſſedneſſe ſhee is made an
happy woman.</p>
            <p>She was once as blacke as pitch:
but ſhee is now as white as the driuen

               <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of broydred gold.</hi>
She is ſo faire and louely in his eye, as
that his loue will ſuffer him to ſpie no

no iniquitie in Iacob, nor tranſgreſſion in

Behold his owne ſpeeches of her prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

            <p>
               <hi>Yea to expreſſe his full contentment

thou haſt wounded mine heart: thou haſt
wounded mine heart with one of thine eies,
and with a chaine of thy necke. My Siſter,
my Spouſe, how faire is thy loue! How
much better is thy loue, then wine, and the
ſauour of thine ointments, then all ſpices?
Thy lips, my Spouſe, drop as hony-combes:
hony and milke are vnder thy tongue, and
the ſauour of thy garments is as the ſauour

            <p>It is certaine that the power of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
appertaines vnto the Husband:
but yet ſometimes hee wants wit to
rule himſelfe: and ſome wiues are now
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1404:28"/>
and then ſicke of the <hi>vnruly euill,</hi> being
very thwart, and fooliſh.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt being the Wiſedome of
God, and the very fountaine of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and commiſerations, performes
the office of a wiſe and tender-hearted
Husband alwaies to his Church, his
Spouſe, which is not moroſe, ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and vnruly, but humble, gentle,
and obedient. And therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
exhorting women to be ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
to their Husbands, propoundes
vnto them the example of the Spouſe
of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>as the
Church is ſubiect vnto Chriſt, ſo let the
wiues bee to their owne husbands euery
thing.</hi> And when he would perſwade
the men to loue their wiues,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25. 29.</note> and to vſe
them tenderly, hee prouokes them to
it by the practiſe of Chriſt, who loues
the Church, and nouriſhes and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
it, as a man his owne fleſh.</p>
            <p>It is allowed to one man to haue
one wife at once, and no more then
one. For God gaue <hi>Adam</hi> but one.
Though he had abundance of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 15.</note>
yet he made but one, but one woman
of one ribbe, for the helpe, comfort,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1404:28"/>
and contentment of one man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſaith by his Prophet, <hi>keepe your
ſelues in your ſpirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 15.</note> that is, bridle your
affections, and keepe your ſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your compaſſe, <hi>and let none treſpaſſe
againſt the wife of his youth.</hi> Our Lord
likewiſe hath but one wife or Spouſe,
our Head hath but one Body. For
though euery godly man bee vnited
vnto Chriſt, and bee a member of his
body, yet all the godly in the world,
that either haue beene, are, or ſhalbe,
being all ioyntly conſidered together,
doe make that one and onely Spouſe
or wife of Chriſt, who ſhall raigne at
his right hand with him in all honour
and glory for euer and euer. This is
ſhe, that is his, and his onely, and no
others with him. This is his Doue,
his Loue, his louing Hinde, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Roe. Her eies doe hold him, her
breaſts doe ſatisfie him, her loue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
him, in her, and in her loue hee
delights continually.</p>
            <p>Yet truely may euery true Belieuer
ſay, Chriſt is my Head, Chriſt is my
Husband: for he is vnited to him. But
yet is Chriſt husband and head to one
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1404:29"/>
ſo, as he is Head and Husband to the
reſt: as <hi>Iacob</hi> was a father equally to all
his ſonnes: as a mans head is the head
of all his members, the feet as well, as
the hands: or as a King is head and
husband ciuill vnto all his Subiects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently,
without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt doth much more to the
Church, then the Husband can vnto
his Wife. A man may, as our Seruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke
ſpeakes, <hi>worſhip his wife with his
body,</hi> that is, hee may honour her with
his body, which hee doth in that hee
doth appropriate it to her, making her
the Miſtris of it: for as the Apoſtle
ſheweth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the Husband hath not the
power of his owne bodie, but the wife.</hi> But
no man is able to giue his wife his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
or ſoule. Though a man and his
wife may liue ſo louingly and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
together, ſpecially a time, as that
a body would almoſt thinke and ſay
there were but one ſoule in both their
bodies: yet in truth each of them haue
their owne priuate ſpirits; the mans
ſoule is not in the woman, nor the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
in the man. His animates and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1404:29"/>
poſſeſſes him, and hers animates and
poſſeſſes her, one of them truely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from the other, not in kinde,
but in number, not in ſubſtance, but in
accidents.</p>
            <p>But our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
his Spirit on his Church. She
liues not by her owne life, but by his
life. She is not ruled by her owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but by his Spirit. Yes, euery man
vnited to Chriſt hath the Spirit of
Chriſt. The very ſoule of man is not
more common to all his members,
then the holy Ghoſt is to all the godly.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome mens wiues
haue beene (and I would none were
now) poſſeſſed with an euill Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very torments and trouble houſes:
the Spouſe of Chriſt is poſſeſſed with
the good Spirit of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> which is the
Spirit of peace, gentleneſſe and loue, who ſuſteines, comforts, inſtructs,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1</note> &amp;
leades her, and dwelleth with all thoſe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2. 27.</note>
that can truly call her <hi>Mother.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There is a certaine tranſcendent and
ſtrong coherence betwixt Chriſt and
his Church. He cleaueth to her, as an
husband to his wife; and ſhee to him,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1404:30"/>
as a wife to her husband: but yet ſo,
as that one of them cannot be broken
from the other, one of them cannot be
abſent from the other, no diſtance of
place, nor croſſeneſſe of winde and
weather, nor any perturbations of
minde, being able to diuide or diuell
them, as they may doe a man and his
wife.</p>
            <p>An husband may bee in <hi>Italy,</hi> and
his wife in <hi>England:</hi> and when hee is
there, hee is not with her here. And
while ſhee is here, ſhe is not with him
there: but one of them (both being
definite and circumſcriptible) is abſent
from the other. But (<hi>Chriſtus eſt totus
in toto corpore Eccleſiae, &amp; totus in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
eius parte</hi>) Chriſt is whole with the
whole Church, and whole with euery
part of the Church, as touching his
perſon, which can no way diuide it
ſelfe, or be poſſeſt by degrees or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is no where, neuer, abſent
from any godly Chriſtian: but is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with him in all places, with his
light he ſees, with his grace he is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
with his Spirit hee is reuiued and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1404:30"/>
comforted, which Spirit reſideth in
him alwaies, and worketh in him real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though not alwaies ſenſibly. Hee
worketh in him, I ſay, yet not as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
but as an artizan: not as a
ſeruant, but as a maſter: nor as the
Sunne or Moone, which are naturall
Agents, but as a voluntary Motor or
workeman, according to his will, in
which he is one with Chriſt, who ſends
him.</p>
            <p>There is many a true ſoule, which
puts her truſt in her husband, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
vpon his honeſty and faith, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abſent from him is deceiued, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
miſ-vſed, by reaſon of his vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and inſatiate ſpirit, and ſometimes
is left in ſcorne, and turned of at ſixe
and ſeauens. But Chriſt is faſt and
faithfull, conſtant and true, plaies not
faſt and looſe, as incontinent and goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Carnaliſts: and being ſtill preſent
with his Church is a <hi>wall of fire</hi> round
about her, a ſhaddow againſt the heat,
a fountaine againſt her thirſt, an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
againſt poyſon, friend in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
a treaſure of all good thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
want, an impenetrable Buckler
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1404:31"/>
to all thoſe, that put their confidence
in him. He,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 6.</note> that belieueth in him, ſhall
not bee aſhamed. Whereas many a
poore woman is aſhamed of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and confounded in her ſelfe,
being euen at her wits end, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which way to turne her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>We haue a By-word, <hi>Out of ſight
and out of minde.</hi> And indeede it falls
out often twixt man and wife, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and diſtance make them forget
each other, or not ſo mindfull, as they
ſhould bee. But the Church is neuer
out of Chriſts ſight, neuer out of his
hand, neuer out of his heart. Can a
woman (trow ye) forget her childe?
can ſhe forget or not haue compaſſion
on the ſonne of her wombe? but ſay
ſhe ſhould,<note place="margin">Iſ. 49. 15. 16.</note> 
               <hi>yet will not Chriſt for get his
Church.</hi> Why? ſhe is ſet as a ſeale on
his heart, as a ſignet vpon his arme.
<hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I haue grauenthee vpon
the palme of mine hands: thy walls are

            </p>
            <p>Men muſt needes reſt themſelues
and ſleep (<hi>Quod caret alternâ requie,

breaſts: and in ſleepe much crueltie
(as Stories declare) haue been ſhewed
ſometimes againſt both them &amp; their
wiues. But the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the
great Keeper of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and husband of

<hi>Hee that keepeth thee,</hi>

for her good,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> and the good of all

            <p>But this is quite out of mans power.
He is vnable to turne all things to his

            <p>Hee can ſay vnto her, <hi>with all my

But how many ſoeuer,<note place="margin">2 Tim: 6. 17.</note> and how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,

The waking of the Prince defendeth the

their leyſure, his induſtry their delights,

are full of care and feare: and bee they
what they may be, they are ſubiect to

eternall, neuer to bee won from her by

it alwaies without feare or doubt.</p>
            <p>Yea euen in this life we haue ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as the world cannot affoord vnto

of God, pardon of our ſinnes, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and peace of a good conſcience,

of God is in vs, all things are cleane

            <p>

yours.</hi> And if all things be ours, then
nothing ſhall hurt vs, but all things
ſhall further vs. For ſeeing all things
are ours, it is meet that all things ſhold
co operate for our good. Yea the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
themſelues are ours, if wee be not
theirs, but Chriſts. Chriſt will ſo order
the matter that they ſhall but wreath
garlands of immortality for vs (though
ſore againſt their wils) and increaſe our

            <p>And whereas many men forget the

of their decency,<note place="margin">Lanquet. Chron</note> as <hi>Sergus</hi> that

his Wife, and held her ſo penurious,
that ſhee was driuen to ſerue other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

is ſo carefull ouer his Spouſe, who
<hi>ſtands at his right hand in gould of Ophir,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal: 45. 9.</note>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1404:33"/>
that rather then ſhee ſhall want atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and honour, he will moue euen
Kings to be her nouriſhers, &amp; Queens
her nurſes,<note place="margin">Iſ. 49. 23.</note> who ſhall bow downe vnto
her with their faces towards the earth,
and licke vp the duſt of her feete.</p>
            <p>The coniunction of Man and Wife
doth not neceſſarily cauſe eyther, or
both of them to bee piouſly diſpoſed:
For, as hee that toucheth pitch is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
defiled with it, and as ſweet riuers
running through fenniſh grounds are
thereby corrupted, ſo the company of
a wicked man doth oftentimes corrupt
the manners of a good natured wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
And although a man may take a
woman to his wife, yet it is not in his
hands to make her eyther a good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or a good Wife, if he finde her
naught. But our coniunction with
Chriſt doth chaunge vs all ouer, and
turnes vs vpſide downe: hee contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
and infects no man, hee cannot
but he purifies and makes good al that
come vnto him, and beſtow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vpon him.</p>
            <p>And albeit the Wife doth in ſome
ſort depend vpon her Husband, ſeeing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1404:34"/>
ſhe is vnited to him, and is his: yet if
that knot were diſſolued, either by iuſt
diuorce, or death, it might fall out that
ſhee might liue ſtill as well, and bee as
godly as ſhe <hi>was before.</hi> For neither her
<hi>Vertues, nor her life,</hi> depends on him,
nor vpon his life, neither yet her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
alway, nor her good ſucceſſe
it'h world. She may find better friends
then her Husband was: or ſhee may be
married to a <hi>ſecond Huſband,</hi> in whom
ſhee may be happier by far, then in her
firſt. But the Church and all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
doe ſo depend on Chriſt, that
without him they cannot continue a
moment: for by him we liue, &amp; moue,
and haue our being, and all our well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being,
both as wee be men, and as wee
are Chriſtian men.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> From him we haue
our ſelues, our iuſtice, holineſſe, and all
our happineſſe. In him wee are<note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ: 1. 4.</note> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
in him<note n="b" place="margin">Epheſ: 2. 10.</note> created, by him<note n="c" place="margin">Col. 1. 14.</note> redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and<note n="d" place="margin">Iude 1. Iohn 15. 12.</note> preſerued. <hi>Without me</hi> (ſaith
Chriſt) <hi>ye can doe nothing;</hi> and ſo alſo
without Chriſt wee can be nothing. If
ſomething, yet that ſomething, that's
worſe then nothing; for nothing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſinne, and nothing cannot ſuffer
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1404:34"/>
for ſinne. Nothing can doe no wrong,
and nothing can feele no paine. It were
more profitable for a man not to bee,
then to be a man out of Chriſt. Though
hee were married to the beſt woman in
the world, though hee were coupled
with the beſt friends i'th world, though
he were ioyned in bloud or alliance to
the cheefeſt Monarchs in the world,
though hee were poſſeſſed with the
greateſt and richeſt kinngdomes of the
world, yet if hee were not vnited to
Chriſt Ieſus, if hee were not poſſeſt of
him, he were nothing, he had nothing,
hee were more miſerable then the duſt
he treads on For Chriſt is all things,
he that hath Chriſt, lacks nothing: he
that wants Chriſt, hath nothing. A man
were better be nothing, then ſomething
hauing nothing. Who is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the worthineſſe of Chriſt Ieſus?
He is our life and our light, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and our crowne, our grace &amp; our
glory,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 11.</note> he is our <hi>all things:</hi> he that hath
him,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 12.</note> hath life (ſaies Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>but hee
that hath not him, hath not life.</hi> But had
I the tongues of Men and Angels, I
could not declare the praiſes due to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1404:35"/>
Chriſt Ieſus my Lord and Sauiour. If
all the water in the Maine were incke,
yet all that incke were not enough to
write downe his worthy praiſes.</p>
            <p>Common experience teacheth that
women feed their children, yea out of
their owne bodies,<note place="margin">Gen: 21. 7.</note> as <hi>Sarah</hi> did <hi>Iſaak</hi>
with her owne milke. And I haue read
of a woman, who gaue her owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſucke of her owne body, when ſhe
being in priſon was kept from meat:
and after ſuch a ſort a woman may
preſerue the life of her husband, a
while at leaſt: but did I neuer eyther
ſee, heare, or read of a man that fedde
and nouriſhed his wife of himſelfe. He
may bring her meat, but he is no meat,
hee makes not himſelfe a diſh to feede
on: he giues his wife his heart but not
as Hawkes-meat to prey on, not ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to liue on. But Chriſt Ieſus the
Husband of the Church, is alſo the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
food of our ſoules.<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 48.</note> 
               <hi>I am that bread
of life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 6. 50. 51. 56.</note> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I am the liuing
bread. The bread which I will giue, is my
fleſh. He which eateth my fleſh, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
my bloud, abideth in mee, and I in
him.</hi> Here is a louer indeed; the globe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1404:35"/>
we tread on, beares not a husband halfe
ſo kinde, nor all the Markets in the
world can afford ſuch meat, as here.
If there were but a Baker, which could
make ſuch bread for the body, to keep
it from death, men would to him, if he
were in the fartheſt angle of the earth,
Countries would goe together by the
eares to get and enioy him. I ſuppoſe
that if he had his choyce, hee would
rather chuſe to dye, then to liue. For
ſure, men would weare his fleſh to the
bones with labour, and would ſcarce
ſuffer him eyther to eate or ſleepe. But
what gaines a man by long life without
this Bread of Life, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus?</hi> The
Iudgement will come at length, and
ſhall not bee put off: and the longer a
ſinner hath liued, the more ſinnes hee
hath committed, the greater accounts
he muſt make, &amp; the greater torments
hee muſt indure. And what pleaſure;
thinke wee, will the ſoule then take to
be kept in the body (like a Priſoner in
a ſtrong Goale, vnder much pain, want,
and ſorrow) againſt her will, and not
to be able to get out, through ſhe would
begge it with flouds of teares continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1404:36"/>
ſtreaming from the eyes, and
would giue euen all the world, if ſhee
had it, if ſhee could but die, and come
to nothing?</p>
            <p>Our Lord, our Husband is better
bread then ſo. He is the bread of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life to all that are vnited to him,
and which feede vpon him. They,
whom he feeds vpon himſelfe, are ſafe
from ſtaruing, ſure enough from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
And. whereas other Bread
is turned and concocted in vs, the
truth is, <hi>This bread of life is not turned
in vs, not turned into the ſubſtance of our
ſoule or body: but it turnes and transforms
vs rather into it.</hi> For Chriſt doth ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphiſe
and alter a man, whom he
couples to himſelfe, that he doth put a
new life into him, hee giues him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinde of ſpirit, and doth ſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him with his owne things, that it
may be truly ſaid, <hi>Hee is a man tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and transformed into Chriſt: he is not
in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit: not Satan, but
Chriſt Ieſus doth dwell and raigne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him.</hi> O happy men, that are in Chriſt
Ieſus, that haue Chriſt Ieſus for their
Husband, who is the ſtaffe of their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1404:36"/>
liues, the breath of their noſtrills, and
their Hope! Many a man is ſaued, and
his wife damned. Two ſhall be in a bed,
one of them ſhall bee taken, the other
forſaken. But whoſeeuer ſhall be found
coupled to Chriſt ſhall bee ſaued. For
he is the bread of life, and life eternall
to all, that haue and hold him.</p>
            <p>There are ſome men (or I wot not
well what <hi>in the ſhapes of men</hi>) that waxe
weary of their wiues with a little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
contemne them in their
decaying dayes, and whether young
or olde, will not bee pleaſed in them
without a deale of artificiall brauery,
and borrowed fauour.</p>
            <p>But the Lord Ieſus eſteemes the hart
of a man, and not his Art: he delights
in ſubſtance, not in naked ſhewes: coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
vertue, which is true hypocriſie,
is accounted with him for double ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
It is not outward beauty that
he ſtands vpon, but inward Vertue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Trueth, and not outward trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings.
Painting of the face with him
is as the guilding of a nutmegge, or the
colouring of a ſtatue, and as pleaſing to
wiſe men when they ſpie it, as a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1404:37"/>
Sepulchre when they ſmell it, or as
counterfeit coyne, when they diſcerne
it. But grace, true grace, which is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
to a man or woman, is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to a true Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>This is that which pleaſeth Chriſt,
which hee with his owne finger hath
painted and engrauen in the ſoule.</p>
            <p>This, this is the tincture, and
the luſtre, that hee delights in. And
as for old age, hee will caſt no man off
for that: but the longer he hath beene
acquainted with any, the longer any
man hath liued in his ſeruice: the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that any haue beene coupled with
him, the more account he vſes to make
of them. Old friends, old ſeruants, old
followers, old conſorts, if ſincere and
truſty, are of all others moſt gracious,
and ſhall haue their rewards with the
chiefeſt.</p>
            <p>I ſaid before that the Husband and
his Wife are appointed by God to bee
one common fountaine and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Originall of Poſterity by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of children.</p>
            <p>For neither is the Man without the
Woman and efficient, nor the Woman
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1404:37"/>
without the Man. And neyther Man
nor Woman without the benignity of
the Sunne. For it is true that (<hi>Sol &amp;
homo generant hominem</hi>) the Sunne and
Man beget a Man.</p>
            <p>Our Lord, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
hath children, and no children, but
thoſe, which he gets himſelfe. But the
Sunne, which is a naturall agent, hath
no hand, helpeth nothing in <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which is ſupernaturall;</hi> as it doth
to Generation, which is naturall.</p>
            <p>And though a Man cannot beget
without a Woman, yet is Chriſt, God
and Man, able to regenerate a Man
without the cooperation of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by himſelfe alone. But yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
if not euer, he doth beget men
to himſelfe by the Church. For my
part, I am perſwaded that hee that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
call her Mother, hath no right to
call him Father. For Ieruſalem, the
City of God, whoſe Originall is from
Heauen aboue, and not from the earth
below,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 26.</note> 
               <hi>is the Mother of vs all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whereas the Mother nouriſhes
her childe with food from her owne
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1404:38"/>
bodie, the Church feedes her children
with the milk and meat of Gods word.
For the two Teſtaments are the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
two Breaſts.</p>
            <p>And as Parents beget children ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their owne image, that is,
men, and ſinfull, and doe ſometimes
alſo lend them their owne diſeaſes, as
Leproſie, Palſey, Gowt: ſo the Lord
Ieſus begets his children according to
his image (ſubſtantiall I meane not, but
accidentall) conſiſting in light, iuſtice,
holineſſe, and true Chriſtian Vertues.
Indeede our Parents beget vs, when
before we werenot: but Chriſt begets
vs, being men before, though in truth
but dead men, dead in ſinnes and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,
and the children of wrath.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1. 3.</note> And
as they giue vs their ſinne, which hath
beene deriued to them from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo
Chriſt giues vs his Iuſtice and Merits
to couer our ſinnes, as I ſhall afterwards
ſhew more fully.</p>
            <p>A Woman may be a Wife, and yet
no Mother: and ſome are Mothers and
yet no Wiues. Or ſhe may be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and yet an adultreſſe. But this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1404:38"/>
is a mans affliction, when either his
wife is barren or vnchaſte. And it is a
womans ſhame, when either ſhee is a
mother before ſhee bee a wife, or is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
when ſhee is a wife. But the
Church can haue no children but by
Chriſt her husband, without whoſe
gracious influence and intention, no
man can make a Chriſtian. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church (as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> well
obſerueth) <hi>is a Spouſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fulg. ad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam. do virgin. ep. 3.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe ſhe is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

becauſe ſhe is made fruitfull by Chriſt: and

            </p>
            <p>Shee is indeed a ſingular wife, of rare
endowments,<note place="margin">Pſal 45.</note> and full of honour.<note place="margin">Cant. 7. 1.</note> For
ſhee is the great <hi>kings Daughter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> and
coupled with him, that is <hi>God and
Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shee is not ſubiect to violence, as
the daughters and wiues of men are, as
<hi>Lucretia</hi> the <hi>wife</hi> of <hi>Collatinus; Dinah</hi>
the daughteer of <hi>Iacob;</hi> and they that
were rauiſht by <hi>Brias, Rodericus, Nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Cararius, Osbright,</hi> and ſuch like
monſters in the ſhapes of men. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
brings ſhee any children to God
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1404:39"/>
by any adulterous mixture (as ſome
wanton wiues) but onely by the grace
of her husband Ieſus Chriſt. As for
Heretiques and Infidels, they bee not
the fruits of her wombe, but Baſtards
of the Diuels getting, and the worlds
conceiuing and bringing foorth.</p>
            <p>Shee is an high and honourable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For ſhee is Mother and Nurſe
(no cruell ſtep-mother) but a louing
mother and tender-hearted nurſe to all
Gods adopted children. They that
haue not her for mother, haue not him
for Father. Shee is mother to all the
true members of Chriſt, to all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
They that haue not her for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
haue not him for their head and
elder brother.</p>
            <p>She is our ſpirituall mother <hi>Eue, the
mother of all the liuing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 26.</note> that either liue a
ſpirituiall life in this world, or ſhall liue
a celeſtall life in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Shee is the mother to all true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
according to the faith, as <hi>Sarah</hi>
was to all Iſraelites according to the
fleſh. And as God made <hi>Sarah</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and gaue her a ſonne out of his
owne good will: ſo God makes his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1404:39"/>
Church a mother, and giues her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>I read of a certaine Romane Lady,
by name <hi>Paulina,</hi> a very chaſte and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
matron, who by no meanes would
yeelde to the Iuſt of <hi>Mundus</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Rome, who attempted to haue
corrupt her, who yet being couzened
by certaine Prieſts lay with him (like a
ſuperſticious foole) in the Temple of
<hi>Iſis,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Anubis</hi> the God
of Aegypt, who deſired her company,
as thoſe varlets tolde her. And in thoſe
heatheniſh dayes it was accounted a
great fauour to haue to doe with a

            <p>But Gods Church is no <hi>Paulina,</hi>
yeeldes not to <hi>Mundus,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> but
is able to diſtinguiſh betwixt God and

of their fauour or dalliance with them.

Ieſus the Churches husband, a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
but more then a man, euen God

fruitfull, and to giue her children, when
he will, and children of a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and complexion, then husbands
giue their wiues,<note place="margin">Iob 25. 4.</note> which are wormes,
and worſe too, vncleane and wretched,
ſubiect to the wrath of God, and vnder
death.</p>
            <p>For all the children of the Church,
which ſhee beareth vnto Chriſt, are
cleane and happy, faire and louely, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with the holy Ghoſt, and clad
with Chriſt himſelfe, who is their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1404:40"/>
and enrobed with his iuſtice, as
with a garment rich enough to redeem
the world,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> in which appearing before
the great and righteous God, the Iudge
of all the world, they reioyce his heart,
and obtaine his bleſſing, as <hi>Iacob</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

him, which his mother had with her
in her houſe. Of ſuch bleſſed Parents
how can there be but bleſſed children?
O bleſſed, thrice bleſſed are all the
children of the Church: The children
of the greateſt Kings and Queenes in
the world are not to bee compared to
them; They are not worthy to bee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
together in one day. The truth is
they are but very wretches (how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſoeuer they bee in the world) till
they come and call her mother, and
become obedient to her.</p>
            <p>But be it that a woman be a wife vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her husband, and a mother too;
yet ſhee is not both houſwife and houſe
too. Men dwell with their wiues, but
not in their wiues, except by loue. But
the Catholique Church is Chriſts huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
and his houſe too, his <hi>Spouſe</hi> and

his <hi>Temple</hi> alſo.<note place="margin">2 Cor: 6: 16.</note>

alway preſident. To him this

A part of which princely Palace is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
godly Chriſtian, who as a liuing
ſtone is hewen out of that rocke of life,
Chriſt Ieſus, and by him made vp, and
put into that goodly building.</p>
            <p>So then, wheras many a poore child
which hath both father and mother, is
yet deſtitute oftentimes of a houſe to
put his head in, and is compelled to lie
vnder hedges and wals, or in the open
fields; there is not a true childe of
God, there is not a man aliue, if he bee
(<hi>filius Eccleſiae</hi>) the ſon of the Church,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1404:41"/>
but hee hath an houſe to reſt his ſoule
in; and ſo long as he is vnder the roofe
hee is ſafe from euill, being vnder the
Lords protection,<note place="margin">Pſal: 18: 30. Prou: 2. 7.</note> who is a ſure <hi>ſhield</hi>
and caſtle of defence, inuincible, vnbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable,
vnto all, that put their truſt in
him, and walke vprightly with him in
his houſe.</p>
            <p>But I will haſte a little faſter on. No
man makes his owne wife. For ſhee is
firſt, without him, a woman, before hee
take her to be with him, as his wife. It
is too much for a man to make a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(for ſome finde it too much to
mend a woman) ſo that he muſt let that
alone for euer, as a worke peculiar vnto
God. And though it be an eaſie matter
for a man to get himſelfe a wife, ſuch as
ſhee is: yet a good wife, a vertuous wife,
a prudent wife,<note place="margin">Prou: 31: 12.</note> one,<note place="margin">Prou: 18: 22.</note> that will doe her
husband good and not euill, all the
dayes of her life,<note place="margin">Prou: 19: 14.</note> is a bleſſing, that
comes from God. Parents can giue
nature, but God giues grace. They can
giue fleſh and blood, but vertue and
well doing are the gifts of God,<note place="margin">Iam: 1: 17.</note> who is
the fountaine and father of <hi>lights.</hi> And
it fals out ſometimes by the iniquity of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1404:42"/>
rigid and couetous parents, that a man
hath a wife thruſt vpon him, beeing
conſtrained to take her for auoyding
greater dangers and more greeuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils.
And when they haue them, they
loue them as men doe ſtraight ſhooes,
and clothes they care not for.</p>
            <p>But the Lord leſus hath no wife ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
on him againſt his will: neither
can any with ſubtill ſleights ſteale into
him, and goe beyond him, as ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
vſe to winne their husbands. But
hee takes, whom hee takes, willingly,
and makes the firſt motion of loue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
himſelfe: neither doth he cozen
or beguile any, but leads them on with
truths and ſollid demonſtrations, and
promiſes no more then he can and will
performe. Yea, he takes but what hee
made before. For all creatures haue
paſt through his hands, hee had the
forming of them all. And whom hee
makes his wife, hee does not marre in
the making (as ſometimes men doe) but
reformes and beautifies them: wheras
men ſometimes take vpon them (mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by worldly reſpects) to marry
ſome peruerſe, wicked, or ſuperſticious
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1404:42"/>
women, hoping, and now and then
bragging they will reforme them,
whereas commonly they buy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
too late, and in ſtead of mending
them are ſomtimes marr'd themſelues,
infected with their vices, as wine or
water with muſty veſſells.</p>
            <p>And whereas men doe not beget
their wiues, they meane to marry. For
men marry not with their daughters.
And ſure if <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Cyanippus</hi> had not
both beene drunke,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> their daughters
had not beene vitiated by them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had <hi>Valeria Thuſculana</hi> got the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
companie of her father, but
vnder the colour of another woman.
Which ſo ſoone, as hee did perceiue,
he kild himſelfe in deteſtation of the
fact.</p>
            <p>Euery Chriſtian ſoule (<hi>eſt filia &amp;
ſponſa Chriſti</hi>) is both the daughter &amp;
the Spouſe of Chriſt Ieſus, deſcended
from him, and vnited to him. Hee
weddeth none, but his owne, whom
hee doth himſelfe beget by the power
of his Spirit. There is none ioyned
to God, but he, that is borne of God.
The Spirit, which regenerates vs, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1404:43"/>
giues vs a new life, is the ſame, by
which we are coupled vnto Chriſt, and
by whoſe holy inſpirations faith and
loue are created in vs, whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
in Chriſt, embrace him, and are
transformed into him. The ſoule is
the life of the body, and Chriſt is the
true life of the ſoule, euen the ſoules
<hi>Soule:</hi> take away the ſoule from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the bodie dies, euen ſo take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the ſoule from Chriſt, or Chriſt
from the ſoule, and the ſoule will die.
In this caſe the body is but a liuing
and breathing Sepulchre of a dead
ſoule, a breathleſſe ſoule, the breath
whereof is the very <hi>breath of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eue</hi> may be ſome light herein vnto
vs. For <hi>Eue</hi> was made of <hi>Adam,</hi> who
ſeeing her ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen 2. 22. 23.</note> 
               <hi>This is now bone of my
bone, and fleſh of my fleſh:</hi> and ſo alſo we
are of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 30</note> 
               <hi>of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi>
as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. God hath
framed his Church out of the very
fleſh, the very wounded and bleeding
ſide of the ſon of man. To all thinges
liuing Chriſt is life, and to men light,
as hee is the ſonne of God: to the
Church both light and life eternall, by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1404:43"/>
being made the ſon of man for vs, &amp;
by being our Surety and Sauiour,
whether we reſpect him as God, or as
Man.</p>
            <p>His body crucified, and his bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
for the life of the world are the
<hi>true elements</hi> of our Chriſtian and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
being, which maketh vs truely
aliue and holy, as he is, of whom wee
come.</p>
            <p>And as by nature we are in our firſt
parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue:</hi> ſo by grace
we are euery one of vs, that are truely
ſpirituall, in Chriſt and in his Church.</p>
            <p>As men, we are all originally in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi>
as Chriſtians, or new men, we are
all originally in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As men, wee haue the nature and
bloud of <hi>Eue:</hi> as new men, or Saints,
wee are partakers of the Spirit of the
Church in her miniſtery by the gift
of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As we are men, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were
our Parents: but as we are regenerate,
ſo Chriſt is our father, and the Church
which ſprang out of his holy ſide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
vpon the croſſe, is our holy and
honorable mother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:1404:44"/>
And as <hi>Eue</hi> made not her ſelfe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was made or begotten by a man,
but by the hand of God, euen by the
hand of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.</note> by whom all things
were created: ſo the Church is not the
workemanſhippe of any creature, nor
of her owne making and moulding,
but is made and faſhioned by God,
<hi>whoſe workemanſhip wee are created in
Chriſt Ieſus vnto good workes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>which God
hath before ordained, that we ſhould walke
in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Adam</hi> had no ſtroke in <hi>Eues</hi>
making: ſhe was made out of him, but
yet without his helpe; of him, not by
him; of his ribbe, not by his hand.
But Chriſt hath a great ſtroke in the
framing of the Church. Shee is both
taken out of him, and made vp by
him: and without him ſhee could not
be formed.</p>
            <p>For by his will ſhe is, by his holy
<hi>breath</hi> ſhee's quickned, his finger
fram'd her, and his merits are her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Nay, not her ſelfe alone, but all
ſhe hath, that is good, ſhe hath receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him, of his fulneſſe. There is
not an ornament about her, but is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1404:44"/>
ſhee hath had of him. There is
not a pinne of her ſleeue, but hee hath
giuen it her.</p>
            <p>And tho God made <hi>Eue</hi> neither
witting, nor willing, yet he quickens
vs, reſtores and reformes vs, both wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and willing. He made vs without
vs, but hee doth not ſanctifie and ſaue
vs without vs.</p>
            <p>But it is hee, that makes vs willing
and obedient,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> being without his grace
vnwilling inough of our ſelues, dead in
our ſinnes and treſpaſſes, voide of a
true ſpirituall life and being. He both
giues vs feete and makes vs runne. He
giues vs hearing eares, and ſeeing eyes,
and makes vs heare and ſee. He opens
our mouthes, and makes vs ſpeake.
Hee vnties our bands, and makes vs
moue. We worke and worke willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but he giues vs hands to worke and
makes vs worke. Hee workes all our
workes for vs. Hee giues vs both the
will and the worke, and that of his
owne good will, without our deſerts.</p>
            <p>But whereas not the ſoule of <hi>Adam,</hi>
but her owne did quicken, ſuſteine and
gouerne <hi>Eue:</hi> and whereas neither of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1404:45"/>
their ſoules in number doe inhabit or

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1404:45"/>
the life, that is naturall or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
And as the ſoule worketh in the
body, and mainteines the naturall life
thereof, and makes a man ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be a man, and indeede to bee a
man, and not a beaſt, or ſome ſenſeles
or liueleſſe lumpe of fleſh: ſo the ſpirit

Chriſtian, and preſerues the ſpirituall
life thereof, and makes him to be, and
to ſhew himſelfe to be a Chriſtian, and
not a meere carnall or naturall man,
and childe of the Diuell.</p>
            <p>And whereas many Parents are
grieued to ſee their children increaſe ſo

through diffidence in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence

Chriſt and the Catholique Church, his
Spouſe, our Mother, take great delight
and pleaſure in their children, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
grieued for the numbers of them,
or troubled with their fellowſhippe:
But ſhe rather takes it kindly, and with

Lord doth viſit her and giue her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1404:46"/>
both ſonnes and daughters of all

that they may be fit Inſtruments of his
glory, &amp; may doeſeruice to his name
in all ages and places of the world,
wherein and whilſt they liue.</p>
            <p>But that wee may yet further our
knowledge of the Coniunction, that
is betwixt Chriſt and vs, it will not be
amiſſe to conſider of three other ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes
vſed in the holy Scriptures to
ſet it foorth vnto vs. The firſt is of a
Vine, the ſecond of a Body, the third
of a Building. And this I will do with
the help of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am</hi> (faith Chriſt) <hi>the Vine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 5.</note> 
               <hi>yee are
the Branches.</hi> Now wee know that the
Vine and her Branches are ioyned faſt
together by nature: and not as boards
are in a ſhippe with pinnes and nayles
by Arte, but a great deale cloſer.</p>
            <p>For the branches ſhoot forth of the
Vine, are animated with the ſpirit of
the vine, liue the life of the vine, are
fed, nouriſhed, and ſuſteined of the
vine, and abiding in the vine bring
foorth fruits according to the nature
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1404:46"/>
of the vine, out of which they grow
and in which they liue. Euen ſo are
we coupled and ioyned vnto Chriſt,
and ſo faſt, that wee cannot be rent or
broken in peeces from him by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
as branches may be from a vine.</p>
            <p>We grow out of Chriſt, as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
root, from whom by the fauour
of God and influence of his grace, we
doe all as new creatures or heauenly
branches ariſe and ſpring foorth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> is the root of all men, as
men: and when God created <hi>Adam,</hi>
he created vs. And as many, as are
ſprung from <hi>Adam,</hi> haue in themſelues
the root, out of which they ſpring.
Euen ſo the children of God haue
Chriſt, as a ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> from heauen
for a certaine celeſtiall and bleſſed
root, whoſe progenie and branches
they are by regeneration, or heauenly
birth.</p>
            <p>And the good Spirit of Chriſt is
from Chriſt deriued to them all,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9. 10.</note> who
doth animate, conſolate, and ſuſteine
them. And from Chriſt they receiue
food and nouriſhment, by the which
they are refreſht and cheered, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1404:47"/>
from death, by the worke of
the Spirit.</p>
            <p>True it is that life and all good gifts
and graces are from the father,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> as from
the originall or beginning of them all:
but they come not to vs but by the
Sonne,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 11.</note> in whom,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Life is,</hi> and, in whom
are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome
and knowledge,<note place="margin">Mal. 4. 2.</note> who is the <hi>Sunne of
righteouſneſſe with healing in his wings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reu. 3. 18.</note>
and hath gold, rayment and <hi>eye-ſalue,</hi>
and all other medicines to enrich vs,
cloth vs, and cure vs of all our ſoule-diſeaſes.
But yet none of all theſe
things come vnto any of vs in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but by the holy Ghoſt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>The grace of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the loue of God,
and the fellowſhippe of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being now indued with the
holy Spirit of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> they liue a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and Chriſtian life. They liue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 17.</note>
and yet not they, but Chriſt and
his Spirit liue within them. Chriſt is
in his Spirit, and his Spirit is in him.
And where the Spirit of Chriſt is, there
is liberty. They liue then, and liue
free, deliuered, and out of feare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1404:47"/>
And for becauſe Chriſt is in them,
and they in him, and for that the ſpirit
of Chriſt is not idle in them (euen as
the ſoule is not idle in the body, or as a
vigilant Prince is not idle in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
but is buſie, as a Bee, working,
like a carefull and prudent husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
his holy workes within them,
therefore alſo they are not barren, and
take vp roome in vaine, but beare, and
bring forth fruite, as God by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his grace doth giue increaſe.
<hi>For neither is he, that planteth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>any thing:
neither, that watereth: but God, that
giueth the increaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whence it is that our Sauiour ſpaith,</hi>
Abide in me, and I in you.<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 4. 5.</note> As the branch
cannot beare fruit of it ſelfe, except it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in the vine: no more can ye, except ye
abide in me. He, that abideth in me, and
I in him, the ſame bringeth foorth much
fruite.</p>
            <p>And the fruits, they yeeld, are ſuch,
as become the vine Chriſt Ieſus, whoſe
branches they are, and whoſe ſpirit
makes them beare. For vine-branches
bring foorth vine-fruites,<note place="margin">Math. 7. 18.</note> vine-berries,<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 44.</note>
grapes,<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 12.</note> and not ſoure ſlowes, crabbes,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1404:48"/>
or hawes. Euery tree brings foorth
fruit according to his owne kind, euen
as euery man, beaſt, bird, and fiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
and produceth according to
his owne ſpecies, kinde, and image.</p>
            <p>But although the faithfull bee in
Chriſt, and Chriſt in them, yet they do
not all equally draw vertue from
Chriſt: but as one branch receiueth
more from the vine, then another, and
as ſome are ſtronger, fairer, and fuller
of fruits, then ſome others are: euen ſo
one Belieuer receiues more grace and
vertue from Chriſt, then another: and
as Chriſt doth more or leſſe impart
himſelfe vnto vs, ſo we ſucke more or
leſſe vertue from him, and ſo alſo are
more or leſſe fruitfull in good workes.</p>
            <p>Sure it is that God doth giue all his
children his ſpirit,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> and that this ſpirit
reſideth in them:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 19.</note> but this ſpirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not equally in them all, nor alike
at all ſeaſons: but in ſome more, and
in ſome leſſe: and at one time more
ſenſibly, then at an other, as the Sun
doth in the heauens, or a workeman in
his ſhoppe.</p>
            <p>God dwelleth in all his children, &amp;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1404:48"/>
they in him: and they are all truely,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 24. &amp; 4. 15.</note>
one as well as another,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>partakers of the
diuine nature:</hi> but yet God doth not
manifeſt and expreſſe himſelfe in the
ſame degree vnto all (as neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to their children) not that hee
could not, but becauſe he will not for
cauſes iuſt, but beſt knowne vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
and hereupon it comes to paſſe
that one is more vertuous, and better
then another, fuller of good workes,
and more like vnto himſelfe, as that
childe is vnto his father, into whom
his father hath more fully and more
happily powred foorth of himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him in generation, tending him like
wife afterwards with a more carefull &amp;
ingenuous education.<note place="margin">Aug. Epiſt. 57.</note> 
               <hi>Whence is it</hi>
(ſaith S. Auſtin) <hi>that ſome bee holier,
then others are: but becauſe that God doth
dwell in ſome more plenteouſly, then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt is the Sunne, the light,<note place="margin">Mal. 4. 2.</note> that
giueth light of nature,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 12.</note> grace<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 4. 9.</note>, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vnto the world. Euery Chriſtian
man is a ſtarre receiuing light from
Chriſt, who ſhineth into his ſoule: now
as one ſtarre is brighter, then another,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1404:49"/>
according as it receiueth more light
from the Sunne, then another: euen
ſo one Chriſtian excells another in the
light of grace and good workes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as hee receiues more plentifully
from Chriſt, and is more neerely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with him, and partaker of his light,
and ſpirit. And thus of the firſt ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
I come to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Chriſt and the Catholique Church
are a certaine <hi>Myſticall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 27.</note> or <hi>ſpirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 22. &amp; 5. 30 32.</note>
Chriſt himſelfe is the <hi>Head</hi> of that
bodie. And euery true Belieuer is a
member of it. <hi>Wee are members of his
body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> ſaith S.
Paul. <hi>And this is a great myſterie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Head is not a perfit body of it
ſelfe alone. For no mans body is all
head.</p>
            <p>Neither is the Body a compleate
bodie without the head. But being
both vnited, and no part wanting, they
become one entire and perfit body.</p>
            <p>Euen ſo Chriſt, and his Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
with all her true parts and

            <p>

It pleaſeth him in his mercy to

            <p>And we, for our parts, are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that without him we are iuſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

            <p>I ſay Chriſt is the head, the <hi>ſole head</hi>
of the catholique church, which is his

him to be the <hi>Head ouer all things

            <p>There is no other man but this

            <p>Theſe three points of Doctrin haue
in theſe latter times crept out of the

ſprings and branches from a tree, or fall
like olde rotten teeth out of a mans
head.</p>
            <p>But when I ſay that all holy and
righteous men, being the naturall and
onely liue-members of the Church, are
vnited vnto Chriſt, my meaning is not
(as I haue touched before) that they
are holy, righteous, and ſpirituall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the vnion, but then, when they are
vnited. They are not holy without the
vnion, but by the vnion. The coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
doth not finde them iuſt, but
makes them iuſt. They are not holy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1404:55"/>
till they be conioyned. For all our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
iuſtice, wiſedome, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is from the Lord Ieſus, partly by
imputation,<note place="margin">1 Cor: 1. 30.</note> and partly by inſpiration:<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 7.</note>
which we would not haue,<note place="margin">Epheſ: 2. 5.</note> vnleſſe firſt
we haue Chriſt himſelfe,<note place="margin">Rom: 8. 9. 10. 12.</note> and be vnited
to him: euen as a man cannot haue
comfort from his clothes vnleſſe hee
put them on, and buckle them about
him: or as the hungry, and ſicke, or
wounded perſon cannot haue the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of meates, and medicines &amp; ſalues,
vnleſſe he haue the very things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
firſt, and that they he applied to
him. And therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing
ſayde that <hi>Life is in the Sonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 11.</note> inferreth
thence that <hi>he that hath the Sonne, hath
life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not
life.</hi> Now who hath the Son, but he
that is vnited to him? who hath the
Husbands fellowſhip, but the Wife?
Who inioyes the loue of a friend and
his loue tokens, but his friend? What
hath ſenſe or motion from the head,
but that which is vnited to the Head,
as are the members of the body?
Who hath the payment of a ſurety,
euen he, that hath the ſurety himſelfe?
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1404:55"/>
And who hath the ſurety, but he, whoſe
perſon the ſurety is pleaſed to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
and put on vpon himſelfe, and
with and for whom hee ſtands in bands
or couenants to ſee the debt diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?
Now the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is our
friend, our ſurety, our head and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
when once we are vnited to him,
(but not before, except in predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
then we come to enioy him, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;
and graces, which are more
worth then the grace of all Princes, the
gifts of all rich men, and the prizes of
all things that can bee prized in the
world.</p>
            <p>They ſay of Venice, ſhee muſt bee
ſeene before ſhee can bee prized. But
though a man cannot tell what ſhee is
worth, yet he may tell what ſhee is not
worth. Shee is not worth all the Cities
of Italy: She is not worth all the towns
in Europe: Shee is not worth all the
earth beſides, is ſhee?</p>
            <p>But the Citie of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 4: 26.</note> the Citie of
the great King, Hieruſalem, which is
aboue, the ſpirituall body of Chriſt,
the Mother of vs all, is worth all the
Cities in the world, is woorth all the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1404:56"/>
world beſides. Her foundations are in
heauen, her wals are Iaſper, her buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
gold, pure golde, her ſtreete ſuch
alſo, her gates pearle, and her ſhining
like abſtone moſt precious. Shee is
wonderfully rich &amp; glorious. Chriſt is
her King, and her Temple, and her
Sunne, ſhee ſees by. She may well ſay,
<hi>Come ſee mee, and then eſteeme mee.</hi> But
who can ſee her yet? who can prize her?
I ſee her not, I cannot ſee her: but I
doe beleeue her being and her beauty,
and I count it aboue all earthly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to be her ſonne. <hi>If I forget thee; ô
Ieruſalem, let my right hand forget her
dexterity. If I doe not remember thee, let
my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth:
if I preferre not Hieruſalem to my cheefeſt
ioy.</hi> But I haue beene ouer carried.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of men, of <hi>all men,</hi>
both good and euill, ſaints and ſinners,
ſo farre as either nature or vice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
reacheth: euen as <hi>Gehezi</hi> was head
of all his iſſue, as touching their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
their ſinnefull and their leprous
nature and diſpoſition: but with ſome
difference. For hee was but a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and ſecondary Head to them, as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1404:56"/>
they were men and ſinners, guilty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
corruption: for heere <hi>Adam,</hi>
hath the primacie. But he was indeede
the firſt head and originall of their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie.
For he was by the ſingular and
ſudden iudgment of God firſt himſelfe
a leper, &amp; then they afterwards by him.</p>
            <p>So Chriſt Ieſus is the head of godly
Chriſtians, of <hi>all godly Chriſtians,</hi> and
of none but ſuch: of all bleſſed men in
the world, and but of ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> is to he found, yea and felt in
euery man: euen ſo Chriſt is to bee
found in euery Saint.</p>
            <p>There are prints of <hi>Adams</hi> ſetting in
euery mortall man: and there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
certaine markes of Chriſts imptin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the ſoule of euery godly man,
who is immortall in hope, which ſhall
not faile him.</p>
            <p>Nature ſprings from <hi>Adam,</hi> as Gods
liuing inſtrument. And ſin alſo comes
from <hi>Adam,</hi> and from ſinne death. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ſo alſo grace is from Chriſt: iuſtice
and holineſſe, imputatiue and inheſiue;
true life and liberty, victory ouer death
at laſt, victory ouer the world in this
life, and all future felicity proceede
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1404:57"/>
from Chriſt, as from their Authour,
or Spring-head, from whence they
flow.</p>
            <p>There is much liberty in the world,
there is a peace of worldlings, many
honours and outward fauours, giuen
them by GOD, but not through
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Many men haue had victories from
God, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Caeſar, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,
Tamerlane,</hi> the great Turkes, and
many moe vnbeleeuers,<note place="margin">Rom: 5: 1.</note> but not
through Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Cor: 15: 57.</note> But ſpirituall
peace,<note place="margin">Rom: 6: 23.</note> liberty, life, health, ioy, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and ſaluation,<note place="margin">Epheſ: 5: 1.</note> no man hath but by
Ieſus Chriſt or Lord.</p>
            <p>So then, if we were not of <hi>Adam,</hi> and
had not <hi>Adams</hi> nature in vs, and ſinne,
which doth defile it, we ſhould neither
be men, nor ſinnefull men, and ſo not
men ſubiect vnto death. Euen ſo, if we
were not members of Chriſt, ſprung
from him as our head, and had him
not in vs and with vs, we could not bee
Chriſtian men, we could not bee ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and holy, we could not bee vnder
grace, but vnder the Law, we could not
bee free, but bond-men, wee could not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1404:57"/>
be iuſtified, we could not be ſaued.</p>
            <p>A man therefore that would haue
life, light, grace and glory, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a true bleſſed man, muſt needes
haue Chriſt his head, hee muſt needes
be his member, he muſt needs be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
with him, and iſſue from him, as
well as ſinners (to make them men and
ſinners) haue their father <hi>Adams</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in them, and that, which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and poyſon it.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt is the head of the
Church, as hee is both God and Man.
Euen ſo wee who are his members, are
vnited to him, as hee is both God and
Man.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, God and Man dwelleth in vs,
and we dwell in Chriſt, who is God and
man. We are partakers of both his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
diuine and humane: Chriſt is in
vs, as touching both, and wee are in
him, as touching both: hee in vs, and
wee in him: and both faſt knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But this muſt be wiſely vnderſtood;
and for the cleering heereof, I will
ſpeake a little yet more fully and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
by the helpe of Chriſt, who is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1404:58"/>
abundantly able beyond all to vnfolde
and define what this vnion is, and to
anſwer all the queſtions, that may bee
put about it.</p>
            <p>Firſt it is readily granted, that the
diuine nature of Chriſt filleth heauen
&amp; earth, and is eſſentially all the world
ouer preſent whole in all places, and at
all times.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that very Man Ieſus
Chriſt, the Virgins Sonne, hath the
diuine nature by hypoſtaticall vnion:
ſo that in the perſon of the eternall
Sonne of God, which is not double,
but ſingle, the two natures, diuine and
humane, are vnited faſt together, and
for euer, the humane beeing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
into God, hauing neuer had any
perſonall ſubſiſtence out of the perſon
of the Sonne of God. A certaine ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
thereof is in the <hi>Miſſelto,</hi> which
(as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth) growes not but in a
Plant of another kinde.<note place="margin">Plin. hiſt. nat. lib. 16. cap. 44.</note> Indeed wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Miſſelto</hi> may be pluckt by force
or ſtubbed vp out of the plant it grows
in, the humane nature of Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſeuered from the <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Coniunction of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1404:58"/>
fleſh with the Deity is extended as far,
as the Deity it ſelfe. For the Deity is
no where ſeuered from the Man-head:
but yet the <hi>actuall Poſition</hi> of the fleſh is
reſtrained and tied to a certaine place.</p>
            <p>Doubt not (<hi>ſith Saint</hi> Auſtin) but
that the man Chriſt Ieſus is now in that
very place,<note place="margin">Aug. ep. 57.</note> from whence hee ſhall come in
the ſame for me and ſubſtance of fleſh, which
he carried thither, and from which he hath
not taken nature, but giuen thereunto im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
According to this forme hee
ſpreddeth not out himſelfe into all places.
For it behooueth vs to take great heede,
leſt while wee goe about to maintaine the
glorious Deity of him, which is man, wee
leaue not the true bodily ſubſtance of man.
So then, tho the fleſh bee actually ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
there, or there, &amp; not euery where:
yet it is euery where ioyned to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
which filleth the whole world:
and no place, no not hell it ſelfe doth
hinder that Coniunction.</p>
            <p>But though wee cannot ſay that the
Man-head of Chriſt is euery where
preſent, yet we may truely ſay that the
man Chriſt is euery where preſent: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that perſon is euery where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1404:59"/>
from whoſe God-head the Man-head
is no where ſeparated: or, becauſe
this man is <hi>very God,</hi> and ſo by his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he is omni-preſent, tho in his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
hee bee but in one particular ſpace
or place at once. So by reaſon of the
hypoſtaticall vnion wee may ſay the
man Ieſus is eternall, is omnipotent, is
God, is Mediatour betweene God and
Man. But wee cannot ſo ſpeake of his
mans nature.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the fleſh or humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Chriſt, or Chriſt as he is a true
man conſiſting of ſoule and body, now
knit together, may bee rightly ſayd to
hee euery where preſent, as touching
<hi>co-operation with the God-head,</hi> and that
in all things.</p>
            <p>For the diuine nature of Chriſt,
which before his <hi>incarnation</hi> wrought
all things without the man-head, doth
<hi>now</hi> worke nothing, wherein the man-head,
which he hath aſſumed, is either
abſent from it, or idle.</p>
            <p>He which came downe from heauen,
and deſcended into hell, is aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heauen, that ſitting at the right hand
of God, inueſted with all maieſty,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1404:59"/>
might, power, honour and glory, hee
might from thence gouerne and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
all things, and fill his Church with
the gracious and bleſſed fruites of his
ſauing preſence.</p>
            <p>His humane nature before his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Aſcenſion, and Seſſion, was not
without the poſſeſſion of this power:
but the <hi>full vſe and exerciſe thereof</hi> was
ſuſpended, till his <hi>humiliation,</hi> which
had before vailed Maieſty, was ended,
and laide aſide.</p>
            <p>For the Seſſion at the right hand of
his Father is the <hi>actuall exerciſe</hi> of that
power and regency, wherein his Man-head
was ioyned and matched with
his Godhead.</p>
            <p>This regencie and dominion hee
now exerciſeth, both as God and man;
<hi>as God,</hi> by eſſentiall preſence with all
things; <hi>as Man,</hi> by cooperation with
his Godhead, which is eſſentially all
the world ouer.</p>
            <p>I ſay then that the Manhead of
Chriſt cooperates with his Godhead,
to which it is perſonally ioyned. For
the <hi>humane will</hi> of Chriſt aſſenteth to althings,
which his diuine will affecteth,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1404:60"/>
and willeth, what the diuine diſlikes.
And from his <hi>humane vnderſtanding</hi>
nothing, which his Deity worketh, is
concealed: ſo that by <hi>knowledge and
aſſent</hi> the <hi>ſoule of Chriſt is preſent with all
things,</hi> which his Deiry worketh.</p>
            <p>And as concerning his <hi>very bodie of
fleſh:</hi> ſeeing it is the <hi>Body of God,</hi> and
perſonally vnited to the Godhead of
the Sonne of God, by whom it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
made a propitiatorie Sacrifice for
the ſinnes of the whole world, it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
receiueth a <hi>Preſence of force and
efficacie,</hi> by reaſon of the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction,
throughout all ages and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
of men. In ſo much that no
ſtint, or limit, can be ſet to the value,
vertue, and merite of his ſacrificed
body it knoweth no bounds of effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
vnto life: but is alſo it ſelfe infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to purge and ſaue all in any
place, or age, on whom Chriſt is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to conferre it.</p>
            <p>Wee are then <hi>vnited by the vnion of
grace</hi> to our bleſſed Lord and Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſt, being locked and ioyned
to him by the <hi>vnion of a ſingular and
moſt bleſſed Dependance,</hi> as hee is both
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1404:60"/>
God and Man.</p>
            <p>For our very being, as we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
&amp; true members of the Church,
his body, doth wholly depend vpon
him.</p>
            <p>Our new life and pardon, our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and holineſſe, and all our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and celeſtiall gifts and comforts,
flow from him, as water from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
or as light from the Sunne, and
altogether depend vpon him ſo, as
that if any thing could come betwixt
vs and him, that could ſeuer vs from
him, or from the gracious operations
of his Godhead, or from the Coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and merits of his Manhead, we
could not, wee ſhould not continue
new creatures, Saints, or liuing mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his myſticall body, one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time: but muſt needes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
become <hi>nothing,</hi> dead, curſed,
ſlaues, fire-brands of hell, and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>I ſay againe, the Godhead of Chriſt
is in vs, dwells in vs, and we in it; not
onely becauſe it fills vs, as it fills all
things elſe, and is preſent with vs, as it
is throughout all the world: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1404:61"/>
cauſe it worketh mightily in vs, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
graciouſly, powring foorth and giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vs all our new being, life, ioyes and
vertues, which we haue: and for that
it doth alſo ſuſteine and keepe vs in
this good eſtate, it ſets vs in. In which
reſpect we may truely ſay that God is
abſent from the reprobate, and that
they are ſeparated from him. And
therefore alſo Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſaith that
<hi>All we, which belieue in Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Greg. in Iob. l. 2. c. 16.</note> 
               <hi>are out of
doubt his body. And becauſe he is become
the head of his members by a maruellous
diſpenſation of pietie, therefore he is alſo
onely with vs, the rout of Reprobates being
repulſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of Chriſt is <hi>the choſen
inheritance of Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rab. in Eccleſ. l.</hi> 5. c. 13.</note> as <hi>Rabanus</hi> truely
ſpeaketh: and therefore the Godhead
of Chriſt viſits and tends her onely
with the viſitation and preſence of
grace and mercy to ſaluation, paſſing
ouer the vaſt and drie Deſarts, and
craggy rockes, and ſterilous moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of wicked Caſt-awayes, which
are the heritage of Satan, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>I ſay further, <hi>the very fleſh</hi> of Chriſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1404:61"/>
is in vs, and we in it. And that, not
onely <hi>Propter identitatem naturee,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath a true humane ſoule and
body, as we haue, <hi>but without ſin:</hi> like
as the head and the body,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</note> and the vine
and her branches haue one kinde of
ſubſtance or nature:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. 17. &amp; 4. 15.</note> nor yet onely
<hi>Propter conformitatem affectuum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyril. in Job. l.</hi> 10. c. 13.</note> for
conformity of affections, or ſimilitude
of vertues, or for becauſe hee is in our
hearts by loue, and we in his, which
may be among faithfull louers, and
louing couples: but alſo, becauſe wee
are his worke and creation, his fruite
and edifice. His very fleſh doth ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
vs, his bloud doth clenſe vs: by the
meanes and vertue whereof, being the
fleſh and bloud of God, our ſoules are
quickned,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.</note> our hearts are purified, our
ſinnes are waſhed away, and wee nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
refreſhed, ſtrengthened, and
preſerued to life and glory.</p>
            <p>From this ſacred fleſh of his our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bodies doe receiue that life, which
ſhall make them glorious at the latter
day, and for the which they are now
reputed parcels of his bleſſed body.</p>
            <p>Theſe corruptible bodies of ours
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1404:62"/>
could neuer liue the life, they ſhall
liue, but that they are here ioyned with
his body, which is incorruptible, and
that his is in ours, as a cauſe of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;
a cauſe by remouing, through
the inualuable death and merite of his
owne fleſh, that, which hindered the
life of ours.</p>
            <p>And if a man may ſay the fire is in a
man, when the heat and vertue of the
fire is in him, as when he is hot, burnt,
ſcorcht, or ſcalded, well then may a
man truely ſay that Chriſt is in a man,
who partakes of his merit, vertue, and
operations, and who hath his very ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
dwelling and abiding in him, who
moulds him, turnes him, faſhions
him, mortifies him, quickens him, and
repaires him, ſcorching, drying, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming,
and burning vp the petulant
and luxurious luſts and humors of ſin
within him.</p>
            <p>Chriſt then, both as God and Man,
is in vs, within vs, and is our Head,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>in
whom we are compleat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as from the head is conueied
ſenſe and motion into all the parts of
the body. And as the ſame ſoule, which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1404:62"/>
is in the head, is in all the members of
the body, quickning, mouing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
them. Euen ſo the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Chriſt is from Chriſt deriued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the members of his ſpirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
and from him, as God and Man,
wee receiue our godly life and being,
and all thoſe perfections, wherein our
godlineſſe and happineſſe ſtandeth.</p>
            <p>The Godhead indeed is the <hi>fountain</hi>
of all grace and comforts: but the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>
is the <hi>conduit-pipe,</hi> by which they
are from that fountain, or ſpring-head,
conueyed and brought vnto vs, euen
as bloud is diffuſed by veines through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the body from the liuer, or as the
ſinewes do miniſter ſenſe and motion
from the braine.</p>
            <p>But whereas, ſinewes, veines, and
pipes of wood, lead or other matter,
lacke reaſon, iudgement and will, the
fleſh of Chriſt is furniſhed with them
in all perfections: ſo that indeed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Deity without the Humanity,
nor the Humanity without the Deity,
<hi>but both do work together</hi> for our good,
and worke-out our life and glorie.</p>
            <p>So then, we participate <hi>whole</hi> Chriſt,

            <p>Hee, that hath the tree, hath the

            <p>We participate Chriſt partly by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi>
his obedience, holineſſe, and
ſufferings, being imputed to vs, and
iudged to be ours, For the Suretie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ours, his mony is alſo ours, to pay
our debts, hauing freely vndertaken
vpon him ſo to doe. This mony is the
iuſtice of Chriſt imputed to vs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we buy out our iuſtification and
liberty, which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus.
This (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of mony)
<hi>doth anſwere all things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

grace is really wrought within vs, and

being ingrauen vpon our hearts by the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1404:63"/>
finger of God, whiles we liue on earth,
and hereafter more fully, when both
our bodies, and our ſoules, ſhall bee
made like vnto his in perfit glory.</p>
            <p>And becauſe Chriſt worketh by his
Spirit, therefore hee beſtowes his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
euen the holy Ghoſt, who is brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
from him, vpon his whole body,
and euery particular member thereof.
This Spirit is that odoriferous <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde,

            <p>Behold all the heads of the world,
naturall heads, politicall heads, oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall
heads, Eccleſiaſticall heads;
what are they all? euen duſt, earth, and
aſhes. A learned head, is but learned
earth: a wiſe head is but wiſe earth: a
great head is but a great clot of earth:
a noble head is but noble earth. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
and Kings, the great comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and ſwayers of the world, they
are but earth, imperiall earth, royall
earth. Earth and aſhes will one day lay

For all fleſh is graſſe: all fleſh is
not one manner of fleſh. But there is
one manner of fleſh of men, another of
beaſts, another of birds, another of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.
But the fleſh of all men, as well
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1404:65"/>
as of all beaſts, birds, and fiſhes, is but
graſſe, very graſſe, leſſe then graſſe:
Yet behold how we admire the perſons
of men, of great men, rich men, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Heads, who are but clay, but duſt,
but dreames, aliue in the morning and
dead at night.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt, our head, our royall
head, is aliue and giues life, liues, and
will liue for euer: Duſt, Death, Diuels,
Men and Angels, Earth and Heauen,
and all things are at his becke. If hee
ſay to the dead, <hi>Liue:</hi> they ſhall liue. If
he ſay to Death it ſelfe, <hi>die, be not:</hi> death

            <p>But the contemplation of our thrice

            <p>I am come at laſt, though long firſt,
to the laſt ſimilitude, which I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the illuſtration of our Vnion

            <p>The Catholick Church is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3. 15.</note>
or <hi>Houſe of the liuing God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3. 11.</note> Chriſt is
the <hi>Foundation</hi> thereof.<note place="margin">Eph: 2: 20.</note> He is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall

<hi>chiefe-corner-ſtone</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>The holy Prophets and Apoſtles are
miniſteriall foundations and Pillars
thereof.<note place="margin">Reuel. 21.</note> For by their miniſtery and
doctrine this houſe is builded,<note place="margin">Eph: 2. 20.</note> and
confirmed.</p>
            <p>Chriſt alſo is the chiefeſt Architect
of this building. The Apoſtles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paſtors of the Church, are his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9.</note>

and with whom hee is preſent to

            <p>They are in this Houſe as Seruants,

the onely begotten Sonne of God,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. 2.</note>
and Heyre of all things. He alſo is the
light and beauty of it.<note place="margin">Reu: 21: 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This houſe of Chriſt groweth out of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 12.</note> and is ruled by the Faith of
Chriſt. The rule of the Faith is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture: The Church is the
ground and Pillar of the Truth,<note place="margin">1 Cor: 3. 15. Chryſoſt.</note> and
the trueth is the ground and Pillar of
the Church: yea therefore ſhee is the
ground of the trueth, becauſe the truth
is the ground of her, and for becauſe
the ſpirit of Truth inhabits and directs
her:<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 17.</note> which ſpirit, becauſe hee ſpake in
the holy men of God,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 22.</note> is therefore beſt
able to giue the ſence of the Scripture,
&amp; accordingly doth teach the Church
all truths therein contained, needfull
to ſaluation.</p>
            <p>This houſe is a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> houſe, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Temple,<note place="margin">1 Pet: 2. 5.</note> and Chriſt is the <hi>Life</hi>
thereof,<note place="margin">1 Cor: 6.</note> and his Spirit poſſeſſes and
keepes it.</p>
            <p>All the ſtones of this Temple are
<hi>liuing ſtones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">I Pet: 2. 5.</note> growing out of the liuing
and life-giuing Rocke, on which the
Temple ſtandeth. They are all made
aliue, and kept aliue by the Spirit of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1404:66"/>
Chriſt, who is reſident alwaies,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9.</note> &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
in them.</p>
            <p>There are in theſe diuerſities of gifts
and operations, but the ſame Spirit
which worketh all in all.<note place="margin">1 Cor: 12. 4. 6.</note> Who is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">Reuel. 1. 4.</note>
yea ſeauenty times ſeauen fould,
not in perſon (for ſo hee is but one) but
in variety of gifts and gracious opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.<note place="margin">Eph: 4. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the foundation beares vp
all the houſe that is layd vpon it: ſo
Chriſt holds vp and confirmes the
Church, beeing rooted and built in
him,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 7.</note> and ſtabliſhed in the Faith. And
this he doth, partly by his prouidence
and circumſpection, and partly by his
merits and efficacy, through his
Spirit.</p>
            <p>And as all the parts of an houſe are
compact together, and ioyned to the
foundation: ſo are all true beleeuers,
all deuout and ſincere Chriſtians knit
together in one,<note place="margin">Coloſ: 2. 2. 7.</note> &amp; ioyned vnto Chriſt
by Faith and Charity (as it were by
lime, pins, nayles, and ſawder) through
the holy Ghoſt, who heweth, frameth,
and ſetteth euery ſtone in order in
Chriſt, <hi>In whom all the Building fitly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1404:67"/>
together,<note place="margin">Eph: 2: 20.</note> groweth vnto an holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a rare and ſingular houſe:
for they that are heereof, are Stones,
and Kings,<note place="margin">1 Pet: 1: 5. 9.</note> and Prieſts.<note place="margin">Reuel: 1: 6.</note> So then the
Church is a liuing Temple, a ſpirituall
Houſe, and a Royall Prieſthood: a
kingdome of Prieſts, and a Prieſtlie
kingdome.</p>
            <p>And no maruell it is if Chriſtians
be ſtones, ſeeing Chriſt Ieſus, out of
whom they are cut, and grow, bee a
Rocke: or though they haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Kingdome and Prieſthood, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they be members of him who is a
King and Prieſt.<note place="margin">Pſal: 45.</note> They are Chriſtians:<note place="margin">1 Iohn: 2:</note>
it is enough; they are annoiuted with
the oyle of gladneſſe, that they may
be able to ouercome the Deuiil, the
World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Fleſh, as Kings that
raigne by Chriſt; and may alſo haue
grace like Prieſts to offer vp ſpirituall
ſacrifices acceptable to God by Chriſt,
with whoſe holy oyle they are annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>For as the precious oyntment, that
was powred vpon <hi>Aarons</hi> head,<note place="margin">Pſal: 133: 2.</note> ranne
downe vpon his beard, and went down
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1404:67"/>
on the border of his garments: So the
holy oyle, the moſt ſweete and ſauing
oyle, which was powred vpon our head
Chriſt Ieſus, hath runne downe ouer
all his body into all his members, and
be-deawes them all, as the deaw of
Hermon, which falleth vpon the
mountaines of Zion. And (which is
no ſmall fauour) this precious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>oyntment</hi> tarrieth on vs,<note place="margin">1 Ioh: 2: 27.</note> and <hi>dwelleth
in vs,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth aſſure vs.</p>
            <p>In a word, this Temple, this Houſe
hath a priuiledge aboue all the temples
and houſes in the world.</p>
            <p>For no winde can driue it downe, no
water can waſh it downe, no fire can
burne it downe, no canon can beat it
downe, no weight can weigh it downe,
no might can caſt it downe, no witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
can worke it downe, no vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
can vndermine it downe, no thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or lightning can teare or fire it
downe: neither men nor Diuels haue
power ouer it. For Chriſt vpholds it
againſt all aſſaults of enemies whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
It is built by Chriſt vpon himſelfe
who hath alſo ſayd that the <hi>gates of hell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth: 16: 18.</note>
               <hi>ſhall not ouercome it.</hi> Chriſt hath ſpoken
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1404:68"/>
this concerning no houſe, that is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
and earthly, but onely of this his

Truth it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Ioh: 14: 6.</note> we may well beleeue him.<note place="margin">1 Ioh: 5: 19.</note>
               <hi>Whoſe houſe we are,</hi>

               <hi>if we hold faſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,

            <p>Thus haue we ſeene our <hi>Coniunction

               <note place="margin">Ioh: 14: 20.</note> who is <hi>in vs, and wee in

            </p>
            <p>He is in vs, as a cauſe in the effect:
wee are in him, as the effect is in the

            <p>He is in vs, as a worke-man is in his
worke: we are in him, as a worke is in
the worke-man.</p>
            <p>We are in him, as <hi>Eue</hi> was in <hi>Adam:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Hee is in vs, as the Sunne is in the
aire or houſe, to illuminate and warme
it: we are in him, as the aire or an houſe
is in the Sunne, which is lightned and
warmed of it.</p>
            <p>He is in vs as a kernell or ſeede, and
the earth it growes in is in the plant:<note place="margin">Similitudo non c<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

or ſeede of which it comes, and in the

            <p>He is in vs, and we in him, as <hi>Adam</hi>
is in his children, and his children in

and the riuer in it: or as a roote is

            <p>But who is able ſufficiently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
theſe things? who can declare
how hee is faſhioned in his mothers
wombe? or tell how his ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are knit together:<note place="margin">Epheſ: 5: 32.</note> 
               <hi>This is a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi>
ſaith Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> but I ſpeake <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Chriſt and the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but that many a poore
ſoule is the Spouſe of Chriſt, and one
of his true members, tho hee be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſay much about his vnion and
incorporation,<note place="margin">1 Cor: 12: 13.</note> which is by the Spirit
of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And though a man ſayd neuer ſo
much hereof, and could ſpeake of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
as if hee had beene there, yet all
were but dreames, vnleſſe hee bee ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Chriſt, and haue his ſpirit really
to poſſeſſe and leade him.</p>
            <p>That which quickneth vs, is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1404:69"/>
of Chriſt:<note place="margin">1 Cor: 15: 22: 45</note> and his fleſh that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he quickneth vs.</p>
            <p>That which ſanctified our nature in
Chriſt, that which made it a ſacrifice
of reconciliation,<note place="margin">Heb: 9: 14.</note> is the ſame, which
quickneth it, raiſed it from the graue,
and exalted it to glory.</p>
            <p>And therefore if a man haue not the
Spirit, or God-head of Chriſt, and be
partaker of his fleſh, hee is but a dead
man, a miſerable man, a man vnmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
vnſanctified, and without hope
of glory. <hi>I am the liuing bread</hi> (ſaith
Chriſt) <hi>which came downe from heauen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh: 5: 21: 53.</note>
               <hi>If any man eat of this bread, hee ſhall liue
for euer: and the bread, that I will giue, is
my fleſh, which I will giue, for the life of the
world. Except yee eat the fleſh of the Son
of man, and drinke his blood, yee haue no
life in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how can a man eat bread, if hee
haue it not? How can wee eat his fleſh
and drinke his blood, vnleſſe wee haue
it? The truth is, hee that giues vs this
meat to eat, muſt alſo giue vs hands to
take it, and mouthes to taſte and eat it,
and a ſtomacke to craue and holde it.
We muſt needes therefore be vnited to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1404:69"/>
Chriſt, and be truely poſſeſſed of him
and of his grace, or elſe we cannot liue
by him.</p>
            <p>And becauſe no man eats him, but
by grace, and for that no grace is but by
the holy Ghoſt, who diuideth to euery
man ſeuerally,<note place="margin">1 Cor: 12: 11.</note> as he will, and ſeeing by
this eating of Chriſt hee is not turned
into vs as bodily food, but wee receiue
nurriture and confirmation from him,
and are tranſmuted into him, and
grow vp in him, and he in vs, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>So then whatſoeuer men talke of the

and which doth faſhion, vnite, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,

wee are faſt vnited, with whom wee are

            </p>
            <p>What ſhall wee render vnto the

duſt and aſhes, ſin, ſhame, and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
What are we all, euen the beſt of
vs all, but vapors, ſhadowes, dreames,
glaſſes, and very vanity? yet as baſe, as

where ſhall wee beginne, or how ſhall
we make an end?</p>
            <p>The Angels, which tranſgreſſed,
thou haſt paſſed by, and wouldſt not
giue thy Son vnto them. Thou doſt
puniſh their pride againſt thee, and
their enuie at our felicity. They
fell without a Tempter, and they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
without a Sauiour. But man,
poore man, diſtreſſed wretch, who

no ſtrength left him to riſe againe, and

            <p>On him thou didſt beſtow thy Son,

            <p>Wee poore wretches are ſicke and

            <p>We are weake and feeble, but he is
our fortitude and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>We are naked, hauing nothing on

            <p>We are hungry and thirſty, empty

            <p>All the <hi>aqua vitae, aqua caeleſtis, aurum

Certain it is, if any man haue <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

in him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh that wee could ſorrow, lament
and howle for our vileneſſe, and weepe
bitterly for our ſinnes with <hi>Peter,</hi> and
euen waſh our Sauiours feete with our
teares, as that poore penitent woman
did. Oh that the fountaines of ſorrow
were broken vp within vs, that whole
flouds of teares might guſh out from
vs: then all our ſorrowes ſhould be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into ioyes, our mourning into
merriment, and our teares into ſongs.</p>
            <p>O that we could goe downe into the
deepes, the deepeſt deepes, and cry out
(as <hi>Ionah</hi> did) <hi>out of the belly of hell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ionas 2. 2.</note>
Then our feares would be chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope,
and our ſighes would end in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
Oh that our ſoules did faint with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vs, and that wee were euen brought
vnto true deſpaire of our own ſtrength
and valour, that wee might onely truſt
in Chriſt, and ſeeke to him for ſuccour.
For all other helpes are but as a ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
foote, a rotten tooth, and a ſilly
reede. And <hi>they that waite vpon lying
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1404:77"/>
vanities, forſake their owne mercie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold we the ſpirit of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ion: 2: 8.</note> who
was able to ſay for himſelfe as much as
another; yet ſeeing his owne neceſſities
and the perfections of Chriſt, hee was
content to caſt off himſelfe, to put on
Chriſt: to caſt downe himſelfe, to
build vp himſelfe in Chriſt: to vilifie
himſelfe to be made glorious in Chriſt:
to become nothing in himſelfe, to bee
ſomething <hi>(euen that whole thing which
he is)</hi> in Chriſt: and euen to loſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in himſelfe, that hee might finde
himſelfe ſafe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What things <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> were gaine to
me,<note place="margin">Phil: 3: 7.</note> thoſe I counted loſſe for Chriſt. Yea
doubtleſſe and I count all things but loſſe
for the excellency of the knowledge of
Chriſt my Lord. For whom I haue ſuffered
the loſſe of all things, and doe count them
but dung, that I may winne Chriſt, and be
found in him, not hauing mine owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
which is of the Law: but that,
which is through the faith of Christ, the
righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith:
that I may know him, and the power of his
Reſurrection, and the fellow-ſhip of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
being made conformable vnto his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1404:78"/>
death: if by any meanes I might attaine
vnto the reſurrection of the dead.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to gaine Chriſt Ieſus and
his graces, and gracious bleſſings, wee
ought to apply our ſelues to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Word and Sacraments.
For theſe are the <hi>golden pipes,</hi> through
which the <hi>oyle</hi> of the ſpirit is conuayed
and brought vnto vs, and by which we
become enriched with the merits and
vertues of our Sauiour.</p>
            <p>For as concerning the Word:<note place="margin">Iam: 1: 8.</note> it is
the <hi>word of truth,</hi> by which we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in Chriſt to God by the Spirit,
who worketh by it.<note place="margin">Heb: 6: 5.</note> It is the <hi>good</hi> word
of God: a word, that <hi>conuerteth the
ſoule and giueth wiſdome to the ſimple.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal: 19: 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is the word of grace, the word of
life,<note place="margin">Phil: 2: 15. 1 Tim: 4: 6. Tit: 2: 8. Epheſ: 6: 15: &amp; 1: 13. Iam: 1: 21:</note> the word of faith, an wholeſome
word, the word of <hi>peace,</hi> the word of
<hi>ſaluation, able to ſaue the ſoule,</hi> in which
it is engrafted.</p>
            <p>It is a word that ſhewes vs our poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
nakedneſſe, blindneſſe, and
wretchedneſſe, and is withall that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
organ of grace and glory, in the
which God ſhewes vs his Sonne, in
whom we may haue remedy, and holds
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1404:78"/>
him out vnto vs, willing vs to take him
of him: and by receiuing of which
word we may come to enioy that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
and thrice-bleſſed <hi>Word,</hi> who
is our life and glory.</p>
            <p>And as touching the <hi>Sacraments:</hi>
they are not onely memorials, ſignes
and teſtimonies, but effectuall meanes
and inſtruments (not naturall, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
not humane, but diuine) by the
which God, when wee take the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
deliuereth vnto vs Chriſt Ieſus
and his merits, and that grace that is
needefull to ſaluation.</p>
            <p>By theſe wee are put into poſſeſſion
of Chriſt, of his ſpirit and grace, both
imputatiue and inheſiue.</p>
            <p>In theſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, God
and Man, comes vnto our ſoules, and
applyes himſelfe vnto vs, and worketh
in vs, as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Yet to ſpeake properly, by Baptiſme
wee receiue but the beginning of thoſe
graces, the increaſe and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof wee receiue afterwards by
the often receiuing of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>Wee receiue Chriſt Ieſus in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1404:79"/>
once, as the Author and firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner:
in the Communion often, as
being by continuall degrees the Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher
and Perfecter of our life.</p>
            <p>When wee receiue this Sacrament,
the ſpirit is ſent a new into vs: not as if
he mooued place (for he is euery where
whole all the world ouer) but becauſe
he is now to beginne ſome new grace,
or to confirme and augment ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
begun, or to raiſe vp ſome lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
or to giue ſome ioy, ſome
comfort, where either none was, or was
ſcarcely felt, or is decayed.</p>
            <p>So then that healing and ſauing
grace, which Chriſt originally is, or
hath, as the fountaine of life and grace,
for the good of the whole Church, hee
doth ſeuerally by Sacraments diuide
and deriue into euery particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thereof Neither doth hee ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
beſtow the grace of Sacraments on
any, but by Sacraments.</p>
            <p>But yet this grace, which wee receiue
by the Sacraments organically, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
not from them energetically, but
from him: as they that looked vpon
the brazen ſerpent,<note place="margin">Wiſd: 16: 7.</note> were not healed by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1404:79"/>
that they ſaw, but by the Lord, their
Sauiour.</p>
            <p>But yet it is very iuſt, and more then
probable, that they which contemne
or neglect the Sacraments, ſhould bee
without the grace of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is the kernell of the word and
Sacraments: they, that would eat the
kernell, muſt cracke the ſhell. Theſe
are the veſtiments in which hee comes
vnto vs.</p>
            <p>They are worthy to goe without
him, that will not vſe the meanes to get
and keepe him.</p>
            <p>Without doubt it is either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or worldlineſſe, or wantonnes,
and preſumption, or ſomething that is
naught, that makes men contemne and
paſſe by theſe holy ordinances of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I aſſure my ſelfe their ſtomackes are
full, their hearts a ſleepe, and their
mouths out of taſte (ſomething doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
is amiſſe) that they haue ſo ſmall
deſire to them, and feele ſo little ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in them.</p>
            <p>Something doth bewitch them, that
they can neither ſee nor feele their own
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1404:80"/>
wants, nor that ſuperabundance of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that is offered to them in Chriſt,
who ſtretcheth foorth himſelfe, and
exhibits his ſpirit, and all his merits in
theſe holy myſteries.</p>
            <p>Queſtionleſſe theſe men lacke faith,
in ſteade whereof their heads are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
full of fanſies. For had they faith,
they would flie to the Communion,
and preſſe on themſelues, as ſhe in the
Goſpell,<note place="margin">Matth: 9.</note> in her iſſue, whoſe faith made
her come to Chriſt, and goe behinde
him, tho but to touch the outer gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſt. And what followed?
vertue went foorth of Chriſt, ſhee was
inſtantly cured. Chriſt Ieſus is offered
vnto vs in the Sacrament. Now if wee
would come to it, as ſhee did to his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we ſhould finde grace. But how
came ſhe? her body was conſumed, her
bloud was ſpent, her purſe was empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and all this ſhee felt, and was well
affected with. Further, ſhe ſaw all her
helps failed her. Shee doth deſpaire of
the skill of all Phyſicians. And for
herſelfe, ſhee ſaw there was no hope of
helpe in nature, which dayly decayed
in her: ſhe ſaw ſhe could not long hold
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1404:80"/>
out in this eſtate. What does ſhe then?
kill her ſelfe, or run out to wizards? Oh
no: but ſhee bethinkes her ſelfe of
Chriſt, whoſe miracles ſhee either had
ſeene or heard of. To him ſhe trudges,
<hi>and touched the hemme of his garment.
For ſhee ſayd in her ſelfe, If I may touch
but his garment onely, I ſhall bee whole.</hi>
And ſhee <hi>was made whole at that ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth: 9: 22.</note>
In like manner the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of the men of Gennazaret,<note place="margin">Mattth: 14: 35. 36.</note> that
when once they knew Chriſt, they ſent
all the ſick people about them to him,
and beſought him that they might
touch the hemme of his garment only.
<hi>And as many as toucht it, were made
whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See, theſe people knew by ſenſe the
miſery of ſickneſſe and diſeaſes, as wee
ſay the oxe knowes not the loſſe of his
horne, till hee hath loſt it: they alſo
knew Chriſt and beleeued his power,
and they were well perſwaded of his
gentle nature: neither were they ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as to thinke his garment able of it
ſelfe to heale them: but they knew that
the vertue came from him: but yet
they deſired onely to touch his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1404:81"/>
becauſe they knew it was a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or ſigne ſufficient of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him.</p>
            <p>Queſtionleſſe Chriſt is the onely
Phyſician of the ſoule, the onely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of life and grace. And in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
hee tenders himſelfe vnto vs,
as he is both God and Man. He is the
ſame that euer he was, as potent, as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
as eaſie to be entreated. And we
for our parts are full of defects. F<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther
therefore that men neglect the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or make light regard thereof, it
it becauſe they are ignorant of Chriſt,
and beleeue not in him, but either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
his might or elſe his mercy, or
both: or elſe it is becauſe they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſate
and ignorant beaſts, without
knowledge and feeling of their owne
miſerable wants and beggerly baſenes:
or they do not vnderſtand &amp; beleeue
what the Sacrament is, and what may
bee obtained by touching, taſting and
receiuing it, in a faithfull, penitent, and
humble manner.</p>
            <p>But if wee came preparedly to the
Sacrament, with good beleefe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
deſire of grace, touched with a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1404:81"/>
thorough feeling of our wants, wee
ſhould certainely obtaine his Spirit,
and receiue grace by the taking and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of the Sacrament, which grace
proceedeth originally from his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
which dwelleth perſonally in his
fleſh, which is there with his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and all his merits exhibited to the
faithfull and humbled ſoule.</p>
            <p>Faith then wee ſee is a gift of great
importance: for by faith wee come to
Chriſt:<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 12.</note> by faith wee loue Chriſt: by
faith we receiue Chirſt: by faith we reſt
in Chriſt:<note place="margin">Rom: 3.</note> by faith wee are iuſtified by
the bloud of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Gal: 2.</note> by faith our harts

to pleaſe God:<note place="margin">Heb: 4.</note> without faith
the word will be vnprofitable in vs, &amp;
the Sacraments likewiſe: without faith
a man cannot enioy Chriſt: for none
ſhall haue him, but ſuch as doe receiue
him, and none receiue him, but ſuch as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1404:82"/>
put their confidence in him, and reſt
contented in his loue And in a word

               <note place="margin">Galat. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>nor vncircumciſion: but
faith, which worketh by loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man lackes nothing, that hath
himſelfe: but he hath himſelf that hath
Chriſt, and hee hath Chriſt that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in Chriſt, in the power of Chriſt,
in the grace of Chriſt, in the worde of
Chriſt, &amp; reſts himſelfe in his doctrine,

            <p>This is enough to make it eſteemed,
becauſe by it he dwelleth in our hearts,
who hath riches for vs if we be poore;<note place="margin">Eph: 3. 17.</note>
