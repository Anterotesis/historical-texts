            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Timothy,</hi> there was a necessity of this Fellows Suspition,
and Wonder: For, had I nam'd her in the Deed, as my Wife,
and exprest a consideration of Marriage, my whole Design might
have taken vent, and so miscarry'd: For 'twere unreasonable
to expect, that a Lawyer, whose Trade is Talking, should keep
silence: And should my cast-off Son have smelt the design, his
Wants and Despair would have left no stone unmov'd to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point

                  <p>I must confess, the secret Conduct of this Design is
very admirable; For, Sir, I think, she her self, who to morrow
must be your Lady, is hitherto no less kept in ignorance both of

your Name and Quality, then all the rest of your nearest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and Relations are of her Person, and your resolution to

                  <p>O <hi>Timothy:</hi> The Art of Secrecy is the Secret of
the World. 'Tis the Rudder, that silently governs the
whole Bulk of Human affairs. A Secret well kept, like Powder
close ramm'd, does certain execution, when ever you give Fire
with a just aime. Therefore have I kept and educated this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Virgin in so private and remote a Quarter of the Town;
Therefore have I disguis'd my Person under a borrow'd name
to her, and those Servants I plac'd about her, that it should
not be in the power of any body to acquaint the World with
my Design.</p>

your liking, or disliking of it; both which are indifferent to me.</p>

my resolutions concerning that Prodigal and Rebell of my
House, whom you call my Son: He shall have no more share in
my Estate, then he has in my affections; and those he has ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
forfeited. But, if you think it expedient to take the
out-cast of my Family into yours, you may use your discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

his, who first said so; but, (I fear,) not so fortunate. Y'ave a
dangerous Rubicon to pass over. Have you thought well upon't?
For, in my judgment, To morrow is both too soon, and too late

                  <p>You perhaps (like the rest of the VVorld) Judging
others by their own scantling) may have reason for this Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

there are two sorts of People in the VVorld mightily given in

cause alike; Cowards, and Old Men. VVe two, (you know)
started into the VVorld almost together; and, our eight and
Fifty years a piece are now run off: For my own part, I should
think it an excess of rashness in my self, if, after so long a Race,
I should still presume so much upon my strength, as to venture
at the dangerous Leap of Matrimony.</p>

                  <p>That (Sir) I owe to Fortune: For in a Country-Farme
I first saw her, and read it in her looks, that Heaven
had not design'd her for that place: And being informed she
was a Merchants Daughter, who had miscarry'd at Sea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Voyage had put her to Nurse there, I easily prevailed
with the Old VVoman of the House, who was my Tenant, to
resign her Charge to me. I took her, as a Present sent from
Heaven to make the rest of my dayes comfortable, and happy.
For two years together I have train'd her up my self, making
it my business to preserve her in her primitive innocence, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59692:8"/>
simplicity: And, lest the contagion of ill company should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the original candour of her nature with the least tincture of
malice, I have plac'd two Servants about her, the honestest and
simplest, I could find out.</p>

true, that wit in woman is the Bawd of Vice:</p>

to <hi>Court, Hide-Park, Mulberry-Garden,</hi> or the <hi>Play-Houses.</hi>
Thirdly, To Visit, and be visited by none of a remoter degree,
then an Uncle, or an Aunt; Fourthly, To write and receive no
Letters, to accept and give no Presents, but such as you see, and
allow of: Lastly, To warm Napkins, make Cawdles, dress
Issues, give Glisters, and the like; still remembring, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Nurse inseperably belongs to the duty of your

you make your addresses to her: For (perhaps) she's as much
infected with this self opinion, as her neighbours; and she'l be

has received no improvement from Education; Nor does she
want it: For, Nature has left her so well finished, that Art has
little to do. Perhaps her Ignorance is greater then ordinary;

which with long study and labour, has been manag'd, by the most

                  <p>'Faith, were he not your Father, I should think him
as extravagant in his way, as this good Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> is. For up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our first interview, he was all sweetness, and kindness; He
paid me his mony with the best grace that ever I saw. He own'd
his <hi>Marriage</hi> to me; but, when I asked him to wait upon his
Mistriss before the Marriage, there he stuck, and absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
me: yet still his gracious aspects were the same; and Ila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to improve his Favour, and gain farther upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
told him the Story (he putting me upon it) of Mrs.
<hi>Betty),</hi> which (you know) is pleasant enough in the Relation:
And all on the sudden, when his kindness and good humor were
at highest, he sunck in a moment to so flat an ebbe of coldness,
and dryness, that he scarce minded what I said, turn'd his head
on one side, stood making of Faces, and was so like a man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
that I cannot attribute this inequallity, in his temper,
to any thing else, but some inward disorder in his Brain, which
must necessarily in time grow to a direct Frenzy.</p>

But, Sir, much against my Will, I must leave your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
For my several designes of disappointing my Fathers Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and securing my own Love, so hurry me too and fro, that
I cannot enjoy a moment of rest.</p>

mild and sweet, that you would Swear, the Creature had no
Gall in it: whil'st t'other side of his Countenance looks on all
about him, as if he could eat 'em up. When he speaks,
the Clapper in his Mouth strikes double; To his Mistriss Eares
it sounds, <hi>Sweet Madam, let me kiss your fair hands;</hi> and, to

may prove no unseasonable Present: But, there's
another use to be made of him, much more important to me, and
(I hope) to you; For, he's very proper to amuse your Fathers
unquiet Suspitions of our Love, and to fill the Room of a Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
which might otherwise be taken up by some body of more
danger: There can be no fitter Person, then he, to be deceiv'd
himself, and to deceive others. I therefore leave him to your

all the hopes and happiness of your humble Adorer <hi>Single.</hi>

VVhat shall I do? I must write my Thoughts to you, and yet
I know not how to chuse words to express them: For I have
been bred in such ignorance, that all the knowledge I have, is,
that I want it. This makes me fearfull of saying any thing,

as I am forc'd to do. Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> does often Preach to me,
That all young men are Deceivers; and, that 'tis their Trade
by fair promises to cheat VVomen of their Honour, and then
forsake 'em. Pray tell me whether it be so or no. I have no

things duely weigh'd, Why should I lay the blame on others,
when here within me lies my worst Enemy? An obstinate Love
has taken possession of my heart, which makes an Ass of my
Reason, and forceth me, though I know the Treason, to dote
still upon the Traitor. Unjustly I condemn the amorous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit

affront he does me, that he calls me to Counsell in all his Plots

Ignorance of an Innocent Girle, whose want of knowledge
(which causes my Disgrace) is the effect of that Education
which I gave her? No: My designs of Revenge are vain, and
unjust. I must pull down my Sailes to weather out this storme.
My only Course will be, to marry her out of hand: That may
open her eyes, to see her Duty; and his, to know the Injury he
does me. Heaven! If it may be, make her honest; if not,</p>

positive determination (as I'm inform'd) of matching me to
one of his own providing, whose Person, and Fortune (they

                  <p>O, by all means: The Lodging is close by; 'Tis a
Corner House, with a Belcony, that looks into the Fields here,
next to <hi>Swan-Ally:</hi> You may see the House from hence. Now,
Sir, the way to deliver it, that neither old <hi>Evans,</hi> nor his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold-Spies
may see it, is to tie it to something, and then toss it
up into the Belcony: By the manner of the conveyance <hi>Betty</hi>
will presently know whence it comes, and how to behave her
self: And, this is the proper time of doing it; For, at this
hour she alwayes comes out in the Belcony, to take a little
fresh Air of the Evening; It being all the liberty allow'd her
by her Jaylor.</p>

                  <p>It imports me likewise, that you should know the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
My passion for <hi>Betty</hi> is now come to that height, that
I'm resolv'd instantly to Marry her. But (most unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to my Designs) my Father comes this night to Town; and
with a resolution (as I am certainly inform'd) to strike up a
Bargain of Marriage for me of his own driving. In these
Streights I have no expedient left to prevent his purpose,
and execute my own, but to get possession of <hi>Betty,</hi> and Marry
her out of hand. Though my Fathers present dissatisfaction may
be great, yet, I hope, time will mollifie him; And I doubt not
but your good Offices will much contribute towards it.</p>

bold a Petition, I should think no place so safe and honourable

of disgusting a Father, though innocently: And yet I'm too
much a Lover my self to advise a breach of promise with your
Mistriss. To satisfie both, you must deferr your going to <hi>Betty</hi>
for an hour, or thereabouts. Your Father must needs be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
after his Journy; and cannot hold you long: And, that she
may not think her self disappointed by you, write a note to her,
to let her know the occasion.</p>

                  <p>Sir, he has inform'd me of a considerable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which his Fatherly care has provided for his Son; for
which I heartily give him joy; And if your Daughter be the
intended Bride, I give you the like; and shall take this, as a
happy rise to begin our acquaintance. Methinks, Gentlemen,
matters of so happy a Consequence can never be dispatcht
too soon: I see no reason why the Wedding should not be to
morrow.</p>

                  <p>Sir, when you know my reason for it, I hope I shall
not deserve your Censure. This Mr. <hi>Single,</hi> and your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Behold an absolute Gift and Conveiance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

            <l>SInce Stealing's grown a pretty, thriving Trade;</l>
            <l>Which many Rich, but few has Guilty made,</l>
            <l>To needy <hi>Poets,</hi> Why should you deny</l>
            <l>The Priviledge to steal, as well as lie?</l>
            <l>Their Theft (alass) swell's not the Nation's Debt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <l>Nor, makes Wine dear, nor will Land-taxe beget.</l>
            <l>Mony they alwayes wanted; Now they grow</l>
            <l>No less in Fancy, then in Fortune, low;</l>
            <l>And are compell'd to rook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Gamesters are,</l>
            <l>That can hold out no longer on the Square.</l>
            <l>Faith, be good natur'd to this hungry Crew,</l>
            <l>Who, what they filch abroad, bring home to you.</l>
            <l>But still exclude those Men from all Relief,</l>
            <l>Who steal themselves, yet boldly cry, Stop Thief?</l>
            <l>Like taking Iudges, these without remorse</l>
            <l>Condemn all petty Thefts, and practise worse;</l>
            <l>As if they robb'd by Patent, and alone</l>

            <l>What we have brought before you, was not meant</l>
            <l>For a new Play, but a new President;</l>
            <l>For we with Modesty our Theft avow,</l>
            <l>(There is some Conscience shewn in stealing too)</l>
            <l>And openly declare, that if our Cheer</l>

            <l>To charge us with a National Offence;</l>
