            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The sicke saith our Sauior, neede

that he which ministreth to

of the sicknes, that being remoued
the medicine may more effectually
worke: &amp; they that minister the
woord, ought to haue a feeling of
their brethrens infirmities, that
they may bee able to comfort the
cast downe conscience, stirre the

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Scripture is
not onely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be grauen
in steel with the
<pb facs="tcp:18472:6"/>
pen of an Adamant, and in
letters of gold; but also to be
written and registred by the
singer of God his spirit in the
table of our harts. Which
sentence briefely speaketh
thus much vnto vs, that what
trouble befalleth a man (his
minde vnappalled) hee will
indifferently beare it out; but
if the spirit of a man be once
troubled and dismayed, hee
cannot tell how to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And no maruell, for if
the mind of man be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of comforts, which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth
comfort vnto him in
all other troubles; and if it
become comfortles, what
shall comfort it? If it be void
<pb facs="tcp:18472:6"/>
of helpe, where shall it bee
helped? If the eye which is
the light of the body be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
how great is that darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?
If the salt which sauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
all things be vnsauourie,
for what is it good? If the
minde which susteineth all
troubles bee troubled, howe
intollerable is that trouble?
To shew this the better, we
will first declare how great a
punishment of GOD this
wound of Conscience is: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
wee will teach howe
this trouble of minde may
be preuented and auoyded:
Lastly we will set down how
Gods children faling in some
measure into this affliction of
<pb facs="tcp:18472:7"/>
spirit may bee recouered out
of it. For the first, the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousnes
of this malladie is
seene, either by some due
consideration of the persons
that haue felt it; or by some
wife comparison made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
this griefe of minde,
and other outwarde griefes
incident vnto a man.</p>
            <p>The persons in whom we
may consider this wounded
spirit, are either meerely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
men, or such as bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
by the spirit of GOD:
The men meerely naturall,
are either the Heathen such
as neuer knew God in Christ
or carnall professors such as
haue not professed Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb facs="tcp:18472:7"/>
aright. If wee looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Heathen, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them haue willingly
gone vnder pouertie, and
haue been content to vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
themselues of al worldly
treasures? Howe haue some
of them (their mindes beeing
vnappalled) suffred imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
exile, &amp; extreame tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of bodies; rather than
they woulde betray Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries?
Howe many of them
hauing deuoured many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries,
and borne outwarde
troubles, with some ease and
with no resistance, whilst their
mindes were at liberty? And
yet looke not into the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
but the best and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:18472:8"/>
men among them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
their wisest Philosophers
sweete Orators and exquisite
Poets, who in bearing and
forbearing thought the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
point of vertue to consist;
and yee shall see when some
great distresse of minde did
wound them, some woulde
make an ende of it by prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a Cup of deadly poyson;
some woulde violently and
voluntarily run on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
pikes; some woulde
throwe downe themselues
from hye Mountaines; some
would not sticke to stab most
monstrously their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with Daggers; or such
like instruments of death: all
<pb facs="tcp:18472:8"/>
which men woulde seeme to
haue great courage in sustei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
many harmes, so long as
their mindes were not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastred.
But when the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
and supreame Essence
(which they acknowledged)
did by his power crosse and
ouerturne their witty deuises
and headstrong attempts, so
as without hope of remedie
they were hampered in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuenes
and sorow of minde,
then beeing not able to turne
themselues vnder so heauy a
burthen, they shrunke down
and by violent death woulde
ridde themselues of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes
and impatiencie of
their troubled mindes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:9"/>
But let vs come nearer; and
whether wee behold the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
or the Familie of loue,
or the common sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
wee shall see they will
passe quietly through many
afflictions, whether for that
they haue a spirite of slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
or numbers cast vppon
them; or whether because
they haue brawned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
through some senceles
blockishnes, as men hewen
out of hard Oakes, or grauen
out of marble stones I know
not. But yet when the Lord
shall let loose the cordes of
their consciences, and shall
set before their faces their
sinnes committed; see what a
<pb facs="tcp:18472:9"/>
fearfull end they haue, whilst
some of them by hanging
themselues, some by casting
themselues into the water,
some by cutting their owne
throates haue rid themselues
out of this intollerable griefe.
Nowe wherein is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that some dye so sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly,
and some dispatch them
selues so violently? Surely the
one feeling no sinne, depart
like brutish Hogs; the other
surcharged with sinne, dye
like barking Dogs.</p>
            <p>But let vs come to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, who haue in
some degree felt this wound
of minde; and it will appeare
both in the members and in
<pb facs="tcp:18472:10"/>
the heade, of all burthens to
bee a thing most intollerable
to susteine a wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And to begin with,
let vs set in the first ranke Iob,
that man of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended
vnto vs by the holy Ghost for
a myrrour of patience, who
although for his riches hee
was the wealthiest man in the
land of Huz; for his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
might haue made afraid a
great multitude; and for his
substance, was the greatest of
all the men in the East: Yet
when the Shabeans violently
tooke away his cattell; when
the fier of God falling from
heauen burnt vp his sheepe
and his seruaunts; when the
<pb facs="tcp:18472:10"/>
Chaldeans had taken away
his Cammels; when a great
winde smote down his house
vpon his children; although
indeed he rent his garments,
which was not so much for
impatiencie, as to shewe that
he was not vnsensible in these
euils: Yet it is saide that hee
worshipped and blessed the
name of the Lorde, saying:
<hi>Naked came I out of my mothers
vvombe, and naked shall I retur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
thither againe: The Lord giueth
and the Lord taketh away, Blessed
be the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit beholde when at
the strange conference of his
comfortles friends, his minde
began to be agast, which was
<pb facs="tcp:18472:11"/>
not so in all his former tryall:
when his conscience began
to be troubled; when he saw
the Lord fasten on him sharp
arrowes, and to set him vp as
as a Butte to shoote at; when
hee thought God caused him
to possesse the sinnes of his
youth; this glorious patterne
of patience coulde not beare
his griefe: he is heauy, &amp; now
may commende to all the
Image of a wounded spirite,
that shall come after. Dauid,
a man chosen according to
the Lords owne hart; Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
a pure worshiper of God,
and carefull restorer of pure
Religion; Ieremiah, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of the Lorde, sanctified
<pb facs="tcp:18472:11"/>
and ordained to that Office
before hee was formed in his
mothers wombe, were rare
and singular in the graces &amp;
fauour of God: yet when
they felt this wound piercing
them with griefe of hart, they
wer as Sparrows mourning;
as Cranes chattering; as Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans
casting out fearefull
cries; they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
as in the graues; they
wished to haue dwelt solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily;
they were as bottels par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the smoke; they were
as Doues mourning, not able
without sighes and grones to
vtter their words; their harts
cloue to the dust, and their
tongues to the roofe of their
<pb facs="tcp:18472:12"/>
mouths.</p>
            <p>But aboue all; (if these were
not sufficient to perswade vs
in this doctrine) there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
one example, whom
we affirme to be the perfect
anatomie of an afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
This is the Lord &amp;
Sauior IESVS CHRIST
the Image of the father, the
head of the body, the myrror
of all graces, the wisedome,
righteousnes, holines, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of all the Saintes;
who susteined the Crosse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from his youth vpward:
and besides pouerty, basenes,
hunger, did willingly goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and reproch, and that
<pb facs="tcp:18472:12"/>
among them where he shuld
haue had a right deserued
honor, in respect of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
he taught them, and in
regard of the manifolde my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
wroght among them;
as the healing of the sicke, the
giuing sight to the blinde, the
restoring of life to the deade:
This vnkindnes neuertheles,
did so much strike him, as at
what time hee was set as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for al, when he was to
beare our infirmities, &amp; carry
our sorrowes, at what time
hee was plagued and smitten
of God, humbled and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for our transgressions,
when hee should be broken,
for our iniquities, &amp; the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement
<pb facs="tcp:18472:13"/>
of our peace was
vpon him, then he cryed out;
<hi>My soule is heauie euen vnto the
death:</hi> Then hee prayeth,
<hi>Lord if it be possible, let this Cup
passe from mee:</hi> But how pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
hee? euen with sweating;
howe sweateth hee? euen
droppes of blood; how long
prayeth hee? Three times:
when ends his agony? not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he was dead: What saide
hee beeing ready to depart?
<hi>My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was this for his humane
death as some haue imagined?
No, no, wicked men haue
died without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint, whose
patience them might seeme
<pb facs="tcp:18472:13"/>
to exceede his; it was his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in his humane Spirite,
which incountred with the
wrath of God, his Godhead
suppressing it self for a while:
he suffred indeede many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in body, but the wrath
of God did much more lye
vpon his soule. If this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of an afflicted spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in these examples doe not
sufficiently shew; what a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
thing it is to susteine a
wounded Conscience: Let
us proceede to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this with other euills,
which fall into the nature of
men.</p>
            <p>There is no sickenes, but
Phisicke prouideth for it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
<pb facs="tcp:18472:14"/>
there is no sore but
Chirurgery will affoorde it a
salue; Friendship helpeth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie;
There is no imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but there is hope of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie;
Suite and fauour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
a man from banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Authoritie and time
weare away reproch: But
what Phisicke cureth? what
Chirurgerie salueth? what ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
ransome, what counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
beareth out? what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
asswageth? what as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
dismaieth a troubled
Conscience? All these ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
togeather in league,
(though they wold conspire
a confederacie) cannot help
this one distresse of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb facs="tcp:18472:14"/>
minde; And yet this one
comforte of a quiete minde,
doth wonderfully cure, and
comfortably asswage al other
griefes whatsoeuer. For if
our assistance were as an host
of armed souldiers; If our
friends were the Princes and
all the Gouernours of the
earth; If our possessions wer
as long as betweene the East
and the west; If our meate
wer as Manna from heauen;
If our apparrell were as cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the Ephod of Aaron; If
euery day were as glorious
as the day of Christs resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
yet if our mindes bee
appalled with the iudgement
of God, these thinges would
<pb facs="tcp:18472:15"/>
little comfort vs. Let expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
speake; If a troubled
minde impayreth not health,
dryeth not vp the blood, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
not the marrowe, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not away the flesh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
not the bones; if it
maketh not al pleasures pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and shortneth not the
life; surely no wisedome can
councell it, no councell can
aduise it, no aduise can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage
it, no asswagement can
cure it, no eloquence can
perswade it, no power can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
it, no Scepter affray
it, nor inchaunter can inchant
it. And yet on the contrary, if
a man languish in sickenes, so
his hart be whole, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb facs="tcp:18472:15"/>
of the health of his
soule, his sickenes doth not
grieue him: If a man bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched,
so he be precious in
the sight of God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
what losse hath hee? If
a man be bannished, and yet
doubteth not that heauen is
his Country, and that hee is a
Citizen among the Saints, it
doth not appall him: If a
man be in trouble of minde,
and findeth peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
hee will quietly digest
his trouble. But if the minde
bee troubled, who dareth
meete with the wrath of the
Lord of Hoasts? who can put
to silence the voyce of despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
who will step out and
<pb facs="tcp:18472:16"/>
make agreement with the
hills to spare vs, who dare
make a couenant with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
that hee would not lay
claime vnto vs: If then a good
conscience helpeth all euills,
and all other benefites in this
life cannot helpe a troubled
conscience; wee see it true in
proofe, which here is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe;
<hi>The Spirit of a man vvill
susteine his infirmitie: But a
vvounded Spirit, Who can beare
it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, in all other afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we may haue some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
against sinne; this is euer
accompanied with sinne. A
man may be sick, reproched,
imprisoned, and banished; &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:18472:16"/>
yet in all these haue a cleare
conscience, his owne hart tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him that there is no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
cause of these crosses in
him, but that hee may suffer
them for the triall of his faith,
or for righteousnes sake and
well dooing: But when the
Spirite is wounded, there is a
guiltines of sinne; and where
a mans spirite is troubled, hee
suspecteth all his wayes, hee
feareth all his sin, he knowes
not what sin to begin with,
it breeds such hurly burly in
him, that when it is day hee
wisheth for night; when it is
night, he would haue it day:
his meate doth not nourish
him; his sleep often forsaketh
<pb facs="tcp:18472:17"/>
him; his dreames are feareful
vnto him: If he speaketh, he
is little eased; if he keepeth si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
hee boyleth in disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of hart; the light doth not
comfort him, the darkenesse
doth grieue him.</p>
            <p>To prosecute our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons;
where all other euills
are more intolerable, because
they bee temporall, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
vs but to death: this bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not cured endeth not in
death, but becommeth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
For euen the heathen
men thought that death was
the end of all misery: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
whereof made them
(beeing in some misery) to
make an end of themselues,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:17"/>
and hasten their owne death,
as Sathan doth make many
nowe a daies, who are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of hell, which is a place
of farre greater paines than
any they can suffer in this
worlde whatsoeuer. Howe
be it a tormented conscience,
if before it was begun, is now
continued; or if it was not
before, now beginneth and
neuer endeth world without
ende. For though true it is,
that sickenes, pouerty, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
or bannishment,
haue ended their terme in
death; yet a wounded heart
which was temporall in this
life, is nowe eternall after this
life: that which before death
<pb facs="tcp:18472:18"/>
was in hope recouerable, is
after death, made both vncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
&amp; vnrecouerable. It is
good therefore to consider,
if euen in this life the torment
of conscience be so fearefull;
how much more grieuous is
it to susteine it in hell? where
that is infinite, which here is
finite; where that is vnmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
which here is measura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
where is the sea of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
whereof this is but a
droppe; where is the flame
of that fire, whereof this is
lesse then a sparke. But to
shut vp this argument: Some
there haue beene, who tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
out all their life time,
haue been free from all other
<pb facs="tcp:18472:18"/>
troubles, so as either they felt
them not all, or else in very
small measure; and by that
meanes neuer knewe what
outward trouble meant. As
for example, some men there
haue been, who for sicknesse
neuer knew the head-ache;
for pouertie, neuer knewe
what want meant; who for
discredite, were neuer euill
spoken of; who euer put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
them the euill daye of the
Lorde; who haue made a
league with death as it were,
&amp; a couenant with hell; who
thought they could crucifie
anie crosse, rather than come
vnder anie Crosse: yet they
could neuer escape a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:18472:19"/>
conscience, either in this
life, or in the life to come.
True it is, that Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
doo often escape it, but
the wicked, and such as are
borne vnto it, as to their sure
inheritance; the more they
flie from it, the more it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth
them. If we haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
the Ciuill Lawes, the
Iudge by bribes may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
if a man haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
some capitall offence,
by flying the Countrey hee
maye escape the Magistrates
hands: but our Consciences
telling vs that wee haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
against God; what bribe
shall wee offer? or whether
shall wee flie? whether shall
<pb facs="tcp:18472:19"/>
we goe from his spirite? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall wee flie from hys
presence? If we ascend into
heauen, is not hee there? If
we flie to the vtmost parts of
the sea, is hee not there also?
There needeth no Paritor
to summon vs, there needes
no Baylie arraunt to fetche
vs, there needes no accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
to come in agaynst vs:
sinne will arrest vs, and lieth
at the Doore, our owne
Conscience will impanell a
Quest against vs; our owne
heartes will giue in Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
agaynst vs, and our
owne iniquitie will pleade vs
to be guiltie to our owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:20"/>
Now let vs shew how we
may preuent it, and by what
means Gods children falling
into some degrees of it, (for
if it rage in extremitie, it is an
euil vnrecouerable) may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and quietly bee deliuered
from it. And here a iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
is to be taken vp, and it
is a wonder to be marked (if
we may wonder at GODS
workes) that we see so manie
carefull and watchfull to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd
other troubles, and so
few or none take anie paines
to escape the troble of mind,
which is so greeuous. We see
men louing health and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sicknes, in diet temperat,
in sleep moderate, in Phisick
<pb facs="tcp:18472:20"/>
expert, skilfull to purge, and
to auoyde such corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
which in time maye
breed (thogh presently they
doo not bring) forth sicknes:
yet to auoyde the diseases of
the soule, no man abateth his
sleepe, no man abridgeth his
diet, no man prepareth Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
for it; no man knoweth
when to be ful, and when to
be emptie; how to want, and
how to abound. Others car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with the loue of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and verie nigh to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
pouertie, will not sticke to
rise early, to take sleep lately,
to fare hardly, to teare &amp; taw
their flesh in labour by lande
and by water, in faire &amp; soule
<pb facs="tcp:18472:21"/>
weather, by rockes and by
sands, from far &amp; from nere:
and yet to fall into spirituall
decaies, to auoyd the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of conscience, no man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
such paines; as though
saluation and peace of mind,
were not a thing worthy the
labouring for. Some ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
hunting after honor, &amp;
not easilye digesting reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
behaue themselues nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sluggishly nor sleepely;
but are actiue in euerie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
by loue and by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
by prudence and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse,
by wit and by practise,
by labour and learning, by
cunning and diligence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
famous, and to shun a
<pb facs="tcp:18472:21"/>
ciuill reproach: yet to bee
glorious in the sight of God
and his Angells, to fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the heauens, and in the
presence of the Almightie to
bee couered with shame and
confusion of conscience, we
make none accompt, as
they who neyther vse anye
meanes to obteyne the one,
nor auoyde those Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which maye bring the
other.</p>
            <p>Others verie vnwilling
to come within the reache
and daunger of the Lawe,
that they may by reading get
experience howe to escape
imprisonment of bodye, or
confiscation of goods, wyll
<pb facs="tcp:18472:22"/>
be painfull in penall statutes,
skilful in euery branch of the
ciuill law; and especially will
labour to keepe themselues
from treasons, murthers, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
and such like offences
of life and death: yet where
the Lord God threateneth
the seazure both of soule &amp;
bodie, the attaching of our
soules, the confiscating of our
consciences, the banishing of
vs from heauen, the hanging
of vs in hell, the suspending
of our saluation, the adiudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of vs to condemnation
for the breache of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements;
few men ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
his eternall Lawe, few
men careth for the Gospell:
<pb facs="tcp:18472:22"/>
neither the sentence of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
diuorsement from the
Lord, neither the couenant
of reconciliation is esteemed
of vs.</p>
            <p>And to reache our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
one Degree farther.
The more we seek outward
pleasures to auoyde the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
trouble of minde, the
more we hast and runne into
it; and wee speedely plunge
our selues in a wounded spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
or wee be a ware. Who
posteth more to becom rich,
than the merchant man? who
hopeth lesse to become pore,
than hee that aduentureth
great treasures? who hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his goods, who putteth
<pb facs="tcp:18472:23"/>
in ieoperdie of his life; and
yet suddenly he either rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vpon the rocke of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heart, or else is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp of the gulphe of a
despairing mind: from which
happely he cannot be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a ship full of golde.
Woful proofe hath confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how some men (whollie
set on plesures, such as could
not away to be sad, and hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vp alwaies of godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe)
haue had their tables
made snares; and euen theyr
excesse of pleasures, hath
brought excesse of sorrowes:
and whilest they laboured to
put the euill daye farre from
them; they haue vsed follyes
<pb facs="tcp:18472:23"/>
that haue beene the most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and speedie hang-men of
their fearfull trembling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>
            <p>There be some of another
sort, who neuer dreaming of
a troubled minde, haue had
their harts set on nothing but
howe they might get some
great fame and renowme; &amp;
therfore haue slipt into such
vaineglorious attempts, and
foule flatteries, as they haue
not onely lost the peace of
their Consciences, but also
fallen most deeply into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull
shame, which they
sought to shun.</p>
            <p>Now therefore as the
peace of conscience and ioy
<pb facs="tcp:18472:24"/>
of minde is such a treasure, as
the eye hath not seene, the
eare hath not heard, nor the
tung expressed; but passeth al
vnderstanding: &amp; as they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowe what the peace of
minde meaneth, that feele it;
so they alone can in trueth
speake of a troubled minde,
that haue tasted of it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>But let vs shew what way
is to be vsed to keepe vs from
this wound of the spirit. It is
the vse of Phisicke, as to cure
vs of diseases when wee are
faln into them; so to preserue
vs from sicknes before it hath
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hold of vs: it is the power
of the Word, as to asswage
<pb facs="tcp:18472:24"/>
the trouble of Conscience,
when it doth once presse vs;
so to preuent it before it hath
ouertaken vs. It is a chiefe
point of worldly wisedome,
not to tarie for the vse of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
vntil we be deadly sick;
but to bee acquainted wyth
Gods mercifull preseruation
to defend vs from it; likewise
it is a chiefe pollicie of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christian, not only to seek
comfort when the agonie is
vpon him; but also to vse all
good helpes to meet with it
before it comes. And if we
condemn them of folly, who
will not as well labor to keep
themselues out of debt; as to
pay the debt when they owe
<pb facs="tcp:18472:25"/>
it: so it is a madnes not to bee
circumspect to auoyd all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
which maye bring
trouble of mind vpon them;
as wee would bee prouident
to enter euerie good waye
which maye drawe vs out of
this trouble, when wee haue
once entred into it.</p>
            <p>These remedies preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue;
are first the searching of
our sinnes, &amp; the examining
of our faith.</p>
            <p>The examining of our sins,
is either the due acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of our sinnes, or the
true sense and feeling of our
sinnes. The acknowledging
of our sinnes, is eyther of
those that bee past, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:18472:25"/>
wee haue vnfeinedlye
repented vs of them: or of
those which bee present,
whether wee be truely gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly of those secret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
which in the course
of our life are likely to come,
whether wee are reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afraide of them; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
to suppresse them with
all our indeuour.</p>
            <p>Concerning sinnes past, we
must call to minde the sinnes
done of old, in our youth, in
our middle age, in our olde
age; &amp; iudging our selues we
maye not bee iudged of the
Lorde; that accusing of our
selues, satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue no occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:26"/>
to accuse; &amp; throwing down
our selues before the Lord,
he may lift vs vp. For manie
going quietly away, and slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in carnall securitie (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the sins of their
youth) neglecting to make
conscience of their sinnes
done long ago; sodainly haue
falne into such horrour of
minde, that (the violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of all their sins
surcharging them) they haue
been ouerwhelmed.</p>
            <p>This Examination then
dooth rightlye proceede,
when it doth reach to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of this life, &amp; to the sins
of our youth; because many
men (euen from their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:26"/>
by a ciuill righteous
life) hauing escaped grose sins
wherewith the world could
neuer charge them, haue not
withstanding caried the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of more secret sins done
in their youth. Dauid <hi>Psal.</hi>
25. 7. prayeth the Lord, not
to remember the sinnes of his
youth; Iob (23. 6.) the man
of God (confessing that the
Lord writeth bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him) saith, he made him
to possesse the iniquities of
his youth. What, shall wee
think that Dauid or Iob wer
giuen to notorious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in their youth? No, they
knewe they were subiect to
youthful wantonnes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staiednes
<pb facs="tcp:18472:27"/>
of their affections;
which thogh it did not burst
out, yet it made them lesse
carefull to glorifie GOD;
which loosenes, is the way to
leaudnes; which weakenes,
the waye to strange vanities;
which wantonnes, the waye
to open wickednes, is euen
in the best of Gods children
in the dayes of their youth:
which beeing afterwards in
the time of their regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
brought (as it were) to
iudgement, and layde before
their consciences, doth cause
them to repent.</p>
            <p>But here is a thing to bee
blushed at, which maketh
mens eares to tingle when
<pb facs="tcp:18472:27"/>
they heare; that manie men
(farre no doubt from thys
true repentance) can large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indeed discourse of theyr
sinnes done in theyr youth;
but in such a brauerie, with
such boastings, and pleasing
themselues in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of them; as besides
that they prouoke others to
sinne; they likewise set them
selues a flatter backe-byas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Repentaunce: and in
stead of this Christian exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
they seeme to renue
the decayed colours of their
olde sinnes, with the fresh
suite of their second plesures
conceiued in them. But alas
what pleasure haue they in
<pb facs="tcp:18472:28"/>
those things, whereof they
haue no profit? what profit
haue they in those thinges
whereof they should bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed?
neither in this strein
can we forget the madnes of
them, who may seeme to step
one degree farther towardes
this examination of sin, than
did the former; by thinking
that the leauing of sinne, and
repenting of sinne is all one.
Against this, both daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and the word of God
doth sufficiently declare. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs
bretheren (Iacob hys
sonnes) who deuised euill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their brother, put him
into the pit, and sold him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
strangers; did cease from
<pb facs="tcp:18472:28"/>
this crueltie: but yet are not
read to haue remembered
their sins with anie remorce,
vntil thirteene yeres after the
sinne was committed, as we
may see in the processe of the
Historie. Dauid had left hys
sinnes of murther and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
(as thinking all quiet and
well) the space of a whole
yere; after which time (being
admonished by the Prophet
Nathan) hee repented of it.
And experience hath tried in
manie, that though they left
their sinnes manie yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,
hauing had some work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God in them; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they repented not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for them, they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
<pb facs="tcp:18472:29"/>
on them with terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sights and fearfull visions,
to humble them; &amp; to bring
them to serious examination
of them, being done and left
long since. Examples where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
wee need not fetch from
farre, seeing so manie prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
(which are acquainted
with fearfull spirits) will giue
witnes hereof. The frute of
which amazed mindes for
sinnes alreadie left, is ours, to
beware of sinnes which are
to come. And that other
mens harmes might teach vs
blessed wisdome; let vs labor
not onely to leaue sin, which
one may doo for profite, for
feare, for prayers, or for we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risomnes,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:29"/>
but also to repent
of it for conscience sake.</p>
            <p>This Examination of sins
past, must bee partly of those
that wee committed before
our calling, &amp; partly of those
which were done after our
calling. Euerie man (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hauing his reason reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Word of God) wil
grant an examination of the
life, before our true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God in Christ, to be
most needfull. But it may be
some will thinke that wee
need not be so precise in the
searching of those sins, which
were after our knowledge;
but seeing of all other sinnes
these byte sorest and pierce
<pb facs="tcp:18472:30"/>
deepest, for that they are ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated
with all the mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God going before and
after sinne. Sinne is then most
sinfull, when after we know
the truth, after we haue ben
deliuered from sin, after we
haue been inlightened wyth
the grace of God, wee haue
falne into it: I thinke that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
most specialy ought
to be had of those sins. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to it erate our former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in a new matter, as we
maye see the former kinde of
examining; first for sinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our calling, in the sonnes
of Iacob; so wee haue a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of the latter in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the Prophet Dauid,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:30"/>
who at the hearing of his sin
was so troubled in spirit, that
he could not rest though the
Prophet tolde him his sinnes
were forgiuen him, but still
he was disquieted, as though
hee found no comfort in hys
spirite. For as it fareth with
sores, it commeth to pas with
sinnes: we are loath to haue
our wounds often grated v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
we cannot so well away
to haue our sores rifled, sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
lanced; but to be fed with
healing salue: so we are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought to haue our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
grownd, or our sins
ransacked, sifted, searched, &amp;
ripped vp; but could stil haue
them playstered with sweete
<pb facs="tcp:18472:31"/>
promises, and bathed in the
mercies of God: whereas it
is farre safer before incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
and healing Medicines,
to vse corrosiue and mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
waters, without which
though some sores may seem
to cloase and skin vp apace;
yet they proue worse, and be
rotten still at the coare; they
haue aboue a thin skin, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
rotten flesh. In like
manner, wee would cloake,
we wold hide and couer our
sinnes, as it were with a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;
but it is more sound
Chirurgerie to pricke and
pierce our Consciences with
the burning yron of the law;
and to cleanse the wound of
<pb facs="tcp:18472:31"/>
the Soule by sharpe threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
least that skinne being
pulled ouer the Conscience
for a while, wee lament the
rotten corruption, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
vncured vnderneath,
and so we be constrained to
crie out of our sinnes open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
As it is a follye then to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
our soares whilst they
be curable, and after to make
them knowen when they be
vncurable; so it is a great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to dissemble our sinnes
whilest they may be remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and so after be constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to blaze them all abroade
when they are remedilesse.
But of this by the waye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee shall more largely
<pb facs="tcp:18472:32"/>
touch it in the last part to
come.</p>
            <p>It is sufficient to commit
sinne before knowledge, but
after some good light of the
spirit to sin, breedeth eyther
hardnes of heart, or a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
spirite; both which wee
shall auoyd, if in truth we be
careful to watch ouer our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and beware least af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our deliuerie we fall into
sinne againe.</p>
            <p>Seuerall men subiect to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
sinnes, haue their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
checkes in their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
some are ouercom with
wrath, and yet after theyr
moodie fit they can tell, that
the wrath of man dooth not
<pb facs="tcp:18472:32"/>
accomplish the righteousnes
of God; some are subiect to
lust, and after they saye, that
mans life hath another ende;
some slip deeply into world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
and yet they bee often
weakened with most terrible
checkes of conscience. Wel,
blessed are they whose hearts
be truly grieued; &amp; let them
beware that make a daliance
with sinne: for either hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heart will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them, or a troubled con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science
will quite confound
them. Whereby it comes to
pas, that many spending their
bodyes on lust, lament that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they haue so abused then
stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth; many giu'n too much
<pb facs="tcp:18472:33"/>
to the pleasures of thys life,
haue griefe comming vppon
them, to remember howe
they haue spent Gods graces,
banished his good giftes, and
misspent their time; or else, if
they haue not this grief, they
fall into voluptuousnes, and
drawe such a skin vpon their
harts, as will cause the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
denouncement of Gods
iudgements to rebound, bee
they driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on neuer so hard.
And sure it is the sinne of this
world, that men beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled
in their consciences,
whilest they are a praying, &amp;
feele a secrete charge said vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them, to beware of guile
in buying and selling; either
<pb facs="tcp:18472:33"/>
haue theyr checkes, and so
grow to be prophane; or els
afterward they are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
wounded, that they
haue beene so worldlye, so
greatly pursuing earthly and
vaine things; so coldlye pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing
heauenlye and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
things. Thus, euen
our priuy thoughts (not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited)
are breeders of farther
trouble.</p>
            <p>Now the remedie against
this is, willingly and witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not to cherish anie sinne,
to with that the Ministers
should touch our most priuie
and secret sinnes, to bee glad
priuately to be admonished,
to profite by our Enemyes
<pb facs="tcp:18472:34"/>
when they doo reproach vs:
and rather desire (in such a
case) to be humbled, than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our selues to be flattered.</p>
            <p>This trying of our selues
must yet stretch it self farther,
not onely to the committing
of euill, but also to the omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of good. As when (after
some good working of the
spirite, and feeling thereof)
we begin a fight and conflict
with our consciences: thogh
I must pray, I must haue time
also to prouide for my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if I go to heare the word
of God, surely I shall bee in
danger to loose this profite;
if I thus attend vpon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of religion, I shall be
<pb facs="tcp:18472:34"/>
cut short in the vse of my ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
Wherefore it shall be
good to search our heartes,
both in the careles not vsing
of the meanes; but also in the
negligent watching ouer the
frutes of the meanes: saying
to our selues in this manner;
I haue heard a Sermon, but
(alas) without anie feeling or
working vpon my affections;
I haue bin praying, but with
no power of the spirit; I haue
receceyued the Sacrament,
but without those ioyes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
&amp; vnspeakeable, which
I was woont to taste of it; I
sawe the Discipline of the
Church executed, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anie feare of sinne at all
<pb facs="tcp:18472:35"/>
in my selfe, or compassion of
the member censured. And
heere I dare from my owne
obseruation assuredly affirm,
that outwarde sins haue not
beene at some times so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
to Gods Children; as
that they haue some tymes
vsed very good meanes with
little reuerence &amp; lesse frute.
And no maruell, we shal see
many men at some times, not
so much grieued for the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it selfe, as for that they
haue willingly neglected the
meanes, which might haue
preserued their health, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
the Phisicke that might
haue restored their health to
them againe: in like manner
<pb facs="tcp:18472:35"/>
(I saye) it fareth with them,
who eyther vnreuerentlye
haue refused the meanes,
which shoulde keepe theyr
soules from surfetting, or else
vnthankfullye haue abused
those helpes, which might
haue recouered them again.
From hence it commeth, that
some are much grieued for
not vsing their good giftes to
the benefit of Gods Church;
as others are troubled for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing
their good gifts to the
hurt of Gods Church: as we
shall see a rich man somtimes
humbled for not giuing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to the poore, which hee
might haue done; as also for
heaping vp riches falsly, that
<pb facs="tcp:18472:36"/>
hee ought not to haue done.
And thus, manie (hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
good giftes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from the Lord) are seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and sanctified by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
wherby they are taught
to put their gifts in vre, and to
offer their seruice to Christ:
and others are feare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o hide
their gifts, which cannot bee
without some decay of Gods
glory, without offence to the
weake, without the losse of
manie soules, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
might bee wonne to the
Gospell, and without streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
the hand of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie
to slander our darke
and dumbe profession. All
which things will in the end
<pb facs="tcp:18472:36"/>
bring terror gf mind: because
if the Lord cannot work vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs by taking away goods,
credit, wife, children, or such
like, to bring vs to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
he will surely whippe
our naked consciences, hee
will enter euen into our very
entrayles, and pierce our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
bowells.</p>
            <p>As wee must examine
our selues thus for sinne past
and present; so must wee vse
this practise in sinnes that
are to come: and this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
needfull; for were it so,
that our life and conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were such, as neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nor after our calling, any
man could iustlye accuse vs:
<pb facs="tcp:18472:37"/>
Yet the hidden corruption
of our nature, may threaten
some haynous downefall in
time to come. Which hath
made men of verie good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and conuersation hang
downe their heads, and feare
their secret hypocrisie; as that
which may breake foorth to
the shame of all their former
life in time to come.</p>
            <p>But because we forgate to
speak of them, that in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
of their liues past, are
much grieued for the want
of sinceritie, and priuie vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie
in themselues; let vs
beware we go to the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our hearts in sinne.</p>
            <p>To come to speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:18472:37"/>
of those men troubled
for this priuie pride, they are
touched or not touched. If
the veyle of sinne was great
in them, that it hid Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
them; it is the good will of
god, that by this sight of their
most secret sinnes they shuld
come to see the righteousnes
that is in Christ Iesus; and so
they shall be kept the better
from being Iusticiarie Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies:
for when beeing a long
time well brought vp, &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a ciuill life, the Diuell
would perswade vs of some
inherent righteousnes in vs;
It is the wisedome of God to
touch vs with the conscience
of most hidden corruptions,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:38"/>
as allso to make knowen
vnto vs, that euen from our
birth there was a secret feede
of sinne in vs, which (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Lord watching ouer
vs) woulde surely haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
forth to his dishonor.</p>
            <p>As for them which haue
had some woorking in them,
and yet are often plunged in
sore distresses; this trouble
commeth to them for two
especiall causes; either for
some hypocrisie, which they
did more in showe than in
truth; wherefore the Lorde
bringeth them backe agayne
to see their corrupt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
&amp; that they may knowe
that al their religion is but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:38"/>
and all their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
to bee but vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes:
or for the abusing of
their knowledge, in that they
made it but a mask to iuggle
in, and that they made theyr
affections to fight with their
owne iudgments. Wee must
remedie this, by not thinking
of our selues aboue that that
is meete, and by labouring to
embrace the truth. And here
let vs note, that many of gods
Children accuse themselues
of hypocrisie, when indeede
they offend not in it. And yet
this accusation ariseth from
some fault: for though they
haue done things in truth, yet
becaus they stroue not to see
<pb facs="tcp:18472:39"/>
their secrete corruptions, in
some other matters; they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine
this troubled minde.
So that there is nothing har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than to sift and serch our
owne hearts at the bottome,
whether we respect our sins
past or present, whether we
we looke to our priuy pride,
hidden wants, or secret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
And to retourne
from whence wee were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed,
to the examination
of our heartes. In sinnes to
come, let vs obserue that in
Gods children there is such a
iealousie, that they tremble at
the verie first motions and
quake at the least occasion to
sinne, although because vice
<pb facs="tcp:18472:39"/>
will sit in residence very nere
vnto vertue; there may be in
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> somtime too much scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulousnes:
this feare causeth
the dearest of the Saintes of
God to reason on this sort;
O Lord, I see how many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
men in gifts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in profession for a long
time, whose end hath not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
their Beginnings;
whose death was not like to
their liues. This is true, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we looke into the word
or into the world: and it is a
thing that maye much hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vs. For though we maye
remember what wee haue
been, and knowe what wee
are; yet who can tell what
<pb facs="tcp:18472:40"/>
may come vnto him heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Oh that the serious medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
heereof, would dwell
long vpon our consciences:
that with a holie iealozie wee
might preuent that sin that is
to come. But alas, there bee
some wayne people, whych
thinke it no masterie to offer
themselues to masking, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strelsie
and dauncing, nor to
runne into quarrells, braules
and contentions; as though
they had theyr eares, theyr
eyes, theyr hands and theyr
feete in their owne power,
and at commaundement to
vse &amp; gouerne as themselues
list.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:40"/>
Howbeit, GODS Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
better fenced with hys
grace, than those bolde buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardes,
are afrayde of these
occasions; as knowing full
well, that theyr eyes maye
soone bee prouoked to lust,
their eares maye quicklye li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
vnto vnchast delightes,
their handes maye sodainely
strike a deadly blowe, and
their feete may easely be sna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the spreaded nettes of
carnall pleasures.</p>
            <p>Beware O man, bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect
O Woman, that
thou prostitute not thy selfe
to too much libertie: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh
in comming to such la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciuious
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentious places
<pb facs="tcp:18472:41"/>
thou diddest purpose none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
yet for thy ventring with
out warrant, thou mayst bee
ouer thy shooes in sinne, and
plunged in some wicked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
ouer head and cares,
ere thou beest aware. And
yet because vice is so confine
vnto vertue, beware also of
superstition: for still the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
laboureth to make thee
too hardie in sinne, or else he
will cause thee to be too fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and superstitious; eyther
hee will puffe thee vp with
presumption, or assault thee
with desperation. To these
tentations our nature is very
appliable: first to presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as maye appeare by our
<pb facs="tcp:18472:41"/>
common speech; tush, the
Preacher is but a man as I
am, I am sure he hath infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as others haue; wee are
no Angels, our nature is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
we are but men, I am
sure you would not haue vs
Gods. Thus the diuell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to tempt; but he appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relleth
himselfe in another
sute when hee commeth to
accuse: and then of a flye he
maketh an elephant, of the
very smallest pricke of a pin
a gloabe of the whole earth,
of a moal-hill a mountain: &amp;
presseth silly soules with fear
&amp; terror, that they know not
how to winde themselues. If
he cannot bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make
<pb facs="tcp:18472:42"/>
conscience where they shuld
make conscience, hee will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to bring them to make
conscience where they need
make no conscience. He ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not whether thou be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
or superstitious, so thou
be one of them. If he cannot
get you to follow the epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme
of the world, as Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
in diet and apparell; hee
wil make you so precise, as to
thinke it a hainous sinne, to
eare one bit of meate, or to
weare one ragge of cloath
more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for necessity. How
needfull therefore it is to saile
with an euen course, we may
coniecture by other thinges
which will bewraye the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb facs="tcp:18472:42"/>
of our nature.</p>
            <p>In the time of a plague we
shall see some will be so bold,
that without anie lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or godly warraunt, they
will rush into places infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and then falling sicke,
their conscience pricks them
for their tempting of God by
an vnaduised boldnes in the
instaunt moment of theyr
death.</p>
            <p>Others plunged as deeply
in a quite contrarie extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
are too fearefull when
they doo but heare of sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and for very feare haue
been brought to deaths dore
onely by imagining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to haue been infected,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:43"/>
when they haue beene most
free, who oftentimes haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
died, and that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
naturall cause that euer
could be knowen, but onely
through immoderate fear &amp;
the iudgement of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vpon them for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie
and vnbeliefe. Thus
it is with vs in Christianitie, in
that as well the oppressing
our selues with too much
feare to be ouercome, as the
carnall securitie, in not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bee ouercome, maye
bring sinne vpon vs. God his
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must labor for a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and that must be sought
for in the Word, which wyll
teach them how they shall
<pb facs="tcp:18472:43"/>
neither decline on the right
hand, nor on the left; but wil
guide them in the narrowe
way, showing in euery thing
what is the vertue, what is
the vice; what is the meane,
what is the extreame.</p>
            <p>Among manie Examples,
let vs consider of zeale, a most
precious vertue in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
so long as it is free from
the extremities.</p>
            <p>If we be cold in zeale, it is
a sinne on the left hand: if we
bee zealous without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
it is preposterous, and
becommeth a sinne on the
right hand.</p>
            <p>But can wee not come to
some perfection? No, if you
<pb facs="tcp:18472:44"/>
vnderstand it for an absolute
vnspottednes; albeit to that
perfection which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
taketh for soundnesse,
truth, and sinceritie of hart,
which is voyd of careles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missenes,
we may come. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth the lord deal with
vs after our sins, nor reward
vs after our iniquities: in
whole eies the most glorious
actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of men, are but as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
flowing purely from the
Conduit, but defiled by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through a filthy chanell:
Wherefore although wee
haue our imperfections, let
vs not seeke to be more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
than we can be; saying
for euerie errour of this life,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:44"/>
Oh, I am none of Gods hys
sonnes, I am none of hys
daughters: for I cannot find
that perfection in me, which
is to be required. But let vs
comfort our selues in the
truth of our hearts, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenes
of our desires to serue
God, because he is God; and
so wee shall bee accepted of
God.</p>
            <p>I speake this to this end, that
poore soules might haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
&amp; know that if they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
sinne as sinne, if they exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
themselues for it, if they
feare to fall into it; the Lord
will not pursue them with
the rigor of his lawe, but wil
giue them the sweetnesse of
<pb facs="tcp:18472:45"/>
his promises; they are no
more vnder the curse, but
vnder grace.</p>
            <p>But farther to inforce our
Exhortation, to auoyde too
scrupulous feare, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
the true examination
of our heartes: let vs thinke
that it happeneth in the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
conflict as in ciuill war.
Wee read that manie Citties
being in great securitie, haue
sodainly both been assaulted
&amp; ouerthrowen; as also, how
some Countries (too much
negligent in the meanes) tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
an excessiue feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
haue incouraged theyr
Enemies with more greedie
violence to pray vpon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:45"/>
With such kinde of strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems
our aduersarie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
beeing well acquainted,
doth often practise this polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
If hee see vs without all
fear too quietly to rest in our
selues, he thinketh his assault
must needes be the stronger,
because our assistaunce is the
weaker. Againe, if he descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in vs a cowardly fear and
fainting of heart, before wee
once begin to ioyne battaile
with him; hee will set vppon
our immoderate feare, and
as villainously as sodenly stab
vs to the heart, &amp; make a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
spoyle of vs.</p>
            <p>Common practise dooth
farther teach vs, that when
<pb facs="tcp:18472:46"/>
we can heare the word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all trembling at God hys
iudgements, when wee can
pray without all feare before
the Maiestie of God, when
wee can come to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church without
all reuerence of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Lorde; all is in
vaine. Againe, let vs heare
with too much trembling, &amp;
wee shall learne nothing; let
vs pray with too seruil a fear,
&amp; our worshipping of God
will be (without all comfort)
vnchearfull. Thus if we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lessen sinne, that is sinne
indeed; neither make sinne
of that which is not sinne: in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uth it is good to proceed to
<pb facs="tcp:18472:46"/>
this threefolde examination
and to laye the edge of this
doctrin nere our affections,
because manie will be found
in this ripenes of knowledge
and hardnes of conscience to
speake, dispute and declare of
all these things very skilfully,
with flickring in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the brain, and not
sitting at the ground of the
hart, doo seale vp a more iust
sentence of condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. To help this euil
we must meditate deeply of
the Law &amp; the Gospell, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the appurtenances
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, that finding our
selues farre from Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
by the law, &amp; seing our
<pb facs="tcp:18472:47"/>
selues ouer to the curses due
to the breakers of the Lawe,
wee maye raise vp some sense
of sin in our selues. Yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we must not stay our foote
but goe a farther stryde: for
whereas manie by a diligent
view of the lawe, haue come
to the sense of sinne in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and saw plainly their
own condemnation; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they labored not to see
their guiltinesse acquited by
the remission in Christ, they
plunged themselues into a
bottomles sea of sorrowes.
Others haue passed these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and hithertoo haue
made these steppes to auoyd
this wound of Conscience;
<pb facs="tcp:18472:47"/>
and yet haue come also too
short, and missed of the
marke: who because of the
sence of sinnes pardoned by
the death of Christ, they felt
not also the vertue of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
crucifiyng sinne in them,
but sawe that with the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sinne was not ioyned
the mortification of sin; and
feared that there was no
forgiuenes for them, but still
languishing with sorow, they
thought them-selues to stand
charged with their former
guiltines. Yea, that which is
more, for that such men haue
not beene instructed, nor
surely haue beene grounded
in the Doctrine of Christes
<pb facs="tcp:18472:48"/>
death and resurrection; it is
for that they sawe not as well
power flowing from his
death to slay sinne in them, as
vertue to pardon sin in them;
for that they felt not as well
strength to Sanctification,
streaming from the rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
of Christ, as they were
perswaded of iustification &amp;
righteousnes therein. They
haue lyne still bleeding at the
heart, in such sort as the
wound of griefs could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
or neuer bee staunched.
Wherefore let vs strengthen
our weake soules wyth thys
seuen-fold coard of consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
agaynst these bitter as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saultes:
let vs first labour to
<pb facs="tcp:18472:48"/>
know sinne, then to sorrowe
for sinne, after to feele our
sinnes in Christ forgiuen, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to looke for power to
crucifie the same, then to lay
holde on iustification by his
resurrection; and lastly, hope
for strength to proceed from
thence, to further vs in sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and holines of life,
euen vnto the end. And thus
much briefly for the second
thing which wee matched in
companie with the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sinne, euen the tryall
of faith: both which rightly
vsed, shall in some measure
sauegard vs from the trouble
of an afflicted minde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:49"/>
Now let vs hasten to the
third part of our Deuision;
to shew how Gods children
being fallen into this wound
of spirit, may be holpe out of
it: which (God willing) wee
will also performe, after we
haue aunswered a necessarie
obiection; which (in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part) might seeme to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
against vs. There is
no man but will graunt, that
Dauid, Iob, and others of the
Saints of God, had a sight of
their sinnes, a sorow for their
sinnes, a taste of the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their sinnes; and yet
how commeth it to pas, that
these men were so troubled
in minde? To this I answere,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:49"/>
that their trouble so befell
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either for falling in some
of these former things; or els
they were rather afflicted
for tryall of their faith, than
for persecuting of sinne in
them. And therefore be it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
prouided, that wee
thinke not euerie conflict of
Conscience, continually or
chiefely to bee for the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our sinnes: but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
and principally, that it
commeth for the trial of our
faith: and yet secondarily or
lesse principally, for the scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of sinne, as wee may see
in Iob.</p>
            <p>Whereuppon let all men
bee admonished, when they
<pb facs="tcp:18472:50"/>
see good men thus humbled
and throwen down in mind,
to laye their handes on theyr
mouthes from saying; Surely
these men are but hipocrites,
doubtles these men be great
sinners, the Lord hath found
out their iniquitie, the Lord
hath discouered their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.
For good reason there
is, that such silence should be
vsed: for the Lorde maye as
well make triall of their faith,
as take punishment of theyr
sinnes. For if such affliction
should alwaies and chieflye
be sent for sinne, then it shuld
follow that all others as they
exceeded them in sin, should
also exceed them in the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb facs="tcp:18472:50"/>
of sinne.</p>
            <p>But now comming to the
saluing of this soare, I shall
seeme verie straunge in my
cure: and so much the more
to bee wondered at, by how
much in manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I discent from the most
sort of men herein.</p>
            <p>I am not ignoraunt, that
manie visiting afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
crye still; Oh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them, oh speake ioyfull
and comfortable things vnto
them.</p>
            <p>Yea, there bee some, and
those most excellently learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who in such cases are full
of these and such lyke spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:51"/>
Why art thou so heauie my
brother? Why art thou so
cast downe my sister? Bee of
good cheere: take it not so
greeuously. What is there
that you should feare? God is
mercifull, Christ is a Sauiour.
These bee speeches of good
comfort indeed: but they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
doo the poore soules as
much good herein, as if they
should powre cold water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their bosomes; when as
without farther searching of
their soares, they may as well
minister a maladie as a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine:
for as nutritiue and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall
medicines are not good
for euerie sicke person, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the bodye need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:18472:51"/>
rather a strong purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than a matter restoratiue;
and as incarnatiue medicines
for the time allaye the payne
of the patient; but after the
greefe becommeth more
greuous: so the comfortable
applying of Gods promises
are not so profitable for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one that is humbled, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye
when their soules are
rather to be cast downe, than
as yet to bee raised vp: so the
sugred consolations may for
a time ouer-heale the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and abate some present
greefe, but so as afterwardes
the smart will be the sorer, &amp;
the grief may grow the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
whereof insueth this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:52"/>
that comfort seemeth to
cure for a while; but throgh
want of wisdome in the right
discerning of the cause, wee
minister one medicine for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
and so for want of skil
the latter fitte grindeth them
sorer than the former. Some
there be, who without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
and practise wilbe theyr
owne Phisitions: and these,
so soone as the fit commeth
vpon them, thinke it the best
to chastise and to chase awaye
their sorrowe, by drinking at
tauernes, by minstrelsie, in
merrie companie, by purging
melancholy, in phisicke, all
which seeme to weare away
the paine for a while, but yet
<pb facs="tcp:18472:52"/>
after it byteth more deeplye,
when the burning feauer of
the spirit shaketh them wyth
a seconde recourse, and for
that before they were not
truly searched, purged, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and launced, it commeth
to passe that the seconde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps
is more dangerous than
the first.</p>
            <p>To come to our purpose
wee must knowe, that all
griefes are either confused or
distinct: and sure it is that the
minde is appalled eyther for
some cause verye well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to vs as certaine, or for
something vnknowen to vs
and vncertaine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:53"/>
To them which are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with such blinde griefes,
whereof they can see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as often it happeneth to
Gods Children; who either
neuer knew God, or had but
a general knowledge of him.
I answere, that as I denie no
Phisicke to bee ministred, if it
in part proceed from a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
cause, so I require the
word especially to shew the
principall and originall cause
to begin in the soule. And this
I doo the rather, because I
would haue wisedome both
in considering the state of the
bodie if need so require; and
in looking chiefly to the soul,
which so few thinke of. If a
<pb facs="tcp:18472:53"/>
man troubled in conscience
come to a Minister, it may be
he will looke all to the soule
and nothing all to the bodie; if
hee commeth to a Phisition,
hee onely considereth of the
bodie, &amp; neglecteth the soul:
for my part, I would neuer
haue the Phisitions counsell
seuered, nor the Ministers la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
neglected; because the
soule and bodie dwelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it is conuenient, that
as the soule should be cured
by the word, by prayer, and
by fasting, by threatening, or
by comforting; so the bodye
also should bee brought into
some temperature, by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
by purging, by dyet,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:54"/>
by restoring, by musike, and
by such like meanes; prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
alwayes that it bee styll
done so in the feare of God,
and wisedome of his spirite,
as we thinke not by these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
meanes to smoother
or smoake out our troubles;
but as purposing to vse them
as preparatiues, whereby
both our soules and bodyes
may bee made more capable
of the spirituall meanes to
follow after.</p>
            <p>As we require these things
to bee the matter of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
in such a perplexitie;
so I would wish the persons
ministring to be men learned
and of sounde iudgement,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:54"/>
wise, and of Godlye experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
meeke and of most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
spirites: for when the
troubled patient shal be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of our knowledge
and discretion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
shall perceiue vs to
come in tender and louyng
affections, I thinke an ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
is in a manner made,
and all preiudice is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
so as wee may the more
freely woorke vppon the
greeued Conscience; first
bringing them to the sight of
sinne, as to some cause of
their trouble.</p>
            <p>Heerein wee must labour
to put awaye all confusion
and blindnesse of sorrowe,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:55"/>
endeuoring by wisedome to
bring the parts wounded to
some certaine obiect &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their trouble; and so
drawe out of them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of some especiall, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
and seuerall sinne; I say
secrete and seuerall sinnes,
because I know, how manie
(through a palpable blindnes
or disordered discerning of
sinne) talke nothing so much
as of sinne; and yet they ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discrie seuerall sinnes, or
they will not bee brought to
acknowledge theyr secrete
sinnes: whereof the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
of the ignorance of
the Lawe of God, the other
of selfe loue, which maketh
<pb facs="tcp:18472:55"/>
vs loath in our trauel of mind
to shame our selues.</p>
            <p>Now that the confession
of perticular sinnes is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
it maye appeare by the
two and thirtieth Psalme,
wherein (beeing a Psalme of
instruction, concerning the
forgiuenesse of sinnes) the
Prophet (by his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience)
teacheth vs, that hee
could finde no reliefe of hys
sicknes, vntill he had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
and made confession
of his sinnes.</p>
            <p>What, shal we thinke that
the Prophet of God (taught
so wonderfully by the word
and by the spirite) did not see
his sinnes before? Be it farre
<pb facs="tcp:18472:56"/>
from vs. Rather let vs know
that he had not seuerally and
perticularlye ripped vp hys
sinnes before the Lorde, in a
seuerall confession of them.
Which things the Lord kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
farre better than wee
our selues: yet such kinde of
sacrifice is most acceptable
vnto him.</p>
            <p>Now if in this trouble the
persons humbled can not
come to the perticular sight
of sinne in themselues, it is
good to vse the help of other
vnto whom they maye offer
their hearts to bee gaged and
searched, and their liues to
bee examined more deeply
by hearing the seuerall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb facs="tcp:18472:56"/>
of the law laid open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; wherby they may
square the whole course of
their actions. For (as we said
before) the grosest hypocrite
will generally complaine of
sinne; and yet deale wyth
them in perticular poynts of
perticular precepts, &amp; proue
them in applying of things
to bee done or vndone to
their owne consciences; and
wee shall see manie of these
poore soules tossed too and
fro, now floting in ioies, now
plunged in sorrowes, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to distinguish one sin fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
another. Now when we see
the wound of the spirit arise
of any known sin, it is eyther
<pb facs="tcp:18472:57"/>
for some sinne alreadie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
wherein wee lie; or
els for some sinne as yet not
committed, whereunto wee
are tempted.</p>
            <p>For the former. It pleaseth
God oftentimes to bring old
sinnes to minde, when wee
not truely repented of them
before; that so (as it were) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
them to vs afresh,
we might fal into a more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
of them. And yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is not all, to mislike our
selues for some perticulars,
although it bee good to bee
occupied about some speciall
sinnes: for as it is not enough
for the auoyding of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
to see some generally: so
<pb facs="tcp:18472:57"/>
it is not enough to eschue the
deceauablenes of the heart,
euer to bee poaring busily in
one perticuler, and to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull
of the great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sinnes. And let vs learne
by the perticulers to passe by
the generalls. When anye
such one sinne then dooth
pursue thee, rest not onelye
therein, but saye thus rather
to thy selfe; Oh Lord, is thys
one sinne so grieuous? and
dooth my God punnish thys
one sinne so soarely? Howe
great then should be my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
if thou shouldest
(O Lord) so deale with mee
for al my other sinnes I haue

               <pb facs="tcp:18472:58"/>
Let vs learne to haue a sense
both of generall and of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sinnes, least in tyme
our griefe passe away wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
frute; whilest that beeing
not displeafed as well wyth
one sinne, as with another;
we either looke too superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to generall, and not to
perticulars; or els too super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously
obserue perticulers
and not the generals.</p>
            <p>Concerning those sinnes
whereunto we are tempted;
as when a man is mooued to
think blasphemously of God
the Father, or to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a Christ or no,
or to imagine grosely of the
holy Ghost, or to deny God,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:58"/>
or to doubt of the Trinitie;
to be mooued to murther, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultrie,
or such like: in which
temptations he feeleth Gods
spirit to check him for them,
so as he knoweth not in thys
case what to doo, for that on
the one side he dares not list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
willingly to these fearefull
and monstrous temptations;
and on the other side, he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
least in time by long sute
he might fall into them, or at
the least yeeld, for that he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not how to be deliuered
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. I suppose these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are not so much to bee
disputed with, as we by them
are to be prouoked to more
instant and zealous praier.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:59"/>
Surely these are dangerous
temptations, and therefore
are not to bee kept cloase;
which our nature will easely
encline vnto: but perticular<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
are to bee confessed of vs.
For the diuel will come som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to thee, to keepe thee
still in a generall acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of thy sinne, and vrge
on this manner; Surely thou
must needes doo this sinne,
thou seest thou canst haue no
ease, vntill thou hast assented,
thou art ordained to it: the
reason why thou art thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly
tempted, is because
thou doost not take thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Go too, delay not, denie
God, beleeue not his word:
<pb facs="tcp:18472:59"/>
it is but a pollicie to keepe
men in awe, Religion is no
such matter as men make it.
Thus for feare of yeelding
on the one hande, and for
shame of disclosing the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
on the other hande;
many men haue pined away,
and almost haue beene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by them. If we should
disclose this (say these men)
what would people say of vs?
They would count vs Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,
they would thinke vs the
wickedst men in the worlde.
Well for our instruction and
consolation herein; Let vs
learn that these kind of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are either corrections
for some sinnes past, or the
<pb facs="tcp:18472:60"/>
punishment of sins present,
or forewarners of some sin
to come. Wee shall see many
tempted to adultery, who
now (no doubt) cannot bee
be brought to commit it; and
yet because in their youth
they haue committed it, and
&amp; not repented of it, it coms
to them againe. The like may
bee obserued in theft, in glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,
and in other tentations,
which are not so much sent
vnto vs, presently to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vs, as to put vs in mind,
that hertofore we hauing bin
ouercome with them, should
now repent for them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
a man shall lye in some
sin, wherof when he will not
<pb facs="tcp:18472:60"/>
bee admonished, neither by
the priuate nor publike
meanes, &amp; then some strange
tentation shall fall vpon him,
differing from that wherein
he presently lyeth, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him of that other sinne.
As when a worldling shal be
tempted to adulterie, a thing
which hee hath no desire to
do, yet it is to make him look
to his worldlines, whereof he
hath so strong and through a
lyking. Whereas if then he
will not bee awaken, he may
sodainely fall into that too,
and so by the punishment
of GOD in punishing one
sinne with another, both his
sinnes shall bee to his great
<pb facs="tcp:18472:61"/>
shame laid open, and one sin
shall make knowne another.
Sometime also it commeth
to passe, that one shall bee
tempted with such a sinne, as
neither heretofore, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
hee hath giuen any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or entertaignement vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and yet the Lord by it may
forewarne him how hee may
fall into it hereafter, as also to
shew that hee hath stoode all
his former life, rather by the
grace of god, than by the
strength of flesh and blood.
Wherefore when thou art
moued to doubt of God and
of Christ, of the word or of
iustification, doo not so much
stande woondring at these
<pb facs="tcp:18472:61"/>
strong tentations, as thinke
with thy selfe that it is the
mercie of God by them, to
cause thee better to discerne
of those tentations in others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Wherefore thou shouldest
haue obserued with feare &amp;
trembling howe they make
the first entry into a mans
heart, howe they gather
strength, howe they agree
with our corrupt nature, in
what degrees they come to
some growth, how the spirite
of God dooth resist them,
what bee the meanes best to
preuaile against them. And
thus if thou make thy profite
by them, thou shalt so woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
search and descrie by
<pb facs="tcp:18472:62"/>
seuerall veines, the body, age
and sleight of these tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in others, by an holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
which GOD hath
taught thee in others, that
besides thou shalt lay foorth
mens secrete corruptions, as
if thou wast in their bosomes,
thou shalt be able by the seed
of sorrowe in thy selfe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
an vnspeakeable ioy in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who in time may bee
tempted to sin as thou nowe
art.</p>
            <p>Thinke moreouer and
besides, that such is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
of sinne, that they who
are nowe no Papistes, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
Adulterers, or
Theeues, may for their
<pb facs="tcp:18472:62"/>
secure contemning and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
ouer these tentations
sent vnto them sodainely,
shortly after fall into them,
because they woulde not
seeke to make some vse of
them, nor confesse before
the Lorde both their prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and worthinesse to fall
into them.</p>
            <p>But if wee will humble
our selues in such tentations,
and learne by them meekely
to discerne the corruption of
our hearts, we shall not only
presently deliuer our selues
from imminent perill, but
bee also further enhabled to
assist others hereafter, in the
like danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:63"/>
But some wil oppose against
these things which wee haue
deliuered: Doo you thinke
it a remedie to cast downe
them that bee already hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled?
this is rather to bee a
Butcher than a builder of a
mans conscience. To whom
I answere, that I desire Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to be Builders, and not
Butchers; and it is one thing
generally to apply, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perticular to lay the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
vnto the wound. It is
good to begin with searching
first, to purge the sore by the
vineger of the Lawe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to supple it with the oyle
of the Gospell. Both which
must bee done in wisedome,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:63"/>
vsing them to some in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to some in lesser measure.
For as some hauing nothing
but a decay of nature, and no
mortall humor, neede rather
restoratiue, than purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines:
So some rather trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for spirituall wants, than
for grosse sinnes, needes not
so much the threatninges of
the Lawe, as the sweete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospell. But if
the body, thorough some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
repletion hath
gotten some great surfet, not
so much to the weakening of
nature, as to the threatning of
imminent death, and therfore
requireth rather some strong
purgation than comfortable
<pb facs="tcp:18472:64"/>
and cordiall medecines: then
the soule also being brought
to some extraordinary sinne
is rather to bee boared and
pierced with the denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Gods iudgement tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
otherwise. But because wee
woulde deale more plainely
&amp; lesse confusedly, it is good
in our accesse to the afflicted
consciences, to lay these two
grounds. First, we must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the persons humbled,
that their sins are pardonable
&amp; their soules curable: And
after, that this visitation is not
so much a signe of Gods
wrath and anger, as a seale of
his loue and fauour, in that it
is not either blind or barren,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:64"/>
but plentiful in good effects,
and fruitefull in Godly issues.
The former howe needefull
it is, the experience of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as haue beene throwne
downe, is a sufficient witnes,
who haue had this as a tagge
tyed in their tentations: The
Lord wil surely make an end
of them in some strange and
vnknown tentation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are not vnlike vnto
men fallen into some dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
disease, who thinking to
bee without the fadome of
the Phisitians skill, and not to
bee within the compasse of
thinges recouerable, adde a
second and sorer griefe vnto
their former.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:65"/>
Wherefore as these men
seeme to bee halfe healed,
when any man of knowledg
can bee brought, who by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath cured the like
malladie in like degrees in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
So then the fearefull
soules are not a little by hope
refreshed and strengthned to
looke for some ease, when
they see none other tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath ouertaken them, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
such as hauing fallen into the
nature of man, haue found
mercie at the handes of God
that hee might bee feared.
This ground worke framed,
it is good to build vp and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
the decayed ioy of the
minde, partly by the Law, to
<pb facs="tcp:18472:65"/>
make a preparatiue for these
ioyes; if the minde not truly
humbled, is not fit truly to be
comforted: and partly by the
gospel, if the conscience kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
throwen down, is become
a fit subiect to apply the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Iesus Christ vnto it.
And here againe, to answere
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that denie the law wholly
or at all to bee vsed, when we
wold breed comfort in one.
I demand, whether if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to maintaine the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
of Christ, it bee not
also as necessarie to preserue
the righteousnes of the Law?
Seing the righteousnes of the
Law, of vs not fulfilled, wyll
drawe vs vnto the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:18472:66"/>
of Christ to vs imputed.
And sith the righteousnes of
Christ to vs imputed, is neuer
throughly and truly esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
vntil we see the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the law of vs to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performed.
Again, if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior
Christ did fore shew his
Disciples, that the first worke
of the holy Ghost at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
should bee to conuict
the world of sinne, to make
men know, that without Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ ther is nothing but
sinne; and then, that he shuld
rebuke the World of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,
that they might see
Christ died not for his owne,
but the sins of others. I see
not why it should not be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:18472:66"/>
conuenient, first to lay ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the righteousnes of the law,
that men maye see their sins;
and then the righteousnes of
Christ; that men may see their
sinnes discharged in him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
wher the Lord saith by
his Prophet, <hi>At vvhat time
soeuer a sinner dooth repent of his
sins from the bottom of his hart,
I vvill put all his vvickednes out
of my remembrance:</hi> that it may
well be gathered there must
be a sound sorrow for sin go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, and then the true
ioy of sinnes pardoned, may
the more frely be looked for
afterward. Moreouer, seeing
al the promises of God in the
gospel are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto vs
<pb facs="tcp:18472:67"/>
vnder the title &amp; tenor of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
sight to the blind, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the deafe, strength to
the lame, health to the sicke,
and life to the dead; it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
not onely that there is
no disease of the soule that
Christ cannot heale: but also
that wee must first finde our
selues blinde, deafe, dumbe,
lame, sicke &amp; dead, before he
wil meddle with vs; because
they that are whole need not
the Phisition, and he came to
call sinners, not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to repentance. Now, to
doo this in wisedome, by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pressing the conscience
too seuerely, nor releasing
the conscience more vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:67"/>
it shalbe the safe way, to
vse the wel tempered speech
of the Apostle to the sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer;
Repent, if it be possible,
thy sinnes may bee forgiuen
thee. Where hee dooth not
wholly discourage him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may bee his sins may
be pardoned; neither yet too
boldly incourage him, that
without repentance, he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
it altogether impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be pardoned. And that
we be not too preposterous
in our consolations, let vs bee
warned by the blasphemous
speeches of the detestable
Arrian, who of late yeares
was put to deth at Norwich.
This hellish heretique, a little
<pb facs="tcp:18472:68"/>
before he shuld be executed,
afforded a few whorish tears
asking whether he might bee
saued in Christ or no? When
one told him, that if he truely
repented, he shuld surely not
perrish: hee brake out most
monstrously into this speech:
Nay is your Christ so easily to
be intreated indeede, as you
say? Then I defie him &amp; care
not for him. Oh howe good a
thing had it been not to haue
cast this pretious stone to this
swine? Oh how safe had it bin
to haue dealt more bitterly,
and dwelt more vehemently
on the conscience of this cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise?
Now to attaine some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in curing this woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:18472:68"/>
spirite, wee must learne
wisely to iudge, both of the
person afflicted, and of the
nature of his affliction. First,
we must note whether it be a
man or a woman, becaus we
may vrge more carefully the
vse of the law to a man, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the stronger vessell. And
as Sathan knew the woman
to be most easie and framea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be wrought vppon, at
his first temptation: so is hee
not ignoraunt that shee is the
weaker partie to susteine an
accusation.</p>
            <p>Then let vs consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they that are thus humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
haue knowledge or no?
Because, if they haue none,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:69"/>
they thinke trouble of minde
to be so strange a thing, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any before it: if they haue
knowledge, then Sathan is
readie to accuse them of sins
agaynst the holye Ghost, as
though anie sin done against
knowledge, were a sinne of
presumption. Farther, we are
to enquire, how strong or
weake they are, that if they
be not sufficiently wounded
to touch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with some deep
sense of sinne. Also we must
be circumspect, to finde out
whether by nature they are
more fearfull or melancholy,
or no? As also, whether they
be vsuall sinners, or haue faln
once of infirmitie, that so vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb facs="tcp:18472:69"/>
their disposition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
we may builde our
speech the better. To these
it is good to adde this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the persons, age,
estate and ability; as if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
bee troubled for worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whether hee bee not a
great housholder: if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of vncleannesse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be not a yong-man &amp;
vnmaried: if he be humbled
with couetousnesse, whether
he be not old, because diuers
countries, callings, ages, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and estates of men,
haue their diuers and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
sinnes, which wee must
rightly discerne. Howbeit of
what sex soeuer they are ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:70"/>
or woman of what complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
soeuer they are, of what
knowledge to discerne sin, in
what degree of committing
sinne, of what age, authority,
wealth, estate, or condition so
euer they are, it is good to
marke that there bee many,
who are more troubled for
vexation and disquietnes of
the mind being distempered,
than for the vilenes and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riblenes
of their sin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
who are wounded more
with the feare of shame, with
the feare of beeing madd, or
with the feare of running out
of their wittes, than with the
conscience of sinne. Which
thing if we finde in them, it is
<pb facs="tcp:18472:70"/>
our parts to trauell with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that they make a lesse matter
of the outward shame, and
more Conscience of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sins. Neither must wee
here forget to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our speech vsed to the
humbled in the time of theyr
extreame agonie, and those
words wee vse the fit beeing
past; because the first requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
more comfort, the latter
more admonishment: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wee maye wisely admonish
them to beware of sin, which
procured their woe. In thys
threatening time, it is also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to exhort them, that
vntill they shuld find greater
power in regeneration, they
<pb facs="tcp:18472:71"/>
would ty themselues to some
holy orders, &amp; godly vowes,
whereby they may either be
furthred in mortifying some
speciall sinne; which for that
they could finde no power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, did most grieue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
or strengthened in some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
grace, the want whereof
did also wound them. But
before we launch deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this sea of perticular ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and begyn to sounde
the daungerous passages of
natural corruptions, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
sinne, the troublesome
froath whereof, doth almost
ouerwhelme manie poore
pilgrimes; it shall be good to
giue this caution, that both in
<pb facs="tcp:18472:71"/>
this and in the former trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
men would bee still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
admonished, patiently
to bear with a wounded spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
howbeit it fall out so, that
they be somwhat pettish; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the holye Ghost speaketh
so fauorably of them, saying;
<hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi>
And surely our practise in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, by the lawe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
maye vrge thys at our
hands. For if men by the light
of reason can see it to bee a
duetie conuenient, not furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to control, but meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to suffer, and wisely to put
vp the vnaduised speeches of
a man distempered in braine,
by reason of some burning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:72"/>
or such like violent and
vehement sickenes: we may
easily gather by the same rule
of reason not so seuerely to
censure the impatient spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of him, who by reason
of some parching Feuer of
the spirite is disquieted in all
partes of his minde, and hath
all the veynes of his heart (as
it were) in a spirituall agony
vexed. Wherefore both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauorie
for want of Godly
wisedome, and vncharitable
for want of Christian loue,
are their murmuring obtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
which say. What,
Is this the Godly man? Is this
hee that is so troubled for his
sinnes. Why! see how pettish
<pb facs="tcp:18472:72"/>
he is, nothing can please him:
no body can satisfie him.
Consider, O man, if thou
canst beare with a fraile body
that thou must much more
beare with a fraile minde.
Consider that this his pettish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
dooth more wound him
at the heart, than any iniury
thou couldst presse him with.
And therefore seeing he affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
his owne soule for it,
thou needest not adde any
thing to his affliction, and to
exasperate his most grieuous
smart.</p>
            <p>Consider that it is a blessed
thing mercifully to bethinke
vs of the poore and needy
&amp; that to rub a fresh wound,
<pb facs="tcp:18472:73"/>
and to streine a bleeding sore,
is nothing els, but with Iobs
friendes to bring a newe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where ther is no need
of it. If the wise father doth
rather pitie than rebuke his
childe, when by reason of
sicknes the appetite is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely
pleased: so, if we purpose
to doo anie good with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
minde, wee must not
bee austere in reprehending
euerie infirmitie, but pitifull
in considering of each tender
frailtie.</p>
            <p>Neither doo I speake this
to nourish pettishnesse, but
would haue them to labour
for patience, and to seeke for
peace; which though they
<pb facs="tcp:18472:73"/>
finde not at the first, yet by
praier they must wayt on the
Lord, and say;</p>
            <p>Lord, because there is mercie
that thou maist bee feared: I will
wait vppon thee, as the eye of the
seruant wayteth vppon the hand
of his Master. I will condemne
my selfe of follie, and saie, Oh my
soule, vvhie art thou so heauie?
Whie art thou cast dovvn vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mee? Still trust in the Lorde,
for he is thy health and thy salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

beene not a little grieued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of my manifolde distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with the like occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
<pb facs="tcp:18472:75"/>
and other waighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres,
I haue beene hindred
hitherto from wrighting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and albeit euen still I
am euen in the same case, yet
conscience towardes God, &amp;
compassion &amp; loue towards
you, forceth me to ouercom
lets which hardly I could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
preuaile against: and
albeit I cannot write as I
woulde, yet of that which I
shall write proceeding from
the forenamed groundes, I
looke for some blessing from
God through Iesus Christ, if
you will not too much faint
in faith, and yeelde to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary,
yea, if you will but
hope so well of your selfe, as
<pb facs="tcp:18472:75"/>
in the feare of God I doo
write it I hope of you. First,
whereas it seemeth you are
sometimes grieued, because
you tarried not still at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
according to mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,
you must knowe I adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it not as a thing necessary,
but more conuenient as I
then supposed, but that I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
you to obaye your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if his pleasure still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to haue you home,
whereunto you yeelding, I
canot see how you offended,
it beeing your Fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you should so doo: and
who knoweth whether bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here you might not haue
bin as much troubled, there
<pb facs="tcp:18472:76"/>
beeing no priuiledge for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and places. In such cases
who knoweth whether it be
the Lordes pleasure, for the
ensample and instruction (&amp;
I hope the consolation) of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the ende. And albeit
you will nowe thinke that
heere you were nearer the
the more &amp; stronger means,
yet knowe you and bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that God can &amp; doth
in such cases worke by fewer
and weaker according to his
good pleasure: Besides, it is
in our corrupt nature to
make much of such meanes
as wee cannot haue, and not
so to esteeme those which
God dooth offer vs as wee
<pb facs="tcp:18472:76"/>
should; I beseech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the name of Iesus
Christ, humbly to praise God
for those meanes he offereth
in mercie vnto you, and to
vse them in faith accordingly;
and so God shall blesse you
by them. And then by such
conference as you may haue
from hence, wherein if I
may stand you in any steede,
rather for the good opinion
you haue of me, then for any
great matter I am able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
I shalbe ready to offer
any office of loue vnto you
as God shall inable mee, and
so farre foorth as I shall bee
at any time instructed in
your perticular estate. In
<pb facs="tcp:18472:77"/>
some letters sent from you
by conuenient messengers, I
perceiue that you ar afflicted
with the blindenes of your
minde, and hardnes of your
heart, which cannot be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
either with the promises
of Gods mercies, or feare of
his iudgements; nor affected
with the loue and delight of
the thinges which bee good,
nor with the hatred and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the euill: great cause
you haue of griefe I confesse,
but no cause of dispaire dare
I graunt, because I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that your perswatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is somewhat false, partly for
want of a sounde iudgement
of your estate, and partly for
<pb facs="tcp:18472:77"/>
some defect of faith somwhat
through your owne default.
First therefore know you for
certainty, that this is no other
tentation, than such as diuers
of Gods children haue been
humbled with, &amp; afterward
haue had a good issue out of
it: &amp; if it please God to moue
ye to credit me, my selfe haue
known others, as deeply this
way plunged, as you can be.
Remember therefore, God
is faithfull, who wil not suffer
you to be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted aboue that
you shalbe able to bear. And
farther yet to confirme you,
the holy scriptures do shew,
that this way god heretofore
hath humbled his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<pb facs="tcp:18472:78"/>
in whose person the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Esaye lamentably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth,
<hi>Esa.</hi> 3. 15. O Lorde
looke downe from heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
from thy dwelling place
of thy holines, and of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
VVhere is thy zeale &amp;  thy
strength, the multitude of thy
mercies, and of thy compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
They are restrained from
me. And afterwards; O Lord
why hast thou made vs to erre
from thy waies, and hardened
our hearts from thy feare? And
in the next chapt. VVe haue
been alas an vnclean thing, &amp;
all our righteousnes is as filthy
cloutes: and we all doo fade as a
lease, and our iniquities as the
winde doth take vs away: and
there is none that calleth vpon
thy name, neither that stirreth
<pb facs="tcp:18472:78"/>
vp himself to take hold on thee
for thou hast hid thy face from
vs, &amp; consumed vs because of
our iniquities. And before 59
<hi>chap.</hi> 5. We grope for the wal
like the blinde, and we grope
as one without eyes, we rore
like beares, and mourne lyke
doues. So complaineth Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias
in the bitternes of hys
soule; Like a crane or a swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
so did I chatter, I did
mourn as a doue: and when
Dauid crieth, Create in me O
God a cleane hart, renue in me
a right spirit. Restore to me the
ioy of my saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, establish me
with thy fre spirit: doth he not
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his hart vnclean, his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
croked, the ioy of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:79"/>
lost, &amp; himselfe subiect to the
spirit of bondage; so that wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the spirit of libertie or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
he could nether cry
Abba Father, nor haue anye
power against sin. Thus you
see how Gods children maie
be blinded in minde, &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in heart for a time, so that
they feel the grace of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit to be in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nere peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and dead. Farther to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the infirmitie of your
iudgement in this case, which
may much distres you, know
that there bee two kindes of
hardnes of heart, the one not
felt, the other felt; and of the
former ther be two sorts, the
first (which is most fearefull)
<pb facs="tcp:18472:79"/>
when any do purposely and
wilfully resist the motions of
Gods spirit, &amp; means of their
saluation; of which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Zachary speaketh. 7. 11.
They refused to harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
away their sholder &amp; stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
their eares that they shuld
not heare: yea, they made their
hearts as an adamant stone, lest
they should hear the law, &amp; the
words which the Lord of hosts
sent in his spirit by the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the former Prophets. The
outragious sin of these men,
the Prophet Esay expresseth
in their owne fearful termes,
28. 15. VVe haue made a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with death, and with hell
we are at agreement: though a
scourge run ouer &amp; passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
it shall not come at vs:
<pb facs="tcp:18472:80"/>
for we haue made falshood our
refuge, &amp; vnder vanitie are we
hidden. This was a fearfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
indeede; yet for all that
no man can saye, but some of
those might bee, and were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
conuerted. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinde of hardnes of hart
which is not felt nor percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
or is perceiued yet not
felt; (albeit it is lesse fearfull,
yet it is daungerous enough)
is in such, as although they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
resist not Gods spirite in
good means; yet securely &amp;
willingly they lye in sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anie remorse of it, or true
taste of good things. Such
was Dauid his estate for the
space of a yeare before Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
<pb facs="tcp:18472:80"/>
the Prophet came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
him, &amp; rouse him from
his lulled sleepe. Both these
kindes I am perswaded you
are free from, otherwise th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
in temptation, Sathan maye
sometimes mooue ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto:
the other kind of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heart which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
&amp; felt, is of two sorts;
the one in them which are
desirous of meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they may be releeued, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they finde smal or no
ease at all in themselues for a
time.</p>
            <p>Of this kinde the Prophet
Esay (in the name of some of
Gods people) complaineth,
<hi>Esa. 63.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:81"/>
Such was Dauids state, after
Natha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reproued him &amp; gods
spirit bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to work with him,
that he crieth out as ye heard
before, of the losse of Gods
graces: &amp; when he saith, that
God will accept of no sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
nor petitions, without a
contrite hart &amp; broken spirit,
he sheweth that for a time (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
after the prophet had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
him) he w<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ated both.
This is your case, &amp; therfore
you are in the state of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for Dauid was in this case,
euen after hee had confessed
his sin, as my trust is you doo:
&amp; was certainly perswaded
of the pardonablenesse of it,
throgh gods mercie, althogh
<pb facs="tcp:18472:81"/>
he was farre off from the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it, or applying to his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
conscience: his state was
good, and very wel to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of; and you must knowe
and be perswaded, that those
things which are written of
Gods saints, &amp; namely of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
and Peter, &amp; such others,
are examples for vs, if we will
stay our selues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word
of God in the mysterie of his
seruants, and wait vppon the
Lords good time, til he come
neerer vnto vs by his spirite:
nerer I say, for he is come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
vnto you; or it may be
he neuer went from you; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to be greued and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with blindnes of minde
<pb facs="tcp:18472:82"/>
and hardnes of heart, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
certainly the trueth of
God is promised in generall,
&amp; to reuerence the seruants
of God, which bring the glad
tidings of the Gospel; &amp; prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the Sacrament of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
&amp; the companie of gods
children, contrarie to hope,
vnder hope, yea without any
present feeling: all this is a
certaine argument, that gods
spirit is with such, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with you. This estate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it bee verie grieuous,
yet it is neuer da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger us, much
lesse is it fearfull; vnlesse anie
bee so wilfull, that they perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and continue in despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
refusing al good means:
<pb facs="tcp:18472:82"/>
vnles they perseuere I say, for
through the subtill sleight of
the spirituall aduersarie, and
his forceable power, wherby
God suffereth him sometime
for a season to winnow them
as wheate, they are so bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and intoxicated, that
they are carried by violent
force of temptation, to wexe
wearie of, or to refuse all
meanes of comfort by fittes;
yea, almost to haue no desire
at all vnto them: yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to speake verie euill of
them.</p>
            <p>But all this is but temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore God will
bee mercifull vnto them for
Christ his sake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:83"/>
Thus Iob cursed the daye of
his birth, &amp; wished to be stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled;
Ieremie almost repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that euer he preached in
the name of the Lord: both
scarcely abstain from blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
Dauid moued with the
spirit of ambition (though du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
admonished) wilfully
we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on in numbring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
Peter also vainglorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
presuming of his owne
strength, being most wisely &amp;
effectualy admonished of his
weaknes euen by our Lorde
Iesus, yet wittingly rusheth
as the horse into the battel, &amp;
then verie cowardlye yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
yea doubly denieth, yea
strengthneth his sinne with a
<pb facs="tcp:18472:83"/>
threefold coard, and fastneth
it with banning and cursings:
&amp; yet all these obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
most bountifully. For why
as Satan desired to winnowe
them, so our Lord Iesus prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for them, that theyr fayth
though it was vehemently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted,
it should not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
although it was batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yet that if should not bee
destroied; and though it was
oppressed, yet it shuld not be
extinguished. And here bee
you fully perswaded, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
it <hi>Luk. 22. 31.</hi> the wordes
seeme to runne as belonging
but to Peter; vz. I haue praid
for thee that thy faith should
not faile, yet he praied for the
<pb facs="tcp:18472:84"/>
rest of the Apostles, yea for all
the faithfull. For first he saith
not; Simon, sathan hath desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to winow thee: but you.
Why then saith hee, I haue
praied for thee? Verely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee should more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously
offend than the rest:
although their offence was
verie great; therefore hys:
and our most blessed Sauior
applyed to him the promise,
but not appropriated it vnto
him onely, and restrained it
from the rest. Compare with
this place <hi>Iohn. 17. 20.</hi> &amp; you
shall see, that the heauenlye
verity affirmeth; that he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not only for the Apostles,
but for all those that shoulde
<pb facs="tcp:18472:84"/>
beleeue through their word:
yea farther, Our Lorde Iesu
Christ was yesterdaye, is to
day, &amp; shalbe for euer. And
as the fore-fathers were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
vnto him, and did eate
his flesh and drink his blood;
so was his praier effectuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to them vnder the lawe,
then more to vs vnder grace.
And when you can find testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
in your hart, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you would doo well, euill is
present with you, and that ye
doo the euil you would not;
then do not you it, but sinne
in you, when it leadeth you
captiue, <hi>Rom. 7.</hi> much more,
when sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> works with al buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting
you, assure you GOD
<pb facs="tcp:18472:85"/>
hath pity on you, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his power shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in your weaknes. If you
beleeue, according to your
faith it shalbe done vnto you.

which in the former part of
my Letter I gaue you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
was the cause of your
excessiue distresse. I beseech
you, and I charge you in the
name of our Lord Iesus, that
you will not willingly lie, nor
offer iniurie to Gods spirite,
nor to your self who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
it. Tell me, what is the
<pb facs="tcp:18472:85"/>
reason why you thinke you
haue no faith? Verely because
you haue no feeling, nor any
other fruites thereof, as you
thinke. Well, first then agree
with me herein (as you must
if you will not disagree with
the truth) that feeling is but
an effect and frute of faith; &amp;
therefore there may be faith
without feeling, aswell as the
cause may be without the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and the tree without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
appearance of frute, yea,
of sap for a season. And as a
man sore wounded and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased,
may for a season be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
almost of all operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the naturall life to the
outward show of his owne
<pb facs="tcp:18472:86"/>
indnment and feeling; so may
a spiritual man be fore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by satan, and diseased by
the present sight and feeling
of his sinful corruptions, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in temptation; that hee
may think, yea appeare to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that the life of the spirit
is not in him. Thus, Peters
faith did not wholly faile, (as
you haue heard) or else the
praier of our Sauiour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
not. Thus when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
in the one and fiftie Psal.
the twelueth verse, declared
that his heart was vncleane,
and his spirite crooked or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable;
and in the fourteenth
verse, that he had lost the ioy
of his saluation, and the spirit
<pb facs="tcp:18472:86"/>
of libertie, or adoption: yet
in the thirteenth vearse hee
prayeth, that GOD would
not take his holie spirit from
him: therefore hereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
hee was not depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the spirite of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Heere seemeth to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaunce,
but there is not
anie: hee was depriued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for a time of the graces
of the sanctifiyng spirite, but
not of the holie Ghost wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
hee was sanctified;
which graces, as God resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto him, so I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
he will do vnto you:
Yea, and I doubt whether
you are depriued of them;
<pb facs="tcp:18472:87"/>
but onely that partly melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
partly Satan working
therewith, make you doo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
to your selfe, and to the
graces of the Spirite in you;
which I beseech you to take
heed of.</p>
            <p>But the messenger cannot
staye, and therefore I cannot
write as I would, either of
this, or of the remedie which
you should vse; which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
I will, as God shall ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
me: and I pray you let me
vnderstand (as I requested in
the beginning) of your estate
in perticular somwhat more,
and by this Bearer if you can;
becaus he is of your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and will bring it to me
<pb facs="tcp:18472:87"/>
faithfully. Onely I doo adde
now vnto you, that I haue
written of hardnes of heart
at large, that you must dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
obserue the Woorde
Create, which Dauid vseth
in the one and fiftie Psalme;
declaring that he had no fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his hearte. To this,
ioyn that which the Prophet
Esay speketh in the person of
God, 57. 23. I create the frute
of the lips to be peace, peace,
to him that is far off as to him
that is nere. Therfore in faith
you may as well praye, with
hope to obtain as did Dauid:
therfore say with him often,
and with Gods people, Esay
64. 12. O Lord, thou art our
<pb facs="tcp:18472:88"/>
Father: we indeed are claye,
but thou art our maker, wee
are the worke of thy hands.
Knowe also, God can cause
wolues, lions, &amp; leopards, to
dwell louingly with lambes,
calues and kids: and that that
is vnpossible to men, is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with god, euen to cause a
cable to go throgh a needles
eie, that is, to change the hard
hart of the vnbeleuing coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
man; much more yours:
yea knowe that all things are
possible to him which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.
Cry then, I beleeue, O
Lord help my vnbeliefe: &amp; I
dare promise ye in the name
of Iesus Christ, that you shall
haue your heartes desire in
<pb facs="tcp:18472:88"/>
goodnes. Thus abruptly I
must end; commending you
to God and the word of his
grace, which is able to builde
you vp, &amp; giue you the right
of inheritaunce among them
that are sanctified. The verie
God of peace sanctifie you
throughout, that your whole
spirit and soul and body may
bee kept blamelesse vntill the
comming of the Lord Iesus
Christ. Faithfull is hee which
hath called you, which will
do it. Amen. I pray you pray
for me, &amp; I trust as I haue, so
I shal pray for you, and much
more. Yours in Christ Iesus
to vse in anie need.</p>

and mercifull goodnes in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, your owne vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
and Satans subtlenes; I
coulde meruaile why you
should giue such place, and
<pb facs="tcp:18472:90"/>
not keepe your grounde no
surer, if I were not much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with such occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;
I know not therfore
whether with wordes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
or comfort, I shoulde
seeke to releeue you. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I cannot come vnto
you, my counsell and desire
is, that you woulde come vp
to London the next Tearme
at the farthest, that so I might
aske of God, to frame my
speeche according to your
good. In the meane season,
I bessech you call vnto mind
that which you cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of, that in the lawe
sacrifices were offered for
Gods people, not onely at
<pb facs="tcp:18472:90"/>
their first entrance into coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the Lorde, but also
afterwards many times, and
that not onely by ignorance,
but also by error, that is, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes,
frailenes, retchles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
carelesnes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is manifest that the sinne
of errour is there opposed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the sinne committed
with an hie hande, that is to
blaspheme with contempt of
GOD, and making his Law
of none effecte but to bee in
vaine. Which sinne I am sure
you are most farre off from, I
would you were as farre off
from vnbeliefe and distrust;
that Gods children may fall
into diuers foule faultes, as it
<pb facs="tcp:18472:91"/>
may appear by many proofs.
First, in the Lawe, when the
Lord speaketh in his Maiestie
and proclaimeth his glorie,
yet in howe many wordes
commendeth he his mercie,
and for howe many seuerall
sorts of sinnes, in Exodus the
twenty foure Chapter, sixe
and seauen verses. Doth not
Esay the holy Prophet call
the people of his daies, the
people of Gomorrha, and
and their Princes the Princes
of Sodome? Doth not he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them as grieuous trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
both of the first and
seconde Table. Esay the first
Chapter, ten and eleuen ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
&amp;c. And yet dooth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb facs="tcp:18472:91"/>
promise them in the
eighteenth verse, that though
their sinnes were as crimson,
they shalbe as white as snow;
though they were redde like
scarlet, they shall be as wool.
Dooth hee not charge them,
that they were sunke deepe
in rebellion, and yet exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them to returne vnto
the Lord? Esay the thirty one
Chapter, and sixth verse. Yea,
doth he not charge them not
onely with rebellion, but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>so
with vexing the holy spirit of
of God, Esay sixty three, and
tenth verse. And reade what
is written, Esay nine, eleuen.
Pray as there you may learn,
Esay tenth Cha. fiue, sixe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18472:92"/>
What dooth not the holy
Prophet Ieremy in the thirty
one Chapter, and the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
nineteenth and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
verses shew, that Ephraim
was an vntamed Calfe, &amp;c.
yet so soone as hee mourned
and was ashamed of himself,
doth not the Lord shew that
his bowels of mercie were
troubled for his estate. Doth
not the Lord offer mercy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the prophane and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
transgressours of his holy
couenant, Psalme fiftith, from
the fifth verse to the two and
twentith. Is not this part of
the couenant made with all
the sonnes of Dauid in Iesus
Christ, that if they not onely
<pb facs="tcp:18472:92"/>
omit many good thinge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
also committe rebellions and
iniquities, that though hee
may visit them, yet it shall be
with the rodde of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and that his mercie hee
will not take from them, nor
breake of his couenant made
with them in Iesus Christ.
Therefore remember that
the holy promises, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and examples are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that we should not sinne,
but if any man sinne, we haue
an aduocate with the father
Iesus Christ the iust, and he is
the reconcilliation of our
sinnes, and not for our sinnes
onely, but for the sinnes of
the whole world. Doth not
<pb facs="tcp:18472:93"/>
the blessed Apostle Paule
charge the Corinthians who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he affirmeth in the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to bee rich in Christ, and
destitute of no spirituall gift,
to be more carnall than spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
yet babes in Christ, yea,
to bee falne into idolatry, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of euill thinges, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
tempting not onely
of God, but of Christ, yea
murmuring against them; yet
doth hee not herein comfort
them, that no temptation
hath taken hold on them, but
such as appertaineth to man,
and that God will bee merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto. Dauid prayeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
presumptuous sinnes,
that they should not raigne
<pb facs="tcp:18472:93"/>
ouer him. Psalme ninetenth
Chapter, &amp; thirteenth verse.
Signifiyng though he sinned
presumptuously, yet if hee
did not perseuer in presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
obstinately, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to repent, that such sinne
or sinnes were pardonable:
Nowe the Lordes couenant
towards his in Iesus Christ, is
not to deale after their sinnes
not to rewarde them after
their iniquities, much lesse
will hee not regard in wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
displeasure their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>But if he should so marke
what is saide or done amisse,
who were able to abide it?
But with him is mercie in
<pb facs="tcp:18472:94"/>
Iesus Christ, that hee may be
feared therefore, lift vp your
handes which hange downe,
strengthen your weakknees,
and say vnto your soule, why
art thou so cast downe, and
so vnquiet within mee? I will
yet trust in Iesus Christ and
wait vpon the mercifull gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God purchased by his
mercies. Consider that true
humillitie ariseth of faith in
Iesus Christ, and that is true
faith that ingendreth humilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
as wee may not diminish
our sinnes, so may wee not
too much aggrauate them,
nor diminish Christs merits:
haue euermore in your
minde the examples of the
<pb facs="tcp:18472:94"/>
prodigall son, who saith not,
I am not thy sonne, but I am
no more worthy to be called
thy sonne; he saith not let me
bee thy bondslaue; nay hee
saith not let me be thy hyred
seruant, but as one of thy hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
seruants; his father came
and met him, fell on his neck,
&amp;c. So shall it come to you
good brother; I neede make
no more aplication, the holy
annointing which you haue
receiued, will bring the olde
mercies of God vpon others
and vppon your selfe vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
and lead you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all truth, which shall bee
requisite for your saluation.
Put your trust in the Lord, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:18472:95"/>
you shall prosper: The Lord
Iesus came not to breake the
brused reede, nor to quench
the smoaking flaxe; his grace
shall bee euer more sufficient
for you, and his vertue shall
vnto the end manifest it selfe
in your weakenes. Nowe
therefore I beseeche him to
preserue your body, soule, &amp;
spirite, vnto his most glorious
appearing; Faithfull is he that
hath called you, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
you, who will performe
it, Amen.</p>
