            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And for that the simple ignoraunt people are caried so easily away, with the only sounde and voyce of the Papistes, by the names of the auncient Fathers and Doctours, from the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Christ Iesus, made me to enterprise and take in hande, (although of all others moste vnmeete) this rude and simple worke: and the rather for that those that daily crie out that this religion is a newe religion, which was neuer allowed by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Canonical scriptures: fathers, and counsels, that we nowe preach and mainteine in these our dayes. Whose mouthes, to stop &amp; stay their cryinges out (if it may be) I haue here gathered (reuerende Father) together, certayne places of holy Scriptures, Fathers, and Counsels, (as concerning the principall pointes of relgion) wherein the simple and ignoraunt may playnely, and clearely see, as it were in a glasse, what side holdeth of Christe most truely: who preacheth Christ most faithfully: whose religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is best allowed by the Scriptures: confirmed by the Martyrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mainteined and taught by the Fathers, the Papistes or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes: wherein they shall easily perceiue and vnderstand, that our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the olde, true and catholique religion.

I speake neither against anie honourable or worshipfull mans pleasure or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, whiche is made for the encrease and preseruation of health, but against vaine and superfluous gardening. Gardens are wholsome, healthfull, and commodious for two causes. First, for the ayre sake, for where manie kinde of sweete hearbes, grow together, there must of necessitie be an excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of aire, whereby the senses of man are both holpen and rele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie for medicine sake, bicause, of hearbes are made the moste excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, salues, and emplaisters for the expulsing of all maner diseases and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the bodie. But notwithstanding the commoditie be greate, yet for the most part it is priuate, for commonlie those that make faire Gardens, thei do so inclose them with huge walles, and high pales, that none hath the fruit of them but them selues, and in the richer mens Gardens, the more seldome do poore men reape anie pleasure by them. But herein I must, as I haue good occasion, commende the labour of this spirituall Gardener, our deere and painefull bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Iohn Northbrooke, whose Garden is not onelie painefullie purged and cleansed of all weedes, but well furnished with all maner of moste excellent hearbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Whiche spirituall Garden, after that with greate labour and studie he had brought about to finishe, hauing taken great paines no doubt, in gettyng out of many Gardens, the most excellent Slippes, Seedes &amp; Plantes, and after that he had brought to passe, that no good hearbe was wanting, that might any thing profit or benefit such as are desirous of their soules health. He neither hath wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it about with great Bricke walles, nor hedged it about with quick thornes, neither paled it in, whereby it might seeme that he bestowed this cost for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and this paines only for his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, as the maner of the world is to do: he hath franckly and freely, with all the commodites thereof, left it open to all maner of men: nay, more then so, that he hath made it a common Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he hath onely planted it, and geuen it to the poore, it is a common Garden for the poore, you maie be bolde to call it the poore mans Garden, out of which notwithstanding, both riche and poore, mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This worke is not in vaine called the poore mans Garden, for it is a riche bed of all sweete flowers, that is, a breefe collection and vnifourme consent of fragrant sweete smelling Scriptures, and fruitfull agreement of the soundest iudgement of the Doctours, which haue on the Scriptures builded long ago their faith and true religion, nowe gathered together for the profite of the ignoraunt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Finally, none that loueth Iesus Christe the sonne, and surest pointes of his doctrine: namely, of faith in the Gospell, but he will be farre in loue with this Garden: but aboue all, my brethren of the Ministerie, to Whom God hath not geuen the gift of tongues, this is to you no small benefite, for whose sakes cheefly the aucthour hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this paine.

The Haruest is great, God sende painefull labourers into the feelde, and their labours diligently employed, God geue encrease, that it may fructifie in his faithfull peoples heartes, and yeelde foorth fruite mightily, that on euery part Christ may be glorified, with his heauenly father, and the holy ghost, worlde without ende,</p>

And without any merites, and woorkes, he doeth either predestinate, and electe: Or els condemne some. Therefore, it is not in the will of the runner, but in the mercie of God.

                  <p>Wherfore, the predestination of God (whiche is to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, and comforte) is (as I saied) the preparation afore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to grace: but grace is the'ffect of the same predestination.

him, before the worlde was made. Certainly, if this be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken, because God knewe afore hande, that thei would beleue: the sonne speaketh against this forknowledge, saiyng. you haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you.</p>
                  <p>Seeyng that God did rather knowe afore hande this, that thei should chose hym, that thei might deserue to bée chosen of him. Thei are therefore chosen, before the worlde was made, in that predestination, in the whiche God knewe afore hande his owne workes, that were to come: But their are chosen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worlde by that callyng, by the whiche, God hath fulfilled that, whiche he did predestinate. For, whom he hath predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, theim hath he called, that is to saie, with that callyng, that is accordyng to purpose: he hath not then called any other but those whom he hath predestinate, theim hath he also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Neither hath he iustified any other, but them whom he so called, them hath he also iustified: Neither hath he glorified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, but theim whom he hath predestinate, called, iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, theim hath he also glorified, with that ende, whiche hath no ende.</p>
                  <p>God then hath chosen the faithfull: but that thei might bee made faithfull. The Apostle Iames saieth, hath not God cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the poore in this worlde, riche in faithe, and heires of the kingdome, whiche God hath promised to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that beleue him?</p>
                  <p>By election therefore, he maketh bothe riche in faithe, and heires of the kingdome, whom I praie you, hearyng the lorde saiyng, you haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you. Dare bee so bolde, as to saie, that men are chosen through beliefe: whereas rather thei are chosen, that thei maie beleue, leaste that thei should bee founde, to haue chosen Christe firste, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the sentence of the truthe, vnto whom Christ saieth: you haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore of twoo infantes, that are bothe faste wrapped<note place="margin">In his booke of the goodnes of perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and. 8.

                  <p>Notwithstandyng, this ought to bee moste certaine to the faithfull, that the one is of the nomber of the predestinate, but th'other is not: For if thei had been of vs (saieth one of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate, whiche out of the Lordes breaste, did sucke this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete) thei had vndoubtedly continued with vs. What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this I praie you, thei were not of vs, for if thei had béen of vs, thei had certainly continued with vs?

Laste of all, were thei not bothe called, and followed the caller, bothe of vngodlie, iustified, and bothe renewed by the fountaine of regeneration? But if he (whiche certainly knewe what he saied) should heare this, he might aunswere, and saie: These are true, and accordyng to all these thynges, thei were of vs: Neuerehelesse, by a certaine other difference, thei were not of vs, for if thei had been of vs, thei should vndoubtedly, haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Gods bokes are open, let vs not tourne awaie our face, the diuine scripture doeth crie, lette vs therefore giue eare: Thei were not of them, because thei were not called, accordyng to purpose: thei were not electe in Christ, before the makyng of the world: thei were not made heires through hym: thei were not predestinate, accordyng to the purpose of hym that woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all thynges.</p>

                  <p>We saie not that all thinges do come to passe by destinie: yea, we saie that nothing is doen by destinie. For, we do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewe, that the name of destinie, is of no value, in the place, where men vse to place it in speakyng, that is ut the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heauenly signes, wherein euery man is conceiued and borne, because the thyng it self is vainly affirmed. As for the order of causes, wherein the will of God is of greate force and power: we dooe neither denie, nor call it by the name of destinie, excepte it be so as we maie vnderstande, <hi>fatum,</hi> to be deriued of the woorde, for <hi>faris,</hi> that is, of speakyng. For, wee cannot denie, but it is written in the holie scriptures: GOD spake ones, these twoo saiynges: I my self heard it: that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer belongeth vnto God: And vnto thée (O Lorde) belongeth mercie: for thou wilt giue to euery man, according to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. And where as it is saied, he spake ones: wee vnderstande that he spake vnmoutablie, that is vnchaungeablie, euen as he did vnchaungeably knowe all thynges that are to come, and that he hymself will dooe. After this sorte therefore, wee maie saie, <hi>fatum,</hi> or destinie is deriued; <hi>a fando,</hi> or speakyng, if this name had not now been accustomed, to bee vnderstanded of an other matter, wherunto we are not willyng, that mens<note place="margin">In the. 10. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter of the same. 5. boke.</note> hartes should be enclined.</p>

Therefore lawes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, exhortations, commaundementes, and sharpe rebukes, are not in vain: because that bothe he did knowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hande, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And iust rewardes are appointed for good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and punishmentes for synnes. Neither doeth man sinne, because God did foreknowe before, that he should synne, yea, rather it is therefore out of doubte, that he doeth synne, when he doeth synne: because he, whose foreknowledge, cannot bee deceiued, did knowe before, that it was not destinie, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or any other thyng, that should synne, but he hym self.

                  <p>Let vs bee chaunged into the same likenesse, from cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to clearnesse, as it were with the spirite of God.

                  <p>What haste thou, that thou haste not receiued? Thou art created, thou art healed, thou art saued. To thée I saie, O thou man, whiche of these, haste thou of thy self? Thou that wast not: could not create, when thou wast a synner: thou couldest not iustifie: when thou wast deade, thou couldest not raise thy self vp againe, besides other thynges, either are necessarie for them that healed: or laied vp for them that shalbe saued.</p>

by the Canonicall bookes of the holy Scriptures, wee muste knowe the churche of Christe, euen like as we knowe christe, which is the heade of the churche, in the holy Canonicall scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
                  <p>The question or doubte is, where the Churche shoulde be,<note place="margin">In the. 2. chap. of the same booke.</note> what then shall we doe?

                  <p>Let vs not heare these wordes: this saie I, this saiest thou:<note place="margin">In the. 3. chap. of the same booke.</note> But these wordes let vs heare, thus saieth the lorde: there let vs seeke the churche: there let vs discusse our cause.</p>

                  <p>And why doeth he commaunde all christians at that tyme to resorte to the Scriptures? For in this tyme, since Heresie hath preuailed in the churche, there can be no other proofe of true christianitie, neither can there be any other refuge for christian men (willing to knowe the trueth of the right faith) but onely vnto the holy Scriptures.

                  <p>Wherefore, he that will knowe whiche is the true church of Christ, in this so greate a confusion of thinges, being so like: howe shall he knowe it, but onely by the scriptures?</p>
                  <p>It was also knowen which was the true church of christe, by their maners, when the conuersation of christian men (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of al, or many) was holy, which was not among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>

                  <p>Therfore, he that will knowe which is the true churche of Christ, wherby shal he knowe it, but onely by the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The Lorde therefore knowyng that so greate a confusion of thinges should come in the later tyme, commaundeth that christian men, that be willyng to know the right faith, should flee to none other thinges, but onely to the Scriptures: for if they looke vpon any other thyng, but onely the scriptures, thei will be offended and perishe, not perceiuyng which is the true churche: And so to fall into the abhomination of desolation, whiche standeth in the holy places of the churche.</p>

of hym, three confessions of his loue: that the three denialles might be counteruailed and recompensed with equal nomber of confessyng. So that, that is committed in wordes, is cured with woordes: Christe asked of hym whether heé loued hym more then another? for he whiche experted greater clemencie of the lorde towardes hym: ought of right to be affected with greater loue.</p>
                  <p>For although generally all the disciples were striken with greate feare, when the Lorde was betraied: yet the faulte of Peter was greater, whiche denied Christ in so short a tyme. Bicause therefore he obtained remission of synnes by greater clemencie of the Sauiour: greate loue of right is required of hym. For he to whom more is forgiuen, ought more to loue.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, by the three confessions of Peter, the crime of the three denials was made voide, and put awaie. And where Christ saide, feede my sheepe, renued that dignitie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship by humaine infirmitie, he shoulde seeme to be abased and made weake.</p>
                  <p>For this, as I iudge, Peter receiued this commaundement<note place="margin">Bernarde of the resurrection of our Lorde, in his first Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of the lorde, thrise to feede his flocke, feede (saieth he) with thy minde: feede with thy mouth: feede with thy worke: feede thou with praier of thy minde: with exhortation of the word, and with example of exhibition.</p>

                  <p>But although the vertue of god, hath called againe certaine soules into their bodies, for to teache vs that he might do it by his owne right: It shall not therefore bee communicated, or graunted vnto the confidence and boldenes of <hi>Magicians</hi> or Sorcerers, and vnto the deceiptefulnesse of Dreames and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynges of Poetes: but when in the examples of the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

the vertue or power of God doth bryng againe the verie soules into their bodies. It is shewed with a whole and full trueth, and which can be touched and handeled, that is a shape or forme of veritie, or that it is a true, and an vnfaigned shape or forme: so that thou maiest iudge, that all fetchyng vp, and appearyng of the dead, without bodies, is méere illusion and deceiptefulnesse.</p>
                  <p>The spirite of <hi>Samuell,</hi> which the woman Sorcerer raised<note place="margin">Augustine to Symplician. 3. question.</note> vp to <hi>Saule,</hi> was not the soule of <hi>Samuell,</hi> but the deuill, which appeared in <hi>Samuels</hi> likenes, for to deceiue <hi>Saule.</hi>

                  <p>You ought to knowe this, that euery nation asketh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell<note place="margin">Hierome vpon the. 8. Chap. of Ieremy.</note> at their owne Gods, and enquireth of the dead, for the helth of the quicke: but God hath giuen you the lawe for your helpe.</p>

For, the soules of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are in the handes of God, and also the Soules of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for thei haue not synned. And that the Soules of sinners are streight wayes after their departure, led awaie, it is made manifest, by the riche man, and Lazarus.</p>
                  <p>But the lorde doth also saie in another place: this daie will thei fetche awaie againe thy Soule from thée. Therefore the Soule, after that it is once gone from the body, cannot wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der here amonges vs, and not without a good cause, for, if they that goe in a iorney, if thei chaunce to come into some vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen countries, can not tell whither to goe, excepte they haue a guide: how muche more shall the soule beyng departed from the bodie, when she entereth into a life and waie that is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether newe vnto her, be vncertaine and ignoraunt, whether she maie goe, excepte she got a guide:</p>
                  <p>It maie bee proued by manie places of Scripture, that the Soules of the righteous men doe not wander here after their death. For <hi>Stephen</hi> saieth: lorde receiue my spirite: and <hi>Paule</hi> did desire to be loosed, and to be with Christe. The Scripture also doth saie of the Patriarch, and he was laied to his fathers, beyng dead in good age. And that the soules of synners can not abide here, neither heare the riche what he saieth, marke and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7706:68"/>
weigh what he doeth aske and not obteine. If the Soules of men might be conuersante here, he would haue come hymsef, as his desire was, and certifie his brethren of the tormentes of Hell.</p>
                  <p>By the which place of the Scripture, this is also most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest and plaine, that the soules, after the be gone out of their bodies, are ledde into a certaine place, from whence thei come not againe at their owne will and pleasure, but do tarie there for the dreadfull daie of iudgement.</p>
                  <p>How shall thei perswade mée, or make mée to beléeue that the soules of vnspotted men, dooe woorke with them? shall it be, bicause that thou hast some times harde theim, that be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with deuilles, crie out and saie, I am the soule of suche a one? but this saiyng doth also procéede and come of the fraude and deceiptefulnes of the Deuill. For, it is not the soule of the head that speaketh suche thynges: but the Deuill doeth faine and counterfaict them, that he may deceiue and beguile them that heare.</p>
                  <p>These ought to be taken as olde wiues Fables, the words ofliers, and fraie bugges of children: neither can the soule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng departed from the bodie, walke in the earth.</p>

Therfore though a dead man should rise againe, or an Angel come downe from heauen: wee muste chiefly and aboue all thynges beléeue the Scriptures. For, the maister of the Angels, and the Lorde, both of the liuyng and of the dead, hath made them.</p>
                  <p>And if god had knowen that the dead, beyng raised againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might haue profited the liuyng: he that hath doen all thynges for our profite, woulde not haue left the same vndoone. And if it were, that the dead should often tymes rise againe, men would also despise the same, and set naught by it nowe adaies.</p>
                  <p>Lette vs not seeke to heare those of the dead, that the holy

Scriptures doe teache vs most plainely, least by the processe of tyme, the deuill should haue set forth pernitious doctrines, and also least the worde of God, shoulde haue come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte. For in stéede of good spirites, the Deuill woulde haue appeared for euery trifle vnto men, and woulde haue tras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed hymselfe into the soules departed: for to bryng eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie daie newe reuelations, or he should haue made as though he had raised some of the dead by false and deceiptfull iullusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or he should haue turned awaie some men from the true faith, whiche would haue made folke to beléeue, that they had béene dead and raised vp againe, and so he woulde haue made them to saie, whatsoeuer it had pleased hym.</p>
                  <p>Wherby it should haue come to passe, that the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures shoulde haue béen vtterly despised, and that men would onely haue giuen credit to fuche reuelatious as we doe see by experience now at this daie And so men could not haue deserned or knowen the true reuelations of God, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations of the Deuill.</p>
                  <p>And therfore, God would not teache vs by the dead, but by his holy Scriptures, and by the ministerie of liuyng men: of whom also he had vs to beware, that thei doo not set forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs one thyng for an other, and deceiue vs.</p>

And although many were raised againe from death, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Christe was crucified: yet did thei not let therfore to persecute most cruelly the Apostles afterwarde.</p>
                  <p>We must not then séeke after the dead, for to haue instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by them. For, first and foremost, God doth not by death separate the soule from the bodie, for to suffre the spirites and soules of the dead to wander here vpon earth: but he maketh this separation for to satisfie vnto his ordinaunce, wherby he hath ordeined and appointed, that this earthly bodie, which is of earth and dust, should returne into the earth, and into the dust wherof it was taken, and that it should rest in the same, as in his bedde, vntill that daie, that he shall make it to rise againe, and that he shall fashion and shapen it a newe, by the resurrection and glorifiyng of the same, whiche he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnto it: for as he hath formed and fashioned it by creation: so hath he determined to shapen it againe by resurrection.</p>
                  <p>And as he hath appointed of the bodie, so hath he ordeined, that the soule and the spirite that he hath giuen vnto man, and whiche is partaker of a spirituall substaunce, shoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb facs="tcp:7706:70"/>
vnto hym that hath giuen it, and that it should goe vp againe vnto the place, that is conuenient and meete for his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: As the bodie goeth downe vnto the place that it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of.</p>
                  <p>Bicause of his nature and weight, vntill the Lorde do come againe, to vnite the soule with the bodie. And as a man might saie, to ioyne heauen with earth, that is to say, the deuine and heauenly parte, with the humaine and earthly parte, by the resurrection, whiche is a newe regeneration, and as it were a seconde creation: as he did in the beginnyng, by the first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he did ioyne the soule, whiche is a spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, with the bodie that is made of earth.</p>
                  <p>If it had been profitable for the faith, that the dead had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes appeared vnto the liuyng, the Lorde woulde haue doen it often. But nowe there is nothyng so profitable, as the diligent searchyng out of the scriptures. The Deuill can also counterfaict falsely and in out warde apperaunce, the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the dead, for to seduce and deceiue the ignoraunte and foolishe, and for to sowe pernitious and deuillishe doctrines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to his malice.</p>
                  <p>But thei can haue no illusions that searche the scriptures, as it behoueth, for thei be the Candle, whiche if it shineth and giue light once, the thief is taken and manifested.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7706:77"/>
therefore let suche women be rebuked by the Prophete Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: And then no more trouble the worlde, and let theim not saie, we worship the Queene of heauen.</p>
                  <p>Christe saied vnto his mother, <hi>woman,</hi> what haue I to doe<note place="margin">In the same boke against one Colliridia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> with thee?

For in deede, the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is but a mockery, and an olde wiues tale: and soothly to say, nothyng els, but the handlyng of an heresie.</p>
                  <p>Neither <hi>Helias</hi> is to be worshipped, although he bee yet a<note place="margin">In the same. 3. boke. 2.

Naie, rather he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued grace from God. But neither <hi>Tecla,</hi> nor any saincte is to bee worshipped, for, that olde errour shall not rule in vs, that we should forsake the liuyng God, and worshippe those thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that were made by him. For thei haue honored and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the creature, besides the creatour, and thei became fooles. For if he will not haue the Angels to be worshipped, how muche lesse, that whiche was borne of <hi>Anna,</hi> whiche by <hi>Ioachim</hi> beyng giuen to <hi>Anna,</hi> whiche by praiers and all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was giuen according to promise, to the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Notwithstanding, was not borne otherwise besides the nature of men, but like as all men, of the séede of the man, and the wombe of the woman.</p>
                  <p>My mother whom ye haue called blessed, therefore is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">Angustine in his. 10. treatise vpon the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Iohn.</note> bicause she hath kepte the worde of GOD: not bicause in her the worde was made fleshe.</p>
                  <p>Mary was more blessed, in that she receiued the faithe of<note place="margin">In his boke of holy virginity, the. 3.

                  <p>Let not the worshippyng of dead men, be counted holines<note place="margin">In his booke of true religion, the. 55. Chap.</note> among vs, for if they haue liued godly, thei be not so, that thei

                  <p>Let vs beléeue this, that the best Angels, and the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ministers, would that we should worship one GOD with them, by whose contemplation and lookyng vpon, they are blessed.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, we worship them with charitie, and loue, that we beare vnto them, and not with bondage, nor builde we to them any Temples, for they will not so bee worshipped and honoured of vs, for they knowe that when we be good, we are the Temples and Churches of the most highest God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it was wel and rightely written, that the man was forbidden of the Angell to worshippe hym, but that he should worship God.</p>
                  <p>There is no man that dare be so bolde, as to saie that sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<note place="margin">In his. x. booke of the Citie of God, and. iiii. Chap.</note> ought to be giuen vnto any, but onely vnto God.</p>

would haue doone sacrifice vnto them, as if they had béen Gods. For they rentyng their garmentes, confessyng and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadyng them, that they were not Gods, forbade suche thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be doen vnto theym. This appeared also in the Angels, as we reade in the <hi>Apocalips.</hi> The Angell forbiddyng him self to be worshipped, and saiyng to hym that worshipped hym: I am thy fellowe seruaunte of thee, and thy brethren.</p>
                  <p>No man was made priuie to <hi>Moyses</hi> graue: lest if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">In his. 1. boke and last Chap. of the wonders of the holy Scriptures.</note> had knowen where his body had been, they would adore and worship it.</p>

So that if it bee a commaundemente, that forbiddeth any euill or wicked thyng, or commaundeth any thyng that is good, or beneficiall, then it is no figure: But if it commaunde any euill, or wicked thyng, or forbiddeth any thyng that is good and beneficiall, then it is a figuratiue speache. Now this saiyng of Christe (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eate the fleshe of the sonne man, and drinke his bloud, you shall haue no life in you) seemeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde an hainouls and a wicked thyng, therefore it is a figure, commaundyng vs to be partakers of Christes passion, keepyng in our myndes, in our greate comforte and profite, that his fleshe was crucified, and wounded for vs.</p>

There he is now, fittyng on the right hande of the father. How can therefore the bread bée his bodie, and the cuppe, or that whiche is in the cuppe, bee his bloud?

                  <p>A daie or twoo before good Fridaie, wee vse in common<note place="margin">In his. 23. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius.</note> speache, to saie thus: To morowe, or this daie twoo daies, Christe suffered his passion, where in very déede he neuer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his passion but once, and that was many yeres passed.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, vpon Easter daie we saie, this daie Christe rose from death: where in very deede, it is many hundred yeres sithens he rose fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death: Why then, doe not men reprooue vs as lyars, when wée speake in this sorte? But bicause wee call these daies so, by a similitude of those daies, wherin those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were doen in deede. And so it is called that daie, whiche is not that daie in deede: but by the course of the yere, it is a like daie. And suche thynges bée saied to bée doen that daie, for the solemne celebration of the Sacramentes, whiche thynges in déede were not doen that daie, but long before. Was christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any more but once? And he offered hym self: And yet in a sacrament or representation, not onely euery solemne feast, of Easter: but euery daie he is offered to the people, so that he doeth not lye, that saieth, he is euery daie offered.</p>
                  <p>For if Sacramentes, had not some similitude, or likenesse of those thynges, whereof thei be Sacramentes: and for their similitude and likenesse, commonly thei haue the name of the thynges, whereof thei be Sacramentes. Therefore, as after a certaine maner of speache, the Sacramente of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, is Christes bodie: the Sacramente of Christes bloud, is Christes bloud: So likewise the Sacrament of faithe, is faith: And therefore, when we aunswere for yong children in their Baptisme, that thei beleue, whiche haue not yet the minde to beleue, wée aunswere, that thei haue faithe, bicause thei haue the Sacramente of faithe. And wee saie also that thei tourne vnto God, bicause of the Sacrament of conuersion vnto God: for the aunswere pertaineth to the celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente.</p>
                  <p>And likewise speaketh the Apostle, of Baptisme, saiyng: that by Baptisme we be buried with hym into death, he saith
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7706:91"/>
not, that we signifie buriall: But he saieth plainly, that we be buried. So that the Sacramente of so greate a thyng, is not called: but by the name of thyng it self.<note place="margin">In his. 57. que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. vpon Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus.</note>

                  <p>A thyng which signifieth, is wont to be called by the name of the thyng, whiche it signifieth, as it is written in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the seuen eares, be seuen yeres, the seuen kine, be seuen yeres, &amp; many other like. And so said S.

                  <p>The Sacrament of the vnitie of Christes body and bloud, is taken in the Lordes table, of some men to life, and of some men to death: but the thyng it self is taken of all men to life, and of no man to death. This is to eate that meate, and drinke that drinke: to dwell in Christe, and to haue Christe dwell in hym. And for that cause, he that dwelleth not in Christ, and in whom Christe dwelleth not, without doubt he eateth not spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually his flesh, nor drinke his bloud: although carnally and visibly with his teeth, he bite the Sacrament of his bodie and bloud.</p>

As concernyng his mans substaunce was not in heauen, when he was in earth, and forsooke the earth, when he ascended into heauen: But as concernng his godly substaunce (which is aboue all measure) he neither left heauen, when he came from heauen, nor he left not the earth, when he ascended into heauen, whiche maie bee knowen by the moste certaine woorde of Christe hym self: who, to shewe the placyng of his humanitie, saied to his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I ascende vp to my father, and your father, to my God, and your God.

be glad, for I goe vnto my father. And again he saied: It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you that I goe, for if I goe not, the comforter shall not come to you: and yet surely, the eternall worde of God, the vertue of God, the wisedome of God, was euer with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in his father: yea, euen at the same tyme when he was with vs, and in vs. For, when he did mercifully dwell in this worlde, he left not his habitation in heauen, for he is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where whole with his father, equall in diuinitie, whom no place can containe, for the sonne filleth all thynges, and there is no place, that lacketh the presence of his diuinitie.</p>
                  <p>From whence then, and whither did he saie, that he would goe? Or how did he saie, that he went to his father, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom doubtlesse he neuer departed? But that, to goe to his father, and from vs, was taken from this worlde that nature, whiche he receiued of vs. Thou séest therefore, that it was the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that nature, to bée taken awaie, and goe from vs, whiche in the ende of the worlde, shall be rendered againe to vs, as the Angels witnessed, saiyng: This Iesus, whiche is taken from you, shall come again, like as you sawe him goyng vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For looke vnto the miracle, looke vpon the misterie of bothe the natures. The sonne of God, as concernyng his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, wente from vs, as concernyng his diuinitie, he saied vnto vs: Beholde, I am with you all the daies, vnto the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ende.</p>
                  <p>He is with vs, and not with vs, for those whom he left and went from, as concernyng his humanitie: Those he lefte not, nor forsooke theim not, as touchyng his diuinitie: For as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the forme of a seruaunte (whiche he tooke awaie from vs into heauen) he is absent from vs: But by the forme of God (which goeth not from vs,) he is present with vs in earth, and neuerthelesse, bothe present and absent, he is all one Christe.</p>
                  <p>If the woorde and thè fleshe, were bothe of one nature, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng that the worde is euerywhere, why is not the fleshe then euery where? For when it was in earth, then verely it was not in heauen. And now when it is in heauen, it is not surely in earth. And it is so sure, that it is not in earth, that as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng it, we looke for hym to come from heauen, when as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng
<pb facs="tcp:7706:105"/>
his eternall worde, we beleue to be with vs in earth: Therefore by your doctrine, either the woorde is conteined in a place with his fleshe, or els the fleshe is euery where with the woorde. For, one nature cannot receiue in it self, twoo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and contrary thynges: but these twoo thynges, be diuers and farre vnlike, that is to saie, to bee contained in a place, and to bee euery where. Therefore, in as muche as the woorde is euery where, and the fleshe is not euery where, it appeareth plainly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that one Christe hymself, hath in hym twoo natures: And that by his diuine nature, he is euery where: And by his humaine nature, hee is contained in a place. That he is created: and hath no beginning: that he is subiecte to death, and can not dye. Wherof, one he hath by nature of his worde, (wherby he is God) and the other he hath by the nature of his fleshe, wherby the same God is man also.</p>
                  <p>Therefore one sonne of God, the selfe same was made the sonne of man, and he hath a beginnyng, by the nature of his fleshe: And no beginnyng by the nature of his Godhead: he is created by the nature of his fleshe: not created by the nature of his godhead: he is comprehended in a place, by the nature of his flesh: And not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended in a place, by the nature of his Godhead. He is inferiour to Angels in the nature of his fleshe: And equall to his father in the nature of his Godhead. He died by the nature of his fleshe: And died not by the nature of his Godhead.</p>
                  <p>This is the faithe and catholique confession, whiche the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles taught, the Martyrs haue confirmed, and the faithfull keepe vnto this daie.<note place="margin">Theodoret in in his. ii. dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The body of Christe, therefore did rise againe, quit Cleane from all corruption and death, and is impossible, immortall, glorified with the glorie of god, and is honoured of the powers of heauen, and yet is a bodie, and the same bignesse, that it had before.</p>
                  <p>To sit in the Throne of glorie, and to set his Lambes vpon his right hande, and the Goates vpon the left hand, signifieth a thyng that hath quantitie and bignesse.</p>

The choise of these, and the puttyng difference betweene one &amp; an other, maie make a man superstitious, and to haue vaine Religion: but it cannot make a man holie.

                  <p>Therefore it were greate rashenesse, if a wretched man should goe about to burthen and charge any man with suche ordinaunces, let euery man eate what he list, as his bodie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, so it be doen soberly, measurably, and for all thynges geue thankes vnto God.</p>

                  <p>This wyll cause Princes to bee blessed, if that they make<note place="margin">In his. 5. boke. and. 24. Cap. of the Citie of God.</note> their power which they haue, a serunant vnto gods maiestie, to enlarge most wyde, his worship, seruice, or religion.</p>
