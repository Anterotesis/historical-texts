            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I consider what favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Reception my first
humble Supplications in
this kind have had from
your <hi>Graces</hi> hand, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think my Duty fully
paid, nor my Adoration sufficiently exprest,
till I Dedicate my whole Life and Labours
to your <hi>Grace.</hi> 'Tis not one act of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
that can make a <hi>Zealot;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as I made a <hi>Present</hi> then, I pay you
<pb facs="tcp:64534:3"/>
a <hi>Tribute</hi> now. And though this <hi>Poem</hi>
has but little Merit of its own, yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by the Honours it has received,
like Pages to Princes, it owes its Boldness
to its Education; and since your <hi>Grace</hi>
gave it leave to be a troublesome Guest at
<hi>New-Hall,</hi> it lik'd the <hi>Entertainment</hi> so
well, that it resolves to <hi>Live</hi> and <hi>Dye</hi>
there; and 'tis an Ambition in some respect
to be justified; for <hi>Poetry</hi> should always
make up part of the Trains of Princes,
especially theirs whose Excellencies are so
Divine a subject for it. Vnder that shelter
I approach your <hi>Grace,</hi> when I must own
I have play'd the <hi>Plagiary</hi> in making the
Dutchess of <hi>Albemarle</hi> the Pattern for my
<hi>Roxolana;</hi> only with this difference, that
I have copyed below the Life. Your
<hi>Grace</hi> has all her <hi>Vertue,</hi> without the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of her Vanity; and this advantage above
her, that Your <hi>Grace</hi> possesses those Charms
which <hi>Story</hi> never attributed to <hi>Roxolana;</hi>
Her <hi>Beauty</hi> could subdue, but not secure her
<hi>Solyman.</hi> But your <hi>Graces</hi> Victories are
more compleat; For if our <hi>English</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
<pb facs="tcp:64534:3"/>
(spight of the fashionable liberty of
a Licentious Age) would Character the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
happiness of a Princely Pair, it must
describe the Influence of the Dutchess of
<hi>Albemarle</hi> over the unalterable Affections
of her <hi>Lord:</hi> And as in Duty to such
eminent Virtues; &amp; such infinite Perfections,
even the most ill-natur'd Age unanimously
speaks of your <hi>Grace</hi> with Veneration;
and to secure that <hi>Fame</hi> your <hi>Virtues</hi> have
so justly acquired, your <hi>Grace</hi> is as Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the Preservation of it: But so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
are your <hi>Sacred Principles</hi> of
<hi>Honour,</hi> that your <hi>Graces</hi> Care in that,
is but like His, who raises Bulwarks to
defend that Town, which of it self before
was inaccessible; nor can I more reasonably
impute the Duke of <hi>Albemarles,</hi> and your
<hi>Graces</hi> more frequent Residence at <hi>New-Hall,</hi>
to any other than a true <hi>English</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
as knowing that your <hi>Greatness</hi> can
better fill a Court than make a part of one.
I could be very prolix on so excellent a
Theam, for 'tis easie to Write where all
Man-kind Dictates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I must confess 'tis
<pb facs="tcp:64534:4"/>
the highest Bliss of an Authour, to have
those <hi>Patrons</hi> whose Merits are above Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
where the Titles of <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Good</hi>
may he given without a Blush. This made
<hi>Horace</hi> speak so largely in the Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his <hi>Maecenas,</hi> and <hi>Juvenal</hi> say so
so little in the praise of <hi>Trajan:</hi> For my
part I account it my chief Happiness to have
been a Witness of your <hi>Graces</hi> Greatness,
and my highest Contemplation to be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer

            <l>'Tis true, when any Favourites Plays appear,</l>
            <l>Then Kindness and Good-nature brings you here:</l>
            <l>And to secure the Censures of the Town,</l>
            <l>The Pit is fill'd with Friends in the Fore-noon;</l>
            <l>And those five long expecting hours you stay,</l>
            <l>Are spent in making Proselytes to th' Play.</l>
            <l>Such Favour is not common; nor are Wit</l>
            <l>And Sense the only means of gaining it.</l>
            <l>That happy Man, the Author, you commend,</l>
            <l>Must be at once a Poet and a Friend:</l>
            <l>Honour'd by the acquaintance of the <hi>Great;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His Conversation Eminent, as his Wit.</l>
            <l>And as th' effect of your kind Influence,</l>
            <l>We've seen such refin'd Fancy, so much sense,</l>

            <l>They need no Favour to support their Cause.</l>

            <l>And those perfections which delight you best;</l>
            <l>And none of those kind leading Votes can boast,</l>
            <l>Let not his Play for his hard Fate be lost,</l>
            <l>What if our Author be not one of You;</l>

            <l>HOw many has our Rhimer kill'd to day?</l>
            <l>What need of <hi>Siege</hi> and <hi>Conquest</hi> in a Play,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Love</hi> can do the work as well as they?</l>
            <l>Yet 'tis such Love as you've scarce met before:</l>
            <l>Such Love I'm sure as <hi>English</hi> ground ne're bore.</l>
            <l>Had half the injur'd Ladys of this Age,</l>
            <l>His <hi>Roxolana</hi>'s kindness, and her Rage,</l>
            <l>What heaps on heaps of Female-suff'rers here,</l>
            <l>Would your good Men make Martyrs in one year?</l>
            <l>But thanks to Heav'n you've not her fond Disease:</l>
            <l>E'ne let 'em range and wander where they please;</l>
            <l>You're not such Fools to think of Poysoning yet;</l>
            <l>You want her Love, but you have twice her Wit.</l>
            <l>Dying's a Mode your wiser thoughts contemn:</l>
            <l>You've a more pleasing way to punish 'em.</l>
            <l>And should our Brood of Gallants take this rule,</l>
            <l>And turn such Lovers as his <hi>Persian</hi> Fool,</l>
            <l>Kind Husband then might peaceably discover</l>
            <l>An Assignation made 'twixt Spouse and Lover.</l>
            <l>Leave you at Cribbedge, let you see a Play,</l>
            <l>Or take the Ayre in a fair Summers day;</l>
            <l>Let you stay out in Masquerade whole Nights,</l>
            <l>With twenty other Innocent delights,</l>
            <l>And no harm done.—And yet how wilde soe're</l>
            <l>The humours of this brisk mad Age appear,</l>
            <l>'Tis ten to one but th' Author still will say,</l>
            <l>Your Vertues were the patterns of his Play;</l>
            <l>And swear you down,</l>
            <l>His Love and Honour both were stol'n from you;</l>
            <l>And from your Features he his <hi>Heroes</hi> drew.</l>
            <l>There's ne're a Comick Writer but will say,</l>
            <l>You're all of you the Patterns of his Play:</l>
            <l>Yet takes your Pictures at so damn'd a light;</l>
            <l>Paints you so Ugly, that your Looks would fright.</l>
            <l>And yet their Plays are your most dear delight.</l>
            <l>Why in your hearts may not th'<hi>Heroicks</hi> share?</l>
            <l>Those make you worse, these better than you are.</l>
            <l>And Flatt'rers sure should not successless prove,</l>
            <l>When those that do abuse you have your Love.</l>
