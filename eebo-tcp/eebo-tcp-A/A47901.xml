            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Inding, by several Letters, published in Your Name, that you professe a more then ordinary zeal to popular Government; and not knowing any thing herein, that can so mislead you, but the glorious pretence of a Free State (a notion, which hath, even, intoxicated many; (otherwise, great and worthy Persons;) I held it my Duty, first, to acquaint you, how necessary it is to distinguish betwixt the Form and Essence of a Common-wealth, the mistake whereof (each for the other) hath proved so fatall in our times: Next to examine, whether those that surfeited of our Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and longed for Novelty have not, indeed (like the Dog in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) lost the substance of Liberty and happinesse, in pursuit of the shadow.</p>
                  <p>Our fierce Champions of a Free State will not, I presume, maintain, that it is subject to no violations, least wofull experience confute, and force them to confesse, either that a Common-wealth may degenerate; or, at least, that this never was a Commonwealth: And, as they must renounce their senses, so they must deny the Faith of Story, which proves, that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks have been sometimes invaded with Usurpation, sometimes Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Embased with Oligarchy; mostly (by reason of their weaknesse, and divisions) subdued, or forced to truckle under their neighbouring Princes) alwayes tormented with faction. Neither, indeed do they, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves offer any argument but such, as, in effect, beg the question, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing great unity in the Coalition, great probity in the Intention, and great purity in the Exercise; which doubtlesse, being admitted, we should so little need to differ about Forms, that perhaps, we should scarce need any Government at all. The stoutest assertors of Monarchy, likewise, must acknowledg, That it, being but earthen ware, (though the finest and stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest) is subject to divers accidents; For nothing under heaven is perfect: And when we constitute Governments, we must not think to build Babels against the Deluge, but embank against floods and enclose the best we can against Trespassours. This being premised, let us consider these two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, not Metaphysically, in notions, abstracted from their subjects, (a pastime, which our Platonicks much delight in) but morally and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably, as concrete, &amp; adapted to times, places, and persons, <hi>viz.</hi> our own.</p>
                  <p>I might, perhaps decide the question, in few words, by alledging the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61851:3"/>
manifest inclination of the whole people, now to Monarchy; For, <hi>As no man can be wronged with his consent, so neither is any to be obliged against his will,</hi> And how should a Government founded upon inequality and force, ever subsist without it? Or a State, which is the meer Adjective of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, becomes a Substantive; beginnings of this kinde being so ominous? As reasonably might I object matter of Title, and forrain pretence; For the same estate, with a flaw in the Conveyance, or clogged with Statutes and Judgements, is not, surely, of like value, as if it had descended clearly from the great Grandfather, and were free both from Claimes and Incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and one that hath little, yet ows nothing, is likelier to thrive then he, who owing vast sums (which he resolves never to pay) dares not walk the streets for fear of Serjeants; But my intent, is onely, to shew, that, our former Government (as it excellently complied with the Laws Genius, &amp; Interest of this Nation) so it comprehended all the benefits of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in great perfection; And this I shall doe, as briefly, as I can.</p>
                  <p>To shew how it complied with our Laws and Constitutions, let it suffice that (Monarchy in these Nations, being more ancient then story or record, more Venerable than Tradition it self) our Laws were (as it were) under that Climate, habituated to that ayre and dyet, grafted into that stock; and though they have (God be thanked) forgot their <hi>Norman,</hi> yet they will hardly learn <hi>Greek,</hi> much lesse, <hi>Vtopian</hi>: That, in the late Protectours times, our Lawyers with one voice, importuned him, rather to assume the stile and power of a King, to which, they found all our Laws were shaped, then retain that of a Protectour, unknown to the Law: That nothing hath rendred our Architectours of a Common wealth more obnoxious, then that their infinite discords in other things, generally, agreed in the necessity of subverting all our Fundamentals, in order to their Designe; which hath likewise oblig'd all sober men, and true Patriots (even the chiefest Pillars of the Parliaments Cause, in the late War) to unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, with the Royall Interest, as not enduring to hear of those violent and dangerous alterations, which they see a Republick must introduce.</p>
                  <p>For its compliance with our Genius, consider, that as our English nature is not like the French, supple to oppression, and apt to delight in that pompe and magnificence of their Lords, which they know, is supported with their slavery and hunger; Nor like the High-land <hi>Scots,</hi> where the honour and Interest of the Chief is the glory of the whole <hi>Clan</hi>; so do<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h it, as little or lesse, agree with the <hi>Dutch</hi> humour, addicted onely to Traffick, Navigation, Handy-crafts, and fordid Thrift; and (in defiance of Heraul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry) every man fancying his own Scutcheon: Doth not every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, that hath the name of a Gentleman, aim his utmost to uphold it? Every one that hath not, to raise one? To this end, do not our very Yeomen commonly leave their Lands to the eldest Son, and to the others,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61851:3"/>
nothing but a Flail or Plough? Did not every one, that had any thing like an estate, pinch himself in his condition, to purchase a knight-hood or smal Patent? What need further proof? Our late experience of that glympse and shadow of Monarchy, (though in persons hated, and scorned, and upon a most scandalous account) yet (for meere resemblance) admitted as toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and in respect of a Common-wealth, Courted, clearly evinces, how gratefull the substance would be to Englishmen.</p>
                  <p>For our Interest, briefly (to wave tedious and politick discourses,) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that our Republick, (were it like to settle) would alarme all our Neighbours, would make our best Allies, our bitterest enemies, and (upon several accounts) probably draw upon us, the united forces of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to crush the <hi>Embrio.</hi> Which (the Nation being so weakened, and divided, as it is,) must evidently endanger our totall oppression, or at least, to bring in the King by Conquest: Besides, by what Title shall we pretend to hold <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> since that of Descent is now avoided, and Consent we know there is none, nor, indeed, can any be expected?</p>
                  <p>I come now to assert, that our former Government, eminently, included all the perfections of a Free-State, and was the Kernel, as it were, of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, in the shell of Monarchy: First I will begin with the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts of a Common-wealth, which are three, <hi>viz.</hi> The Senate propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, the People Resolving, the Magistrate Executing: For the Senate or Parliament, if, ever there were a free, and honourable one, it was here; where the Deputies of the whole Nation, most freely chosen, did, with like freedome, meet, propound, debate and vote all matters of common Interest: No danger escaped their Representing; no grievance, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; no publick right, their Claim; or good, their Demand; In all which the least breach of Priviledge was branded as a civil sacriledge, And though there lay no Appeal to the dispersed body of the People (a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion manifestly impracticable in Government, and sitter indeed for Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes to move, then Nations to admit) yet (Elections being so popular, and Assemblies frequent) the same end was attained with much more safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and convenience. The Prince had, likewise (in effect) but an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, which he exercised by Ministers and Officers, not onely sworn, but severely accomptable: For though both he and the Lords had their Negatives in making Laws; yet (no Tax being impossible, but by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Commons, nor any Law, (without it) of such validity, that the Ministers of Justice durst enforce it;) There was a wise and sweet necessity for the King, and likewise for the Lords (who were but as a grain in the Royall Scale) to confirm all such Bills, as were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the People and not greatly hurtfull to the Prince; and so this Bug-bear Negative, was resolved into a meer Target, to shelter and preserve the Government from being altered, at the Will of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61851:4"/>
the Commons, if, at any time they should prove Factious: which (being in reason manifest) hath been also confirmed by great experience: Our Kings having, rarely, obstructed any Bill, which they might safely grant; but on the other side, passed many high Acts of meer Grace, circumscribing their Prerogative, and clipping its Wings; nay, I could wish they had not peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced its bowels. This was that triple Cord, which one would think, could not be broken; nor indeed, was it broken, but cut asunder: This was our Gold, seven times refined; for every Bill, being thrice read, debated and agreed, in either House, was at last, brought to the King, for his Royal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the Mint of our Laws: A triall so exact, that surely, no drosse could escape it; since all Interests must thereto concur (as truly, it was but sit they should, in the establishment of that, which must binde them all:) This was that Temperament, which poised our Humours, and at once, endued us, with health, vigour and beauty; No Vote was precipitated, no Act was huddled up; As by sad events, we have since seen, that, Power being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed by one of the Estates, purged and modelled to the Interests of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; a consequence natural to such premises: (As in a Ballance consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but of one scale) nothing hath been weighed, our laws have been Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes of a Nights growths, and our times as fickle as the weather or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
                  <p>The King indeed, had the Power of making War, but he had not the means; And then, it signified no more, than giving him leave to flye, if he could get wings; or to go beyond Sea, so he went without shipping: He had a Sword, but he alone) could never draw it; for the Trained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Bands were a Weapon, which he (decently) wore, but the Nation, onely, could use: He chose his Ministers, (as who doth not his servants?) But alas, he was accomptable for them, to the Trienniall Parliament, which none but the soundest Integrity could abide: He could hinder the stroke of Justice with his Pardon (though still, the jaws not being muzzled, it would bite terribly) but certainly, it was great wisdom, rather, to give way; since (with his own scandall) he could afford offenders but a lame and scurvy Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and since the Power of relieving his VVants rested in the Commons, to ballance his Will, and oblige him to a Correspondence with Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>That his Person should be most Sacred, it was but needfull; to avoid circulation of accompt; reasonable, since it carries with it, the Consent of Nations; Just, that he should not be the meer But of Faction and Malice, in worse condition, than the basest of Vassals; Honourable, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of Government might not be daily uncovered; VVise, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, not at once, to trust and provoke, by forcing him to shift for his own Indemnity, no danger to the Publick seeming <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <p>A Revenue he had, for the support of his State and Family, ample; for the ordinary Protection of his People, sufficient; but for any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, defective; and for publick oppression; so inconsiderable, that when Prerogative was most Rampant, our greatest Princes (and some doubtlesse, we have had, the most renowned Warriours of their Ages) could never prudently aspire to make themselves sole Legislatours, nor presumed to maintain <hi>Red-coats</hi> in times of Peace.
