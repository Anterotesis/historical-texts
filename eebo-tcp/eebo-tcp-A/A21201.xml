            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This was a greate prerogatiue of nobilitie, wherof though the benefite be to be ascribed to god: yet the meane occasion of the same came from the Church of Rome. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithe of whiche churche, we haue euer since continued and consented with the rest of the worlde in vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of religion.

Of al which matters I can say nomore but suche was the misery of the tyme. And see how farre forth this furie went. For those that liue vnder the Turke, may frely liue after their conscience, and so was it not lawfull here. Yf men examined wel vpon what groundes these Innouations began, they shall well finde, that the rote of thys, as of many other mischieffes, was avarice: And that the lust &amp; Carnal affeccion of one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded all lawes, both deuine and humane.

all these deuises &amp; pollicies practised within thys Realme against the church of Rome, they neded not to haue loste you, but that they sought rather as fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des to reconcile you, then as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to enfeaste you. For they wanted not great offers of the most mightie Potentates in all Europe to haue ayded the church in that quarell. Then marke the sequel, ther semed by these chaun ges to rise a gret face of riches &amp; gayne, which in profe cam to gret misery and lacke.

And as it was a synguler fauoure of God to conioyue theym in mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: so it is not to be doubted but that he shal sende them yssue for the comforte and suerty of thys common wealthe.

outragious stormes of errours, cares, and calamities, are thus called home agayne to the sure hauen and porte of the most holy Catholyke faythe: But also we do beleue with our very hartes, and do confesse with al our mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, that almighty God of hys deuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath preserued and kept. iii. persons, as lode<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>star res and chiefe guydes, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, inbringinge, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Englande thus to the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Christes churche.</p>

The second is my lord Cardinal, who beyng an exile out of hys natiue countreth Englande, these xxi. yeares, for the two causes before mencioned, and in the meane season, so abhorred, so hated, and so detested as no man durst scars ones name him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the quenes magestie nowe hath restored to his bloud, and to the honor of his house.

            <p>Other newes I haue none, but

those newes, which most Ioiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reioyseth all Englande, That the Quenes magestie is concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with Childe whom our Lord long preserue, and send hir high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes a gracyous delyueraunce. And also that in Christmasse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydayes, the Prynce of Piemont arryued in Englande, and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after hym the prynce of Ore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge whiche are very pryncely intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the king and Quenes Magesties.

As for the quenes most excellent magesties

person whose person you haue so often tymes sene, I shall not greatly nede to depai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te vnto you: Understande therfore, that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng hys highth, I can wel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare<note place="margin">The kiges forme and stature.</note> hym to Iohn Hume my lord of Iedwardes kinsman. Of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, he is well fauored, with a brod forhead, &amp; gray iyes, streight nosed, and manly countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. From the forhead to the point of hys chynne, hys face groweth smal: his pace is pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cely, and gate so straight and vpright, as he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth no inche of his higthe, with a yeallowe head, and a yeallowe berde. And thus to conclude, he is so wel proporcioned of bodi, arme legge and euery other Limme to the same, as nature cannot work a more parfite paterne. And as I haue learned, of the age of. xxviii yeares. Whose maiesty I iudge to bee of a stoute stomake, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt
