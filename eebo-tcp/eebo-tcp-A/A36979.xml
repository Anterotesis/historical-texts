            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Am in Debt so many ways, for Obligations to your Self, and Noble Family, that, with all the Gratitude I have, I am puzzled in finding occasions to express my Thanks; be pleased therefore to receive in a Dedication of this flight Piece, my Hearts true Acknowledgments, and as true an Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to dievrt you, by Reading a Comedy, which was only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to please such as look on this sort of Dramatick Poesie, as you do, with Judgment and good Humour. I have studied these things long enough to know the Humor of the Town, and what is proper for Diversion; but I cannot always bring my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to flatter the (<hi>Would be WITS,</hi>) nor spare the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a notorious Vice, thô the price of a Third Day were the fatal consequence of such an Indiscretion: It is, and shall be, enough for me at any time, if some few of the many Noble and Worthy Persons, that did me the Honour to appear for me, in spite of the Party that was malitiously made by some eminent Gamesters of both Sexes, who thought themselves touch'd: If such as your Lordship, and those others of my unbyass'd Friends, will please to think it worth their liking, and alluding to a late Honourable, and Renowned Author; I Declare,

                  <p>As to the Play, I will only say this of it, the first hint was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from an old Comedy of <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s; and as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, and several new Humours added, it was generally lik'd before the Acting. I knew <hi>Basset</hi> was a Game, only proper for Persons of great Fortunes; and therefore I thought, that a wholsome Satyr of this kind might have oblig'd some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Gentlemen; or Citizens of small Estates, whose Wives ne're heeding the approaching Ruin, took only care, they might have the Honour, to be seen at Play with Quality. But some certain, very nice, Persons, especially one, took it so to Heart, that dear <hi>Basset</hi> should be expos'd, that my honest Intentions were quite frustrated, and that the Piece might be sure to be ruin'd, their Majesties were told, it was so obscene, that it was not fit to be Acted; when, I can prove, there has not, these seven years, been any Comedy so free from it; and some good Judges were pleas'd to Declare, they thought that, the only Reason some People had to find fault. Obscenity is a thing of that abomin<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>My LORD, I most Humbly beg your Lordships Pardon for this Digression, thô I could not well Publish the Play, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some Defence in this kind; but I have done with 'em now, and the hottest Censurer shall at leisure cool of himself: I will only rally my own ill Fortune, and say, with that admirable <hi>French</hi> Moralist; <hi>Fortune, Ie me repends de t'voir suivie, &amp; cognoissant que tu ne peux chos. du monde advoüë que la vertu est le seul port où les hommes peuvent-trouver leur veritable tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lité.</hi>

                  <l>A Poets Trade, like Hazard, does entice;</l>
                  <l>He's the unlucky Caster, you the Dice.</l>
                  <l>Constant ill Luck attends at every Throw</l>
                  <l>You Criticks are like <hi>Fullhams,</hi> high and low,</l>
                  <l>Yet 'tis his Fate, he can't give over so.</l>
                  <l>Like a young Wife, just ready to Lie in,</l>

                  <l>And each pert husfing Whipster throws a Bomb,</l>
                  <l>Whilst th' trembling Author all the Shot retains</l>
                  <l>Of several Nations, and their several Brains;</l>

                  <l>For Brains are never seen, till Heads are broke;</l>
                  <l>From Famous <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s Hint, this piece was made,</l>

                  <l>Without being flagn'd by a Poetick Whip.</l>
                  <l>The Noble Peer may to the Play repair,</l>

My third and last Branch is upon Amity, for as the Tree—</p>

                        <p>The Truth on't is at present, I look more like a Sow-gelder than a Secretary; the Learned observe, Men of Merits often taste the greatest misfortunes—Well Sir, I'll go and uncase, as your Grace Commands—little does he think that the Man in the Rugg here has his Fortune told to be as great as himself shortly. But Mum, <hi>Toby</hi>—There's some comfort still, however.

                  <head>EPILOGUE:</head>
                  <stage>Spoken by Mr. Montfort.</stage>
                  <p>Of which (because it was particularly carp'd at) I desire every one that has more Wit than Malice, to Judge.</p>
                  <l>FOnd of his Art; the Poet has to day</l>
                  <l>Mistook, and made me mad the silliest way;</l>
                  <l>Pride, Wealth, or Wine, may Frenzy often move:</l>
                  <l>But that's a strange Brute that runs mad for Love,</l>
                  <l>Few now, Thank Heaven, such lewd examples find,</l>
                  <l>'Tis forfeiting the Charter of our Kind;</l>
                  <l>Shall Men have all, and Women no remorse?</l>
                  <l>Then let the Cart hereafter drag the Horse.</l>
                  <l>Let each <hi>Eve</hi> wrest the Scripture false, and swear;</l>
                  <l>She was not made for Man, but Man for Her;</l>
                  <l>No, this had been a most unpardon'd Crime;</l>
                  <l>Did not the Lady here repent in time.</l>
                  <l>Besides, the Notion's false, for sure no Man</l>
                  <l>Can Love so well, and faith no Woman can:</l>
                  <l>'Tis true, degrees of Madness all may fit,</l>
                  <l>Some with too much, some with too little Wit,</l>
                  <l>I have been Mad, or I should ne'r have Writ.</l>
                  <l>'Tis a Disease that Reigns in every station,</l>
                  <l>First, amongst Gamesters I have found occasion,</l>
                  <l>Somtimes to make a pretty Observation;</l>
                  <l>At Hazard I have seen a Witty Lad</l>
                  <l>Eat up a Candle, if his luck were bad;</l>
                  <l>What think ye, Sirs, Was not that Fellow mad?</l>
                  <l>A Lady too, in Tears has left off Play</l>
                  <l>(Alas poor <hi>Punt,</hi>) for losing <hi>Sonica,</hi>)</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49146:45"/>But above all, Wine does worst Frenzy raise,</l>
                  <l>For then Fop comes, and Whistles at our Plays,</l>
                  <l>Calls some one Whore, that to some Spark belongs,</l>
                  <l>Who calls him out, and whips him through his Lungs.</l>
                  <l>This, on our Nation, a vile blot remains</l>
                  <l>None but the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> take such pains</l>
                  <l>To fill the Paunch, and empty all the Brains.</l>
                  <l>The last, worst sort too, does your Heads invade,</l>
                  <l>That's Whoring, that Vice makes ye all stark mad:</l>
                  <l>Not Poverty has power to stop its force,</l>
                  <l>Poor Rogues, that ne'r could pay their Alehouse Scores</l>
                  <l>Shall brag they've at Command a Leash of Whores.</l>
                  <l>To th' Camp those Militant Doxies yearly stray</l>
                  <l>Where each mad flitt'ring Fool that's given that way</l>
                  <l>To purchase Pox, melts down a whole Months Pay.</l>
                  <l>Many more Theams of Madness I could name,</l>
                  <l>And quote; indeed too many to our shame.</l>
                  <l>But, Sirs, to prove that you have all your Wits,</l>
                  <l>Let every Critick, that in Iudgment sits,</l>
                  <l>Our Poet to an easie Penance doom,</l>
                  <l>Wink at small faults, for all of you have some.</l>
