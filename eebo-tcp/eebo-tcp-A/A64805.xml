         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe End of theſe few Lines is to perſuade
Peace, which every man pretends to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet;
but the end is not attainable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the uſe, means, and avoiding that
which is of a contrary Importance. Some
few things are here pointed at, which have occaſioned
diſturbance in Families, hatred and animoſity among
Neighbours, diſorders in the City, oppreſſion and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in the Nation. That ſuch things may not happen
amongſt us any more, is the deſign of this Paper, and
ſhall be the conſtant and hearty Prayers of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>It behooves every good Citizen to have a watchful
Eye toward ſuch Perſons and Actions as would caſt
Scorn and Contempt upon the meaneſt Inſtrument of
Government. It is rare if any man be made deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wicked at once. Evil is propagated by degrees.
Hard thoughts of our Superiour, are often followed
with Hatred, and after with Sedition and Rebellion,
great things taking their riſe from ſmall and inſenſible
beginnings. A Cloud of the bigneſs of a Hand, ſpreads
the face of the Heavens. Thus a diſobedient Servant
proves a bad Maſter, and a worſe Citizen. If we ſlacken
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106515:3"/>
in the leaſt the Chain of our Duty, the Devil quickly
takes advantage. Some men who at firſt deteſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
have laughed and talked themſelves into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
for which, perhaps, being worthily puniſhed,
hath ſo exaſperated their minds, ſo as nothing wanted
for revenge, but an opportunity. Others there be,
whoſe great felicity lies in hearing and telling News:
Theſe are a ſort of Buſie-bodies, and men for the moſt
part, of ſmall imployment, and as little diſcretion, that
receive all they hear (eſpecially ſuch things as will pleaſe
their Party) without examining the probability of its
being true or falſe; and having heard ſome odd Story,
go (big with it) to the next Club, where it is related
with abundance of formality; and if it be any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Government, it is ten to one but ſome Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
or ſad Deſcant, as bad as Malice can invent, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
over and above. A ready way to introduce a diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
toward thoſe in Authority, and prepare mens
minds for Diſobedience and Rebellion: Therefore ſuch
Malapert Talkers, who are always finding fault, and
like Flies, are apt to dwell upon every Sore, ought to
be Brow-beaten, ſcorned, and oppoſed by every honeſt
Citizen, as the Bane of Society, and Peſts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
Let us all endeavour to live like Men,
and Chriſtians, and boldly reprove ſuch as offer to put
Affronts and Contempts upon Authority: A far rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
way to cure their itching Malady, than by taking
pleaſure in their Fooleries and impertinencies. Let
every man in his ſtation purſue thoſe things that make
for PEACE. We are all Members of one City, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of one Kingdom: all embarked in the ſame Veſſel,
and if that ſuffers Shipwrack, none can promiſe immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to themſelves. In a word, Let us <hi>fear God, honour
the King, and not meddle with thoſe that are given to
change.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106515:3"/>
There is alſo another ſort of men among us, ſo well
conceited as to think themſelves fit to be ſharers in the
Government, and are always complaining that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is amiſs. Men of petulant teſty humours, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
Spirits, never contented, never pleaſed. Is it
not a ſhame to think what a fooliſh and ridiculous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
was lately made to introduce an Officer among
us? Did they fanſie the Government would be Trickt
into a Sheriff? What was the Man? How qualified,
that ſuch ſiniſter and undue practices were uſed about
his Election? I believe but few men will beſpeak him
Maſter of any extraordinary meaſure of Reaſon, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Piety. As for his Eſtate, that was granted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
even by his own Faction, as appears by their
Subſcriptions towards the upholding of his Grandeur.
Certainly <hi>They have need of a Bird that give a Great for
an</hi> OWL! What then? Why the truth is, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more ridiculous than Empty Boldneſs, yet
this mans confident and ſeditious ſpeaking, which made
him obnoxious to the Law, hath advanced his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with ſome men to an high rate, who otherwiſe
might have paſſed along unobſerved. Is this an Office
to be carried on with Contribution? Is it not one of
the higheſt places of Truſt in this great City? Ought
not he, whoever is Elected to that dignity, to be able
to bear the charge without auxiliaries, as well for his
own ſecurity as the Cities honour? For ſhould he fail
in that particular, he muſt not onely be ruined, but the
Office fall lame by the way. Yet this man, till he ſaw
his Party confounded, offered without bluſhing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it. It is an Office of that Truſt, as ought to be
committed to the care of none but perſons of known
Integrity, Religion, and Honeſty, that in times of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and diſorder, may keep the Peace, and not encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
Sedition and Tumult: one firm in his Allegiance to

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106515:4"/>
his Majeſty, and a true Proteſtant according to the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> What deſign theſe men had in
offering their purſes ſo freely toward ſetting up this
Puppet Sheriff, God and their own hearts onely know;
but certainly it hath an ill aſpect, for that during his
Office he muſt have been Penſioner to the meaneſt
Tradeſ-man of his Party. Some few Quakers afforded
him their Votes, but their frugality and principles, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
would hardly, allow them to club toward Feaſting
or Fine Clothes. Whatſoever their end was, they are
not to be approved, who ſeek to acquire good ends by
bad means; and in this Eſſay they ſhewed the Popiſh
party a new device (though they have already more
tricks than are good) by Subſcriptions and Cabals to
introduce ſome of their Favourites into places of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Truſt.</p>
            <p>Conſider the danger and inconvenience that ariſeth
from the multitude of Pamphlets that are publiſhed
every day, filled with Lies and Falſhood, to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God and Religion: containing baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
reflections upon moſt men of the greateſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the Nation, not ſparing at ſome turns (though
in cunning and canting terms) the Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Sacred Majeſty. Are not all publick Actions
turned into <hi>Ridicule</hi> by theſe petty Scriblers, who have
hardly Bread to eat, but what they receive for their
Weekly Copy? Do we not all know that not long
ſince <hi>Poor Robins Intelligence</hi> was Weekly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
where the Author took upon him to make a
<hi>Laughing-ſtock</hi> of any perſon, to whom he was prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
either by money or malice, or to fill up an empty
ſpace in his Pamphlet? And though he forbore to name
the perſons, yet pointed at them by ſuch Notes and
Characters, as they were eaſily known by any that were
of the Neighbourhood, to the great diſturbance of

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106515:4"/>
Families and breach of Charity among Citizens, till for
abuſing a perſon of Honour, Authority took occaſion
to chaſtize his inſolence by ſtopping the Preſs: which
particulars, as to him, had been omitted, but that he, or
ſuch another, hath, and ſtill doth take upon him to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and aſperſe the Juſtice of the Nation, in unworthy
and unſeemly terms, not caring whether the matter be
true or falſe, ſo it will help to ſell the Book. It is true
the Lord Major hath taken ſome care about thoſe Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
but ſtill there remains a duty upon every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Citizen that may tend much to ſuppreſſing the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
thereby ariſing: for if in ſtead of reading them
with delight and complacency, they and their Authors
were diſcountenanced, it would contribute much to the
quiet and tranquility of the City and Nation. Let
each man obſerve this <hi>decorum;</hi> and for want of reward,
thoſe that write them would ſoon be compelled to turn
their Pens to ſome honeſter imployment. It is no ſmall
trouble to men that are peaceably diſpoſed, to ſee how
eagerly the multitude purſue thoſe miſchievous vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which commonly the ſharper and more Satyrical
they are againſt thoſe in place and authority, find the
moſt ready and approved reception, though to ſpeak
plain, it is a certain indication of a depraved conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
when men are better pleaſed with things ſowre
and crude, than with what affords wholeſom nutriment.
And the youth of this City, with ſome others, who are
but Children in Underſtanding, are as it were inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
tainted with diſlike of the Government, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoſe ſeeds of Sedition which afterwards afford
an Harveſt too plentiful, and upon every occaſion and
opportunity is ready to break forth into open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt thoſe, whom by the Law of Nature and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
they are bound to obey, eſteem, and honour.</p>
            <p>For my own part I am as deeply ſenſible of the late

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106515:5"/>
horrid and damnable Plot againſt the perſon of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majeſty, and the Proteſtant Religion as any man,
and am verily perſuaded the King himſelf, and thoſe
about him, are ſufficiently ſatisfied how induſtriouſly it
hath been carried on, contrived, and fomented by the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries both at home and abroad. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
I do profeſs, I think it our greateſt prudence and
duty to leave the proſecution of thoſe villanous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
to his Majeſty, and thoſe whom he is pleaſed
to authorize for that purpoſe, and not for us to meddle
with cenſuring their proceedings, either for Method,
Place, or Time, but to reſt ſatisfied with what they ſhall
think fit to do in the matter, leſt we be found among
the number of thoſe who are <hi>heady, high-minded, and
ſpeak evil of dignities, and that would rob the King of his
Diadem.</hi> For what is it leſs, if we cry out that thoſe
who ſit at the Helm are either ignorant, or abettors, or
favourers of ſuch horrid deſigns; in the one caſe we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
our ſelves fitter to govern than they; and in the
other, we render them, ſo much as in us lies, odious to
all men.</p>
            <p>We all know the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have been buſie ever ſince
the Reformation, to make us again taſte of their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinths
and Gourds, yet through the goodneſs of God,
and the prudence of our Governours their moſt ſecret
Plots have been diſcovered, their Deſigns baffled, and
all their attempts proved the raine of the Contrivers.
Neither have they been yet ſo formidable, as to offer
at any acts of open hoſtility, unleſs it can be ſaid they
made the Presbyterians and Independents their Drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the late Times to do their work. And if ſo,
when ever you ſee them aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ring at the ſame
Oar, conclude they are still serving the ends of the
ſame Maſters, or ſetting up for themſelves. And here
it will not be amiſs to conſider how things ſtand now,

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106515:5"/>
and what motives were frequently uſed for introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the late unnatural War. Did not the Factious of
thoſe Times ſeduce the people, by making them believe
the late King, of bleſſed Memory, was inclined to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
or at leaſt a favourer of it? Were not Fears and
Jealouſies the main Engines uſed by thoſe bloody Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants
to ſerve their turns? And is there not ſtrong
preſumptions that the ſame things are endeavoured by
the ſame ſort of men to be acted over again? Is it not
daily inculcated what danger we are in from the Papiſts,
and many a dreadful Story told of Slavery, Popery, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and Arbitrary Government, and God knows
what? Does any man think that the Magiſtrates are
ſwallowed up in a Supine Negligence? Hath his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
think you, no care of us, nor of himſelf? Hath he
not always with much fervor proteſted his adherence to
the Proteſtant Religion? Did he not graciouſly offer
the laſt Parliament to ſign any Bill they ſhould frame
for ſecurity thereof after his deceaſe? Is he then ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for its preſervation after his death, and ſhall we
imagine he will not protect us in the profeſſion of it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his happy Reign? (which God long continue.)
Away then with theſe Fears and Jealouſies which are
formented by men of ambitious deſigns, turbulent ſpirits,
and aſpiring minds. Look upon them all as Tricks of
the old Trade. Did his Majeſty ever do any thing that
looked like betraying us into Slavery? For Gods ſake,
Sirs, Conſider whither we are going; let us not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
again by the ſame methods we were before. Are
there not ſome at this day that long to be fingering the
Crown-Lands, and Biſhops Revenues. Be not enſnared
with their wicked Contrivances, and ſpecious pretences;
and let not us deny that to our Soveraign, which by the
common ſuffrages of Chriſt and his Apoſtles was awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to Heathen Emperours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106515:6"/>
But it may be ſaid, we are yet in danger of being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted
by the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and their bloody Crew, and the
late Plot is not yet over. It is true, we may yet be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to ſome effects of their malice and fury. But we
uſe to ſay, when a Diſtemper is once diſcovered, it is
half cured. Have not we been hitherto delivered from
thoſe Lions and Bears? They contrive, but God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints;
and if their plotting and deſigning, though
it takes no effect, ſhall continually fill us with fears and
jealouſies, how much more ſhould every man be filled
with affrightment at the leaſt appearance of that ſpirit
which ruled in the hearts of thoſe Children of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in the beginning of our late troubles? Shall theſe
men ſtill impoſe upon us ſuch dreadful apprehenſions of
thoſe, whoſe deſigns have hitherto been blaſted, and
muſt we be perſuaded that we are out of all danger
from thoſe who have ſo far ſucceeded in their attempts,
as to ſubvert a flouriſhing Kingdom, and overthrow
both Religion and property? Perhaps if theſe things
were well conſidered, we ſhould not be ſo eaſily Cajo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by them, whoſe great Cry is for Liberty, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they mean nothing more than Anarchy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;
againſt Popery, while they mean Epiſcopacy;
that while we are ſtaring at the <hi>Romiſh Wolf,</hi> we may
be ſurprized by the <hi>Northern Bear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have had of late ſome Inſtances of Tumultuary
Propoſals and Applications, that fell little ſhort of the
old Story of <hi>Venn</hi> with his Mermydons, as his late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
was pleaſed to expreſs it; which was onely an Eſſay
of the ſtrength of that Party that caſt us formerly into
Confuſion. But they were ſeaſonably checkt both by
the authority and good affections of the City, to the
Confuſion of their Hopes and Deſigns. Is not this like
<hi>Abſalom in the Gate?</hi> Is not this the way to amuſe and
fright men from their Trade and Buſineſs? and in effect

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106515:6"/>
to cry, as of old, <hi>To your Tents, O Iſrael?</hi> It is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thing to affect Popularity, and to talk of Papiſts
in Maſquerade. But unleſs we had better marks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to diſtinguiſh thoſe ſort of men, it can onely ſerve as
an odious term to be fixt upon whom himſelf and his
Party pleaſes; and when time ſerves, expoſe them to
the fury of an untutoured Zeal, and to be uſed as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant,
Delinquent and Popiſhly affected, were of late;
which had no other effect, but ſequeſtring the Eſtates,
and ruining the Families of perſons ſo ſtigmatized;
though indeed they onely were the true Lovers of the
Proteſtant Religion, their King, and Country. We
are not to account a Vote of the Houſe of Commons to
have the Authority of a Law, (as ſome would have a
late Vote to be,) when as (the Parliament being diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
it ſignifies juſt nothing as to the matter of Law,
though it was an honeſt and excellent teſtimony of their
Zeal for the preſervation of his Majeſties perſon, and the
Proteſtant Religion; for which the whole Nation is
bound to give them thanks, but I hope we ſhall never
live to ſee a Vote, no nor an Ordinance neither, paſs for
a Law; and I believe this did not ſpeak the ſenſe of the
Houſe: and as little did the late out-cry ſpeak the
ſenſe of the City, as appears in this, that there are not
ten men to be found that will own the action. Beſide
that, the Faction was over-born by a majority of honeſt
men.</p>
            <p>I have no purpoſe to reflect upon any mans perſon.
My deſign is onely to caution my Fellow-Citizens, not
to have a hand in any action that looks like Faction and
Diſorder, for from little ſparks, many times, are kindled
mighty flames: and <hi>Solomon</hi> bids us, <hi>Shun the appearance
of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Frailty and Imperfection is juſtly inſcribed on all
things ſublunary. Yet if we could ſuppoſe a Syſtem of

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106515:7"/>
Rules and Laws infallible, even this could not free the
Government from miſcarriages, it being morally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
among ſuch a multitude of ſubordinate Officers (of
neceſſity to be uſed) that all ſhould be furniſhed with
Wiſdom and Integrity ſufficient for diſcharge of their
duty, ſo that there will always be cauſe of complaint,
but no man can ſay, that ſuch things will diſcharge the
Subjects from their duty. As to the Conſtitution of
our Government, it hath been reckoned the beſt in the
World; and for the Adminiſtration, I dare appeal to
any man, whether there is not more rigour and ſeverity,
heavier Taxes and Impoſitions laid upon the People in
the moſt flouriſhing Chriſtian Kingdom in the World,
by three parts in four, than ever we have yet met with,
unleſs in the late Times of Defection. Is any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon us (which to remedy) will make amends
for Tumult and Diſorder, or any danger threatned, or
like to befall us, that can equal the miſchief and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of a Civil War. Conſider this, Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and let not ambitious men purchaſe their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the price of your Bloud and Treaſure. They
may contrive with their heads till their hearts ake, but
without help of your hands, all their project will fall
to the ground. I beſeech you therefore ſtand faſt in
your duty to God, allegiance to the King and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
eſtabliſhed by Law. To the firſt you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by Nature and Religion; to the ſecond, by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Oath; to the laſt, by Prudence and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid by the Diſſenters from the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> that they are willing to obey his Majeſty, and
obſerve the Law in all Civil Matters, but in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Affairs, and Epiſcopacy, they will not, they cannot
yield obedience. My buſineſs is not to diſpute the
point, but to perſuade to peace, and to warn you of ſuch
men as are like to diſturb it. Let it be conſidered that

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106515:7"/>
Epiſcopacy hath received the ſame Civil Sanction with
thoſe Laws that concern Liberty and Property. It is
adapted into the Conſtitution of the Government.
Would they have his Majeſty aboliſh Epiſcopacy by
his own power? Surely this would be to exalt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
with a witneſs; and (as themſelves would ſay
in other caſes) contrary to <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> If not, let
them ceaſe their murmurs, till ſome Parliament comes
that will pull down that, and ſet up a better, if they can
tell where to find it. I confeſs if any man purely out
of conſcience refuſeth to Conform, and the Laws againſt
it rigorouſly executed, his Circumſtances are hard. But
is that our Caſe? Is not every man ſuffered to be as
good as he will? Doth not the clemency of our King
admit every man to hear and preach where they pleaſe?
to follow their own Paſtors, and their own Diſcipline?
And after all this, do you hear men cry out againſt the
Government, the Biſhops, and the Clergy, men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and dignity in the Church, perſons againſt whom
they have no exceptions, but their Office and Revenues,
perſecuting them with the moſt vile and unſavoury Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
their malice can invent. And is this out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
too? Can any man think he that ſhuns a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
but can eaſily ſwallow a Lie, that exclaims againſt
the Common-Prayer, yet is full of Envy, and hatred, is
uncharitable to his Neighbour, and conſtantly reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with ſcurrilous and immoral expreſſions againſt
every one that treads not in his path: that this is the
effect of a <hi>Tender Conſcience.</hi> Fly then the Society of
this ſort of men, for whatſoever their ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may be, their thirſt is after Domination and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Thoſe that trampled upon the Mitre overthrew
the Crown, Monarchy and Epiſcopacy both fell by the
ſame hand: therefore it is not amiſs to mind you once
more of <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, <hi>Fear God, Honour the

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106515:8"/>
King, and meddle not with thoſe that are given to change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you reflect upon the Methods taken in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the late Wars by an ill-ſpirited ſort of men,
whoſe delight was in Diſorder, and aimed at gainful
Fiſhing, if they could but once trouble the Waters, that
their firſt endeavour was to raiſe a diſlike againſt the
Perſon and Government of the beſt of Kings, and how
the Grand Engineers ſtirred up the Citizeus and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
to popular Tumults, whereby his Majeſty
was invaded, and through fear and force, baniſhed from
his Palaces, Cities, his Conſort, his Royal Children
and Family, and at laſt himſelf moſt barbarouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.
What contrivance, and by whom carried on?
Broils raiſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the better to diſtreſs his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and after all this and much more, not to be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without the extreameſt horror and deteſtation;
How the Actors thereof were unmasked, their perſons
and deſigns diſcovered, their ſeveral Governments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their moſt politick Eſtabliſhment ſhaken to pieces
as frequently as formed, and at laſt both the one and
the other, not by humane prudence, but by the meer
hand of God, deſtroyed and confounded. In all which
mutations this City felt moſt conſtant pains and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and the whole Nation, after all the vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Blood and Treaſure, had purchaſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nothing but Chains and Fetters. When, I ſay,
you reflect upon theſe things, it muſt needs excite your
ſingular care to preſerve your ſelves from a ſubjection
to the deſigns of ſuch men, as may have hopes to lead
us again into the like Defection and Inconvenience,
and to be afraid of any thing that hath a tendency that
way.</p>
