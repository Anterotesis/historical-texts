            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Iupiter glutted with drinking of Nectar, sharpned his stomacke with chewing of Philemons sower Grapes. Honor of times hath her eye assone delighted with the sight of a crooked ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="tcp:6160:3"/>
as with the view of a curious Picture: and as well could Tmolus laugh at the homely Musicke of Pan, as wonder at the heauenly melodie of Apollo. The minde wearied with weightie affaires, seeketh assone to be recreated with some pithie conceipts, as with any deepe contemplations: &amp; rather with sleight deuises to procure mirth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with sollemne shewes to foster melancholie. They which offered gifts vnto Alexander, presented him with some warlike munition. None co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented Crassus so much as they which brought him straunge Characters. Nigidius being demaunded why he gaue Antonius Pius the bud of an Oliue, reddily aunswered: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is the flower of clemencie. So (right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) it is not possible that your Honour beeing a Maecenas of learning, should want the trouble of Schollers, neither that being such a worthie fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of good letters, euen the meanest (amongst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I rest) should not indeuour their simple skill to shewe how duetifully they are affected to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors noble and vertuous disposition. VVhich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this your rare and singular minde, hath forced many to present the fruits of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to your Lordships patronage: so that all they
<pb facs="tcp:6160:3"/>
which reape profite by others paines, and gaine knowledge by the workes of them which haue wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the depth of Myneruas Laberinth, are bound to praise and extoll your honor: whose courteous fauour towards learning, hath forced them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their skill for your Lordships priuate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but the Commons publicke commoditie. These premises throughly weighed, although my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce might iustly abash me from troubling your honour with such friuolous trash: yet the duetifull and humble affection wherewith I finde my selfe bound to such a worthie patrone of good letters, hath emboldned me to present your Honour with this Pamphlet, being a Planetomachia or generall opposition of the seuen Planets: wherein is Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomically decyphered their nature &amp; essence, and plainly sheweth (that sith euery man is naturally borne vnder the influence and irradiate constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one of these wandring Starres, and that one is alwaies predominant in the configuration of euery natiuitie) what proper qualities each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer Planet doth appropriate: painting out what affectionat desires Iupiter doth allot to them that are Iouialistes: and what qualities Saturne doth
<pb facs="tcp:6160:4"/>
infuse vpon them which are Saturnistes, together with the diseases incident to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitution and complexion. But as Horace alwaies sung his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres vpon the Lute, and Phidias painted blacke Vulcan sitting in an Iuorie Charriot: as Prota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines carued the counterfaite of Irus in a wedge of gold: and Demosthenes sawsed his weightie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiues with some pretie &amp; pleasaunt inuentions. So (right Honorable) I haue mixed melancholie with Musicke, and tempered the brawles of the Planets with pleasaunt though tragical histories: which if your Honour shall accept, my trauell shall be so requited, as if I had optained most rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. And thus hoping your Honor will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my rashnesse, and thinke of my mind more then of the matter, I commit your Honour to the Almightie.</p>

For as with confections tempered by Arte, the Phisitions sometim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here further is to be noted that <hi>Saturne</hi> with his Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie humor doth not erect in all bodies his influence equallie, but representeth and resembleth the nature of Wine, which for a certaine Idiot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Saturne</hi> with his Melancholie humor doeth moue some vnto laughter, as <hi>Democritus</hi>: some vnto teares, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi>: others to pratling, as <hi>Thersites</hi>: some to Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as <hi>Nestor</hi>: to patience and sylence, as <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysses:</hi> to feare as <hi>Pysander,</hi> to myrth as <hi>Lucullus,</hi> to sadnesse as <hi>Crassus,</hi> to musing as <hi>Archimedes</hi>: in fine, it moueth diuers men to diuers affectes, according to the proportion of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie or qualitie predomynant: All which affectes are styrred vp by certaine fumes and vapors, proceeding from Saturnine and Melancholie blood, which ascend vnto the Tower of the minde and there trouble the vitall spirites and the braine, which, as <hi>Galen</hi> saith, is the storehouse of the senses, and vitall actions whereof ensue diuerse doubtes, thoughts, reasons, discourses, opinions, studies, and phantasies, according (as I said before) to the variable nature in quantitie &amp; quality of the said Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly bloode puffing vp such grosse fumes and vapours as it were out of a hot and fierie matter. For we euidently see that more grosse smokes and smelles, doe proceede from burnt Oke, then from Alder, from sea coale then from wood, from Sulphur then from Frankensence because of the diuersities of their substance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their particular natures: so this starre procureth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse effectes according to his diuers temperature, for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it procureth boldnesse, as in <hi>Hercules</hi>: and being much adust, fearefull crueltie, as in <hi>Aiax,</hi> continuing long for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the terrene qualitie therein predominant, but and if it exceede more in coldnesse then either in heate or drinesse, it
<pb facs="tcp:6160:10"/>
ingendreth feare and slothfulnesse as in <hi>Pysander</hi> &amp; <hi>Thersites.</hi> By these former reasons it is euident (yee mightie gods) that the infortunate influence of <hi>Saturne</hi> with his Melancholie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour conceiued intemperately in a grosse and thicke matter, tourneth as it were, to infectious poyson, which in some liuing bodies lieth deade, as Sulphure remoued from the fire: and in other some flameth out as burning brimstone, which not onely burneth but also infecteth all thinges with his troublesome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poures and smokes.

his Chamber thinking to beguile the long sommers day with a fewe sweete slumbers, which fell out otherwise: For being once solitarie he felt his minde perplexed with more vehement and straunge passions: whereas before his affection was scarce warme, now his fancie beganne to flame: the Idea of <hi>Pasyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> comely personage presented it selfe so liuely into <hi>Rodentos</hi> imagination, as he felt himselfe halfe snared with her singular bewtie: which craftie <hi>Cupid</hi> noting, hauing his wings plumde with times Fethers, least hee might let slippe occasion, seeing this young nouice at discouert, thought to strike while the yron was hot, and so drew a boult to the head and hitte <hi>Rodento</hi> at the verie heart, which pearced so deepe as no meanes but death coulde euer after cure his maladie: for then the fame of <hi>Pasyllas</hi> vertuous life began to allure him, the report which all <hi>Ferrara</hi> made of her courtesie, was a chain to intangle his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: her honour, birth, parentage, and incomparable beautie gaue such fierce assaultes to his perplexed fancie, as no defence of reason was able to withstand these violent impressions. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dento</hi> seeing himself payned with these vnacquainted fits, was driuen into a quandarie, whither he should valiantly resist the inchaunting tunes of <hi>Cupids</hi> sorcerie, and so stande to the chaunce what so euer the maime were: or else yeelde to the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring call of beawtie, and so spende his youth in seeking, and sing for doubtfull, though desired fauours. Tossed a while in these contrarie thoughts he began to consider at last, that to fixe his fancie vpon <hi>Pasylla,</hi> was with the young Griphons to pecke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the starres: and with the wolues to barke against the moone, for there had ben such a perenmitie betweene the house of the <hi>Valdracchie</hi> and the <hi>Celij,</hi> that neither the Duke would condiscende his daughter should match with him: nor yet the Earle his father be content y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should fancy <hi>Pasylla.</hi> Further hee knew that as the hearbe <hi>Spattania</hi> no sooner sprouteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue grounde but it blometh, and the Egges of the Lapwing are scase hatched before the young ones can runne: so wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men resembling the Apples of the tree <hi>Pala,</hi> are scarce ripe before they desire to bee pluckte, and their yeares not able

                  <hi>Rodento</hi> had no sooner vttered these wordes, but hee felte his mynde halfe eased with flattering hym selfe thus in his follies, so that from doubting if hee mighte loue, hee fell to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising how to obtayne his loue: hee began to consider that <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dracko</hi> was his enemie, and that he might not goe to his house, least he should procure his secret harme, for the flattering of an enemie is like the melodie of the <hi>Syrens,</hi> who sing not to stirre vp myrth, but to allure vnto mishap. <hi>Rodento.</hi> I say, doubting that <hi>Valdrackos</hi> melancholy disposition could carrie in a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted tombe rotten beames, durst not venture too farre for slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ouer his shoes, thinking also that if the Earle his Father should know by any meanes of his pretence, he would strayght seeke to preuent his purpose. Seeing then that at this breache there was no way to giue the assault, he determined to meet her as she went abroad, and then to reueale vnto her the summe of his sute, this deuise was not so soon inuented, but it was as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily misliked, knowing that she went continually accompanied with such guarde of the Dukes houshold, that he shuld hardly be admitted to her speech, and if he were, yet he should neither haue fit time nor opportunity, to moue so waighty and secret a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Wel, <hi>Rodento</hi> hauing a spurre in his side to pricke hym forwarde in his enterprise, could take no rest till he might finde

some meanes how to manifest his affections. At last after sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry fond thoughts, he determined to send her a letter, which hee knew was such a secrete seruaunt as woulde neither blabbe nor blush, in deliuering his maisters message, but to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shoulde commit the charge, he knew not, so that he passed three or foure daies in careful thoughts, till at last he called to remembrance that there dwelled hard by the Dukes house, an old Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>Clarista,</hi> who made often repaire vnto the Lady <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silla,</hi> she, hee thought, was the fittest person to bring about hys purpose, knowing that old women oft times were more greedy of coyne, then charie of conscience, that for lucre they would not sticke to allure young myndes euen vnto vanities, and that not onely she might deliuer the letter secretly, but also temper <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillas</hi> mynd (if she were obstinate) with some forcible perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

It is not for fools to play with swords, nor for maides to dallie with loue, least the one haue cause to crie, and the other to repent. There is nothing sweeter then libertie, nor any thing more sooner lost, which men seeke to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with flattery, and to rewarde with falshood, yet I will imagine <hi>Rodento</hi> doth loue, and <hi>Pasylla</hi> could loue, will <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dracko</hi> grant he shoulde enioy his daughter? no, hee had rather preuent her with vntimely death, then pretend such an vnlikely demaunde: he would sooner consent to payn her with some hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish miserie, then place her in such a haplesse marriage.

To forbid <hi>Rodento</hi> to prosecute his sute, was to stoppe swift streames with a sworde, and to stay the blastes of the winds with a vale of silke, so that he was doubtfull what to do: yet in this resolute: rather then his enimy shoulde triumph in obtaining his purpose, to preuent his pretence with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death of his owne daughter.

               <p>With that, <hi>Valdracko</hi> embraced the Earle, swearing that he made such account of his friendship, as he wold obserue that day as the most fortunate in al his life. The Senat who al this while waited when either these 2. enimies shold part, or els fall into their accustomed choler, seing their friendly imbraceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, were all amazed with sodain ioy, &amp; driuen as it were into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie at this strange Metamorphosis, yet greatly astonished: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not priuy to their secrete conference, which the Duke perceiuing, to put them out of their musing dumps, told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how that they two, which neither by the feare of authoritye, nor friendly perswasions, could be reconciled, had nowe casting all old grudges aside, renewed a perfect league of amity, and to confirme the same, they were agreed to vnite their houses, and to marry <hi>Pasilla</hi> with <hi>Rodento.</hi>

a reason of the principles of his science. In this Citie, famous in those dayes for learning and vertue, dwelled an infamous strumpet called <hi>Rhodope,</hi> descended of good parentage, and of comely personage, honorable for her birth, and renowmed for her beautie: but her outward hue was so spotted with inwarde vice, as her praise was not such for the perfection of the body, as the discredit was for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lasciuious disposition of her mind, which was so stained with wanton affections, that I thinke <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe coulde not haue past her in vanities. This <hi>Rhodope</hi> racking her honestie to maintaine her pompe and pride, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting shame and conscience (two vertues long since exiled from <hi>Venus</hi> Court) set her bodie to sale, and in the prime of her yeares became a professed courtesan: so that for the appointed price, euery stragling straunger might pray vppon such loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Carrion.

It so fell out on a day, that shee determined to go sport her selfe at a fountaine (which is dedicated vnto <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) a miles distance from <hi>Memphis,</hi> whether shee went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with such young youthes, as were snared in her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring bewty: being come to the place which for the scituation seemed to bee an earthly paradise, after they had refreshed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with stoare of dainty delicates, which were prouided by <hi>Rhodope,</hi> they past away a great part of the day with amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conceiptes and pleasant parles: till at last the weather waring somewhat warme, <hi>Rhodope</hi> desirous to bath her feet in the coole fountaine, caused one of her maides to pull of her shooes, which were imbrodered with gould, and richly be sette with stones, which she diligently doing as she laid them on the greene grasse, verie necessarie to helpe her mistresse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

chaunce shoulde portende: beginning straight coniecturally to construe this happe to the worst, but her companions were of an other opinion, for some of them saide it was a signe of good lucke, other that it was a token of honour and dignitie: All (her selfe excepted) saide the best, because women are most pleased with praises and promises, and shee rested to thinke the best, whatsoeuer in outward countenance she did pretende. Well, after they had diuersely descanted vppon this euent, shee with her company returned to the Citie of <hi>Memphis,</hi> but the Eagle with the shooe tooke her flight to the Court of <hi>Psamne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichus,</hi> who at that verie moment was walking alone in his priuie Garden: assoone as shee came ouer the kings heade, not by chance, but by some infortunate and dismall destinie, she let the shooe fall, and with a marueilous crie soared againe into the ayre: which soodaine and prodigious sight so amazed the olde king, and so astonished his senses, as they which gazed at the gastlie heade of <hi>Gorgon.</hi> At last come to himselfe, he tooke vp the shooe, marueiling whether it did belong to some heauenly Nymph, or some mortall creature. The shape pleased his fancy. the glistring beautie thereof delighted his eyes: (to be short) <hi>Cupid</hi> the accursed sonne of <hi>Venus,</hi> seeing him at disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, drewe a boult to the heade and strooke <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> at the verie heart, which perced him so deepe, that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne not onely to like the shooe, but to loue the owner of such a pretious Iewel: feeling a tickling affection to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his minde, whereuppon he began to smile at his owne follie that he should be so fond now in his age to doate, more then he did in his youth.</p>

All desirous of gaine and glorie (beleeue mee, two Idols that women most honour) assailed to winne the price, but it was as easie for them as for <hi>Vulcan</hi> to drawe on <hi>Thetis</hi> slipper on his poult foote: whereat <hi>Philarkes</hi> and the noble men smiled, but <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> pinched with an vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted passion, began to imagine what heauenly creature she was, to whom this shooe did belong: feeding himselfe in this musing humor vntill such a burning desire crept into his minde that neither reason, nor counsaile could asswage, so that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himselfe into his secreat chamber holding the shooe in his hand, he cast himselfe on his bedde, where he murmured out these or such like complaints.</p>
               <p>Ah thrise vnhappie <hi>Psamnetichus,</hi> what vnfitte fancies bee these for thy aged yeares? what fonde thoughtes for thy gray heares? what vnmeete musings for thy stayed minde? wilt thou feeke to rake for quicke coales among dead cynders? to search for freshe flowers among withered weedes? to sow youthfull desires in aged mindes? if thou doe this <hi>Psamnetichus,</hi> thinke, though thou hast but a short time to liue, yet thou shalt haue a long time to repent. For loue in age is like fyre among drie sticks which kindled with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least puffe, is quenched in the least moment.

                  </gap> and therefore the more infortunate is my loue. <hi>Pigmalion</hi> fell in loue with his Marble picture an affection so straunge, as he was both blamed and pittied for
<pb facs="tcp:6160:29"/>
doating on such a senslesse Image. A Senators sonne in Rome loued extreemly the Iuory picture of <hi>Vesta,</hi> whiche wroughte him such discredit as he was exempted for bearing office in the citie. Were my case such, I wold think my selfe fortunate. But a shoe of golde is the only thing that bewitcheth my mind, such a straunge fancie, as time hath neuer made report of the like. Tush <hi>Psamnetichus,</hi> it is not the shoe, but the Dame that ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the shoe, which hath inchanted thy affection: it is the <hi>Idea</hi> of her person, which by a secret imagination, is imprinted in thy minde, that hath pearced thy heart: seeke then by some meanes to free thy selfe from those fetters, whiche vnlesse thou vnloose, thou canst not but loose. Dye then <hi>Psamnetichus,</hi> for nothing can free thee from loue but death. It is no earthly creature, but some heauenlie goddesse, that oweth this Iewell, the excellent shape of her, to whom this precious gemme doeth belong, was neuer placed on earth, but enthronysed amongest the heauens, the woorse is thy happe, and the lesse cause hast thou to hope: to hope? why not? <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> no doubt, shee is a woman, and therefore to bee wonne with prayses, or promises, for that shee is a woman.</p>
               <p>As thus he continued his complaints, his sonne <hi>Philarkes</hi> came into the chamber, wherevpon <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> ceased, and for that time made no shew of sorrow, but passed away the daye with other talke. The night beeing come, faining himselfe not well at ease, hee giuing his sonne and the other noble men the good night, went to his bedde, thinking by sleep to haue driuen away such fonde affections, but he was no sooner layd, but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king slumber, and halfe dreaming thoughts, so tormented him, that he coulde take no rest: wherevpon he began to cast a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand doubtful coniectures in his minde, what he had best to do: at last he found out this deuise.</p>
               <p>He called to remembrance that there was in his court a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne skilfull magician called <hi>Nestor,</hi> who by his secret science might not only be a meanes to discouer what Ladye was the owner of the shoe, but also if through frowardnesse (a disease co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

amorous potions, ayde him to obtaine his purpose. This polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke conceite pleased him passing well, so that on the morrowe (fearing that delay might breede daunger) hee sent for this olde doating <hi>Nestos,</hi> who comming to the kings presence, and with great reuerence, doing his obeisance, craued to know his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties pleasure: <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> curteously resaluting him, tooke him by the hand, and led him into his priuy garden, where char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him firste vppon his life and alleageaunce moste secretely to conceale whatsoeuer he shoulde in that place make manifest: then hee broke with him in the matter, promysing if hee coulde tell him by his arte who owed the shoe, hee woulde rewarde him so largely, as he should haue cause to speake of his bountie: otherwise if by negligence he should be found slacke, he would so bitterly reuenge hys frowarde disobedience, as hee shoulde haue cause both to curse hym selfe and his science. <hi>Nestos</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured with the large promises of the King, and feared wyth his sharpe and cruell threateninges, made aunsweare, that what were able to bee doone by Arte, shoulde wyth all skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diligence bee perfourmed: and hereuppon hee craued three dayes to make a shewe of his cunning. <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> (suche was the heate of his newe kindeled fancie) thought it a longe time to yeelde so small a verdict, yet hee was content, hoping by this meanes hee shoulde bee fully satisfied. <hi>Calchos</hi> leauing the King in his dumpes, hyed him home to his lodging, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into his study, began to fal to erecting of figures, to take the eleuation of the pole, and the houre wherein the shoe was found, but these superstitious ceremonies would not shew what hee sought for: so that in fine, from consecrating, hee was faine to fall to flatte coniuring, wherein after hee had swette lyke a dogge to adiure the Dyuell, hee perceiued by the Oracle, that hee had made an ende of his woorke, whiche hee had no sooner doone, but with all speede that mighte bee, hee posted to the Courte, where beeyng admitted to <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> presence, all the nobles commanded to auoyde the chamber, hee vttered these wordes.</p>

Loue is vnfit for thy yeeres, because thou art old, but such loue is vnmeet for thee wert thou neuer so young.

                  <hi>Philarkes</hi> was satisfied with his fathers answere, but <hi>Psam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netichus</hi> more troubled with his sons demand, so that he could take no rest, but lingred in doubtfull thoughts, til at last reason yeelding to appetite, and wisedome to affection, he determined to enioye a full content, though he both ouerthrew him selfe and his kingdome. Beeing resolute in this determination, for the better bringing to passe of his purpose, hee appoynted that his Court shoulde bee kepte at the Citye of <hi>Memphis,</hi> and heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon commanded, that with as muche speede as might bee, the Court shoulde remoue. The Courtiers willing, because the Winter drew on, to soiourne in the citie, vsed great diligence in dispatching their affaires: and the Citizens hearing that the King should come, willing to shew themselues dutiful subiects to so louing a Souerain, indeuoured to receiue him in the most sumptuous and solemne manner they coulde, prouiding shewes iustes, tourneyes and triumphes: sparing no expences, to shew their dutifull affections. <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> perceiuing by outward actions, the inwarde good will of his Citizens, requited theyr kindnesse with such friendly curtesie, &amp; princely magnificence, that with one generall assent, they all praysed his bountie and vertue.</p>

To send for her to the Court, was the ready meanes to reueale his folly to the whole worlde, and to repaire vnto the house of a Curtesan, was to dishonor his princely dignity, with a seruile discredite: but to remayne stil in the hellish passions, was in life to suffer farre worse paynes then death. At laste, seeing his troubled minde coulde finde out no shiftie deuise, hee thoughte it beste to make some of his trustye

seruauntes priuy to his affections, who perhappes by some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till pollicie might procure him to obtaine his purpose: and hee thought none so fitte for the participating of suche a waightye matter, then his Chamberlayne <hi>Zorastes</hi>: vnto whom on a daye when hee founde fitte time and opportunitie, hee reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the whole matter, laying before him two baytes, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and death, promising that if in secrete wise hee could help him to the sight of <hi>Rhodope,</hi> hee woulde bountifully rewarde him with liuinges and dignities: otherwyse if eyther he shoulde halte, or bee founde slacke in the perfourmaunce of hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, all tortures and tormentes shoulde bee too easie for the reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of his disloyalty. <hi>Zorastes</hi> hearing with sorrow this haplesse pretence of the King, knowing that hee was so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in his purposes, as no reason or counsell coulde diuerte from his determinations, thought perswasions woulde little preuaile: and therefore told him, that if his Maiesty would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe his deuise, he would that night bring him to the sighte of <hi>Rhodope,</hi> in such secret sorte, that no man but they two, should so much as once suspect the matter. For the fulfilling of this his promise, hee aduised the king to faine him selfe sicke, and to giue a speciall charge, that none, no not his sonne <hi>Philarkes,</hi> shoulde trouble hym, vnlesse they were sent for by <hi>Zorastes.</hi> This done, hee willed <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> to disguise hym selfe in the attire of one of his Gentlemen, and then they two passing out at a posterne gate, which opened into a darke lane, might wythout daunger or suspition, goe vnto the house of <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dope.</hi>

               <p>This prety pollicy greatly pleased the king, so that without any further consultation, hee put <hi>Zorastes</hi> deuise in practise: for assoone as the night came, he changed both his apparrel &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce so cunningly, as hee might bee taken rather for some stale Courtier, then for so mightye a Potentate.

But <hi>Philarkes,</hi> who sat nipped on the pate with this straunge newes, inraged with wrath and choller, coulde starse keepe his handes from preuenting his fathers miserie, by the violent death of such a vile strumpet, which <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> partlie

Well, <hi>Rhodope</hi> being a woman, and therefore both amorous and inconstant, shamed not to disdaine the father and desire the sonne: yeelding her selfe captiue to lust at the first alarum. To be short, <hi>Venus</hi> had so snared her in the beautie of her sonne <hi>Philarkes</hi> as her only ioy was in enioying the sight of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet as there is no weede so hadde which serueth not to some vse, nor confiction so deadly which hath not one good simple: so in <hi>Rhodopes</hi> minde, holely stained with vice, there were some sparks of vertue: for she considered with her self, that <hi>Psamne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichus</hi> of a common and infamous strumpet, had without anie desert, but vpon meere affection, made her a Queene: and if she should so falsifie her faith, the gods would not suffer such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall ingratitude to be vnreuenged. Further, the impossibility of obtaining such incestuous loue, was a meanes to perswade her from such laseiuious thoughts. But shee whom <hi>Venus</hi> had blinded with shamelesse affection, cared not for these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but followed her owne forwarde will, seeking not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse her lust, but how to enioy her loue: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she began to shew <hi>Philarkes,</hi> more then accustomed fauors, painting her beauty out with fresh coulers, &amp; seeking to intrappe the young Prince with alluring flatteries, and amorous glaunces. <hi>Philarkes</hi> whose young yeares were apt for loue, began more narrowlie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These sparkes of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grew by time to a greate flame, so that he began not onely to like, but to lust after <hi>Rhodope</hi> which he sought to represse with these reasons. First he perswaded himselfe that incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adultrie was a sinne so repugnant to nature, as the verie brute beastes did abhorre the committing of such a fact, and that it was so odious both to the gods and men, as it were better to committe either sacreledge, or murther: but these

thoughts could not que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch that which iniurious <hi>Venus</hi> had once set on fire, for he felt his mind so passionate with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beauty of his mother in law, as no counsaile might appease his maladie: yet nature and vertue so much preuailed, that he chose rather to die then to consent vnto such vnnaturall disloyaltie: his griefe so increased by concealing his disordinate fancies, that hee fell into a daungerous sicknesse, hauing his heade so weakened with continuall eare, and yrke some passions: that hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most brought into a frensie. <hi>Psamnetichus</hi> seeing his sonne thus perplexed, sent for the most learned Phisitions in all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but neither could they coniecture his disease, nor redresse his maladie, which so grieued the king as he tooke no delight but in sorrowing for his sonne <hi>Philarkes.

Although <hi>Philarkes</hi> saw her in suche a chafe, yet hee would not giue ouer the chase at the first default, but stoode fast to his tackling, insomuch that after a few consenting denialles, she agreed, assoone as place and time woulde serue, to fulfil his request. <hi>Philarkes</hi> sealing vp the bargain with a few sweet kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, rested content with this desired consent, and in shorte time recouered his former health, to the great ioy of his father <hi>Psam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netichus,</hi> and his mother in law <hi>Rhodope.</hi>

               <p>The king being gone on progresse, left the Queene at home, as he thought, halfe sicke, (for what cannot women faine to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill their fancies) and commanded his sonne <hi>Philarkes</hi> to beare her companie, vntil his returning: not thinking to repaire to <hi>Memphis,</hi> til a moneth were fully expired. <hi>Psa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>netichus</hi> beyng gone, the two louers floated in blisse, hauing such fitte opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities for the fruition of their loues, as they could wishe or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. But the king doating on the beautye of his young wyfe, had not been absent ten dayes, but that he tooke post horse, and rode very secretly and speedily to <hi>Memphis,</hi> where beeyng ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued, passing in at the posterne gate, onelye accompanied wyth <hi>Zoroastes</hi> his chamberlain, he found <hi>Rhodope</hi> and <hi>Philarkes</hi> in bed together fast on sleepe. Which strange &amp; vnnaturall sight so danted the old king, as a quaking cold possessing his limmes, hee stoode trembling for the horror of suche a bruitishe fact, till his chilling feare turning into a flaming choler, hee fell almost into a raging frenzie, yet hee somewhat appeased his furye, tyll hee hadde sente for twoo or three of hys Noble menne, which hee had lefte at the Court to bee attendaunt in hys ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence vpon the Queene, that they myghte bee wytnesses of

               </gap>ught them no plaine way but in darke problemes and miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: For he instituted certaine Feastes called <hi>Orgia:</hi> wherein vpon his Harpe he deliuered them in Sonnets the principles of Astrologie. Furthermore, by his Harpe which had seuen strings, he did represent the consent of the moueable Starres: which when he did strike he did ouercome all things, and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both Stones, Birds and Beastes. The Poets by this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his great skill and industrie in Musicke: &amp; the <hi>Gretians</hi> willing to honour him, appointed him a place in the Heauens, wherein a fewe Starres being conioyned in one circle is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Orpheus</hi> Harpe: so that if euer you shall see <hi>Orpheus</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carued in a Stone, or painted out in colours, he sitteth in the middest like a Musitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holding a Harp in his hand, &amp; about him a great multitude of creatures, amongst which there is a man, a Ball, and a Lyon, representing that part of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> nerest vnto the which he doth approach. It is reported also that <hi>Tyresias</hi> the <hi>Boetian,</hi> was very famous in the art of deuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6160:40"/>
And the Poets faine that he was both man and woman: but for no other cause then that he found out how the Signes and Planets were some feminine and some masculine. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident also how greatly the <hi>Gretians</hi> esteemed the Science of Astrologie, when as <hi>Atreus</hi> and <hi>Thiestes</hi> striuing for their fathers Kingdome, were by a common consent of the <hi>Argiues</hi> allotted, that whether of them excelled others in Astronomie should enioye the Empyre. Then <hi>Thiestes</hi> shewed them of the signe of <hi>Aries</hi> in the <hi>Zodiacke,</hi> whereof it was fained that <hi>Thiestes</hi> had a golden Ramme. But <hi>Atreus</hi> tolde them of the course of the Sunne, and of his rising and setting, that he was the middest of the Planets, and gaue light to the rest: of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and swiftnesse, and of his peculiar vertues and properties, whereof the <hi>Argiues</hi> made him King and honoured him great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The like I suppose of <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> who I thinke did not ride on a winged horse, but being skilfull in this Science, was contemplating daylie among the Starres, so that he ascended into heauen, not by a flying horse, but by a wise and conceiuing minde. The same is to be thought of <hi>Phrixus,</hi> the sonne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamantes,</hi> whom the Poets report was caried vp &amp; downe in the Ayre vpon a Ramme. And as for <hi>Dedalus</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> I esteeme him to be a perfect Astrologer, in which Science he greatly excelled in his time, and instructed his sonne therein. But <hi>Icarus</hi> tickled forward with the heate of youth, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting to much in his vnperfect skill, began at the first to search the deapth of Astrologie, and to wade so farre in the intricate misteries thereof, that climing to hie he erred from the trueth, and fell headlong into the deepe Sea of supernaturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts: whereof the <hi>Gretians</hi> said he was drowned in the Sea called <hi>Mare Icarium:</hi> Neither doe I thinke that <hi>Pasipha</hi> fell in loue with a Bull, and by the meanes of <hi>Dedalus</hi> obtained her incestuous pleasure, but that hearing by his reporte of the Signe <hi>Taurus</hi> placed in the <hi>Zodiacke,</hi> she fell in loue with the science of Astrologie, and by the meanes of <hi>Dedalus,</hi> had skill in the same: so that she was saide, <hi>copulare cum Tauro.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6160:41"/>
Amongst them which haue beene fauourers of this Arte, some haue laboured in one part and some in an other: one seeking to knowe the perfect course of the Moone: some of the Sunne: others of the rest of the Planets, according to their particuler disposition: as <hi>Endimion</hi> whom they faine to haue slept with <hi>Luna:</hi> and <hi>Phaeton</hi> to be the sonne of <hi>Soll:</hi> but these being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, did yet allude vnto their Astronomicall qualities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with these men were seuerally indewed. For who is so simple to thinke that <hi>Eneas</hi> was the sonne of <hi>Venus:</hi> or <hi>Mynos</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iupiter: Ascalaphus</hi> of <hi>Mars:</hi> or <hi>Antolycus</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie:</hi> but that in the configurations of their Natiuities, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was predominant in the one, <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: that as in the begetting or procreation of children, they take some likelihoode of their Parents, so being borne vnder one of the Planets, they borrowe of them their forme, shape, valour, mindes, and actions: for by the happie aspect of <hi>Iupiter Mynos</hi> became a King: <hi>Eneas</hi> borne faire by the fauour of <hi>Venus: Antolycus</hi> giuen to deceipt and robberie through the malignaunt influence of <hi>Mercurie.</hi> Furthermore, neither did <hi>Iupiter</hi> cast <hi>Saturne</hi> into bondes, nor throwe him headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, nor offer him these vnnaturall iniuries which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets faine. But <hi>Saturne</hi> is very slowe and dull in his motion, and is farre remooued from our <hi>Horizon,</hi> so that his motion may hardly bee marked of mortall men: and for this cause is sayd to stand as though bound in chaines. But who so narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considereth the sacred and misticall verses of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesiod,</hi> shall finde their fictions did tende to the discouerie of Astrologie. For where as he telleth of the chaine of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and of the Darts of <hi>Sol,</hi> I doe thinke he meaneth their irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation: in shewing the Cities which <hi>Vulcan</hi> did ingraue in the Target<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And although <hi>Homer</hi> hath shewed of the concurse of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi>: yet in other verses he seuerally describeth there diuers influence, as thus.

                  <hi>Charaxes</hi> as thus, he for feare and she for disdaine, ceased to passe away the time in any familiar conference, there came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garden her Brethren <hi>Frestinus</hi> and <hi>Romphanus:</hi> who saluting <hi>Charaxes</hi> very friendly, spent the morning while din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time in diuers kinde of exercise: wherein <hi>Charaxes</hi> was very actiue, as one framed by nature wholy to <hi>Mars</hi> and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall exploites.

Troubled with these diuers doubts, assane as dinner was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he got him into his Chamber, where being alone by him self, he began to consider the crooked disposition of <hi>Lyndana,</hi> and her froward crabbednesse, in crossing him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually with despightfull ouerthwarts: how for desire she requited him with disdaine: and for loue with hate: that although being a prisence he was courteously intertained by <hi>Euandrus,</hi> yet the vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued crueltie of <hi>Lyndana</hi> was such a hell to his conscience, as he would not liue long in such seruile subiection.

the King into a thicket, he spurred his horse and coasted out of the Forrest, and with as much speede as might bee fled out of the confines of <hi>Scithia,</hi> and so secretly and safely within short space arriued in <hi>Libia.</hi> But leauing <hi>Charaxes</hi> to his good lucke, againe to <hi>Frestynus</hi> and <hi>Romphanus,</hi> who with great sport so hotly pursued the Bore, that within three or fower ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers they killed him, and sent him to the Court by two of the Gentlemen there present: which done, missing the King their father, they straight thrust into the thicke of the Forrest to goe seeke him: but coasting and coursing through ech holt &amp; lawne, finde him they could not: yet not leauing of to hallowe and to blowe their hornes, but they could not heare any replye, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the chatting Eccho, who alwaies returned them the last ende of their measures.

Whereupon he presently went to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxes,</hi> who seeing <hi>Frestynus</hi> in such estate, was greatly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: yet he most courteously and kingly imbraced him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the cause of his so straunge and vnlookt for arriuall. <hi>Frestynus</hi> vnfolded vnto him the cause of his comming, how <hi>Romphanus</hi> his brother had sediciously driuen him out of his Kingdome and Countrie, and possessed himself of the Crowne and Dyadem, and that if it pleased him to take the matter in hand, and by force repossesse him of his Domynions, he would acknowledge himself his Subiect and pay him yerely tribute. <hi>Charaxes</hi> seeing the way layd open before him to enioye the Kingdome of <hi>Scythia,</hi> made aunswere to <hi>Frestynus,</hi> that he would for his sake giue <hi>Romphanus</hi> such a breakfast, as he should neuer be able to disgest it, bidding him be of good chere, for what he had promised he would with all speede performe. Upon this <hi>Frestynus</hi> rested, &amp; <hi>Charaxes</hi> smyling in his sleeue mustered all <hi>Libia,</hi> and gathered a mightie Host of good and valiaunt Soldiours, furnishing them with such Armour, and his Camp with such warlike Artillarie and Munition, as was able to afray the greatest Prince in those parts. Being thus prouided, he protracted no time but passed into <hi>Scythia,</hi> where
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6160:56"/>
he raced downe diuers Townes which withstood him, putting all to the edge of the sword that obeyed not to the Herralt sent vnder the name of their lawfull King <hi>Frestynus.</hi> This bloudy inuasion terrified so the <hi>Scythians,</hi> that he quietly passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe a great part of the Countrie without any skirmish, but at last <hi>Romphanus</hi> met him with a great power and ioyned battell: betwene whom was a daungerous and cruell conflict: the <hi>Scythians</hi> fearing the tyrannie of <hi>Frestynus</hi> &amp; <hi>Charaxes,</hi> and the <hi>Libians</hi> hoping for no mercie if they remayned van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished: The combat continuing still doubtfull, till the two Brothers <hi>Romphanus</hi> and <hi>Frestynus</hi> met, betweene whom there was a mortall combat: at last <hi>Frestynus</hi> feeling himselfe in some perril, redoubled his strength and slewe <hi>Romphanus:</hi> who no sooner was dead but his Soldiours began to faint and to flee: whereupon the <hi>Libians</hi> pursued them so fast, that they made a monstrous massacre, leauing of all the Armie fewe or none aliue. Constrayned at last by the approching of the night to retyre: the <hi>Libians</hi> went home to their Tents with great ioye and triumph: Amongst whom went <hi>Frestynus</hi> as a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Conquerour, ioyfull for so happie a Conquest. Well, the Soldiours banquetting and making chere for their good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: <hi>Charaxes</hi> &amp; <hi>Frestynus</hi> supped together as good frends, and departed not while late in the night. But vpon the next morning <hi>Charaxes</hi> being earely vp, came into <hi>Frestynus</hi> tent, accompanied with diuers of his Nobles, whom he found fast a sleepe in his bed, and drawing out his arming sworde, without respecting either law of God or man smot of his head, leauing the body weltring in his bloud: which when he had done, he called straight for a Herralt at Armes, and taking the heads of the two Brothers, sent them speedilie to the Ladie <hi>Lyndana,</hi> with a Letter to this effect.</p>
