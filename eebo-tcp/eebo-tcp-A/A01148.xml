            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I am ſure it hath amazed ſome of you not a little, that I haue forſaken the ſocietie, wherein I was woont to meete you, and haue drawen vpon my ſelfe that diſgracefull name of an <hi>Huguenot</hi> (for ſo I heare you pleaſe to tearme me) and other ſcandalous imputations wherewith you vpbraide me; all which are to me no meane aduantage.

 withdrawe me out of the ſinck of ſinne and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,<note place="margin">After her conuerſion, ſhe wrote this Epistle.</note> to incorporate me in the communion of his Sonne, within the boſome of his ſanctified Church, the refuge for all them that deſire ſaluation, (and where I wiſh, and deſire in ſoule, that I could em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace you all:) After (I ſay) God had thus diſpoſed of my abſolute conuerſion, notwithſtanding my many reuoltes and back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſlidings, by your Letters, wherewith I was continually laboured, and other meanes of no ſmall moment; I fell vpon my knees, and as the bleſſed <hi>Virgin Marie</hi> ſaid in her Song, at that heauenly ſalutation brought her by the Angell <hi>Gabriell,</hi> euen ſo I ſpake to my God in my ſoule:<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ieſus Chriſt is the only Sacrificer, without any ſucceſſor or Vicar.</note> To Ieſus Chriſt then only appertaineth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, to be the Sacrificer of the new couenant: and they doe him intollerable outrage, to appoint him any Succeſſors or Suffragans, in regard the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>There is one euerlaſting Sacrificer, which neuer ceaſeth, and paſſeth not from one to another.</hi>

So likewiſe Chriſt tooke not to himſelfe this honor, to be made the high Prieſt: but he glorified him, that ſaide vnto him: <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day begate I thee.</hi>

            <p>As for the Sacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, that is (ſaith<note place="margin">

            <p>Iouerſlip a great many blaſphemies, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue ech one to be ſeuerally ſpoken of: For you haue tolde me, that ſome things you giue credit to, and others you doe not, eſpecially any thing which you conceite to be damnable.

Therefore in Poperie, when they doe enterpriſe, to reiterate, or renew, or continue the ſame (for they make vſe of all theſe ſeueral tearmes) is it any thing elſe, but a meere renouncing of that only ſacrifice, remaining freſh, in full ſtrength and vigour, which Chriſt once offred vpon his Croſſe, to ſanctifie all beleeuers? And the fruite heereof is daily preſented to vs, in the preaching of the Goſpell, and we reeeiue the ſame by a true &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified faith, in him only. For to this end was the ſacred miniſterie of Gods word inſtituted by God himſelfe in his Church: and not for any nouell or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſacrifices, as your (ſoules heauie enemies) doe make you to beleeue.</p>

In diſtributing the bread, he ſaid, <hi>Take, eate, this is my bodie which is given for you; doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> Likewiſe in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the wine, he ſaid: <hi>Drinke you all of this, for this is my bloud. &amp;c.</hi> where we may diſcerne, that he putteth the commaundement in the firſt place,<note place="margin">Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is in the firſt place.</note> in ſaying to vs, that we ſhall take, eate, and drinke. Then he annexeth the promiſe, wherein he teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs, that that which we eate, is his bodie, and that which we drinke is his bloud. To enjoy then the effect and benefit of this promiſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth, that the faithfull doe take and eate the bread, &amp; drinke the wine which is giuen to them. In briefe, there is the communion of many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in doing that, which Ieſus Chriſt repreſenting to the whole Church, did performe in this firſt Supper: For that which Ieſus Chriſt ſaid to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;

            <p>In the Goſpel, the vertue, nature, and vſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, are expreſſed clearely and openly.

And therefore the bread, which he makes to bee adored then, euen as if it were the body indeed of our Lord: is no ſuch matter, but remaineth ſtill very bread, euen as it was before his conſecration, being neyther more or leſſe, then as if it were in any other place, out of the Churches aſſembly, and the Prieſts, and whoſoeuer (for his owne pleaſure) ſhould ſpeake the very ſame words of their inſtitution, vpon any other piece of bread.</p>

For ſeeing that Ieſus Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vs, to giue vs his body in the Sacrament, when the faithfull ſhould communicate together after his inſtitution: we may not be ſo vain or idle-headed, as to ſeeke it elſewhere, or according to our fantaſies.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch men therfore be admoniſhed, that they cannot excuſe themſelues of idolatry, both before God and men: when they are made to worſhippe<note place="margin">They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a round cake in ſtead of God.</note> (as if God himſelfe were ſubſtantially preſent) a round cake of bread, which is lifted vp to be ſeen, aboue the ſhoulders of the Prieſt, and (with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great deuotion) to be reuerenced and adored of all there preſent.</p>
            <p>But Ladies, I haue held ye ſomewhat long in this point, becauſe it is of ſuch maine importance, yet perſwading my ſelfe to haue ſaid ſufficient, albeit not halfe ſo much as I could: I will proceed to diſcouer another wicked Idolatry, which they<note place="margin">She procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther idolatry commutted by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people.</note> procure the poore people to commit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as thinking theron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that is, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in their Maſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhould obſerue the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in that kinde as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt did firſt inſtitute it by inniting the people to communicate with the Preiſt, they fly from his example, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, (once a yeare) they are contented to doe ſo,
<pb facs="tcp:2710:15"/>
and that is at Eaſter, for then the people ſhall bee<note place="margin">The people doe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate but in one kinde.</note> permitted to communicate, and yet it is but of one moitie onely of the Sacrament, wherein likewiſe they intermingle many fond inuentions, yea, and all the accuſtomed ſuperſtitions of their ordinarie Maſſes, without expounding, or declaring any part of the miſtery to the people.</p>
            <p>According to the inſtitution of our Lord in the Sacrament, they ſhould inuite the people, and breaking the body of Chriſt, after his example, it ſhould be truely giuen to the faithfull Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, according to the promiſe of our Sauiour. Notwithſtanding all this, they will obſerue their owne deuiſed manner, wherein they can no way<note place="margin">The Prieſts are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and make the people to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, gaue his bodie to be lookte vpon with our ſoules eyes, and not to be ſuperſtitiouſly adored in the bread, which is no more but the outward ſigne, and (by faith) to bee eaten to euerlaſting life. For (worthy Ladyes)<note place="margin">Chriſt did command no worſhip to the bread.</note> Chriſt did not ſay, looke vpon this bread, then take, eate, and worſhip it: but he ſimply ſaid, Take, eate, this is my body.</p>
            <p>Therefore whereas the Sacrament ſhould bee a helpe, to liſt vp the vnderſtanding, of the faithfull vnto heauen, where Chriſt Ieſus is, and no where elſe, as concerning his true body, &amp; (from thence) giues himſelfe in powerfull vertue, to enioy and

            <p>They ſeeke not to eleuate mens vnderſtandings, to the place where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hande of his Father, but to lift vp their eies to their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Idoll.

            <p>Beſides all this, the prayers which they yet vſe to ſay in their Maſſe, do likewiſe very ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them: for when the Church retained her wonted puritie, the people were then receiued to the Communion, and behold what their prayers then contained, and yet doe.</p>
