            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>FOps and Knaves are the fittest Characters for Comaedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this Town was wont
to abound with variety of Vanities and Knaveries till this unhappy division.
But all run now into Politicks, and you must needs, if you touch upon any humour
of this time, offend one of the Parties. The Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds being then so narrow, I saw
there was no scope for the writing of an intire Comaedy, (wherein the Poet must
have a relish of the present time) and therefore I resolved to make as good an
entertainment as I could, without tying my self up to the strict rules of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maedy;
which was the reason of my i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>troducing of Witches. Yet I will be bold
to affirm, that Young <hi>Hartfort,</hi> Sir <hi>Timothy, Smerk,</hi> and <hi>Tegue O Divelly</hi>
are true Comical Characters, and have something new in 'em. And how any of
these (the Scene being laid in <hi>Lancashire</hi>) could offend any Party here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
that of Papists, I could not imagine, till I heard that great opposition was design'd
against the Play (a month before it was acted) by a Party who (being ashamed to
say it was for the sake of the Irish Priest) pretended that I had written a Saty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and several profest Papists railed at it violently,
before they had seen it, alledging that for a reason, such dear Friends they are
to our Church. And (notwithstanding all was put out that could any way be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rested to an offence against the Church) yet they came with the greatest malice
in the world to hiss it, and many that call'd themselves Protestants, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyn'd with
them in that noble enterprise.</p>
            <p>How strict a scrutiny was made upon the Play you may easily see, for I have
in my own vindication Printed it just as I first writ it; and all that was exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is Printed in the Italick Letter. All the difference is, that I have now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<hi>Smerk,</hi> who before was a young Student in Divinity, expecting Orders
and to be Chaplain to Sir <hi>Edward.</hi> The Master of the Revels (who I must confess
used me civilly enough) Licenc'd it at first with little alteration: But there

that upon a Review, he expunged all that you see differently Printed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
about a dozen li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es which he struck out at the first reading.</p>
            <p>But, for all this, they came resolved to hiss at it right or wrong, and had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mercenary Fellows, who were such Fools they did not know when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o hiss, and
<pb facs="tcp:62244:3"/>
this was evident to all the Audience. It was wonderful to see men of great Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentlemen in so mean a Combination. But to my great satisfaction they
came off as meanly as I could wish. I had, so numerous an assembly of the best
sort of men, who stood so generously in my defence, for the three first days, that
they qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh'd all the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>issers yielded, and the Play lived in spight of them.</p>
            <p>Had it been never so bad, I had valued the honour of having so many, and
such Friends, as eminently appeared for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> above that of excelling the most
admirable <hi>Johnson,</hi> if it were possible to be done by me.</p>
            <p>Now, for reflecting upon the Chuch of <hi>England,</hi> you will find, by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in the Play, that I intended nothing less. And I am well assured that
no Learned, or Wise Divine of the Church, will believe me guilty of it. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to have a true value and respect for them.</p>
            <p>But they who say that the representation of such a Fool and Knave as <hi>Smerk</hi>
(who is declared to be an infamous Fellow, not of the Church, but crept into it
for a Lively-hood, exposed for his Folly and Knavery, and expell'd the Family)
should concern, or reflect upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> doe sufficiently abuse it. A
fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lish Lord, or Knight is daily represented: nor are there any so silly to believe
it an abuse to their Order. Should <hi>Thompson,</hi> or <hi>Mason,</hi> or any Impudent
Hot-headed Tan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivy Fool be exposed; I am confident that the Sober and the
Wise Divines of the Church will be so far from thinking themselves concern'd in
it, that they detest them as much as I do.</p>
            <p>Nor should any of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation think themselves concern'd, but <hi>Kelly</hi> (one
of the Murderers of Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfrey</hi>) which I make to be his feign'd
Name, and <hi>Tegue O Divelly</hi> his true one. For Whores and Priests have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
names still.</p>
            <p>Some of the worsted Party of the Hissers were so malicious to make People
believe (because I had laid the Scene in <hi>Lancashire</hi>) that I had reflected perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
on some in that, and in an adjoyning County. Which no man, that will
give himself leave to think can believe. And I do here solemnly declare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and that it was never once in my thoughts to do so.</p>
            <p>But the Clamours of a Party (who can support themselves by nothing but fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood)
rose so high, as to report that I had written Sedition and Treason, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
upon His Majesty, and that the Scope of the Play was against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England.</hi> Which are Villanies I abhor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some of the Reporters I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
would not stic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at. But I am well assured they did not believe themselves,
only (out of malice to me) thought if they could bring the report to <hi>Windsor</hi>
(which they did) by that means to cause the silencing the Play, without farther
examination: But they who had the Power, were too just for that, and let it live.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62244:3"/>
For these reasons I am forced, in my own vindication, to Print the whole Play
just as I writ it (without adding, or deminishing) as all the Actors who rehers'd
it so a fortnight together, before it was reviewed, may testifie.</p>
            <p>For the Magical part, I had no hopes of equalling <hi>Shakespear</hi> in fancy, who
created his Witchcraft for the most part out of his own imagination (in which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
no man ever excell'd him) and therefore I resolved to take mine from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And to that end, there is not one action in the Play, nay scarce a word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, but is borrowed from some antient, or Modern Witchmonger. Which
you will find in the notes, wherein I have presented you a great part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Witchcraft, beleive it who will. For my part, I am (as it is said of
<hi>Surly</hi> in the <hi>Alchymist,</hi> somewhat costive of beleif. The evidences I have
represented are natural, <hi>viz</hi> slight, and frivolous, such as poor old Women were
wont to be hang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s, if I had not represented them as those of real Witches, but
had show'd the ignorance, fear, melancholy, malice, confederacy, and imposture
that contribute to the beleif of Witchcraft, the people had wanted diversion, and
their had been another clamor against it, it would have been call'd Atheistical, By
a prevailing party who take it ill that the power of the Devil should be lessen'd, and
attribute more miracles to a silly old Woman, then ever they did to the greatest
of Prophets, and by this means the Play might have been Silenced.</p>
            <p>I have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t one thing more to observe which is, that Witchcraft, being a Religion
to the Devil, (for so it is) their charms upon several occasions being so many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Witches Liturgy to him,) and attended with as many ceremonies as
even the Popish Religion is, 'tis remarkable that the Church of the Devil (if
I may catachrestically call it so) ha's continued almost the same, from their first
writers on this subject to the last. From <hi>Theocritus</hi> his <hi>Pharmaceutria,</hi> to
<hi>Sadducismus Triumphatus:</hi> and to the shame of Divines, the Church of Christ
has been in perpetual alteration. But had there been as little to be gotten in
one as in the other, 'tis probable there would have been as few changes.</p>
            <p>I have troubled you too long, speak of the Play as you find it.</p>

                  <p>O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yes, there are Huntsmen that think there's no sport without venturing
Necks or Collet-bones; besides, there is no other way to hope to see our Mistresses:
by this means we shall troll out my Mistresses Brother, who loves, and understands
nothing but Countrey sports. By that we may get acquaintance with Sir <hi>Edward
Harfourt,</hi> who is reported to be a wise, honest, hospitable, true English man. And
that will bring us into Sir <hi>Ieffery Shaklehead</hi>'s family, <hi>Whally</hi> being in the mid-way
betwixt them.</p>

                  <p>I vow 'tis true; indeed I have strugled with my self before I thought fit
to reveal this: but the consideration of your great accomplishments, do indeed, as

                  <p>There is a Friend of mine, a Lady (whom the world has acknowledged
to be well bread, and of Parts too, that I must say, and almost confess) not in the
