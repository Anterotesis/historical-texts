            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>PROPOSALS To the HONOURABLE HOUSE of COMMONS,</hi> By <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> Gent. How to Raiſe Four Millions in Five Years; or Eight Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> without Demanding, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, or Receiving one Penny in Money from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: <hi>Demonſtrated thus,</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <label>Firſt,</label> THAT the People of <hi>England,</hi> by Computation, are 9000000. And that each of them doth Expend half a Peck of Bread-Corn <hi>per</hi> Week, at leaſt; And that if One Half-Penny Duty be laid upon each reſpective Half-Peck, it will amount to 975000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> Deduct 175000 <hi>l.</hi> for Poor, and Collecting the ſaid Duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then 'twill amount t 4000000 <hi>l.</hi> in Five Years, or 800000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be Collected at the ſeveral Mills where the ſaid Corn ſhall be Ground, and the Overſeers of each reſpective Pariſh, to Appoint ſuch Times for the Inhabitants to bring their Corn to the ſaid Mills, as ſhall be moſt convenient for them, and Surveyors to be Appointed to Attend at the ſaid Mills, at thoſe Times, to take an Account of the Corn; The Duty to be received in Meal. Thus, for every Peck of Wheat, Maſtling or Rye, One Penny-worth; and ſo proportionably for a greater or leſſer Quantity; The Miller only to be Accountable to the Surveyor, and to be Chapmen for the ſame at the loweſt Market-Price; which ſhall be ſet by the Juſtices of the Peace at their Quarter-Seſſions, or other Meetings, which will be the ſame Trouble to the ſaid Juſtices, as giving the Aſſize of Bread to the Bakers, and the Miller to have Credit for the ſame to ſuch Times as ſhall be Appointed by the Collectors.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Object. 1.</label> 
               <hi>That the People will be Liable to be Defrauded by the Miller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſwer.</label> That the Juſtices of the Peace do Award how many Ounces the Miller ſhall Receive for the Penny-worth <hi>per</hi> Peck Duty; So that the People cannot be wronged one Grain comparatively.</p>
            <p>The Overſeers to give a Liſt of the Poor at the Meeting of the ſaid Juſtices, and the Juſtices Certificate of ſuch Poor to the Collectors, ſhall be ſufficient, and the Poor to be Allowed Half a Peck a-piece, Ground or Unground, <hi>per</hi> Week; and this to be unaccounted between the Miller and the Surveyors.</p>
            <p>If any Perſon or Perſons ſhall bring their Corn at other Time or Times than Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, it ſhall be Forfeited to the King; or if the Miller ſhall Receive any Corn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Surveyor's Knowledge, That he ſhall be Liable to ſuch Penalty as this Honourable Houſe ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Object. 2.</label> 
               <hi>Why ſhall thoſe that have Conveniency to Grind at Home, be obliged to bring their Corn to the Mill?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw</label> It may be thus Ordered, Such Perſons ſhall give an Account of the Number of their Families to the Collectors, and be Chargeable for the ſame Half-Peck Duty, in the Nature as the Miller.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it will be a great Charge to Collect this Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That One Perſon, being placed in the Center, may Collect Twelve Mills; which will not amount to above 12 <hi>d.</hi> in the Pound.</p>
            <p>If this Paſs into an Act, no Bank or Fund whatſoever, but will Advance a Million, either by way of Loan or Farming the ſame upon ſo certain a Revenue, that while the People eat Bread, cannot fail nor alter.</p>
            <p>And that no good Subject will Grudge a ſmall ſlice of Bread, once a Week, for ſo great a Support to the King and Government againſt their Enemies: And this Duty amounts to no more.</p>
            <closer>And I hope my Well-wiſhing, when Corrected and Amended by my Superiours, may be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, as deſigned by your moſt Humble and Obedient Servant.</closer>
