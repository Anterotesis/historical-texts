            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Eſſay of a King written by
Sir Francis Bacon.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> King is a mortall God on Earth, unto
whom the living God hath lent his
own name as a great honour: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
told him hee ſhould die like a man,
leſt he ſhould be proud and flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that God hath with his name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
unto him his nature alſo.</p>
            <p>2 Of all kinds of men, God is leaſt beholding unto
them, for he doth moſt for them, and they do ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leaſt for him.</p>
            <p>3 A King that would not feele his Crown too heavy
for him, muſt weare it every day, but if he think it too
light, he knoweth not of what mettall it is made of.</p>
            <p>4 He muſt make Religion the Rule of government,
and not the Scale; for he that caſteth in Religion onely
to make the ſcales even, his own weight is contained in
theſe Characters <hi>Tekel uphraſin,</hi> he is found too light, his
Kingdom ſhall be taken from him.</p>
            <p>5 And that King that holds not Religion the beſt
reaſon of ſtate, is void of all piety and juſtice, the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
of a King.</p>
            <p>6 He muſt be able to give Counſell himſelf, but not
to relye thereupon: for though happy events juſtifie
their Councels, yet it is better that the evill event of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51109:2"/>
good advice be rather imputed to a Subject then a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne.</p>
            <p>7 He is the Fountain of Honour, which ſhould not
run with a waſt pipe, leſt the Courtiers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell the waters,
and then (as Papiſts ſay of their holy Wels) to loſe the
vertue.</p>
            <p>8 He is the life of the Law, not onely as he is <hi>lex lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens</hi>
himſelf, but becauſe he animateth the dead letter,
making it active towards all his Subjects <hi>praemio &amp;
poena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9 A wiſe King muſt doe leſſe in altering his Laws,
then he may; for new government is ever dangerous, it
being true in the body politique, as in the corporall,
that <hi>omnis ſubita mutatio eſt periculoſa,</hi> and though it be
for the better, yet it is not without a fearfull apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
For he that changeth the fundamentall Laws of a
Kingdome, thinketh that there is no good title to a
Crown but by conqueſt.</p>
            <p>10 A King that ſetteth to ſale Seats of Juſtice, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
the People, for he teacheth his Judges to fell
Juſtice, and <hi>praecio parata, praecio vincitur Juſticia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bounty and Magnificence are vertues, <hi>verae Regiae,</hi>
but a prodigall King is neerer a Tyrant, then a parcimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious:
for ſtore at home draweth his contemplations
abroad, but want ſupplyeth it ſelf of what is next, and
many times the next way, and herein he muſt be wiſe
and know, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t he may juſtly doe.</p>
            <p>12 That King which is not feared, is not loved, and
he that is well ſeen in his craft, muſt as well ſtudy to be
feared as loved, yet not loved for feare, but feared for
love.</p>
            <p>13 Therefore as hee muſt alwayes reſemble him
whoſe great name he beareth, and that in manifeſting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51109:3"/>
the ſweet influence of his mercy over the ſevere ſtroke
of his Juſtice ſometimes, ſo in this not to ſuffer a man
of death to live, for beſides that the Land doth mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n,
the reſtraint of Juſtice towards ſin doth more retard
the affection of love, then the extent of mercy doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
it, and ſure where love is beſtowed, feare is quite
loſt.</p>
            <p>14 His greateſt Enemies are his Flatterers, for
though they ever ſpeak on his ſide, yet their words ſtill
make againſt them.</p>
            <p>15 The love which a King oweth to the weal-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
ſhould not be reſtrained to any one particular, yet
that his more ſpeciall favour do reflect upon ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ones, is ſomwhat neceſſary, becauſe there are ſo
few of that capacity.</p>
            <p>Hee muſt have a ſpeciall care of five things, if hee
would not have his Crown to be put upon him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that <hi>ſimulata ſanctitas,</hi> be not in the Church, for
that is <hi>duplex iniquitas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that <hi>inutilis aequitas,</hi> ſit not in the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
for that is <hi>inepta miſericordia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that <hi>utilis iniquitas,</hi> keep not the Exchequer,
for it is <hi>crudele latrocinium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, that <hi>fidelis temeritas</hi> be not his Generall, for
that will bring but <hi>ſeram poenitentiam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, that <hi>infidelis prudentia,</hi> be not his Secretary,
for that he is <hi>Anguis ſub viridi herba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, as he is of the greateſt power, ſo hee is
ſubject to the greateſt cares, made the ſervant of his
people, or elſe he were without a calling at all.</p>
            <p>He then that honoureth him not, is next an Atheiſt
wanting the feare of God in his heart.</p>

               <head>An explanation what manner of perſons thoſe ſhould be, that
are to execute the power or Ordinance of the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
written by the ſaid Sir Francis Bacon late Lord
Chancellour, and Lord St. Albans.</head>
               <p>THat abſolute Prerogative according to the Kings
pleaſure revealed by his Lawes, may be exerciſed
and executed by any Subject, to whom power may be
given by the King, in any place of Judgement or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,
which the King by his Law hath ordained, in
which the Judge ſubordinate cannot wrong the people,
the Law laying downe a meaſure by which every Judge
ſhould governe or execute; Againſt which Law if any
Judge proceed, he is by the Law queſtionable and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable
for his tranſgreſsion.</p>
               <p>In this nature are all the Judges and Commiſsioners
of the Land no otherwiſe then in their Courts, in which
the King in perſon is ſuppoſed to ſit who cannot worke
that treſpaſſe, Felony or treaſon which the Law hath
not made ſo to be, neither can puniſh the guilty by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
puniſhment then the Law hath appointed.</p>
               <p>This Prerogative or power as it is over all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſo being knowne by the Subjects, they are without
excuſe if they offend; and ſuffer no wrong, if they be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
And by this prerogative the King governeth all
ſorts of people according unto knowne will.</p>
               <p>The abſolute prerogative which is in Kings according
to their private will and judgement cannot be executed
by any Subject, neither is it poſſible to give ſuch power
by Commiſſion, or fit to ſubject the people to the ſame.
For the King in that he is the ſubſtitute of God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51109:4"/>
the Father of his people, and head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth by participation with God and his ſubjects,
Diſcretion, Iudgement, and feeling love towards thoſe
over whom he raigneth only proper to himſelfe, or to
his places and perſon, who ſeeing he cannot in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
diffuſe his wiſedome, power, or gifts, which God
in reſpect of his place and charge hath enabled him
withall, can neither ſubordinate any other Iudge to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
by that knowledge, which the King can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then by his knowne will participate unto him. And
if any ſubordinate Iudge ſhall obtaine Commiſsion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording,
of ſuch Iudge to govern the people, that Iudge is
bound to think that to be his ſound diſcretion, in which
the law in which the Kings known will ſheweth unto
him to be that Iuſtice which hee ought to adminiſter:
otherwiſe he might ſeeme to eſteeme himſelfe above
the Kings law, who will not governe by him, or to
have a power derived from other then from the King,
which in the Kingdome will adminiſter Iuſtice contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the juſtice of the Land. Neither can ſuch a Judge
or Commiſsioner under the name of his high Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſhrowde his owne high affection, ſeeing the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and diſcretion of every man is particular and
private to himſelfe; As the diſcretion of the Judge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be properly or poſsibly the diſcretion of the King,
or conſcience of the King; And if not his diſcretion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Judgement that is ruled by another m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns only.
Therefore it may ſeeme they rather deſire to bee Kings
then to rule the people under the King, which will not
adminiſter Juſtice by law, but by their owne wills.</p>
               <p>This Adminiſtration in a ſubject is derogative to the
Kings Prerogative, for he adminiſtreth Juſtice out of a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51109:4"/>
private direction, being not capable of a generall dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
how to uſe the Kings pleaſure in Cauſes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
reſpect, which if another then the King himſelfe
can doe, how can it be ſo, that any man ſhould deſire that
which is unfit and impoſsible, but that it muſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oceed
out of ſome exorbitant affection, the rather ſeeing ſuch
places to be full of trouble, and being altogether unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
no man will ſeeke to thruſt himſelfe into it, but
for hope of gaine. Then is not any prerogative oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
but maintained, though it be deſired that every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Magiſtrate may not be made ſupreame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he may ſeale up the hearts of the people, take from
the King the reſpect due unto him only, or to judge the
people otherwiſe then the King doth himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And although the Prince be not bound to render any
accompt to the Law, which in perſon adminiſtreth it
ſelfe. Yet every ſubordinate Judge muſt render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
to the King by his lawes how hee hath admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
Juſtice in his place where he is ſet. But if he hath
power to rule by private direction, for which there is no
law, how can he be queſtioned by a law, if in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
cenſure he offendeth.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſeemeth that in giving ſuch authority
the King ordaineth not ſubordinate Magiſtrates, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Kings; And what doth the King leave to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
who giveth ſo much to others as he hath himſelf?
neither is there a greater bond to tie the ſubject to his
Prince in particular then when he ſhal have recourſe unto
him in his perſon or in his power for releif of the wrongs
which from private men be offered, or for reformation
of the oppreſsions which any ſubordinate Magiſtrate
ſhall impoſe upon the people: there can be no offence in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51109:5"/>
the Judge, who hath power to execute according to his
diſcretion, when the diſcretion of any Judge ſhall be
thought fit to be unlimited; And therefore there can be
therein no reformation, whereby the King in this uſeth
no prerogative to gaine his Subjects right. Then the
ſubject is bound to ſuffer helpleſſe wrong, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
of the people is caſt upon the King, the lawes
being neglected, which with their equitie in all other

but it is ſafe and blameleſſe both for the Judge and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and honour to the King, that Judges bee appointed
who know the Law, and that they bee limited to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
