         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Or, a Brief
ACCOUNT
OF THE
Corrupt Practice of the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>GReat Complaints have been publickly made, ſetting
forth the wicked Practices of the Profeſſors of the
Law, and thoſe who have dependance upon the ſame,
by which I conceive, has been plainly made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the great Calamity of the People, and how
Thouſands of Families have conſequently been ruin'd thereby.
Yet notwithſtanding the Intereſt of thoſe profeſſing the Law,
hath been hitherto ſo great, no Care has been taken to redreſs
the ſame. But finding that few particular Inſtances in Relation
to Fact (which always makes a greater Impreſſion upon the
Minds of Men than a general Notion of things) have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of Matters of this Nature; therefore I conceive my ſelf
obliged by the Duty I owe to my Native Country, as well
as in order to my own Preſervation, to give a brief Account of
the evil Uſage my ſelf and ſome Friends have met withal from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105666:3"/>
Perſons Profeſſing the Law: By which, (if we Judge by the
Rule of Proportion) the Miſery of the People in General will
manifeſtly appear. And that according to the preſent practice
of the Law, no Man is ſafe, but liable to be Eaten up and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured.</p>
            <p>There's none concern'd in Merchandice, Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
muſt unavoidably have Diſputes, ſome of which will conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
beget Law-Suits, which often times are ſeen to prove
(as things are now managed) to be the Ruin both of the
Plaintif and Defendant, and many Suits appear to be kept on
Foot only to promote the Intereſt of Attorneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which
Evils come to paſs principally through the Remiſneſs, or
rather, groſs Corruption of the Judges, who are intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Executive part of the Law, and want not Power
to check and put a ſtop to all theſe Evil Practices; which
ſpin out as it were the very Bowels of the People. So that
we who have been for many Ages paſt, the happieſt People
in the World; and even the envy of other Nations, are now
become the Miſerableſt People in the Univerſe, only for want
of our Laws being duly Executed; yet leſt it ſhould be
ſaid I Caluminate Perſons, and am not able to prove Matter of
Fact, I ſhall give a ſhort Relation of ſeveral Matters, not
long ſince Tranſacted (ſome of them very lately) which I
conceive will fully Demonſtrate what I ſay, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 There was a certain Perſon came to my Houſe, to Lodge and
Diet, pretending to be a Lady, (was Recommended to me as
ſuch) and in ſome time, ſhe became Indebted to me, by
Moneys Lent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> about <hi>30l.</hi> for which ſhe gave me Bond;
then I diſcovered her to be a Cheat, upon which ſhe fled from
my Houſe, and it was ſome Years before I found her out; then
I Arreſted her, which begot a Law Suit, that coſt me near <hi>40l.</hi>
yet I am kept out of my Money to this day; and tho it was
then publickly known, this Woman was a profligate Wretch,
who had eſcap'd out of <hi>New Gate,</hi> and had ſeveral pretended
Husbands (ſome of which had been Executed at <hi>Tiburne,</hi> as
Fellons) yet in this very Suit, was admitted as a Pauper at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105666:3"/>
one and the ſame time, both in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and <hi>Chancery,</hi>
(tho my Debt as hath been ſaid was upon Bond,) ſhe produced
about 18 Witneſſes, not one of them appearing to be of any
Reputation: Nay, my own Attorney who knew what Wicked
People I had to deal withall, and to whom I gave ſtrict
orders to be careful of my Buſineſs, ſuffer'd me to be Non-ſuited
to my Coſt, <hi>6l. 6s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This pretended Lady, and her Gang, was not ſatisfied in
Engaging me in Two Suits of Law, for they and ſome Lawyers
did prompt and excite, a Young Man to Sue me, (whom I
had brought up from a Child, and put forth an Apprentice at
my own proper Coſt and Charge,) tho he had no Juſt Ground
ſo to do, being prompt thereunto by this Gang, and ſome
Lawyers, (as he has ſince with ſorrow confeſt to me) upon
which I had him before a Judge, but could have no relief;
but in a little time, the Young Man was ſenſible of his
folly, and of his own accord, came to me and beg'd Pardon
for what he had done; ſo we went to the Attorney and
order'd him to ſtop Proceedings. Yet now my Attorney
brings me in a Bill upon this account, tho there was no
Proceedings thereupon; but his wickedneſs to me will farther
appear; which at preſent I ſhall wave, and go upon other
Matter.</p>
            <p>3. I was Truſtee for Two Young Men for ſeveral Years,
and the Account between them and me, was Stated by Two
Attorneys, who Audited the ſame, and ſet their hands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
yet ſome Years after theſe unhappy Young Men, met
with ſome Lawyers that put them upon Suing of me, tho
there was not the leaſt Ground for it, as in the end it did
appear, to the High Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> the Matter having
been Twice referred, by Order of Court, to a Maſter in
<hi>Chancery,</hi> who Audited the Account, in the preſence of Two
Counſellors at Law; this Unjuſt Suit was near <hi>200l.</hi> Charge
to the Young Men, to the utter Ruin of one of them; who
lays his Ruin, and I think Juſtly, at the Lawyers Door, as the
Cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105666:4"/>
4. I took out a Writ againſt a certain Perſon; upon which
a Bayliff took him, and took Bail of him in his own Name;
then came to me, and ſwore deſperately, if I would not
give him <hi>40 s.</hi> he would let his Priſoner go. I not comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his unreaſonable Demands, he arreſted me; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I ſummon'd him before a Judge, who did acknowledge,
and ſay I was much abuſed, yet would do me no Juſtice, but
ſeem'd rather to encourage the Bayliff, thereby to bring (as
I ſuppoſe) more Griſt to the Mill; ſo I was glad at laſt to
give the Bayliff <hi>4 l.</hi> to be rid of him, and ſecure my Debt.</p>
            <p>5. The Attorney, whom I before did make mention of, I
did employ in ſeveral Buſineſſes; for doing which, he ſent me
in a Bill of <hi>13 l.</hi> odd Money, and in ſome Months after ſent
another Bill of <hi>17 l.</hi> (both referring to one and the ſame
Buſineſs) and then ſent me ſeveral threatning Letters, that
if I did not forthwith pay him, he would arreſt me; upon
which I ſummon'd him before a Judge, before whom he
appear'd, and whiſper'd to him, and then gave into his
Hand another Bill of 25 <hi>l.</hi> which I never ſaw otherways
than in the Judges Hand; whereupon I acquainted his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that I had two Bills before given me, either of which
I was willing to have tax'd; but it would not be granted,
tho I offer'd to prove that I had paid him 7 <hi>l 10 s.</hi> and that
he charged me with near Five Pound for Counſel Fees, which
he never disburſed, and that he had a Bill of 10 <hi>l.</hi> of mine
in his Hands, and that he charg'd me 20 <hi>s.</hi> for viewing
ſome Writings in my Hands, when I never employ'd him,
he having been employ'd by another Perſon, who gave him
20 <hi>s.</hi> for his Pains; (nay, he had the Confidence to tell his
Lordſhip, that he examin'd two Cart-loads of Papers by my
Order, when as all of them were in a ſmall Deale-Box.)
The Judge was very attentive to him, but would not hear
me, tho I offer'd to ſwear it (as I have ſince done before
another Judge) and ſo ſign'd and order'd the 25 <hi>l.</hi> Bill to be
tax'd, and that I ſhould pay in to one of the Prothonitors of
the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> 25 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, which I though to be a great
Hardſhip put upon me when I was not in his Debt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105666:4"/>
I waited upon the Judge again, and took a Friend along
with me, who endeavour'd to Convince his Lordſhip, but
all to no purpoſe, tho I offer'd to depoſite the Money in a
third Perſons Hand, yet he would not recin'd from what he
had done, but 25 <hi>l.</hi> I muſt pay in; upon which my Friend
went to my Attorney, and asked him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why he was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have either of his former Bills tax'd; He deny'd that
ever he gave me any Bills before, when as I have his Bills and
Letters by me to prove it; but he ſhew'd my Friend the
Bill ſign'd by the Judge, and ſaid, if I would not have that
tax'd, he would Arreſt me before Night. This was about a
Month ſince, but he has not done it yet; ſo the Matter's
ſtill depending.</p>
            <p>6. A Relation of mine ſued a certain Perſon for 50 <hi>l.</hi> he
was indebted to him; in proſecuting of which Suit he ſpent
above 200 <hi>l.</hi> before he could recover his Debt; and in this
Cauſe, between Plantiff and Defendant, there was ſpent
above 500 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. A certain Perſon came to a Shop-keeper (a Man of
known Reputation) and deſir'd him to give him Silver for
a Broad piece of Gold; according to his Requeſt he gave him
the Money, but this Perſon, by a Trick of Ledgerdemain gave
him a Broad Guilt Shilling, inſtead of a piece of Gold. The
ſame Day it was done, he found he was cheated, and ſo made
Search after the Perſon that did it; who finding himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
and that he was like to fall into Trouble, was too
quick for the Shop-keeper; for he takes out a Warrant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and had him before a Juſtice of the Peace, for
Scandalizing of him; upon which, the Shop-keeper, and his
Wife, acquainted the Juſtice of the Peace with the whole
Circumſtance of the Matter, and offer'd to ſwear it, yet the
Juſtice of the Peace would not admit him to his Oath, but
bound him over to the next Seſſion of the Peace for Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing
the worthy Gentleman; but afterwards (not without
great Trouble) he took him up with a <hi>Bench Warrant,</hi> and
the Matter was tried at <hi>Hicks'</hi>s <hi>Hall,</hi> where that and other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105666:5"/>
Crimes of the like nature were fully prov'd upon him, (tho he
produced near 20 Witneſſes ſuch as they were) for which he
was by the Court Fin'd <hi>40 l.</hi> but it was reduced to <hi>20 l.</hi> which
he immediately paid and went off, and the honeſt Shop-Keeper
in proſecuting this Matter was at above <hi>12l.</hi> Charge, and like
to have no Satisfaction; for if he could meet with this Wicked
Perſon, he ſays he dares not Sue him, ſeeing there is ſo great
Corruption in the Practice of the Law.</p>
            <p>8. A Gentleman was unjuſtly Sued for <hi>100l.</hi> yet in Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf, in that Suit he ſpent above 120. tho he did not
pay the Debt, he had paid the better part of the Money to his
Attorney who Arreſted him before he gave him a Bill, after
which the Attorney gave him a Bill; and he Objecting againſt
ſome things in it; in a little time his Attorney gave him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and made his Account above <hi>10l.</hi> more, and then Laught
at him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon which he was adviſed by ſome Friends to get the
Bill Taxt, but others telling him how <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> things were,
adviſed him rather to pay the Attorney, then Involve himſelf
in farther trouble, which he accordingly did.</p>
            <p>9. In the Year 1692 a <hi>French</hi> Ship and Cargo, called the St <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
of <hi>Haverdegrace,</hi> of the value of near <hi>3000l.</hi> in the open
Seas was Seized by Three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sailors on Board, (who had
been Captivated into <hi>France)</hi> and Carried into <hi>Tenby,</hi> Dependant
upon the Port of <hi>Milford;</hi> upon which <hi>Walter Midleton,</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
of the ſaid Port, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Unladed the Veſſel by Night, and
Embezeled the Cargo, and withall Committed the Three <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Sailors to the Common Goal, at the ſame time Diſmiſſing
the <hi>French,</hi> who had been brought in as Priſoners. Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof being given to the Admiralty-Court, Commiſſions
of Enquiry were thence Iſſued, and upon Examination the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezelments
fully prov'd, and Sentence paſſed on behalf of the
King; whereupon the Offenders moved for, and obtained a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
out of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to ſtop all further Proceedings,
which is continued to this day; ſo the Spoil ſeems to have been
divided among them, The poor Sailors were continued many
Months in Priſon, and did not obtain their Liberty without great

treated as the poor Saylors, although their Lordſhips often
gave him aſſurance, <hi>That if he prov'd the Facts, he ſhould not

on, and fed with vain Hopes from time to time, to the utter
Ruin of him and his Family) and expended a conſiderable Sum
of Money, yet has not been able to obtain any Satisfaction,
otherwiſe than that about <hi>Three Months</hi> ſince the <hi>Lords of
the Admiralty</hi> ſent for him, and told him at a full Board, <hi>If he
would not concern himſelf any more in this Matter, but retire
into his own Country, they would order him 10 l.</hi> which he was
conſtrain'd, thro his great Neceſſity, to take.</p>

            <p>Theſe three Caſes, which I have laſt Recited, may ſeem to be

for the future; for having made ſo great and notorious a Breach
of the Oath they took, when they were admitted to practice as
Attorneys, they at the ſame time being Inveſted with a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

to no more than as if I ſhould take up a Perſon, who
had cheated me, and have him before a Juſtice of the Peace, who
ſhould oblige him to reſtore to me what he wrong'd me of;
and afterwards diſmiſs him, and give him leave to cheat any
Body elſe whom he pleas'd: For ſo it is, that when Men are not
puniſh'd for their Offences, it does but encourage them and others
to Commit the like Crimes for the future, and to be more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than they were before; which plainly demonſtrates any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

many Thouſands of Perſons may reaſonably be ſuppos'd to be
engaged in Suits at Law, that underſtand nothing of the Law,
but refer all to their Attorneys, and if they find they are ill
treated by them, and a Diſpute happens to ariſe between them,
they are not able to contend with them, but for the moſt part
lie at their Mercy to do by them even as they pleaſe; yet if any
are ſo hardy as to contend with their Attorneys, ſo as to have
their Bills Tax'd, generally ſpeaking, they can have little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
