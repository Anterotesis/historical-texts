            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <stage>Spoken by Mr. <hi>Haines</hi> in a Red Coat like a Common Souldier.</stage>
            <l>SInce there's a Dearth of Witt, and that to Play,</l>
            <l>Is hardly worth one poor Brown George a Day;</l>
            <l>I from the Poet, and our Friends within,</l>
            <l>Am sent t'intreat, and your last Favours win,</l>
            <l>E're we go hence and shall no more be seen.</l>
            <l>For my part,—</l>
            <l>I'le to the <hi>French</hi> Campaigne, where one may get</l>
            <l>A certain Wholsome though a Homely Treat;</l>
            <l>Good Oyl and Cooling Sallads, though no meat:</l>
            <l>Good Campany, good honest Lowste Currs.</l>
            <l>There's Honour to be got too—Honour, Sirs;</l>
            <l>Honour that makes the General's Voice sound loud,</l>
            <l>And serves instead of Brandy to the Crowd.</l>
            <l>My Spirits are reviv'd; Methinks I hear</l>
            <l>A Crew of Fire-fac'd Rogues embattled there,</l>
            <l>Whose Motly Noses carry Hope and Fear:</l>
            <l>Cry out, Fall on, we shall be Kings, Great Men,</l>
            <l>Nay Emperours, the Devil knowes how, and when.</l>
            <l>Then Shouting all, advance they to the Siege,</l>
            <l>And to the Plunder fall with Priviledge.</l>
            <l>Pray tell me then, is it not better farr,</l>
            <l>To live abroad when other Nations Iarr,</l>
            <l>Then 'mongst our selves to make a Civil Warr?</l>
            <l>Are not these Bandaliers, this Sword, this Coat,</l>
            <l>Better than Tipstaves, or a Baily's Note?</l>
            <l>To day we Play Great Kings, strutt, bounce and fly,</l>
            <l>But e're next Morn the Shop's shut up—God buy.</l>
            <l>This by your great Unkindness is our Lott,</l>
            <l>We share and share, 'tis true—but nothing's got.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:48958:3"/>Like lab'ring Bees we toyle for Witt, though poor,</l>
            <l>Which you like Drones suck up, and hum for more,</l>
            <l>But bring in nothing to the Winter-Store.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Witt</hi> is forgot; for with you Men of Miss,</l>
            <l>Sence is unnatural as Marriage is—</l>
            <l>Knowledge of this has made me what you see,</l>
            <l>And if your tempers change not instantly,</l>
            <l>Comedian <hi>Haines</hi> a man of Sword shall be.</l>
            <l>'Tis true, my Loyalty is not preserv'd,</l>
            <l>But that in many has for Profit swerv'd;</l>
            <l>Besides, 'tis better to be hang'd than starv'd.</l>

                  <p>Nay, let thee alone to bring it off, be it what it will; But come, if thou wilt go in with me, I'll give thee thy Welcome to Town.</p>

                  <p>No, I have business elsewhere; Nor must this angry Beauty sleep in her displeasure—but first to my Father—and whatever you hear of my Actions, Gentlemen, Not a word of my Humour; for though to you I appear a Mad, Wild, <hi>Monsieur</hi>; To him I must be <hi>Ananias</hi>—Walk thus—Look thus—Spit thus—I have a Plot in't, and you'l find it your diversion, if you think it worth your patience; for the present, Adieu.</p>

                  <p>Sirrah you Rogue—look for't, for I will make thee ten times more miserable than thou thought'st thy self before thy Travel; Thou hast told my Father, I know it, and I find it, all my Rogueries by meer way of prevention, to undo me.</p>

                  <p>The Devil's in him—this is another Whim now, but I'll be gone, for I'm sure the Old Man's Fingers itch at me, and I think, 'tis not fit that Learning shou'd be beaten.

Well, I'll go seek an Heir—I am resolv'd on't, for my Inheritance must not turn Secretary; my Name and Quality has kept my Land three hundred years in Madness—and if it slip now, may it sink for ever—But first, I'll find out this lying Rogue, this Dog, this <hi>Launce,</hi> that took my money, and then fool'd me—I'll find him, and I'll cudgel him to Mummy.

No singing, nor no dancing, nor no drinking?—thou think'st not of these scandals—thou can'st snore, and sleep, and Chatter bawdy in thy Dreams,—and the next morning wake and go to breakfast, and nothing else—but his life shou'd be otherwise.</p>

gratitude I owe ye—for my Daughters kind Entertainment:—I fear I have too much trespass'd upon your patience.</p>

                     <p>Sir I thank ye, and 'twas a business of Moment that brought me hither; for yesterday in the afternoon I had a Letter from Sir <hi>Wilding Frollick</hi>—proposing a Marriage between his Son and my Daughter.</p>

                     <p>The same—I am so vext I forgot to bring it with me, 'twou'd have made you laugh heartily—for in my life I never saw so extravagant a style;—now Cousin my business in Town is, to put a stop to this Match, for I hear he comes often to her, and against her Will too,—does he so Cousin?</p>

                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>Sometimes Sir—by way of visit, or so—but not against her consent, that ever I heard of, and you know Sir, 'twou'd not be civil in me to deny her visitants.</p>

                     <speaker>Sir Per.</speaker>
                     <p>Cousin, you say well—but we Fathers perhaps have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eyes to pry into these matters—then your Youngsters have; she's a good Girl Sir, and I think a Fathers Indulgence shou'd be carefully imploy'd in bestowing a good Girl upon a good Man.</p>

                     <p>Why very well—then to be plain, his fame is none of the cleerest—for in troth we hear in the Country, he is ten times more mad, and debauch'd since he came from <hi>Paris,</hi> then he was before—they say, he never says his Prayers.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48958:28"/>
in his consideration, when it tends to the disposal of his Children; —but come, pray let me see her.</p>

                     <p>You, I say, having read <hi>Aristotle</hi>—and knowing Mice to be very destructive to the Common-Wealth, cannot but consider what your Master may suffer; for there is as much difference in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rukes, as in Bucklers, and the Cardinal <hi>Bobinello</hi> loosing one of his Teeth with a Skirmish 'twixt him, and the Pigmies—Your Master's

And tho' this kind of life is least troublesome; t'other is certainly most safe: especially, if a Man can change his Temper, else 'tis a Plague to him. For Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to a Debauchee, is a second Purgatory; It gives him onely a Prospect of Joy, or Torment, without knowing which he shall arrive to. But I hope I know my self better, than to venture without great Consideration to such Uncertainties.</p>

            <l>THat I have been a Mad Old Fool to Night,</l>
            <l>I need not tell you; but to set all right,</l>
            <l>The Poet now makes me a Parasite.</l>
            <l>Sends me to flatter ye, and beg Excuse,</l>
            <l>For the Insipid Errors of his Muse:</l>
            <l>He bids me say, the less to show his Guilt,</l>
            <l>On the Foundation <hi>Fletcher</hi> laid, he built;</l>
            <l>New drest his Modish Spark fit to be shown,</l>
            <l>And made him more Debauch'd, t' oblige the Town.</l>
            <l>Drink, Rant and Sing, he now takes pains to be</l>
            <l>A perf<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t and accomplish'd Debauchee.</l>
            <l>But Criticks, you that never yet were known</l>
            <l>To think there could be Sence above your own;</l>
            <l>You that do surfet on the Spoyles of Witt,</l>
            <l>And still have less to shew, the more you get.</l>
            <l>Like barren Ground that swallowes up the Rain,</l>
            <l>Yet is by th' Industrious Hand Manur'd in vain,</l>
            <l>Will in your Censures your Ill Natures show,</l>
            <l>And with your Weeds choak up the Grain we sowe.</l>
            <l>I know you'l cry, Confound this tedious Stuff,</l>
            <l>He has not made the Spark half mad enough;</l>
            <l>He should have been all Air, and th' Mode pursue,</l>
            <l>That is, keep Miss, kick Wise, and Run Men through:</l>
            <l>Ashore you give good proofs of this each day;</l>
            <l>Pray Heav'n you hold and prove as mad at Sea.</l>
            <l>But that I think there's none can doubt or fear;</l>
            <l>No,—Witt's a greater Plague to you than Warr.</l>
            <l>Witt that is now us'd like a Common slave,</l>
            <l>Both by those have none, as well as those that have.</l>
            <l>Therefore against such to procure defence,</l>
            <l>Not doubting th' Aid of all the Men of Sence,</l>
            <l>The Poet now the Ladies help do's Crave,</l>
            <l>That with a frown or smile can damn or save.</l>
            <l>And as the Mighty God of Witt shines clear,</l>
            <l>And shines upon his Fav'rites once a Year;</l>
            <l>From them that Sacred Influence let him find,</l>
            <l>That he may say he Once found Beauty kind.</l>
