            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>MATTH. V.48.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which our Saviour draws from thoſe Precepts which he had given his Diſciples of <hi>greater perfection,</hi> than any Laws that were extant in the world before. <hi>V.</hi> 44. <hi>I ſay unto you, love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for thoſe that deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> And to perſwade them hereto, he propounds to them the Pattern of the <hi>Divine Perfection</hi>; telling them, that being thus affected towards their Enemies, they ſhould reſemble God, <hi>v.</hi> 45.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35252:9"/>
               <hi>That ye may be the Children of your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father; for he maketh the Sun to riſe on the evil, and on the good, and ſendeth Rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then he tells us, that if we be not thus affected towards our Enemies, and thoſe that have been injurious to us, we are ſo far from being like God, that we are but juſt level with the worſt of Men, <hi>v.</hi> 46, 47. <hi>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even the Publicans the ſame? And if ye ſalute your Brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the Publicans ſo?</hi> And then concludes, that if we would attain that <hi>perfection</hi> which the Chriſtian Religion deſigns to advance Men to, we muſt endeavour to be like God in theſe <hi>perfections</hi> of Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Patience; <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> In which words we have,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The abſolute <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature ſuppoſed; <hi>as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is propounded as a Pattern to our imitation. <hi>Be ye therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In handling of theſe words, I ſhall do theſe <hi>four</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35252:9"/>I. Conſider how we are to conceive of the <hi>Divine Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall lay down ſome Rules whereby we may govern and rectifie our Opinions concerning the Attributes and <hi>Perfections</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. How far we are to imitate the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and particularly what thoſe Divine Qualities are, which our Saviour doth here more eſpecially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our imitation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I ſhall endeavour to clear the true meaning of this Precept, and to ſhew that the Duty here intended by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is not impoſſible to us; and then conclude this Diſcourſe with ſome uſeful Inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider how we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the <hi>Divine Perfections.</hi> Theſe two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By aſcribing all imaginable and poſſible <hi>Perfection</hi> to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By ſeparating and removing all manner of <hi>Imperfection</hi> from him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By aſcribing all imaginable, and poſſible <hi>Perfection</hi> to God; abſolute and univerſal <hi>Perfection,</hi> not limited to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind, or to certain particulars; but whatever we can conceive, and imagin to be a <hi>Perfection,</hi> is to be aſcribed to him;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35252:10"/>
yea and beyond this, whatever poſſible <hi>Perfection</hi> there is, or poſſible degree of any <hi>Perfection,</hi> which our ſhort Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings cannot conceive or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, is to be aſcribed to him. For we are not to confine the <hi>Perfection</hi> of God to our imagination, as <hi>if we could find out the Almighty to Perfection</hi>: But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to believe the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature to be boundleſs and unlimited, and infinitely to exceed our higheſt thoughts and apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>More particularly, all kinds and all degrees of <hi>Perfection</hi> are to be aſcribed to God, which either do not imply a plain Contradiction, or do not argue ſome <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,</hi> or are not evidently incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſome other and greater <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some things may ſeem to be <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which in truth are not; becauſe they are plainly impoſſible, and involve a Contradiction; as that what has once been, ſhould by any Power be made not to have been; or that a thing, which by its Nature is limited and confin'd to one place, ſhould at the ſame time be in another. Theſe things in Reaſon are impoſſible, and therefore not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to fall under any Power how unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35252:10"/>
ſoever. For if we once aſcribe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions to God, we deſtroy his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe then to be, and not to be, Power, and no Power would be all one.</p>
            <p>And then there are ſome <hi>Perfections,</hi> which do argue and ſuppoſe Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in them; as Motion, the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſwiftneſs thereof in Creatures is a <hi>Perfection,</hi> but then it ſuppoſeth a finite and limited Nature: For a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and immenſe Being, that is every where preſent at once, hath no need to move from one place to another; and therefore though Motion be a <hi>Perfection</hi> in Creatures, there is no Reaſon to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it to God, becauſe it ſuppoſeth a greater <hi>Imperfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are alſo ſome imaginable degrees of <hi>Perfection,</hi> which becauſe they are inconſiſtent with other <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> are not to be admitted in the Divine Nature. For inſtance, ſuch degrees of Goodneſs and Mercy may be imagined, as would quite exclude and ſhut out Juſtice; and on the other hand ſuch a ſtrictneſs and a rigour of Juſtice, as would leave no room at all for Patience and Mercy; and therefore ſuch degrees are not really to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Perfections.</hi> For this is a certain truth, that nothing is a Divine <hi>Perfection,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35252:11"/>
which evidently claſheth with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary and eſſential <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature. We muſt ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, that they may accord and conſiſt together; and therefore it cannot be a <hi>Perfection</hi> of God to be ſo good and gracious, as to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Sin, and to overthrow the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his own Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Tis not Goodneſs, but Eaſineſs and Weakneſs, to be contented to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually injur'd and affronted. 'Tis not Patience, to be willing to be everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trampled upon. So likewiſe on the other hand, 'tis not a <hi>Perfection</hi> to be ſo ſevere and rigorous, as to ſmite a Sinner in the inſtant that he offends, not to be able to refrain from Puniſhment, and to give time for Repentance.</p>
            <p>But whatever <hi>Perfection</hi> is conceivable or poſſible, and argues no <hi>Imperfection,</hi> nor is repugnant to any other neceſſary <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> is to be aſcribed to God; for this is the moſt natural and eaſie conception that we can have of God, that he is the moſt <hi>perfect</hi> Being. This natural Light doth firſt ſuggeſt and offer to the Minds of Men, and we cannot conceive of God as meer Power and Will without Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs. Hence it is that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35252:11"/>
               <hi>Greeks</hi> call God very often, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the beſt of Beings, and the Latin <hi>Optimus, Maximus, the beſt and the Greateſt, beatiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma &amp; perfectiſſima natura, conſtans &amp; perfecta Ratio, the happieſt and moſt perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, immutible and abſolute Reaſon</hi>; and many other ſuch expreſſions which we meet with in the Writings of the Heathen Philoſophers. I readily grant, that the firſt and moſt obvious thought which men have of God, is that of his Greatneſs and Majeſty; but this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily involves or infers his Goodneſs; as <hi>Seneca</hi> excellently reaſons, <hi>Primus Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cultus eſt Deos credere, dein reddere illis majeſtatem ſuam, reddere bonitatem, ſine quâ nulla Majeſtas,</hi>
               <q>The firſt Worſhip of the Gods is to believe their Being; next to aſcribe to them Greatneſs and Majeſty, to aſcribe to them Goodneſs, without which there can be no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And we ſhall find all along in <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tully,</hi> and the beſt and wiſeſt Writers among the Heathen, that they every where attribute the higheſt Excellencies and <hi>Perfections</hi> to the Divine Nature, and do ſteer and govern all their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of God by this Principle, that <hi>Perfection</hi> is to be aſcrbied to him: And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35252:12"/>
whenever any thing is ſaid of God, they examin whether it be a <hi>Perfection</hi> or not; if it be, they give it him as his due; if it be not, they lay it aſide, as a thing not fit to be ſpoken of him.</p>
            <p>And in the Scripture we do every where find <hi>Perfection</hi> aſcribed to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Works, and Laws of God, to every thing that belongs to him, or proceeds from him: <hi>Job</hi> 37.16. <hi>Doſt thou know the wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge?</hi> And again, <hi>Canſt thou by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing find out God? Can'ſt thou find out the Almighty to perfection? Pſ.</hi> 18.30 <hi>As for God his way is perfect</hi> Pſ. 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not need to conſider particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſeveral <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine Nature, I ſhall only give you a brief Scheme and Draught of them. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Perfection</hi> can be imagined either in the manner of Being or Acting is to be aſcribed to God; therefore as to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we ſay that he is a Spirit, that is, that he is not meer Body or Matter, becauſe that would exclude ſeveral other <hi>Perfections</hi>; for meer Matter is incapable both of Knowledge and Liberty, being determined by neceſſary Laws of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet without Knowledge and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35252:12"/>
Liberty, there can be no Wiſdom nor Goodneſs. We ſay of God, that he is of himſelf, and without Cauſe, and does not owe his Being to any other; and conſequently that he is neceſſarily, and that he cannot but <hi>be,</hi> and cannot be otherwiſe than he is; for that which is of its ſelf did not chuſe whether it would be or not, nor whether it would be thus or otherwiſe; for to ſuppoſe any thing to deliberate or conſult about it's own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is to ſuppoſe it to be before it is.</p>
            <p>We muſt ſay of God likewiſe that he is immenſe, and every where preſent, becauſe to be limited is an <hi>Imperfection</hi>; and that he is eternal, that is, ever was, and ſhall be; for to ceaſe to be, is a greater <hi>Imperfection</hi> than ſometime not to have been.</p>
            <p>And then we are to ſay of God, that he is the Cauſe of all other Beings, that they are made by him and depend upon him; that he knows all things, and can do all things in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner, by a glance of his Mind, and by the meer beck and nod of his Will, without long ſtudy or deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without laborious pains and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and conſequently that nothing is exempted from his Knowledge, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35252:13"/>
Power, and Providence, and that he adminiſters all things in a way of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wiſdom, of Juſtice and Truth; and therefore all things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to him, as their laſt end. All theſe <hi>Perfections,</hi> and all other that are poſſible, we are to look upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature as fully and immutably poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of, and that in an higher and more excellent degree, than our finite Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are able to conceive or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we are to aſcribe all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, poſſible <hi>Perfections</hi> to God, ſo we are to ſeparate and remove all manner of <hi>Imperfection</hi> from him. We muſt not obſcure or blemiſh the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the leaſt ſhadow or blot of <hi>Imperfection.</hi> If we once admit of this, to aſcribe any thing to God which argues <hi>Imperfection,</hi> we ſtrike at the foundation, and deſtroy one of the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and moſt eſſential Notions, which Men have of God. And therefore we find the Scripture very careful to remove all kind of natural or moral <hi>Imperfection</hi> from God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. <hi>That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to ſlay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35252:13"/>
that be far from thee; ſhall not the Judge of all the world do right?</hi> Deut. 32.4. <hi>A God of truth and without iniquity.</hi> Rom. 9.14. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid,</hi> far be it from him.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that in Scripture Holineſs is ſo frequently aſcrib'd to God, which ſignifies the purity and freedom of the Divine Nature from that which we call Sin; and God is very ſolicitous to give us ſuch a notion of himſelf, as may remove Sin and unrighteouſneſs at the greateſt diſtance from him, becauſe that is the greateſt of <hi>Imperfections.</hi> Is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to countenance Sin? the Scripture acquits God of it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Thou art not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with Thee.</hi> Is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to go from ones word, or to change ones mind? this likewiſe is remov'd from God. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael will not lie or repent, he is not a man, that he ſhould repent.</hi> Is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to want any thing, to be liable to any thing, to depend upon any thing without one's ſelf for their happineſs? this alſo is to be ſet far from him. <hi>Job</hi> 22.2, 3. <hi>Can a man be profitable to God? or is it a gain
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35252:14"/>
to him, that thou makeſt thy way perfect? Job</hi> 35.6, 7. <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doſt thou againſt him? or if thy tranſgreſſions be multiplied, what doſt thou unto him? If thou art righteous, what giveſt thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wickedneſs may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteouſneſs may profit the Son of man.</hi> Is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to tempt, or to be tempted to Sin? this is to be ſeparated from God, <hi>He cannot be tempted of evil, neither tempteth he any man,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James. Chap.</hi> 1.17. And to mention no more, is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to be in any reſpect mutable? This is denyed of God, <hi>with him there is no variableneſs, or ſhadow of turning.</hi> Thus you ſee how we are to conceive of the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, by aſcribing all imaginable and poſſible <hi>Perfection</hi> to him, and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſhadow of <hi>Imperfection</hi> from him. I proceed in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Place, to lay down ſome Rules by which we may rectifie and govern our Opinions concerning the Attributes and <hi>Perfections</hi> of God: The beſt I can think of, are theſe following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us begin with the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and plain, and eaſie <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and lay them for a foundation,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35252:14"/>
and rectifie all our other Apprehenſions of God, and Reaſonings about him, by theſe; and theſe are his Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Goodneſs, to which moſt of the reſt may be reduced. Right Apprehenſions and a firm Belief of theſe will make it eaſily credible to us, that all things were made and are governed, by him; for his Goodneſs will diſpoſe and incline him to communicate Being to other things, and to take care of them when they are made. An infinite Power and Wiſdom render him able to do all this without any labour or difficulty, and without any diſturbance of his eaſe or happineſs, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> would ſeem vainly to fear; who in truth did not believe a God, but pretended only to deny his Providence, and that he either made or govern'd the world; becauſe he was loth to lay ſo much trouble upon him. Vain man! as if thoſe things which are impoſſible and difficult to our Weakneſs and Folly, might not be infinitely eaſie to infinite Power and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Particularly the Goodneſs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God are not ſo difficult to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, as the Diſputes and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about them have rendred them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35252:15"/>
to many. When we conſider infinite Knowledge and Power, we may eaſily loſe our ſelves, and go out of our depth, by wading too far into them: There is ſomething concerning theſe, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable, and unaccountable to our Reaſon; we may not be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how Something may be produc'd from Nothing; becauſe it argues ſuch an exceſs of Power, as we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; but yet we are forc'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that either the World muſt be produc'd from Nothing, or that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was eternally of it ſelf, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very whit as hard to imagine, as that infinite Power ſhould be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it from nothing. So likewiſe we are not able to conceive, how God can certainly know future Events, which depend upon voluntary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Cauſes, becauſe we cannot comprehend infinite Knowledge; but this we may eaſily be ſatisfied in, that infinite Power and Knowledge may be able to do, and know many things, which we cannot conceive how they can be known or done, no more than a Child can imagine how a great Mathematician can demonſtrate his Propoſitions. Only this we are ſure

of, as we can be of any thing, that no Power can do that which is evidently impoſſible, and implies a plain Contradiction.</p>
            <p>We are not able perhaps to reconcile the particular Providences of God with his univerſal Goodneſs, Juſtice, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, becauſe we cannot ſee to the end of his Ways and Works at one view, and ſee every part with relation to the whole; which would appear very wiſe, if we knew the whole ſeries of things, and ſaw the entire deſign together, as God himſelf does, to whom (as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us) <hi>all his ways are known from the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that however we may be at a loſs in our Conceptions of God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Knowledge and Power, yet Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Juſtice, and Truth, are Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons eaſie and familiar; and if we could not underſtand theſe, the whole Bible would be inſignificant to us. For all Revelation from God ſuppoſeth us to know what is meant by Goodneſs, Juſtice, and Truth: And therefore no man can entertain any Notion of God, which plainly contradicts theſe. And it is fooliſh for any man to pretend, that he cannot know what Goodneſs, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35252:16"/>
Juſtice, and Truth in God are: for if we do not know this, 'tis all one to us, whether God be good or not, nor could we imitate his Goodneſs; for he that imitates, endeavours to make himſelf like ſomething that he knows, and muſt of neceſſity have ſome Idea of that to which he aims to be like: So that if we had no certain and ſetled Notion of the Goodneſs, and Juſtice, and Truth of God, he would be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether an unintelligible Being; and Religion, which conſiſts in the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, would be utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Now theſe being the moſt eaſie, and intelligible <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, by which he is ſaid in Scripture to declare his Name, that is, to make himſelf known to us, we ſhould govern all our Reaſonings about God (as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Decrees, and his concurrence with the Free Actions of Men, and his particular Providence, which are things more dark and obſcure) by what is more clear; and we ſhall find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that in all theſe points holy Men do conſtantly appeal to theſe unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable and intelligible <hi>Perfections</hi> of God. <hi>Wilt thou deſtroy the righteous
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35252:16"/>
with the wicked?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham) That be far from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the world do right</hi>? We may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; but God certainly knows who are wicked, and who are righteous; and he knows how to puniſh the wicked, and ſave the righteous: But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be miſtaken in this Principle, <hi>that the Judge of all the world will do right.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſatisfies himſelf, and others concerning the particular Providences of God towards the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Deut. 32.3, 4. <hi>I will publiſh the name of the Lord: All his ways are judgement; a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is He.</hi> This we certainly know of God. So St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Thou art inexcuſable, O Man!</hi> Whatſoever Excuſe men may pretend for their faults, he lays down this for a Principle, <hi>We are ſure the Judgment of God is according to truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us always conſider the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> of God in conjunction, and ſo as to reconcile them with one another. Do not conſider God as meer Power and Soveraignty, as meer Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as meer Juſtice and Severity; but as all theſe together, and in ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree as may make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35252:17"/>
with one another. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſtakes in Religion are certainly ſprung from this root, from ſeparating the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and conſidering them ſingly, and framing ſuch wide and large notions of one, as to exclude ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whereas the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God agree together, and that is not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Perfection,</hi> which contradicts any other <hi>Perfection.</hi> Among men indeed an eminent degree of any one Excellency does uſually ſhut out ſome other; and therefore it is obſerv'd, that Power and Moderation, Love and Diſcretion, do not often meet together; that a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and a ſmall Judgment, a good Wit and an ill Nature, are many times found in conjunction: But in infinite <hi>Perfection</hi> all <hi>Perfections</hi> do eminently meet and conſiſt together; and it is not neceſſary that one Excellency ſhould be raiſed upon the ruines of another.</p>
            <p>And if this had been well conſider'd, Men would not, by being too intent upon God's Soveraignty, with neglect of his other <hi>Perfections,</hi> have ſpoken thoſe hard things about Predeſtination: for the Soveraignty of God doth by no means ſet him above the Eternal Laws of Goodneſs, and Truth, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35252:17"/>
And if this were conſidered, men would not, by poring upon the Juſtice and Severity of God, be ſo ſwallowed up in deſpair: for God is not ſo ſevere, but he is merciful to the penitent, and hath left a retreat for the returning Sinner. If this were well conſider'd, it would check the preſumption of thoſe, who incourage themſelves in ſin, by fancying to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a God all of Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and <hi>becauſe ſentence againſt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil work is not ſpeedily executed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their heart is fully ſet in them to do evil:</hi> For it is not Goodneſs and Mercy finally to bear with and forgive obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Offenders; but want of Prudence and good Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Among different Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God (as there always have been, and will be in the world) chuſe thoſe which are fartheſt from extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; becauſe Truth as well as Virtue uſually lyes between the Extreams. And here I will inſtance in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, which has much diſquieted the Church almoſt in all Ages, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Decrees of God; about which there are two Extreams, the one that God peremptorily decrees the final
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35252:18"/>
condition of every particular perſon, that is, their everlaſting happineſs or miſery, without any regard or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> Actions of Men. The other, that God decrees nothing concerning any particular perſon, but only in general that men found under ſuch and ſuch Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be happy or miſerable, and puts it into their own power to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie themſelves. Now he that is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this matter, as every man muſt be that underſtands the difficulties on both ſides, had beſt take up in the middle Opinion, that God decrees the final condition of particular perſons with reſpect to certain Qualifications, which ſpeaking abſolutely are not in every Man's power; but yet, under the influence of God's grace, which is never wanting to the ſincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of men, may be ſaid to be in our power, in the ſame ſenſe, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthning me</hi>: For beſides that this in all probability is the Truth, there will be this advantage in it, that he that ſtands in the middle, is like to be more moderate towards the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters on both ſides, than either of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35252:18"/>
them will be to one onother; becauſe the middle is not ſo far from either Extream, as the Extreams are from one another. At the worſt, he ſtands fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for an impartial enquiry after Truth, and when he has ſatisfied himſelf where the Truth lyes, he may more ſilently paſs over to it, without any great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of inconſtancy; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be remarkable in him, who paſſeth from one Extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, Entertain no Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning God, that doth evidently contradict the Practice of Religion, and a good Life, though never ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſubtile Arguments may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to perſwade it. Truth is moſt eaſily ſeen, and diſcern'd in thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings and Opinions which tend to practice; becauſe the abſurdity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of them is ſooneſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: whereas we cannot ſo certainly find out the truth or falſhood of thoſe Opinions, which ſpeculative Men deviſe in their Studies, without any conſideration whether they ſerve any real purpoſe of Life, or not. Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are very apt to form thoſe notions, which are moſt remote from common
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35252:19"/>
ſenſe and uſe; becauſe more pains and wit are required to make them plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: but there needs no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make a wiſe man deſpiſe them, than that they are unprofitable, and ſignifie nothing to our practice, and to make men truly better.</p>
            <p>This is univerſally true in all kind of knowledge, but moſt conſiderable in the knowledge of God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe that knowledge is of the greateſt conſideration. We need not ſcruple to admit ſome things, not ſo evident to Natural Reaſon, if we be ſatisfied of the truth of them, from an higher and more cogent Reaſon: As that God has revealed it, and ſaid it; this general Reaſon may perſwade us of a thing that is above and beyond Natural Reaſon: But we may not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing for a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which evidently contradicts and weakens the practice of an holy Life; becauſe this is the main end of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation; and we know God, only in order to the ſervice and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him.</p>
            <p>Let us then look upon all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that contradicts practice, as vain and falſe, becauſe it deſtroys its end.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35252:19"/>
There are many things that ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough in Speculation, which yet we moſt pertinaciouſly deny, becauſe they are not practicable; and there are many things, which ſeem doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Speculation, and would admit of great diſpute, which yet becauſe they are found true in practice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, are to be taken for certain and unqueſtionable. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the idle Reaſoning of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> was a thing contemned by the wiſer Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, as a vain and uſeleſs ſubtilty. <hi>Zeno</hi> pretends to demonſtrate there is no Motion; and what is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this Speculation, but that Men muſt ſtand ſtill? But ſo long as a man finds he can walk, all the Sophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the world will not perſwade him, that Motion is impoſſible. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they that would perſwade us, that men can do nothing, nor contribute any more to their own Sanctification, than Stocks or Stones, and upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Metaphors miſunderſtood, (as <hi>our being dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> and <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to good works)</hi> graft Notions which are impoſſible and abſurd in practice, do not conſider that the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this is, that men muſt do
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35252:20"/>
nothing at all in Religion, never think of God, nor pray to him, nor read his Word, nor go to Church; but ſit ſtill, and be wholly paſſive to the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God's grace: but however this may ſeem plauſible, and men may think they add much to the glory of God's grace, while they deny any power in the Creature; yet every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Man will preſently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that this is by no means to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe it contradicts Practice, and makes all the Commands and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of God's Word vain, and to no purpoſe; becauſe it deſtroys Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and diſcourages the endeavours of Men; makes them ſloathful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of <hi>working out their own Salvation</hi>; than which nothing can ſet a man far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God's grace and aſſiſtance, and more immediately diſpoſe him for ruine; and upon ſome ſuch falſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as this, the <hi>ſloathful Servant</hi> in the Parable <hi>hid his talent in a napkin, and buried it in the earth</hi>; but when he was called to account, his excuſe was not admitted, but <hi>he was caſt into utter darkneſs.</hi> The two other Particulars, namely how far we are to imitate the Divine <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> and particularly what thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35252:20"/>
Divine Qualities are, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth here more eſpecially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our imitation, and likewiſe to clear the true meaning of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and to ſhew that the Duty here injoyned, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> is not impoſſible to us.

            <p>IN theſe words we have, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The abſolute <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature ſuppoſed, not only in thoſe before mentioned, of Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Patience; but in all other Excellencies whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Perfection</hi> of God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as a Pattern for our Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>In the handling of theſe two Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, I propounded to proceed in this method.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſhew how we are to conceive of the Divine <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:35252:22"/>II. To lay down ſome Rules, by which we may rectifie and govern our Opinions concerning the Attributes and <hi>Perfections</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhew how far we are to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what thoſe Divine Qualities are, which our Saviour doth here more eſpecially propound to our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To clear the true meaning of this Precept, and to ſhew that the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here intended by our Saviour is not impoſſible to us; and then to draw ſome uſeful Inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p>The <hi>two</hi> firſt I have already ſpoken to, I now proceed to the <hi>third</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which is to ſhew how far we are to imitate the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and particularly what thoſe Divine Qualities are, which our Saviour doth here more eſpecially propound to our imitation. For though theſe words do ſuppoſe the abſolute <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature, yet becauſe there are ſeveral <hi>Perfections</hi> of God which are incommunicable, and a Creature, as ſuch, is utterly incapable of them, theſe cannot be ſuppos'd to be intended for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35252:22"/>
a Pattern to us. As the neceſſity and independency of the Divine Nature; and the Self-ſufficiency of it to his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; to be the Original Cauſe of all things, and conſequently ſupream Lord and Governour; the Immenſity and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of his Being; theſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſeveral other <hi>Perfections,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable to a Creature; and it would be an unſufferable pride, and a kind of High Treaſon againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, and a ſottiſh Ignorance of the neceſſary bounds and limits of our own State, as we are Creatures, to think to reſemble God in theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, of which the condition of a Creature is utterly incapable. This was the Sin of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> an ambition to ſtep into the Throne of God, and <hi>to be like the moſt high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in our imitation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Perfection,</hi> we are to keep within the ſtation of Creatures, not affecting an Independency and Soveraignty like the moſt high, and to be Omnipotent as he is, <hi>to have an arm like God, and to thunder with a voice like him,</hi> as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is in <hi>Job:</hi> But to endeavour to reſemble him, <hi>pro modulo crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> according to the rate and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35252:23"/>
of a Creature, in thoſe Divine Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and in ſuch meaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as our finite and dependent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of.</p>
            <p>More eſpecially and chiefly in the moral <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch as are his Goodneſs, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Patience, his Juſtice, and Truth, and Faithfulneſs; theſe, and only theſe, the Scripture ſeems to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend under the name of Holineſs; not all the Excellencies of the Divine Nature in general, but thoſe which we call moral Excellencies and Perfections, ſuch as thoſe which I have named; for with theſe, and hardly with any other, is the Holineſs of God joyn'd in Scripture, as <hi>holy and righteous, holy and true,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore when God ſays, <hi>be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that we are to imitate God in his Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Patience, and Righteouſneſs, and Faithfulneſs, and Truth; for theſe are the Holineſs of the Divine Nature, which ſet him at the greateſt diſtance from that which we call Moral Impurity and Sin.</p>
            <p>For that which our Saviour here in the Text more peculiarly recommends <pb n="31" facs="tcp:35252:23"/>
to our imitation, is the Goodneſs of God, of which his Mercy and Patience are two eminent Branches. The Mercy of God is his Goodneſs to thoſe that are in Miſery, or are liable to it. The Patience of God is his Mercy in ſparing thoſe who have deſerved Puniſhment, and are liable to it. And the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is then greateſt, when it is exerciſed towards the evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful; thoſe who are ſo far from deſerving it, that they have given great and juſt Provocations to the contrary. And this affection and temper of Mind, which is ſo remarkable in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the unworthy and unthankful Sons of Men, our Saviour recommends to our imitation here in the Text. <hi>Be ye therefore Perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is Perfect. Be ye therefore</hi>; this Particle of inference, <hi>therefore,</hi> hath a plain relation to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpoken before; and if we look back to <hi>v.</hi> 44. we ſhall find our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour there enjoyning his Diſciples <hi>to love their Enemies, to bleſs them that curſe them, to do good to them that hate them, and to pray for thoſe that deſpightfully uſe them, and perſecute them.</hi> And by what other argument doth he inforce
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35252:24"/>
the Practice of this difficult Duty, but by telling us, that this is to be like God, to be good to the evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, <hi>v.</hi> 45. <hi>That ye may be the Children of your Heavenly Father, who maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and the good, and his Rain to fall on the juſt, and on the unjuſt.</hi> God is good to all, and exerciſeth great Mercy and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience even towards the evil, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. And then he concludes, that if <hi>Perfection</hi> it ſelf be fit to be a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, we ſhould labour after theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>Be ye therefore Perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> So that though the univerſal Perfection of the Divine Nature be here ſuppoſed, yet the Attributes of his Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are here particularly pointed at, and propounded to us for our Pattern; and the Precept of imitating the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Perfection</hi> is more eſpecially to be underſtood of thoſe <hi>Perfections</hi> which our Saviour had been diſcourſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of before, <hi>viz.</hi> the Goodneſs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. And that this is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, is evident from St. <hi>Luke's</hi> rendring this Precept, Ch. 6.36. <hi>Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, benefici, ready to do good,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35252:24"/>
full of kindneſs and benignity; merciful, as your Father which is in Heaven is merciful</hi>; that is, endeavour you to be ſuch as I have deſcribed God to be. And this St. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls Perfection, becauſe the Goodneſs of God is his great Perfection, and the Glory of the Divine Nature, that which reflects a luſtre and beauty upon all his other Attributes, and takes off the terrour of them. From all which it is plain, what thoſe Perfections of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are, which our Saviour doth here particularly recommend to our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I come now in the</p>
            <p n="4">IV. and <hi>laſt</hi> place, To clear the true meaning of this Precept, and to ſhew that the Duty here required, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by our Saviour (when he ſays, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect)</hi> is not impoſſible to us. And to this purpoſe be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſider theſe <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our imitation of God is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reſtrained to the communicable Perfections of God, and ſuch as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are capable of, as I have ſhewn before. For it is ſo far from being a Duty to affect or attempt to be like
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35252:25"/>
God in his peculiar Perfections, that it was probably the Sin of the Apoſtate Angels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our imitation of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which are communicable to Creatures, is likewiſe to be reſtrain'd to ſuch degrees of theſe Perfections, as Creatures are capable of. For no Creature can ever be ſo perfectly Good, as God is; nor partake of any other Excellency in that tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent degree, in which the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is poſſeſt of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But there is no manner of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in having a Pattern propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us of ſo great Perfection, as is above our reach to attain to; and there may be great Advantages in it. The way to excel in any kind is, <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima quaeque exempla ad imitandum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere,</hi> to propoſe the higheſt and moſt perfect Examples to our imitation. No Man can write after too perfect and good a Copy, and though he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reach the Perfection of it, yet he is like to learn more, than by one leſs perfect. He that aims at the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which yet he is ſure to come ſhort of, is like to ſhoot higher than he that aims at a mark within his reach.</p>
            <p>Beſides that the excellency of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35252:25"/>
Pattern, as it leaves room for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual improvement, ſo it kindles Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes Men ſtrain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the utmoſt to do better: And though he can never hope to equal the Example before him, yet he will endeavour to come as near it as he can. So that a perfect Pattern is no hindrance, but an advantage rather to our improvement in any kind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If any thing can be ſuppoſed to be our Duty, which is abſolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Power, a Precept of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may with as much reaſon be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be ſo, as any thing that can be inſtanc'd in: Becauſe in ſuch a caſe, if we do our beſt, and be continnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſſing forward towards the Mark, though we can never reach it, yet we do very commendably; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the law may require to try and raiſe our Obedience, yet in all equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interpretation, ſuch a Will and Endeavour will be acceptable with God for the Deed. For if the Perfection of the Law do really exceed our Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and be beyond the poſſibility of our Performance, the aſſurance we have of God's Goodneſs will ſufficiently ſecure us from any danger and prejudice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35252:26"/>
on that account. And we may reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably preſume, that to do all we can towards the fulfilling of this Precept, will be as acceptable to God, and as beneficial to our ſelves, as if our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had been greater, and we had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfill'd it. If our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to try the readineſs and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our Obedience, bid us do that which he knows we cannot do, though we can do ſomething towards it, we may be ſure that he will be very well pleaſed when he ſees, that in obedience to him we have done all that we could. And we may in this caſe reaſon as our Saviour does; <hi>If we that are evil would deal thus with our Children, how much more ſhall our Heavenly Father</hi>? The Goodneſs of God ſignifies very little, if it does not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie this, that in any inſtance of real and unqueſtionable Goodneſs, God is much better than any Father upon Earth.</p>
            <p>However, at the worſt, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we fall ſhort of the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Law, may be ſupplyed on our part, by an humble acknowledgment of our own Weakneſs and Imperfection, and on God's part by Mercy and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35252:26"/>
for the ſake of the perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of our bleſſed Redeemer. This is the leaſt benefit we can expect in this caſe from the Grace, and Mercy, and Equity of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> which will fully clear this matter, this Precept doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to come up to a perfect equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with the Pattern propounded to us, but only imports a vigorous imitation of it; that we be perpetually aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and climbing up higher, ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing from one degree of Goodneſs to another, and continually aſpiring after a nearer reſemblance to God: And this certainly is poſſible to us, to endeavour to be as like God as we can, in this weak and imperfect ſtate.</p>
            <p>Whereas any Equality with God, even in the communicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of his Goodneſs, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Patience, is not only impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us in this ſtate of Sin and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, but above the condition of a Creature, even of <hi>the Spirits of juſt Men made Perfect,</hi> and of the higheſt Angels in Glory: for their Perfection is not abſolute, but in compariſon with our preſent ſtate. And I think there is no great Reaſon to doubt, but that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35252:27"/>
the bleſſed Spirits above, who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally behold the Face of their Father, are ſtill writing after this Copy, which is here propounded to us; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>to be perfect, as their Father which is in Heaven is perfect</hi>; ſtill aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after a nearer and more perfect reſemblance of God, whoſe Goodneſs and Mercy is ſo far beyond, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of any Creature, that they may be for ever approaching near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to it, and yet never overtake it.</p>
            <p>And this ſeems to be no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ingredient, and enhancement of the happineſs of Heaven, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of good men (which is the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of God) is never at a ſtand, nor at it's full growth and period; but that the glorified Saints (yea and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels too) may be continually growing and improving, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtill become better and happier to all eternity. And this in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion is no undervaluing the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Heaven, that it is not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at firſt, as it ſhall be afterwards; becauſe it is granted on all hands, that the happineſs of thoſe good Souls, who are already in bliſs, ſhall be more
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35252:27"/>
perfect and compleat at the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And why may it not then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increaſing, and be augmented ſtill more and more, without any ſtint or final period of it's perfection? In this world we are apt to faint in a long courſe of goodneſs, and to be <hi>weary of well doing.</hi> But in the other ſtate, when men ſhall be ſtrongly by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed to goodneſs, and have nothing to pull them back, it will then be ſo far from being a trouble, that methinks it ſhould be a mighty pleaſure to the bleſſed, to find that there is no end of their doing good and becoming better. For if conformity to God be the ground and foundation of all Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, then our Bleſſedneſs will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance proportionably, as we grow more and more like to him. This I confeſs were a diſmal Conſideration, to think that in Heaven we ſhould be liable to relapſe, to go backward, or fall from that holy and happy ſtate. But this is a comfortable Conſideration, that our holineſs and happineſs ſhall never be at a ſtand, that it is ſecure ſo far as it goes, and that we cannot loſe what we have once attain'd, as we may do in this world. This methinks
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35252:28"/>
ſhould be a trouble to no man, that as good and happy as he is at firſt, he ſhall ſtill be better and better, more and more happy without end.</p>
            <p>But be that as it will, and as God pleaſeth (for we do but talk in the dark about our future ſtate,) this is certain, that an equality with God in any of his <hi>Perfections</hi> is not to be attained by any Creature, and therefore cannot be thought to be the meaning of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: But that which our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, is a vigorous imitation of this Pattern; that we have this Example of the Divine <hi>Perfection</hi> always before us, and that we be continually endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as much as in us lies, to bring our ſelves to the neareſt reſemblance of God, that poſſibly we can. And if this be our ſincere care and ſtudy, we need not doubt but that it will find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, and that he will be graciouſly pleaſed to eſteem us for his Children; and if there need a pardon for it, that God will forgive wherein we fall ſhort of the <hi>Perfection</hi> of that Pattern, which we can never imitate to Perfection.</p>
            <p>And happy were it for us, if this were all the ground of our fear and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35252:28"/>
trouble, that when we had done all we could, we muſt ſtill fall much ſhort of the <hi>perfection</hi> of God's Law, and the Duty therein laid upon us; alas! which of us does near ſo much as we can, and is not conſcious to himſelf that it is through his own fault and neglect, that he is ſo unlike his heavenly Father in Goodneſs and Mercy, in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs; and that he ſtill partakes in ſo great a meaſure of thoſe, not only unreaſonable and brutiſh, but even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Paſſions of Malice and Hatred, of Rage and Cruelty, of Impatience and implacable Revenge; and that theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlike Qualities do ſo frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon us, and have ſo much domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over us!</p>
            <p>We are ſo far from being what we ought, in theſe and many other reſpects, that we are far from what we might be, if we would mind our Duty with care and conſcience, and make it our ſincere endeavour to ſubdue our ſelves to a conformity to God, and to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſs in his fear.</p>
            <p>Would we but often ſet God before our eyes, and repreſent to our ſelves thoſe excellent and amiable <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine Nature, which are ſo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35252:29"/>
comfortable and beneficial to us, and to which we ſtand ſo infinitely oblig'd, his Goodneſs and Mercy and Patience, upon which all our hopes of Happineſs do depend, and to which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, that we are not miſerable paſt recovery; that Goodneſs and Patience which he continually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth towards us, (for we provoke him every day,) and exerciſeth towards us on purpoſe to endear thoſe <hi>Perfections</hi> to us, from which we reap ſo much comfort and advantage; that by the Pattern of <hi>Perfection</hi> it ſelf, and the Example of him who is ſo much above us, ſo no ways obliged to us, nor tyed by any intereſt to be concerned for us, and who being happy in himſelf nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hopes nor fears any thing from us; I ſay by an Example that has all theſe advantages, we might be provok'd to be ſo affected towards one another (who have mutual Obligations one to another, and mutual Expectations of Good or Evil one from another) as we have always found God to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and as we deſire he ſhould ſtill continue; and miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are we, when ever he ceaſeth to be ſo: And we have reaſon to fear he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35252:29"/>
will ceaſe to be ſo, if this Example of his Goodneſs and Patience towards us, do not transform us into the Image of the Divine <hi>Perfections,</hi> and prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to imitate thoſe Excellencies, which we have ſo much reaſon to approve and admire, and be in love withal.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations taken both from ingenuity and intereſt ſhould awaken our ſloath, and ſtir up our moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and vigorous endeavours after that <hi>Perfection</hi> which our Saviour here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and make us aſhamed of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy complaints, that our Duty is ſet ſo high, that the endeavours of our whole life cannot reach it; when yet we have hardly made one ſtep towards it, and are ſo remiſs and unconcern'd about it, as if we could do it at any time with the greateſt eaſe, and at an hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before we leave the world, could fulfil this Precept of our Lord, of <hi>being perfect as our Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet let me tell you, ſo far as any of us are from reſembling our heavenly Father in ſome good degree and meaſure, ſo far are we diſtant from Heaven, and the temper of the bleſſed; ſo far are we utterly unqualified for the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35252:30"/>
bliſsful ſight and enjoyment of God: for unleſs we be firſt <hi>like him,</hi> we cannot <hi>ſee him as he is</hi>: Only <hi>the pure in heart ſhall ſee God,</hi> and therefore <hi>every man that has this hope in him,</hi> ſhould <hi>purifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf even as he is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have, as briefly as I could, diſpatcht the <hi>four</hi> things I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for the Explication of this Text; namely, how we are to conceive of the Divine <hi>Perfections,</hi> and to give ſome Rules to regulate and govern our Opinions concerning the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and <hi>Perfections</hi> of God; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the extent of this Duty, and vindicate the poſſibility of it.</p>
            <p>All that now remains, is to draw ſome uſeful Inferences from this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which I have made; and they ſhall be theſe <hi>two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. That the ſtrongeſt and ſureſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings in Religion, are grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eſſential <hi>Perfections</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the trueſt and moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Practice of Religion, conſiſts in the <hi>imitation</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the ſtrongeſt and ſureſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings in Religion are grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eſſential <hi>Perfections</hi> of God; ſo that even Divine Revelation it ſelf
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35252:30"/>
doth ſuppoſe theſe for its Foundation, and can ſignifie nothing to us, unleſs theſe be firſt known and believed. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we be firſt perſwaded of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and his particular Care of Mankind, why ſhould we believe that he would make any Revelation of himſelf to Men? Unleſs it be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally known to us, that God is true, what foundation is there for the belief of his Word? And what ſignifie the Laws and Promiſes of God, unleſs natural Light do firſt aſſure us of his Soveraign Authority and Faithfulneſs? So that the Principles of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are the foundation of that which is Revealed; and therefore in Reaſon nothing can be admitted to be a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God, which plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts his Eſſential <hi>Perfection,</hi> and conſequently if any pretends Divine Revelation for this Doctrine, That God hath from all Eternity abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the eternal ruine of the greateſt part of Mankind, without any reſpect to the Sins and Demerits of Men, I am as certain that this Doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of God, as I am ſure that God is Good and Juſt: becauſe this grates upon the Notion that Mankind have of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35252:31"/>
Goodneſs and Juſtice. This is that which no good man would do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be believed of infinite Goodneſs; and therefore if <hi>an Apoſtle or Angel from Heaven</hi> teach any Doctrine which plainly overthrows the Goodneſs and Juſtice of God, <hi>let him be accurſed.</hi> For every man hath greater aſſurance that God is Good and Juſt, than he can have of any ſubtile Speculations about Predeſtination and the Decrees of God.</p>
            <p>And for the ſame Reaſon I cannot believe, upon the pretended Authority or Infallibility of any Man or Church in the world, that God would not have Men underſtand their Publick Prayers, and the Leſſons of Scripture which are read to them. A Leſſon not to be underſtood is nonſenſe: a Leſſon is ſomething to be learn'd, which how it can be without being underſtood, is hard to comprehend.</p>
            <p>And as little can I believe upon the Authority of any Perſon or Church whatſoever, that God ſhould reveal his Will to Men in the holy Scriptures, with a deſign to have it hid, and lock't up from the generality of Mankind in an unknown Tongue. And much
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35252:31"/>
leſs can I believe (which yet is the expreſs Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) that the ſaving Efficacy of the Sacrament depends upon the Intention of the Prieſt. Which is to ſay, that though people believe, and live never ſo well, they may be damned by Sholes and whole Pariſhes together at the pleaſure of the Prieſt, and for no other reaſon, but becauſe he is ſo wicked, as not to intend to ſave them. Can any man believe this that hath any tolerable notion of God's Goodneſs? May we not in this caſe appeal, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice of God, and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with greater Reaſon, than he did, much after the ſame manner, <hi>wilt thou deſtroy the righteous for the wicked; That be far from Thee to do after this manner,</hi> to damn the righteous for the wicked, and that righteous people ſhould lye at the mercy of a wicked Prieſt, to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſaved at his pleaſure, <hi>that be far from Thee; Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> And can there be a greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the Goodneſs and Juſtice of God, than to imagin he ſhould deal with men after this manner? If this be to do right, there is no poſſibility of doing wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:35252:32"/>And to give but one inſtance more, I can never believe, upon the Authority of any Man, or Church whatſoever, that our Saviour, in the Celebration of his laſt Supper, did with his own hands give away his own Natural Body into the hands of his Diſciples, and give his Blood ſhed, before it was ſhed; That the whole Doctrine of Chriſtianity ſhould mainly rely upon the Evidence of Miracles, the aſſurance of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the certainty of Senſe; and yet that an Eſſential part of that Doctrine ſhould overthrow the certainty of Senſe. I can never while I live believe theſe two things, that the laſt thing our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did before his death ſhould be to teach his Diſciples not to believe their own Senſes, as he muſt do if he taught them Tranſubſtantiation; and that the very firſt thing he did after he was riſen from the dead, ſhould be to teach them the quite contrary, by appealing to the certainty of Senſe for the proof of his Reſurrection; for when they doubted of his Reſurrection, Luke 24.38. <hi>He ſaid unto them, why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts? behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf, handle me and ſee, for a Spirit hath not fleſh and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35252:32"/>
bones, as ye ſee me have.</hi> If this be a good Argument, that it was a real Body which they ſaw, becauſe they ſaw and felt Fleſh and Bones: is it not as good an Argument on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, that what they ſaw in the Sacrament was not his real and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body, becauſe they could neither ſee nor handle Fleſh and Bones? So that I cannot believe Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs I can believe that Truth it ſelf can contradict and deſtroy it ſelf.</p>
            <p>You ſee of what uſe it is to have right and ſteady Apprehenſions of the Divine <hi>Perfections,</hi> that, theſe being laid for a foundation, we may upon all occaſions have recourſe to them, and govern our Opinions and Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Religion, about all doubtful matters, by ſuch Principles as are clear and unqueſtionable. The</p>
            <p n="2">II. Inference is, That the trueſt and moſt ſubſtantial Practice of Religion conſiſts in the imitation of the Divine <hi>Perfections,</hi> eſpecially the Moral <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> of the Divine Nature, which the Scripture is wont to comprehend under the name of Holineſs; and ſuch are the Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35252:33"/>
of God, his Juſtice, and Truth, and Faithfulneſs. To imitate God in theſe is true Religion; or as St. <hi>James</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>pure Religion, and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without any flaw or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, alluding to precious Stones, the greateſt commendation of which is to be clear and without flaw. <hi>Religio eſt imitari quem colis, this is Religion to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate him whom we worſhip.</hi> This the Heathens by the light of Nature did diſcover to be the great End of Religion, and the beſt Worſhip of the Deity, to be like God.
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> was wont to ſay, <q>that we honour God moſt, when we are moſt like him in the temper and diſpoſition of our Minds;</q>
and <hi>Plato</hi> to the ſame purpoſe,
<q>that the height and <hi>Perfection</hi> of Goodneſs, is to reſemble God, as near as is poſſible; and that we reſemble God in being juſt, and holy, and wiſe.</q>
So likewiſe <hi>Hierocles,</hi> 
               <q>that a good man imitates God in the meaſures of Love and Friendſhip, who hates no man, and extends his benignity to all Mankind.</q>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath an excellent Diſcourſe about the Patience of God towards Sinners, and gives this as one Reaſon why God doth not preſently puniſh
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35252:33"/>
Offenders; <q>that he might give an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to us of Gentleneſs and Patience, and check the fury and violence of men in revenging Injuries upon one another; which nothing will do more effectually, than to conſider that Gentleneſs and Forbearance are an imitation of the Divine <hi>Perfection.</hi>
               </q>
And then he cites an excellent ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> 
               <q>that God manifeſted himſelf, and diſplay'd his <hi>Perfections</hi> in the World for our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation; true Virtue being nothing elſe, but an imitation of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For there is no greater Benefit man can receive from God's hand, than to become virtuous by the imitation and purſuit of thoſe Excellencies and <hi>Perfections</hi> which are in God.</q>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> likewiſe hath many paſſages to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>inter viros bonos ac Deum amicitia eſt, imo etiam neceſſitudo &amp; ſimilitudo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and good men there is a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yea and an intimacy and likeneſs</hi>; and that a virtuous man is <hi>diſcipulus aemula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torque &amp; vera progenies Dei, a diſciple and imitator, and the very genuine off-ſpring of God.</hi> So that the light of Nature, and the Reaſon of Mankind, have always placed the perfection of Religion in the imitation of the Divine Excellencies and <hi>Perfections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:35252:34"/>And this is very agreeable to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and ſenſe of the holy Scriptures, which every where make the Practice of Religion to conſiſt in our Conformity to God, and the Laws which he hath given us; which are nothing elſe but a tranſcript of his Nature. The great buſineſs of Religion is to do the Will of God, and <hi>this is the will of God, our ſanctification</hi>; and our ſanctification is our conformity to the holineſs of God; and this is the ſcope of the general Exhortations of Scripture, to perſwade us to holineſs, that is, to an imitation of the Moral <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine Nature. 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes, dearly beloved! let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15, 16. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it is written, be ye holy for I am holy.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.3, 4. ſpeaking of the Chriſtian Religion, which he calls <hi>the knowledge of him who hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby alſo</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are given unto us exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, that by theſe we might be partakers of a divine nature, having eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the corruption that is in the world
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35252:34"/>
through luſt.</hi> So that the holineſs the Goſpel deſigns to bring us to, is a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Divine Nature,</hi> which we can no otherwiſe partake of, but by an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the Divine <hi>Perfections.</hi> This is that which the Scripture expreſſes to us by the terms of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the <hi>New Man,</hi> and the <hi>New Creature.</hi> And therefore thoſe who are converted from a wicked and ſinful ſtate, and reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to goodneſs, are ſaid <hi>to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs, and the holineſs of truth.</hi> Epheſ. 4.23. <hi>To be renewed after the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of him that created us.</hi> Coloſſ. 3.10. This is to be <hi>the</hi> ſons <hi>and</hi> children <hi>of God, to</hi> imitate <hi>and reſemble God in our diſpoſitions and manners.</hi> Epheſ. 5.1. <hi>Be ye therefore, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, imitators of God, as dear children.</hi> Philip. 2.15. <hi>That ye may be blameleſs and ſincere, the ſons of God without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe nation.</hi> 1 John 3.10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil, whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God.</hi> There have been great enquiries concerning the Marks of a Child of God; this is the true Character, and that which in effect comprehends all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35252:35"/>
others, our imitation and reſemblance of God in thoſe <hi>Perfections</hi> wherein he is ſet forth for a Pattern to us. And in this mainly conſiſts the practice both of Natural Religion, and of true Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>But does not Religion conſiſt very much in the Duties of God's Worſhip, in the Exerciſes of Piety and Devotion, in conſtant and frequent Prayers to God, and in the celebration of his Goodneſs by Praiſe and Thanksgiving, in reading, and hearing, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon God's Word, in Faſting and Abſtinence, and keeping our bodies in ſubjection to our ſpirits, and in frequent receiving of the holy Sacrament? To this I anſwer, That Religion doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt very much in the due performance of theſe Duties, and they are unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and neceſſary parts of Religion, and the Means appointed by God for the begetting and increaſing in us ſuch diſpoſitions of mind, as render us moſt like to God, and for the production of all the fruits of Goodneſs and Holineſs and Righteouſneſs in our lives.</p>
            <p>But then it is to be conſidered, that theſe Exerciſes of Piety and Devotion are but the <hi>Means</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

and not the ultimate <hi>End</hi> and Deſign of it. All theſe do but ſerve to bring us to a nearer reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of God; and where they fail of this End, and are performed for their own ſakes only, and we reſt in them, without aiming at any thing farther, they loſe their nature; becauſe they are not uſed as <hi>Means,</hi> but reſted in, as if they were the <hi>End</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And it is to be feared there are many which fall into this fatal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take about Religion, and think that if they do but ſerve God in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and go to Church, and behave themſelves there with Devotion and Reverence, and at certain ſeaſons receive the Sacrament, they are truly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and very good Chriſtians; when all this while they take no care to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves in real Goodneſs, by an inward conformity of their Minds to God, and the real reformation and amendment of their Lives, by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their Luſts, and ſubduing their Appetites and Paſſions to the Laws of Reaſon and Religion, by <hi>putting on as the elect of God bowels of kindneſs</hi>; by being true and faithful; righteous and juſt, patient and <hi>merciful, as their Father
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35252:36"/>
which is in heaven is</hi> ſo; and by <hi>forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another</hi> in caſe of provocation, and <hi>forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us</hi>; by <hi>purifying themſelves as God is pure,</hi> and endeavouring to <hi>be holy in all manner of converſation, as he who hath called them is holy</hi>; when all this while they are as covetous, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, and to ſerve their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will ſtrain a point of Truth or Juſtice, and hardly do an act of Charity in their whole lives, but what is extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them by meer importunity, or ſome ſuch urgent neceſſity, in point of decency and reputation, that for ſhame of the World they know not how to avoid it; when their Paſſions are as fierce and ungoverned, their Hearts as full of Gall and Bitterneſs, their Tongues of ſlander and evil ſpeaking, their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours as proud and ſurly and cenſorious, as theirs can be who are openly profane, and ſeem to neglect and deſpiſe all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And yet becauſe they ſerve God (as they call it) and make an external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Piety and Devotion, are good Church-men, and attend upon the Ordinances of God, they think they have diſcharged the whole buſineſs of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35252:36"/>
Religion admirably well, and are very good <hi>children of God,</hi> and in a ſtate of great grace and favour with him. Whereas the performance of all theſe Duties, and the uſe of all theſe Means, ſeparated from that which is the great End of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Conformity of our ſelves to God, in thoſe Qualities and Diſpoſitions which I have mention'd, is ſo far from finding acceptance with God, that it is an abomination to him. So God every where declares in Scripture, telling us, that <hi>the prayer of the wicked is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord,</hi> and that he diſdains to be praiſed by men of unhallowed lips and lives; and that unleſs with <hi>the praiſes we offer to him, we order our converſation aright, we ſhall not ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi> With what contempt does he ſpeak of this formal and external Religion, without the power of it upon our hearts and lives! <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to me? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſands of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Oil? he hath ſhewed thee, O man! what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? Is not this the faſt which I have choſen, to break the bands of wickedneſs, and to let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35252:37"/>
go free, to deal thy bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out to thine houſe; when thou ſeeſt the naked that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh</hi>?</p>
            <p>Nor is it <hi>hearing of the Word</hi> that will avail us, unleſs <hi>we be doers of it. Bleſſed are they</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>that hear the word of God and keep it. He that heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, ſhall be likened to a wiſe man, who hath built his houſe upon a rock.</hi> Nor will bare receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sacrament recommend us to God; but performing the Obligation, which thereby we take upon our ſelves, to obſtain from all ſin and wickedneſs; otherwiſe <hi>we tread under foot the Son of God, and prophane the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby we ſhould be ſanctified, as if it were an unholy thing.</hi> Can any man think <hi>that</hi> to be Religion, which has no effect upon the lives of men, which does not teach them to govern their words and actions, who reads thoſe plain words of St. <hi>James? If any man among you ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vain. Pure Religion and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed before God and the Father is this, to viſit the fatherleſs and widdows in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35252:37"/>
and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the world.</hi> When Religion produceth theſe real Effects, then the <hi>Means</hi> of Religion do truly ſerve the <hi>End</hi> of it, and we are <hi>not</hi> only <hi>hearers of the Word, but doers of it,</hi> and <hi>ſhall be bleſſed in our deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that as there is an obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to uſe the <hi>Means</hi> of Religion, which God hath inſtituted, with great care and conſcience; ſo we ſhould chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind that, which is the <hi>End</hi> of all Religion, which is to make us <hi>partakers of a Divine Nature,</hi> and make us like to God, eſpecially in thoſe amiable and excellent Qualities, which are the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and beauty of the Divine Nature, his Benignity and Goodneſs, his Mercy and Patience. Theſe, becauſe they are the primary <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, are the principal Duties both of Natural and Revealed Religion, and of an eternal and indiſpenſable Obligation; becauſe they have their foundation in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, which is fixt and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And all poſitive Inſtitutions, when they come in competition with theſe, are to ſtoop and vail to them. <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, eſpecially thoſe of Goodneſs, and Mercy, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35252:38"/>
Charity, are ſo ſtrongly bound upon us, that nothing in any <hi>reveal'd</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can cancel the Obligation of them, or juſtifie the violation of theſe great and indiſpenſable Laws. Our Saviour in his Religion has declar'd nothing to the prejudice of them: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary has ſtraitned our Obligation to them, as much as is poſſible. <hi>The Son of man came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them</hi>; ſo that they <hi>know not what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpirit they are of,</hi> who think to pleaſe God by hating men, who are made after the image of God, &amp; <hi>by killing one another to do him good ſervice</hi>; who to advance his Cauſe and Religion in the World, will break through all the Obligations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Civil Society, undermine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and diſturb the Peace of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Whereas our Saviour did not by any thing in his Religion deſign to alter the Civil Government of the World, or to leſſen and diminiſh the Rights of Princes, or to ſet men looſe from Allegiance to them, or to make Treaſon and Rebellion, bloody Wars and barbarous Maſſacres lawful, for the propagating of his faith. He had (as any one would imagin) as much Power as the Pope; but yet he depoſed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35252:38"/>
no Princes, nor excommunicated and diſcharged their Subjects from their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Obedience to them, for their oppoſition to his Religion; he hath aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med no ſuch Power to himſelf. <hi>By what Authority then does</hi> his Vicar <hi>do theſe things? and who gave him this Authority</hi>? Our Lord tells us plainly, <hi>his Kingdom was not of this world</hi>; and that without any diſtinction of <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> and therefore he wreſted no Princes Kingdom out of his hands, nor ſeized it as forfeited to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But this Power the Pope claims to himſelf, and hath exerciſed it many a time, diſturbing the Peace of Nations, and exerciſing the moſt barbarous Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the World, under a pretence of Zeal for God and Religion: as if becauſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ſo very good a thing in it ſelf, it would warrant men to do the very worſt things for its ſake; which is the ready way to render Religion contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and odious, and to make two of the beſt things in the World, God and Religion, good for nothing.</p>
            <p>If we would preſerve in the Minds of Men any reverence and eſteem for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we muſt take heed how we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Principles of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:35252:39"/>
and undermine the Peace and Happineſs of Humane Society, for the glory of God, and under pretence of following Divine Revelation, and being led by a Church that cannot err: for every Church doth certainly err, that teacheth any thing plainly contrary to the Principles and Dictates <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f Natural Religion, and utterly inconſiſtent with the eſſential <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and with the Peace and Order of the World: for <hi>God is not the God of Confuſion, but of Order</hi>; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> appealeth to, as a Principle of eternal Truth, and naturally known: But they that pretend that Religion prompts men to Sedition and Cruelty, do repreſent God as <hi>the God of confuſion,</hi> and <hi>not of order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore whatever men may through an ignorant zeal, or for ambitious Ends, pretend to be Religion; let us place it in that which is unqueſtionable, the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine <hi>Perfections,</hi> and let us (as the Apoſtle exhorts) <hi>put on, as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God, bowels of mercy, kindneſs, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, and above all, let us put on Charity, which is the very bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> The great <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature, or rather the very Eſſence of God is Love. So St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35252:39"/>
and God in him.</hi> And 'tis very remarkable that in theſe very qualities of Charity, and Kindneſs, and Compaſſion, which we peculiarly call <hi>Humanity,</hi> we approach neareſt to the <hi>Divinity</hi> it ſelf, and that the contrary Diſpoſitions do transform us into wild Beaſts and Devils.</p>
            <p>And yet as ſeverely as I ſpeak againſt theſe Principles and Practices, I have an hearty pity and compaſſion for thoſe who are under the power of ſo great a Deluſion, and upon a pretence of being made the only true Chriſtians in the world, are ſeduced from <hi>Humanity</hi> it ſelf, and ſo far from being made good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by theſe Principles, that they are hardly left to be <hi>Men; being blinded, and led by the blind, they fall into the ditch</hi> of the groſſeſt and fouleſt Immoralities; ſuch as are plainly enough condemn'd by the light of Nature, if there were no Bible in the World.</p>
            <p>Not but that we Proteſtants have our Faults and our Follies too, and thoſe (God knows) too many and too viſible; we poſſeſs more Truth, but there is little Peace among us; and yet God is as well and as often in Scripture called <hi>the God of peace,</hi> as <hi>the God of truth.</hi> In this great Light and Liberty of the Reform'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35252:40"/>
we are apt to be wanton, and to quarrel and fall out; we are full of Heats and Animoſities, of Schiſms and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>and the way of peace we have not known.</hi> God grant that at laſt <hi>in this our day</hi> (when it concerns us ſo much) we may <hi>know the things that belong to our peace, before they be hid from our eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee in what things the Practice of Religion mainly conſiſts, in our likeneſs to God, and reſemblance of him in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs; and without this we are utterly incapable of happineſs: we cannot <hi>ſee God,</hi> unleſs <hi>we be like him.</hi> The Preſence of God can adminiſter no Pleaſure, no Felicity to us, till we be changed into his Image; till we come to this temper, to hate Sin, and delight in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holineſs, we can have no delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful communion with the holy God; till our Paſſions be ſubdued, and our Souls diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt of thoſe deviliſh and ungodlike Qualities of Hatred and Malice, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and Impatience, and till we be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the Spirit of univerſal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Charity, we are not fit company for our heavenly Father; we are not qualified <hi>to dwell with God,</hi> who is <hi>love and dwells in love.</hi> So far as we are defective in theſe Divine Qualities and <hi>Perfections,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:35252:40"/>
ſo far we fall ſhort of the temper of Happineſs.</p>
            <p>There is a direct and eternal Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the holy and good God, and the evil diſpoſitions of wicked men, and till this Oppoſition be removed, it is impoſſible we ſhould find any felicity in the enjoyment of God. Now the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is fixt and unchangeable, God cannot recede from his own <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and therefore we muſt quit our ſins: Thou canſt not change God, therefore change thy ſelf, and rather think of putting off thy corrupt Nature, which may be changed, than of altering the Divine Nature, <hi>with whom is no varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs nor ſhadow of turning.</hi> God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to take our Nature upon him, to make us capable of Happineſs; but if this will not do, he will not put off his own Nature to make us happy.</p>

            <p>SINCE all Men naturally deſire <hi>happineſs,</hi> and thirſt after it; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we ſhould all deſire to know what it is, and where it is to be found, and how it is to be attained by us, in that degree in which Creatures are capable of it. What <hi>Job</hi> ſays of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> may be ſaid alſo of <hi>Happineſs, God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</hi> He only, who is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſt of it himſelf, knows wherein it conſiſts, and what are the true ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:35252:42"/>So that to direct us in our ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>happineſs,</hi> the beſt way will be to Contemplate and Conſider the Divine Nature, which is the perfect Pattern and Idea of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and the Original Spring and Fountain of all the Felicity that Creatures are capable of. And to that end, I have pitched upon theſe Words, wherein the Apoſtle attributes this Perfection of <hi>beſſedneſs</hi> or <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to God, <hi>The Bleſſed God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' this be as Eſſential a part as any other of that Notion which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have of God from the Light of Nature, yet I no where find in all the New Teſtament, this Attribute of <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> given to God, but only twice in this Epiſtle. 'Tis true indeed, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> is frequently given both to God and Chriſt, but in another Senſe, and in a quite different Notion: As <hi>Mark</hi> 14.61. where the High-Prieſt asks our Saviour, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt, the Son of the Bleſſed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of him that is to be Celebrated and Praiſed</hi>; and 2 Cor. 11.31. <hi>The God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> So likewiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. <hi>The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, bleſſed for evermore</hi>: Which likewiſe is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Of whom
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35252:42"/>
Chriſt came, who is over all, God Bleſſed for evermore</hi>; that is, <hi>for ever to be praiſed and celebrated.</hi> But in all theſe Texts the Greek Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which tho' we Tranſlate <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> yet it is a quite different Notion from the Title of <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> which is given to God in the Text, where the Word is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Bleſſed,</hi> or <hi>the Happy God</hi>; and this Title is not any where in all the New Teſtament, (that I know of) given to God, but here in the Text, and Chap. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 15. where our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (who alſo is God) is called <hi>the bleſſed and the only Potentate.</hi> And whether this Title of <hi>the Bleſſed,</hi> or <hi>the Happy God,</hi> be here in the Text given to God the Father, or to his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; is not ſo much material to my preſent purpoſe to enquire. For, ſuppoſe it be Chriſt who is here call'd <hi>the Bleſſed God</hi>; this however is certain, that <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> or <hi>Happineſs</hi> is a Title belonging to <hi>God,</hi> which is all that is neceſſary for a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking of this Argument, I ſhall do theſe <hi>three</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Shew what we are to underſtand by the <hi>happineſs</hi> of God, and what
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35252:43"/>
are the eſſential Ingredients of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That this Title doth belong to God, and that the Divine Nature is perfectly <hi>bleſſed</hi> and <hi>happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. How far Creatures are capable of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and by what Ways and Means they may be made partakers of it: And ſhall then make ſome Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from my Diſcourſe upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I will conſider what we are to underſtand by the <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> or <hi>happineſs</hi> of God, and what are the eſſential In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of it. Now the Notion of <hi>happineſs</hi> taken at its higheſt pitch (as we muſt neceſſarily do when we apply it to God) is no other than a fixt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable ſtate of Contentment and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, of Pleaſure and Delight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the ſecure poſſeſſion, and enjoyment of all that is good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, that is, of all Excellency and Perfection; ſo that theſe following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients muſt go to make up a perfect ſtate of <hi>happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Perfect Knowledge, to underſtand what it is that conſtitutes <hi>happineſs,</hi> and to know when one is really poſſeſt of it. For as he is not <hi>happy,</hi> who is ſo only in Imagination or a Dream, without
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35252:43"/>
any real Foundation in the thing; for he may be pleaſed with his Condition, and yet be far enough from being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>happy</hi>: So on the other hand, he that has all other neceſſary Ingredients of <hi>happineſs,</hi> and only wants this, that he doth not think himſelf ſo, cannot be <hi>happy.</hi> For this we often ſee in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect felicity of this World, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men who have all the Materials and Circumſtances of a worldly <hi>happineſs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, yet by the unskilful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the matter, and from a lightneſs and injudiciouſneſs of Mind, not knowing when they are well, they make an hard ſhift, even when they are in as good Circumſtances as it is almoſt poſſible for Men to be in this World, to be very diſcontented and miſerable in their own Opinions. But God perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows both what makes <hi>happineſs,</hi> and that he is poſſeſt of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To perfect <hi>happineſs</hi> is likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a full Power to do whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to <hi>happineſs,</hi> and likewiſe to check and control whatever would be an hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and diſturbance to it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Being is as happy as it can be, that is not All-ſufficient, and hath not within its Power and Reach whatever
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35252:44"/>
is neceſſary to an happy Condition, and neceſſary to ſecure and continue that <hi>happineſs</hi> againſt all Attempts and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is Wiſdom alſo requir'd to direct this Power, and manage it in ſuch a manner, as it may effectually conduce to this end; and this is very different from meer Power, abſtractedly conſider'd; for one may have all the Materials of <hi>happineſs,</hi> and yet want the Wiſdom and Skill to put them ſo together, as to frame an happy Condition out of them; and he is not happy, who doth not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly underſtand the proper method and means of compaſſing and ſecuring his own <hi>happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Another moſt conſiderable and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Ingredient of <hi>happineſs</hi> is Goodneſs; without which, as there can be no true Majeſty and Greatneſs, ſo neither can there be any <hi>felicity</hi> or <hi>happineſs.</hi> Now Goodneſs is a generous diſpoſition of Mind to communicate and diffuſe it ſelf, by making others partakers of its <hi>happineſs</hi> in ſuch degrees as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, and as Wiſdom ſhall direct: For he is not ſo happy as he may be, who hath not the pleaſure of making o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo, and of ſeeing them put into an
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35252:44"/>
happy Condition by his means, which is the higheſt pleaſure (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>pride,</hi> but I may truly ſay <hi>glory</hi>) of a good and great Mind: For by ſuch Communications of himſelf, an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe and Allſufficient Being doth not leſſen himſelf, or put any thing out of his Power, but doth rather enlarge and magnifie himſelf; and does, as I may ſay, give great Eaſe and Delight to a full and fruitful Being, without the leaſt diminution of his Power or Happineſs. For the Cauſe and Original of all other Beings, can make nothing ſo indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon it ſelf, as not ſtill to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Intereſt in it, to have it always under his Power and Government; and no Being can Rebel againſt his Maker, without extream hazard to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Perfect <hi>happineſs</hi> doth imply the exerciſe of all other Virtues, which are ſuitable to ſo perfect a Being, upon all proper and ſitting occaſions; that is, that ſo perfect a Being do nothing that is contrary to, or unbecoming his Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, his Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, which are eſſential to a perfect Being, and for ſuch a Being to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them in any caſe, would be to create diſquiet and diſturbance to it ſelf:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35252:45"/>
For this is a certain Rule, and never fails, that nothing can act contrary to its own Nature without reluctancy and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which in moral Agents is that which we call <hi>Guilt</hi>; for <hi>Guilt</hi> is nothing elſe but the Trouble and Diſquiet which ariſeth in one's Mind, from the conſciouſneſs of having done ſomething which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the perfective Principles of his Being, that is, ſomething that doth not become him, and which, being what he is, he ought not to have done; which we cannot imagine ever to befall ſo perfect and immutable a Being as God is.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Perfect <hi>happineſs</hi> implies in it the ſettled and ſecure Poſſeſſion of all thoſe Excellencies and Perfections; for if any of theſe were liable to fail, or be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, ſo much would be taken off from perfect and compleat <hi>Happineſs.</hi> If the Deity were ſubject to any change, or impairment of his Condition, ſo that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Knowledge, or Power, or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Goodneſs, or any other Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, could any ways decline or fall off, there would be a proportionable abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>happineſs.</hi> And from all theſe does reſult in the</p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>th,</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> place, Infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35252:45"/>
and Satisfaction, Pleaſure and Delight, which is the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Infinite Contentment and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Condition. And well may <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> be contented with it ſelf; that is, with ſuch a Condition, that he that is poſſeſt of it, can neither deſire it ſhould be better, nor have any cauſe to fear it ſhould be worſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pleaſure and Delight, which is ſomething more than Contentment: For one may be contented with an Affliction and painful Condition, in which he is far from taking any Pleaſure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. <hi>No affliction is joyous for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but grievous,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. But there cannot be perfect <hi>happineſs</hi> without Pleaſure in our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Full Pleaſure is a certain mixture of Love and Joy, hard to be expreſt in Words, but certainly known by inward Senſe and Experience.</p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to you, as well as I could, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our imperfect Conceptions and Expreſſions of God, the <hi>happineſs</hi> of the Divine Nature, and wherein it conſiſts. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing I propoſed, which was to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35252:46"/>
ſhew, that this Attribute of Perfection doth belong to God; and that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is <hi>perfectly Bleſſed and Happy</hi>; and this is ſo univerſal an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Natural Light, that it would be a very ſuperfluous and impertinent Work, to trouble you with particular Citations of Heathen Authors to this purpoſe; nothing being more frequent in them, than to call the Deity, <hi>beatiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam &amp; perfectiſſimam naturam, the moſt happy and moſt perfect Being,</hi> and therefore <hi>happy,</hi> becauſe Felicity doth naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from <hi>Perfection.</hi> It ſhall ſuffice to take notice of theſe <hi>Two</hi> things out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Writers, to my preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they accounted <hi>happineſs</hi> ſo eſſential to the Notion of a God, that this was one of the Ways which they took to find out what Properties were fit to attribute to God, and what not, to conſider what things are conſiſtent with <hi>happineſs,</hi> or inconſiſtent with it; and whatever did ſignifie <hi>happineſs,</hi> and was a perfection conſiſtent with it, they aſcribed to God, as a ſuitable Property of the Divine Nature; and whatever was otherwiſe, they remov'd it from God, as unfit to be ſaid of Him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:35252:46"/>2. Whatever differences there were among the Philoſophers concerning the <hi>Perfections</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> they all agreed in the <hi>perfect felicity</hi> of it; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf, who ſo boldly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſtrip the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> of moſt of its Perfections, by denying that God either made or govern'd the World, whereby he took away at once his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Cauſe and Original of all things, and his Goodneſs likewiſe, and Wiſdom, and Power, and Juſtice; or, at leaſt made all theſe uſeleſs, by taking away all occaſion and opportunity for the exerciſe of them; yet this Man does frequently own, and profeſs to believe the <hi>happineſs</hi> of the Divine Nature; and then out of an ignorant, and officious kindneſs to the Deity, and (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) for the ſecurity of his Felicity, did in effect take away his other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; he would by no means put God to the Trouble and Burden of making the World, or taking care of the Affairs of it, leſt this ſhould diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Deity, or be an interruption or diſturbance of his Eaſe and Felicity. For thus <hi>Lucretius,</hi> the great Diſciple of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> deſcribes his Opinion of the Divine Nature,
<q>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:35252:47"/>
                  <l>Omnis enim divûm, per ſe, natura ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe eſt,</l>
                  <l>Immortali aevo ſummâ cum pace fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur,</l>
                  <l>Semota à noſtris rebus, ſejunctaque longè.</l>
                  <l>Nam privata dolore omni, privata pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclis,</l>
                  <l>Ipſa ſuis pollens opibus, nihil indiga noſtrî.</l>
                  <l>Nec benè pro meritis capitur, nec tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur irâ.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That is, <hi>It is neceſſary that the Divine Nature ſhould be Happy, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unconcern'd in our Affairs; free from all grief and danger, ſufficient for it ſelf, and ſtanding in need of no body, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſed with our Good Actions, nor provoked by our Faults.</hi> This was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry falſe Notion both of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> to imagine that the Care of the World ſhould be a pain and diſturbance to Infinite Knowledge, and Power, and Goodneſs. But this is not now my buſineſs to conſider; that which is to my preſent purpoſe, is, That the <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Divine Nature was Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally owned; and that <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35252:47"/>
ſo inſeparable from the Notion of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that whoever profeſſes to believe a <hi>God,</hi> muſt acknowledge him to be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Teſtimony of Scripture, I have already told you, that there are but two Texts wherein this Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the happy</hi> or <hi>bleſſed,</hi> is given to God; but by conſequence the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every where declares the <hi>happineſs</hi> of the Divine Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> wherever it ſpeaks of the Excellency and Perfection of his Being, of his Knowledge, and Power, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, and Righteouſneſs, and of the Eternity and Unchangeableneſs of theſe, and of the infinite Delight and Complacency which he takes in the Enjoyment of theſe <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> I ſhall now proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. And <hi>laſt</hi> thing, which I propoſed to conſider, <hi>viz.</hi> How far <hi>Creatures</hi> are capable of <hi>happineſs,</hi> and by what ways and means they may be made partakers of it. They are not capable of <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>perfect happineſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>that</hi> reſults from <hi>infinite perfection,</hi> which is no where to be found but in God: It remains then that <hi>Creatures</hi> are only ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being <hi>happy</hi> in a <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> degree, by the reſemblance of <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:35252:48"/>
and by the enjoyment of him; by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like to him, and by our likeneſs to him, being qualified for his favour, and for the enjoyment of him.</p>
            <p>As we are <hi>Creatures</hi> of a <hi>finite Power,</hi> and limited Underſtandings, and a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Nature, we do neceſſarily want many of thoſe <hi>perfections,</hi> which are the Cauſe and Ingredients of a <hi>perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</hi> We are far from being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our own happineſs; we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo of our ſelves, nor can we make our ſelves ſo by our own Power; for neither are we wiſe enough for our own direction, nor good enough for our own ſatisfaction. All the <hi>happineſs</hi> that we are capable of is, by communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him, who is the Original and Fountain of it; by our being made <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine Nature,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks) by our reſemblance of God in thoſe <hi>perfections</hi> which are the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Ingredients of <hi>happineſs,</hi> his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Righteouſneſs, and Truth, and Holineſs; theſe do immediately qualifie us for the Favour and Friendſhip of Almighty God, and for the bleſſed ſight and enjoyment of him; and the Favour of God, and the Light of his Countenance lifted up upon us, and his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35252:48"/>
Friendſhip and Good-Will to us, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies all the defects of Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in us: For God being our Friend, we have an Intereſt in all his <hi>Perfections,</hi> and a Security, that as occaſion requires, they will all be employ'd for our benefit and advantage; ſo that tho' we are <hi>weak in our ſelves,</hi> we are <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> and are <hi>able to do all things through him ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us</hi>; and tho' <hi>we want Wiſdom,</hi> we may have free recourſe to the Fountain of it, and <hi>ask it of God, who gives to all liberally, and upbraideth not.</hi> And it is next to having theſe <hi>perfections</hi> in our ſelves, to know where to have them for asking, whenever we ſtand in need of them, ſo far as is neceſſary to our <hi>happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that tho' our happineſs depend upon another, yet if we be careful to qualifie our ſelves for it, (and God is always ready to aſſiſt us by his Grace to this purpoſe) it is really and in effect in our own power; and we are every whit as ſafe and happy in God's care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of us, as if we were ſufficient for our ſelves. However this is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>happineſs</hi> that the Condition of a <hi>Creature</hi> is capable of, to have all our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35252:49"/>
defects ſupply'd in ſo liberal a manner by the Bounty of another, and to have a free recourſe to the Fountain of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and at laſt to be admitted to the Bleſſed ſight and enjoyment of Him, <hi>in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at whoſe right hand are Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> I have done with the <hi>Three</hi> Things I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>But to what purpoſe, may ſome ſay, is this long Deſcription and Diſcourſe of <hi>happineſs</hi>? How are we the Wiſer and the Better for it? I Anſwer; very much, in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This plainly ſhews us, That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> is a very melancholy and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous thing; it would take away the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>happineſs,</hi> and the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Pattern</hi> of it; it endeavours at once to extinguiſh the Being of God, and all the Life and Comfort of Mankind, ſo that we could neither form any Idea of <hi>happineſs,</hi> or be in any poſſibility of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it. For it is plain, we are not ſufficient for it of our ſelves; and if there be not a God, there is nothing that can make us ſo? God is <hi>the true light of the World,</hi> and a thouſand times more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the comfort and happineſs of Mankind, than the Sun it ſelf, which is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35252:49"/>
but a dark Shadow of that infinitely more bright and glorious Being; <hi>the happy and only Potentate</hi> (as the Apoſtle deſcribes him in the latter end of this Epiſtle) <hi>who only hath immortality, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in that light which no man can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee,</hi> meaning in this mortal ſtate.</p>
            <p>So that the greateſt Enemies, and moſt injurious of all others to Mankind, are thoſe who would baniſh the Belief of a God out of the World; becauſe this is <hi>to lay the Ax to the root of the Tree,</hi> and at one blow to cut off all Hopes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs from Mankind. So that he is <hi>a Fool</hi> indeed, that <hi>ſays in his heart there is no God</hi>; that is, that wiſheth there were none; becauſe it is not poſſible for a Man to wiſh worſe to himſelf, and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to deſtroy his own happineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Divine Nature be ſo <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> and <hi>compleatly happy,</hi> this is a very great confirmation of our Faith and Hope concerning the happineſs of another Life, which the Scripture deſcribes to us, by the Sight and Enjoyment of God. As we are Creatures, we are not capable of the happineſs that is abſolutely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely perfect, becauſe our Nature is but finite, and limited; but <hi>the bleſſed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35252:50"/>
God</hi> who is <hi>infinitely happy</hi> himſelf, can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo make us <hi>happy</hi> according to our <hi>finite</hi> Meaſure and Capacity. For, as he that is the Firſt and Original Being, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Being to other things, ſo He that is the Fountain of Happineſs, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive and convey happineſs to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>And we ſhall the more eaſily believe this, when we conſider that <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> as it is the prime Perfection, ſo is it likewiſe the chief felicity of the Divine Nature. It is his Glory and Delight to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himſelf, and ſhed abroad his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the higheſt expreſſion of the <hi>Divine Goodneſs,</hi> is to communicate happineſs to his Creatures, and to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that they ſhould ſhare and partake with him in it. Baſe and Envious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are narrow and contracted, and love to confine their Enjoyments and good Things to themſelves, and are loth that others ſhould take part with them; but the moſt Noble and moſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Minds are moſt free and enlarged, and cannot be happy themſelves unleſs they find or make others ſo.</p>
            <p>This is the higheſt pitch of Goodneſs, and conſequently the higheſt Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſupream delight of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35252:50"/>
Divine Nature. Now it is natural to every Being, to be moſt frequent and abundant in thoſe Acts in which it finds the greateſt Pleaſure; <hi>to be good,</hi> and <hi>to do good</hi> is the ſupream Felicity of God himſelf; therefore we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe, that he is very ready and forward to make us happy, by all the ways that are agreeable to his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Righteouſneſs; and that He is alſo willing to make us abundantly ſo, and to advance us to the higheſt degree of Felicity, of which our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable, if we do not render our ſelves incapable of ſuch a Bleſſing, by an obſtinate refuſal of it, and utter indiſpoſition for it.</p>
            <p>This, I ſay, is very credible, becauſe the <hi>happineſs</hi> of God himſelf conſiſts in that propenſion and diſpoſition of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which tends to make others <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</hi> And if there can be any acceſſion to that which is <hi>infinite,</hi> God himſelf finds a new Pleaſure and Felicity in the communication of his goodneſs to his Creatures, and therefore is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Scripture, as glad of <hi>the Converſion of a ſinner,</hi> becauſe the ſinner hereby becomes capable of the happineſs which God deſign'd for his Creatures,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35252:51"/>
and is always ready to confer upon them, whenever they are qualified for it, and he can, with the Honour of his other Perfections, beſtow it upon them.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Two</hi> things which raiſe our Hopes and expectation of Good from any Perſon; if he be <hi>Able</hi> and <hi>Willing</hi> to beſtow upon us what we hope for from him. Now if any one can confer <hi>Happineſs</hi> upon us, it is He who is <hi>infinitely</hi> poſſeſt of it, and hath all the Treaſures of it in himſelf; and <hi>that</hi> God only is; who, as he is <hi>able,</hi> ſo is <hi>willing</hi> to make us happy, if we be qualified for it; and it is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of his happineſs to make others happy; for even that Goodneſs which inclines him to communicate happineſs to others, is a great part of his own Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; ſo that, as our Saviour argues, <hi>becauſe I live, you ſhall live alſo</hi>; we may reaſon in like manner, that <hi>becauſe God is happy, we ſhall be happy alſo,</hi> if we do but ſincerely deſire and endeavour to qualifie our ſelves for it. The Goodneſs of God does ſtrongly incline him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our happineſs, and makes him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ready to beſtow it upon us, when ever we are capable to receive it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:35252:51"/>So that the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God is the great Foundation of all our Hopes, and the firmeſt ground of our aſſurance of a Bleſſed Immortality. It is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Divine Nature to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himſelf; and the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God's Goodneſs to us are the cauſe of our happineſs; and therefore, both for our Example and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be repreſented to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Advantage, and we ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to poſſeſs our Minds with a firm Belief and Perſwaſion of it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the Divine Nature (which we all acknowledge to have infinitely more goodneſs than is to be found in any of the Sons of Men) whatever we would not attribute to a good Man, and to vindicate God from all ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Envy and Ill-will, of Cruelty and Arbitrary dealing with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And I cannot apprehend why Men ſhould be averſe from theſe ſo agreeable and delightful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God; or how it ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man's Intereſt to leſſen the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of God; for moſt certainly the better God is in himſelf, the better
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35252:52"/>
and happier it will be for us all, if it be not our own fault.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From what hath been ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>happineſs</hi> of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> we may learn wherein <hi>our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> muſt conſiſt, namely, in the <hi>Image</hi> and in the <hi>Favour</hi> of God; in the <hi>Favour</hi> of God as the Cauſe of of our happineſs; and in the <hi>Image</hi> of God, as a neceſſary inward diſpoſition and qualification for it. Unleſs God love us, we cannot be <hi>happy,</hi> for miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable are they whom he hates; for God to ſay of any Man, that <hi>his Soul hath no pleaſure in him,</hi> imports as great Miſery, and as dreadful a Curſe as can be imagin'd, and <hi>his Soul</hi> can <hi>have no pleaſure</hi> in a bad Man; for <hi>he loveth Righteouſneſs and hateth Iniquity, he is not a God that hath pleaſure in Wickedneſs, neither ſhall Evil dwell with him; the Wicked ſhall not ſtand in his ſight; he hateth all the workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Nay, if we could ſuppoſe that he could love and take pleaſure in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſon that is unlike to him (which is impoſſible) yet that Perſon could not be <hi>happy,</hi> becauſe he would want that inward Frame and Diſpoſition of Mind, which is neceſſary to <hi>happineſs.</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:35252:52"/>
For the very ſame Cauſes and Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients which make up <hi>the happineſs of God,</hi> muſt in an inferior degree be found in us, otherwiſe we cannot be <hi>happy</hi>; no, tho' a Man were in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if he be ſtill a bad Man, <hi>Coelum, non animum mutavit,</hi> he hath only <hi>changed the Climate,</hi> and is gone into another <hi>Countrey,</hi> but he bears <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> ſtill about him, and his <hi>Mind</hi> is not changed, which would ſignifie a thouſand times more to his <hi>happineſs,</hi> than any <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>outward Circumſtance</hi> whatſoever. A bad Man, whereſoever he goes, hath <hi>a Root of Gall and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs</hi> within him, and is miſerable from <hi>himſelf</hi>; he hath a Fiend in his own Breaſt, and the Fuel of Hell in a guilty Conſcience.</p>
            <p>For there is a certain Temper and Diſpoſition of Mind, that is neceſſary and eſſential to <hi>happineſs,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> is <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> which is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God; and ſo much as any Perſon departs from this Temper, ſo far he removes himſelf, and runs away from <hi>happineſs</hi>: And as Sin is <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from God,</hi> ſo the Puniſhment of it is likewiſe expreſt by <hi>departing from him; Depart from me ye Curſed; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35252:53"/>
from me all ye that work Iniquity, I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is one great part of the Miſery of thoſe degenerate and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Spirits, the Devils, who are for ever baniſh'd from the Preſence of God, that they are of a Temper quite contrary to God, Wicked and Impure, Envious and Malicious, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and Cruel; and ſuch a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is naturally a torment and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et to it ſelf. And here the Foundation of Hell is laid in the evil diſpoſition of our Minds; and 'till this be cur'd, and ſet right, it is as impoſſible for any of us to be <hi>happy,</hi> as it is for a Limb that is out of joint to be at eaſe. And the external preſence of God, and a <hi>local</hi> Heaven (if we could imagine ſuch a Perſon to be admitted into it, and ſee all the Glories of that place, and the Pleaſures and Delights of that ſtate) all this, I ſay, would ſignifie no more to make a bad Man <hi>happy,</hi> than heaps of Gold and Diamonds, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts of the moſt delicious Muſick, and a well-ſpread Table, and a rich and coſtly Bed would contribute to a Man's Eaſe in the paroxyſme of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

            </p>
            <p>I have been ſo long upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, on purpoſe to convince Men of the Neceſſity of Holineſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all other Virtues, to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future <hi>happineſs.</hi> They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the nature of <hi>happineſs,</hi> who hope for it, or imagin they can attain it in any other way. The Author and the Fountain of <hi>happineſs,</hi> he that made us, and alone can make us <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> cannot make us ſo in any other way, than by planting in us ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Mind, as is in Truth <hi>a participation of the Divine Nature,</hi> and by endowing us with ſuch Qualities as are the neceſſary Materials and Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of <hi>happineſs.</hi> There is no way to partake of the <hi>Felicity</hi> of <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> but by becoming Holy and Righteous, Good and Merciful as he is.</p>
            <p>All Men naturally deſire <hi>happineſs,</hi> and ſeek after it, and are as they think travelling towards it, but generally they miſtake their way. Many are eager in the purſuit of the Things of this World, and greedily catch at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35252:54"/>
and Riches and Honour, as if <hi>theſe</hi> could make them <hi>happy</hi>; but when they come to embrace them, they find that they are but Clouds and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and that there is no real and ſubſtantial <hi>felicity</hi> in them. <hi>Many ſay, who will ſhew us any good?</hi> meaning the good things of this World, <hi>Corn, and Wine, and Oil</hi>; But wouldſt thou be <hi>happy</hi> indeed? endeavour to be like the <hi>Pattern</hi> of <hi>happineſs,</hi> and the <hi>Fountain</hi> of it; Addreſs thy ſelf to him in the Prayer of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Lord lift thou up upon me the light of thy Countenance, and that ſhall put more joy and gladneſs into my heart,</hi> than the Men of the World can have, <hi>when their Corn and their Wine increaſeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many ſay, <hi>lo here,</hi> and <hi>lo there</hi>! That <hi>happineſs</hi> is in a great Place, or in a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Eſtate, or in the enjoyment of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſures and Delights; but <hi>believe them not; happineſs</hi> is ſomething that is nearer and more intimate to us, than any of the Things of this World; it is <hi>within thee, in thine heart,</hi> and in the very inward frame and diſpoſition of thy mind.</p>
            <p>In a Word, if ever we would be <hi>happy,</hi> we muſt be <hi>like the Bleſſed God,</hi> we
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35252:55"/>
muſt be <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>merciful,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>juſt, as he is,</hi> and then we are ſecure of his Favour; for <hi>the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, and his countenance will behold the upright.</hi> Then we ſhall be qualified for the enjoyment of him, and take pleaſure in communion with him, becauſe we ſhall be like him. For the ſureſt foundation of Love and Friendſhip is a ſimilitude of Temper and Diſpoſition; every thing naturally affects its own likeneſs, and moves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and greedily catcheth at it, and gladly runs into the Embraces of it. God and Man muſt be like one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, before they can take pleaſure in one another: If we be unlike to God, it is in the nature of the thing impoſſible that we ſhould be <hi>happy</hi> in one another, and therefore there muſt be a change either in God or us, to bring about this likeneſs. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is inflexible, fixt, and unchangeable; therefore change thy ſelf Sinner, and endeavour to be like God; for ſince he cannot depart from his Holineſs, and Purity, thou muſt leave thy Sins, and <hi>be holy as he is holy,</hi> if ever thou hopeſt to be <hi>happy,</hi>

            <p>THE connexion and dependance of theſe Words upon the former is briefly this; the Apoſtle had aſſerted before, that God is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Sin and Evil, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Let no Man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God is untemptable by evil, neither tempteth he any Man: but every Man is tempted, when he is drawn aſide of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35252:57"/>
his own luſt, and enticed</hi>; and here in the Text he aſſerts, that God is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Author of all Good; <hi>do not err, my beloved Brethren</hi>; as if he had ſaid, do not miſtake me, tho' Sin and Evil be not from God, but from our ſelves, and our own corrupt hearts; yet all good is from God, and not from our ſelves: tho' we be the Authors of the ſins we commit; yet we are not ſo of the good that we do, <hi>that</hi> is from God; <hi>every good Gift, and every perfect Gift is from above, and cometh down from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights.</hi> Sin which is nothing but Evil and Imperfection, is not from God, but wholly from our ſelves; but whatever is good and perfect, is not from our ſelves, but from God; we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclined to that which is good, nor are able of our ſelves to perform it; both the inclination and the power are from God, who is the Fountain of goodneſs and perfection, and can never be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and can never change nor ceaſe to be ſo, <hi>for with him is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning.</hi>

               </gap> is a word which belongs not to the daily, but to the yearly courſe of the Sun, which is nearer to us, or farther from us, as he approacheth nearer towards the Northern or Southern Tropicks;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35252:58"/>
and hence it is that it caſts ſeveral ſhadows to People in ſeveral Countries; and agreeably to this, the Word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But God is an Eternal Spring of Light, which never riſeth or ſets, which hath no mixture of ſhadow nor darkneſs, hath no changes nor varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but is always the ſame free and liberal diſpenſer of good things to his Creatures; <hi>the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; which Words ſignifie <hi>the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfection and goodneſs of the Divine Nature,</hi> which ſhall (by Gods aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) be the ſubject of my preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; In which I ſhall proceed in this Method.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall briefly explain what is meant by the <hi>immutability,</hi> or <hi>unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs,</hi> of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew that this is a perfection eſſential to God, to be <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably</hi> what he is, that is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall anſwer an Objection which lies againſt it, from the mention
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35252:58"/>
ſo often made in Scripture of <hi>God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting himſelf.</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Apply the Conſideration of it to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the Explication of it. By the <hi>immutability</hi> of God, we mean that he always is, and was, and to all Eternity will be the ſame, that he undergoes no changes either of his Eſſence and Being, or of his Properties and Perfections. In reference to the <hi>unchangeableneſs</hi> of his <hi>being,</hi> he is ſaid to be <hi>eternal, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and only to have immortality.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his <hi>perfections,</hi> he is always the ſame infinitely Wiſe, and Good, and Powerful, and Holy, and juſt Being; from whence it follows, that he is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Immutable in all his Decrees and Counſels, his Purpoſes and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. We are uncertain and mutable in in our very Nature and Beings, and in all thoſe Qualities and Perfections which belong to us, in all our Purpoſes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and Actions; we are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally growing or decreaſing in this or that quality, and do frequently change from one extream to another, from that which is more perfect to the contrary, now knowing, and then ignorant, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wiſe, and oftner fooliſh, ſtronger
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35252:59"/>
and weaker, better or worſe, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and as we order our ſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually waxing or waining in our Knowledge, and Wiſdom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Power; we frequently change our Minds, and alter our Purpoſes, and break our Promiſes, and contradict our firmeſt and moſt ſerious Reſolutions, and ſpeak a thing and do it not, ſay it and do not bring it to paſs; but God is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly the ſame in all his Perfections, conſtant to his Intentions, ſteady to his Purpoſe, immutably fixt and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in all his Decrees and Reſolutions. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing I propoſed, namely, To ſhew that this <hi>Perfection</hi> is eſſential to God, to be <hi>unchangeably</hi> what he is. And this I ſhall endeavour to make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt both from Natural Reaſon, and from the Divine Revelation of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Dictates of natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which tells us, that nothing Argues greater weakneſs and imperfection than Inconſtancy and Change. This is the great Vanity of all Creatures, that they are uncertain, and do not long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in one ſtate; this is the vanity of the World in general, that <hi>the faſhion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35252:59"/>
of it paſſeth away</hi>; and of Man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that he is liable to ſo many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral changes, by Age, and Diſeaſes, and Death, for which Reaſon he is ſaid by the Pſalmiſt, to be <hi>in his beſt eſtate alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity</hi>; and that he is liable to ſo many moral changes, to be deluded and deceived in his Underſtanding, and to alter his Opinion ſo often, to be ſo fickle in his Will, and to change ſo often his Purpoſes and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the alteration or appearance of things. We attribute Change and Inconſtancy to Perſons of the weakeſt Age and Underſtanding, as Children, who are liable <hi>to be toſt to and fro, and carried about with every wind,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>Now if the Divine Nature were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to change, this would caſt an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Cloud upon all the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and obſcure all other Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and make them <hi>like the flower of the field,</hi> which, how gay and glorious ſoever, is fading and periſhing; and the greater the Divine Perfections are, the greater Imperfection would mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be; for as <hi>the corruption of the beſt things is the worſt,</hi> ſo the better any thing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35252:60"/>
is, ſo much the worſe it would be to have it liable to Corruption and Change.</p>
            <p>And as mutability in God would darken all his other Perfections, ſo would it take away the Foundation and comfort of all Religion; the ground of our Faith, and Hope, and Fear, of our Love and Eſteem of God would be quite taken away. We could have no great Honour or Eſteem for a Being that is fickle and inconſtant; if his Power and Juſtice were uncertain, his Threatings would in a great meaſure loſe their awe and force; if his Truth and Faithfulneſs could fail, no Promiſes and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how gracious ſoever, would be any ſecurity or firm ground of Truſt and Confidence.</p>
            <p>And this Reaſoning is not the reſult of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> but clearly founded in the <hi>natural</hi> Notions and Suggeſtions of our Minds, as will appear by citing one or two Teſtimonies to this burpoſe, of thoſe who had no other Guide but Natural Light. <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phoedo</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
<q>Whether the moſt perfect (that is God) be always the ſame, or ſometimes thus, and ſometimes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that is (ſaith he) whether that which is Equality and Goodneſs and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35252:60"/>
Bounty it ſelf, receives any the leaſt Change at any time, and be not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Uniform, and of it ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in any wiſe upon, any account, ſubject to any Change or Alteration whatſoever? To which he anſwers, That it is neceſſary that he ſhould be the ſame and always alike.</q>
And <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Repub.</hi> where he lays down the Fundamental Laws and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion, he mentions theſe <hi>two</hi> (which one would almoſt think he borrow'd from St. <hi>James,</hi> but that he lived ſo long before him) <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt,
<q>That God is the Cauſe of all good, and and in no wiſe of any evil;</q>
anſwerab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to what our Apoſtle here aſſerts, that <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any Man: but that every good and perfect gift is from him.</hi>
Secondly,
<q>That God doth not deceive us, by making various Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of himſelf to us, ſometimes in one form, and ſometimes in another; for he is unchangeable and always the ſame, and cannot, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, paſs out of his own Idea, or be any other than what he is;</q>
which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35252:61"/>
he further confirms by this excellent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
<q>That which is the beſt and moſt perfect Being is not liable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Alteration; but ſuch a Being is God, and therefore he cannot be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any thing that is weaker and leſs perfect than himſelf, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not will to change himſelf; for if he ſhould, it muſt either be for the better or for the worſe; it cannot be for the better, for being already poſſeſt of all Perfection, there can be no acceſſion of any to him by any change; and certainly there is no Wiſe Being, as God is, that will change for the worſe,</q>
and therefore he concludes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<q>That being the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and beſt Being that is poſſible, he always continues ſimply the ſame.</q>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> likewiſe ſpeaking of the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of God's Counſels (<hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>de Benef.) Statuerunt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>quae non mutarent, neque unquam primi conſilii Deos poenitet,</hi>
               <q>The Gods make unchangeable decrees, and never repent them of their firſt counſel.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This will yet more clearly appear from the Divine Revelation of the Holy Scriptures, which tell us that God
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35252:61"/>
is <hi>unchangeable</hi> in his Nature and in his Perfections, in all his Decrees and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and Promiſes. In his <hi>eſſence</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> Exod. 3.14. <hi>I am that I am,</hi> this is his Name, whereby he made known himſelf to the comfort of his People, and to the terrour of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.2. <hi>From everlaſting to everlaſting thou art God.</hi> Pſal. 102.27. <hi>Thou art the ſame, and thy years fail not.</hi> Mat. 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord and change not.</hi> Hence it is that the Title of <hi>the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God</hi> is ſo frequently attributed to him; and he ſwears by this, as denoting not only his <hi>eternity,</hi> but his <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs; As I live, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Hither likewiſe we may refer thoſe Texts where he is call'd the <hi>incorruptible God,</hi> Rom. 1.23; <hi>The immortal King,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17; and is ſaid <hi>only to have immortality,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16. And he is immutable likewiſe in his <hi>perfections</hi>; hence it is ſo often ſaid in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> that <hi>his goodneſs</hi> and <hi>his mercy endure for ever; his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> likewiſe is ſaid <hi>to endure for ever.</hi> Pſal. 111.3. and Pſal. 36.6; <hi>To be like the great Mountains,</hi> not only <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>conſpicuous,</hi> but <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>immoveable</hi>; and the ſame likewiſe is ſaid of his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> Pſal. 117.2. <hi>His truth

            <p>And ſo likewiſe in his <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> Pſal. 33.11. <hi>The counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations</hi>; Eſa. 14.24. <hi>Surely as I have thought, ſo ſhall it come to paſs, and as I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſo ſhall it ſtand.</hi> Numb. 23.19. <hi>God is not a Man that he ſhould lie, or as the Son of Man that he ſhould repent; hath he ſpoken, and ſhall not he do it? hath he ſaid it, and ſhall not he bring it to paſs?</hi> If he hath made any promiſe, or entred into any Covenant with us, it is <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>immutable,</hi> Pſal. 89.33. <hi>He will not ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail, his covenant will he not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his lips.</hi> His Covenant and his Promiſe are in themſelves immutable; but for our further aſſurance, God hath given us his Oath, the higheſt ſign of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability; ſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> tells us, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.18. <hi>That by two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, (viz</hi> his Promiſe and his Oath) <hi>in which it is impoſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong conſolation, who are fled for refuge to the hope which is ſet before us.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:35252:62"/>III. Thing I propoſed, which is to anſwer an Objection, which may ſeem to lie againſt what hath been ſaid, from the mention ſo often made in Scripture of <hi>God's repenting himſelf</hi>; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. where it is ſaid that <hi>it repented God that he had made Man</hi>; 1 Sam. 15.11. That <hi>he repented that he had made Saul King</hi>; and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16. When <hi>the Angel had ſtretched out his hand over Jeruſalem to deſtroy it,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>the Lord repented him of the evil</hi>; and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.14. the Lord ſaith there that <hi>he will repent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerning his ſervants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I anſwer, That this expreſſion of <hi>God's repenting</hi> we are to underſtand (as many others in Scripture) after the manner of Men, and as ſpoken by way of Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Accommodation to our Weakneſs and Capacity, and not as caſting any imputation of Mutability and Inconſtancy upon God, as if out of levity or for want of foreſight, he did alter his Mind; but when God is ſaid <hi>to repent that he made Man,</hi> or <hi>that he made Saul King,</hi> the change was not in <hi>him,</hi> but <hi>them</hi>; and it ſignifies not that God was abſolutely deceived in his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that things had fallen out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35252:63"/>
to all reaſonable Expectation; and therefore the Scripture cloaths God with the Humane Paſſion of <hi>repenting</hi> and <hi>grieving</hi> for what he had done, as Men uſe to do when they are greatly diſappointed and fall ſhort of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
            <p>And as for the other inſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is ſaid <hi>to repent him of evils threatned,</hi> the expreſſion only ſignifies thus much, that God doth not execute that which ſeemed to us to have been his peremptory purpoſe and reſolution, that is, he is pleaſed to do otherwiſe than his threatning ſeemed openly to expreſs, becauſe of ſome tacit Condition implyed in it, which he did not think fit to acquaint us with. And this doth not at all derogate from the <hi>conſtancy</hi> and <hi>immutability</hi> of God; for when God did threaten, he ſpake what he did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purpoſe and intend, if ſomething did not intervene to prevent the Judgment threatned, upon which he was reſolved at that time when he threatned, to be taken off and to ſtay his Hand; and in thus doing, God doth not <hi>mutare conſilium ſed ſententiam; He doth not change his inward Counſel and Purpoſe, but takes off the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> which was paſt with <hi>reſerved
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35252:63"/>
conditions</hi> and <hi>unknown to us,</hi> on purpoſe to urge us the more effectually to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>And that God uſually reſerves ſuch Conditions, not only in his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but ſometimes alſo in his Promiſes, appears from that remarkable Text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it; if that nation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom I have pronounced, turn from the evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them: at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; if it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I ſaid I would benefit them.</hi> And from this very Conſideration the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet encourageth the People to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God, and the Lord will repent him of the evil he hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt you.</hi> And we have a famous inſtance of this in the caſe of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> the deſtruction whereof within forty days after, God had openly proclaimed by his Prophet; yet he ſtops the Execution
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35252:64"/>
of the Sentence upon their Repentance, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.10. <hi>The Men of Niniveh turned from their evil ways, and the Lord repented of the evil he ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that now remains is to apply this Doctrine of the <hi>immutability of the Divine Nature</hi> to our ſelves; and the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it may ſerve to ſeveral good Purpoſes, both in reference to bad and good Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In regard to ſinners and wicked Men.</p>
            <p>And, 1<hi>ſt. The unchangeableneſs of God</hi> is matter of great terrour to wicked Men. Let but the ſinner conſider what God is, and the conſideration of his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable nature</hi> muſt need terrifie him; <hi>He is a holy God, and of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.12. <hi>He is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him, the fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight, he hateth all the workers of iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 5.4, 5. <hi>He is</hi> likewiſe <hi>a juſt God, and will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> nor <hi>let ſin go unpuniſht,</hi> Exod. 34.7. <hi>He is</hi> alſo <hi>omnipotent,</hi> and able to execute the vengeance threatned againſt Sinners. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger</hi>? Pſal. 90.11. <hi>Thou even thou art to be feared, and who may ſtand in <pb n="113" facs="tcp:35252:64"/>
thy ſight when once thou art angry.</hi> Pſal. 76.7. <hi>Strong is the Lord God who judgeth.</hi> Rev. 18.8. And which gives a ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to all this, he that is thus holy and juſt and powerful, continues <hi>for ever the ſame,</hi> and will never alter or put off any of theſe Properties, will never ceaſe to hate iniquity, and to be an implacable Enemy to all impenitent Sinners; and is it not <hi>a fearful thing to fall into the hands of</hi> this holy and juſt and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent <hi>God who lives for ever,</hi> and can <hi>puniſh for ever</hi>? Let all obſtinate Sinners hear this and tremble; you cannot be more obſtinately bent to continue in your wicked ways, than God is perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily reſolved to make you miſerable. If you be determined upon a ſinful courſe; God is alſo determined how he will deal with you, that <hi>he will not ſpare,</hi> but <hi>that his anger and jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt you,</hi> and that <hi>all the curſes that are written in his book ſhall light upon you,</hi> and that <hi>he will blot out your name from under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he hath ſworn in his wrath, that</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and impenitent Sinners <hi>ſhall not enter into his reſt</hi>; and for the greater aſſurance of the thing, and that we may not think, that there is any condition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in theſe Threatnings, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35252:65"/>
them by <hi>an Oath,</hi> that by this <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> ſign, <hi>in which it is impoſſible for God to lie,</hi> Sinners might have <hi>ſtrong terrours,</hi> and not be able <hi>to fly</hi> to any in hopes of <hi>refuge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> The conſideration of Gods <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs,</hi> ſhould likewiſe be a very powerful Argument to urge Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Repententance. If they will but leave their ſins and turn to him, they will find him ready to receive them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Repentance and Submiſſion; for <hi>he is a God gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger and ready to forgive,</hi> he is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably good,</hi> and <hi>his mercy endureth for ever</hi>: but if they will not come in, and ſubmit to theſe Terms, there is nothing before them but Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, nothing then <hi>remains but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation to conſume them.</hi> God hath declared to us the terms of our Pardon and Peace, and if we will not come up to them, he is at a point, he cannot change his Nature, nor will he alter the terms of his Covenant; there is a perfect and eternal oppoſition between the Holy Nature of God, and an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinner; and 'tis impoſſible ſuch an one ſhould be Happy, till this oppoſition be remov'd; and to do that, there are but <hi>two</hi> ways imaginable, by <hi>changing God</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:35252:65"/>
or by <hi>changing our ſelves</hi>; the Nature of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>unalterable</hi>; God cannot recede from his own pure Nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>we</hi> muſt depart from our ſinful and corrupt Nature: God cannot quit his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; therefore we muſt leave our Sins: we can have no hope <hi>to change God</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt <hi>change our ſelves.</hi> Rectifie Sinner thine own corrupt Nature, and renounce thy luſts, do not venture upon Impoſſibilities, rather think of altering <hi>thy ſinful nature,</hi> which <hi>may be changed,</hi> than of altering <hi>the Divine Nature,</hi> which is <hi>eſſentially immutable, with whom is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning.</hi> God hath once condeſcended ſo far, as <hi>to take our nature upon him,</hi> to make us capable of Happineſs; but if this will not do, he can go no lower, he will not, he cannot <hi>put off his own nature</hi> to make us Happy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In reference to Good Men, the conſideration of Gods <hi>unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is matter of great Conſolation to them, in all the changes and viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the World; their main com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and hope is built upon a Rock, <hi>the rock of ages,</hi> as the expreſſion is in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 26.4. it relies upon the <hi>unchangeable</hi> goodneſs and faithfulneſs of God, <hi>all whoſe promiſes are Yea and Amen</hi> truth and certainty. All other Support,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35252:66"/>
and Hopes may fail us: but <hi>God will not ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail, his covenant will he not break, nor alter the thing which is gone out of his lips,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt aſſures us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.33. Men may break their Word, and be leſs than their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: but <hi>God is faithful, who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give grace and glory, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold no good thing from them that walk uprightly; he is not as Man, that he ſhould lie, or as the Son of Man that he ſhould repent; hath he ſpoken and ſhall he not do it? hath he ſaid it, and ſhall not he bring it to paſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any thing that hath the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a change in God, it is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the <hi>merciful</hi> ſide, as when he ſtops the execution of his threatnings upon the repentance of a ſinful Nation; as in that remarkable Text which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd before, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8. <hi>At what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it, if that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them</hi>; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when his faithful People and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are in great Diſtreſs, and there is no viſible help and means of relief, in this caſe likewiſe God is ſaid <hi>to repent</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:35252:66"/>
and to appear for their reſcue, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36. <hi>The Lord ſhall judge his people, and repent himſelf for his ſervants, when he ſeeth that their power is gone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſhould comfort our ſelves in the greateſt extremities, with the conſideration of the <hi>immutable</hi> goodneſs and faithfulneſs of God. The things of the World are Mutable, and the Men of the World; even thoſe things which ſeem moſt conſtant, as the Heavens; and to be ſetled upon the ſureſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, as the Earth; yet theſe ſhall be changed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.25, 26, 27. <hi>Of old haſt thou laid the foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thy hands, they ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure, all of them ſhall wax old like a garment, as a veſture ſhall thou change them, and they ſhalt be changed, but thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall have no end</hi>; from whence the Pſalmiſt infers this comfort to the Church and People of God, <hi>v.</hi> 28, <hi>The Children of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhall continue, and their ſeed ſhall be eſtabliſht before thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing that is mutable can be a ſolid Foundation of Comfort and Confidence. Men are inconſtant, and Riches are uncertain, and all other things which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35252:67"/>
Men commonly truſt to, and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>chargeth them that are Rich in this World, not to truſt in uncertain Riches, but in the living God.</hi> He only that <hi>lives for ever</hi> is a firm Foundation of Hope and Confidence.</p>
            <p>When God would comfort the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> under their great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, he bids <hi>Moſes</hi> only to declare to them his <hi>immutability, Exod.</hi> 3.14. Say unto them, <hi>I am that I am, hath ſent me unto you</hi>; and this is the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Chriſtians, that <hi>he</hi> who is <hi>the ſame Saviour,</hi> and <hi>their hope,</hi> is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever; he that was, and that is, and that is to come,</hi> in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations the ſame.</p>
            <p>We are continually changing, and are not the ſame we were; ſome of us were Young and now are Old; once perhaps flouriſht in great Proſperity, but now are Poor and Needy; were once Strong and Healthful, but now Sickly and Weak; it ſhould comfort us in all theſe Changes, that <hi>God is ſtill the ſame,</hi> and he alone is inſtead of all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Supports, when all other things fail, we may <hi>rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of our Salvation.</hi> Youth, and Health, and Riches, and Friends,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35252:67"/>
may forſake us; but God hath promiſed, that <hi>he will never leave us nor forſake us</hi>; that <hi>he will not leave us when we are old, nor forſake us when our ſtrength faileth,</hi> when <hi>our ſtrength fails,</hi> and <hi>our heart fails,</hi> then is he <hi>the ſtrength of our hearts,</hi> and <hi>our portion for ever</hi>; and when our great change ſhall come, and the terrors of Death ſhall take hold of us, we have ſtill the ſame Comfort, <hi>the Lord liveth, and bleſſed be the God of our Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, the Conſideration of God's <hi>immutability</hi> ſhould keep us fixt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in all the Changes and Accidents of this World, and not apt to be ſtartled and ſurprized at them, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>he ſhall not be afraid of evil tidings, becauſe his heart is fixed, truſting in God.</hi> This ſhould make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to him and his truth, <hi>ſtedfaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable and always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as we know, that our labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord</hi>; it ſhould make us <hi>hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering,</hi> in full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that <hi>God will be as good to us as his word,</hi> and in a firm <hi>hope</hi> and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of that Eternal Life, which God that cannot lie hath promiſed.</hi>

            <p>I Come now to ſpeak of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Perfections which relate to the Divine Underſtanding, and Will, and Manner, and Power of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Knowledge</hi> conſiders things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and in themſelves; <hi>Wiſdom</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the reſpects and relations of things one to another, and under the Notion of Means and Ends. The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God is a perfect comprehenſion of the Nature of all things, with all their Powers, and Qualities, and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God is a perfect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35252:69"/>
of the Reſpects and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things one to another; of their Harmony and Oppoſition; of their fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unfitneſs to ſuch and ſuch Ends. The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his bare Underſtanding of Things; but his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> implies the Skill of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and diſpoſing things to the beſt Ends and Purpoſes, to make every thing, and to govern and adminiſter all things in Number, Weight, and Meaſure. I ſhall, at preſent ſpeak of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God, which, as I ſaid, is a perfect Comprehenſion of the Nature of all things, and of every thing belonging to their Nature; of the Powers, and Qualities, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things.</p>
            <p>Theſe Words ſignifie God to be <hi>the Fountain of Knowledge</hi>; that is, that he poſſeſſeth it himſelf, and communicates it to others. In the handling of this, I ſhall</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Endeavour to prove, that this Attribute belongs to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Shew the Perfection and the Prerogatives of the Divine <hi>Knowledge.</hi>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Draw ſome practical Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:35252:69"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the proof of it, I ſhall attempt it <hi>two</hi> ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the Dictates of Natural Light and Reaſon.</item>
               <item>2. From Scripture or Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. From the Dictates of Natural Light and Reaſon. I begin with this firſt, becauſe, unleſs this be eſtabliſh'd, all Divine Revelation falls to the ground; unleſs Natural Reaſon aſſures us, That God is endowed with <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> it is in vain to enquire after Divine Revelation. For to make any Revelation credible, two things are requiſite on the part of the Revealer, <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi>; that he have a perfect <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the thing which he reveals, ſo that he cannot be deceived himſelf; and ſo much Goodneſs and Truth that he will not deceive us. Now unleſs our Reaſon aſſure us that God is endowed with <hi>Knowledg and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> Condition is evidently wanting, <hi>viz. Ability,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>ſecond, Integrity</hi>; for there cannot be goodneſs and veracity without <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being premiſed, I proceed to the proof of it from ſuch Arguments as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35252:70"/>
our Natural Reaſon ſuggeſts to us. I have formerly told you, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Perfections</hi> are not to be proved by way of <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> but by way of <hi>Conviction,</hi> by ſhewing the Abſurdities and Inconveniencies of the contrary; for if we deny Knowledge to God, we muſt deny it to be a Perfection; we muſt deny it to be in any of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; we muſt attribute many other Imperfections to God; all which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to our Natural Reaſon; for Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon dictates to us, That Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a Perfection, that it is to be found in the Creatures, and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it to God will argue many other Imperfections in the Divine Nature; now theſe are ſo many Arguments which Natural Reaſon offers to us to prove, that <hi>knowledge belongs to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a Perfection, and therefore belongs to God. Natural Reaſon tells us, tho' the Scripture had not ſaid it, That <hi>Knowledge excells Ignorance, as much as Light doth Darkneſs</hi>; now whatever is <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Excellent,</hi> is to be attributed to the Divine Nature, for this is the <hi>firſt</hi> Notion we have of God, That He is <hi>a Being abſolutely Perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:35252:70"/>2. Knowledge is to be found in ſome of the Creatures, and therefore is much more in God the Creator, becauſe it is derived from him. Our very Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings whereby we know God, or any thing elſe, are an Argument that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>

The Scripture indeed uſeth this Argument, but I mention it as that which Natural Reaſon doth ſuggeſt to the moſt brutiſh and ignorant of Men. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.8, 9, 10. <hi>

            <p n="3">3. The denyal of this <hi>Perfection</hi> to God, argues many other Imperfections in the Divine Nature. Nothing would more eclipſe the Divine Nature, than to take away this <hi>Perfection</hi> from it; this would bring an univerſal Obſcurity upon God's other Perfections; this would be to put out the Light of Heaven, and to turn <hi>the brightneſs of the morning</hi> into the <hi>ſhadow of death.</hi> If we remove this
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35252:71"/>
               <hi>Perfection</hi> from God, we deny his <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> He that does not know the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Qualities of Things, cannot know how to apply Means to Ends, to fit or ſute one thing to another: And we weaken his <hi>Power.</hi> What an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ineffectual thing would <hi>Power</hi> be without <hi>Knowledge?</hi> what irregular things would it produce? what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward Combinations of Effects would there be, if <hi>infinite Power</hi> were let looſe to act without the Conduct of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding?</hi> And conſequently we take away his <hi>Providence</hi>; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Knowledge</hi> there can be no Counſel, no fore-caſt of Events, no proviſion for the future, no Government of the World. And this is not all, for without <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> there could be no ſuch thing as <hi>Goodneſs</hi>; for he is not good that does good out of Ignorance, or from a blind Neceſſity. There could be no <hi>Veracity,</hi> nor <hi>Juſtice,</hi> nor <hi>Mercy</hi> in God; for all theſe ſuppoſe <hi>Knowledge.</hi> He that ſpeaks Truth muſt know it; he that is Juſt muſt underſtand right from wrong; he that ſhews Mercy, muſt know who are miſerable, and how they may be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and not to labour in a thing ſo plain and caſie, take away the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:35252:71"/>
of God, and you render him inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any <hi>Honour</hi> from his Creatures; for if he know not what Honour we do him, it is loſt labour to give him any. And that we may ſee theſe are the deductions of Natural Reaſon, without the advantage of Revelation, we ſhall find the Heathens, who were deſtitute of Divine Revelation, did attribute this Perfection to God. <hi>Tully</hi> tells us, that <hi>Thales</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>Deos omnia cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere</hi>; and we know the Heathens were wont to ſwear <hi>Diis immortalibus teſtibus interpoſitis,</hi> which is an owning of his <hi>Omniſcience: Quis enim non timeat Deum omnia pervidentem, &amp; cogitantem, &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvertentem, curioſum &amp; negotii plenum Deum,</hi> de Nat. Deor. l. 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From Scripture and Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. I will not heap up all thoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scripture which might be gathered together upon this Argument; I will only inſtance in two or three. Job 36.4. <hi>He that is perfect in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is with thee</hi>; 37.16. <hi>Doſt thou know the wondrous works of him who is perfect in Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hither we may refer thoſe Texts which repreſent God by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to our infirmity, as having
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:35252:72"/>
Eyes and Ears, which ſignifie his <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of what is done in the World; and thoſe which ſpeak of him as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to us all the Knowledge which we have; <hi>he giveth Wiſdom to the Wiſe, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding to them that know <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> Dan. 2.21. And thoſe which ſpeak of God, as knowing the moſt ſecret things, <hi>the hidden things of darkneſs,</hi> the Hearts and the Thoughts of Men; and thoſe things which are at the greateſt diſtance, as future things; and of the greateſt uncertainty, as the contingent Acts of free Creatures; each of theſe I ſhall particularly conſider; for in proving that God knows all theſe, his <hi>Knowledge</hi> of all other things will be proved with advantage; for if any thing be out of the reach of the <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> it muſt in all probability be either thoſe things which are ſecret and hidden, as Mens ſecret Actions, or their Thoughts; or elſe thoſe things which are to come, and depend upon no certain cauſe, as future contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and the proving of this may be of great uſe to us, as having a great influence upon Practice; it tends very much to the advancement of Religion, and the good Government of our Lives. I begin with the</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:35252:72"/>I. Of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That God takes very exact and particular notice of all the Actions of Men, even thoſe that are moſt ſecret. And in handling of this, I ſhall ſpeak diſtinctly to theſe <hi>three</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God takes knowledge of all our actions; <hi>his Eyes are upon the ways of man, and he ſeeth all his goings,</hi> Job 34.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he is a curious obſerver of them; <hi>he ſeeth all his goings, he marks all his ſteps,</hi> takes very exact and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of all that we do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He takes notice of thoſe actions which are moſt ſecret and hidden; <hi>there is no darkneſs nor ſhadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themſelves,</hi> Job 34, 22.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God takes notice of all our actions. And that this Notion was planted in the Mind of Man, and a Beam of the Light which comes with us into the World, will appear by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral agreement of Heathens in it; I will but produce one or two Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to this purpoſe. <hi>Tully</hi> lays down this Principle, as that which makes Men regular and orderly, and fit for Society; <hi>ſit igitur hoc perſuaſum civibus, qualis quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35252:73"/>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Arrian</hi> in his Diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Epictetus</hi> tells us, it is neceſſary that every one ſhould be perſwaded of this, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>that every thing that is done by Men is ſeen of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture frequently mentions this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.1. <hi>&amp;c. Prov.</hi> 5.21. <hi>The ways of Man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings.</hi> Jer. 32.19. <hi>Thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the Sons of men, to give every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He is a curious Obſerver, one that takes exact notice of all that we do. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>he ſeeth all our ſteps</hi>; and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> that <hi>he pondereth all our goings</hi>; the word is, <hi>he weighs them in a ballance.</hi> So 1 Sam. 2, 3. <hi>The Lord is a God of knowledge, by him actions are weighed.</hi> Job 31.4. <hi>Doth he not ſee my ways, and count all my ſteps</hi>? which doth not imply the difficulty, but the Perfection and exactneſs of God's Knowledge; he kn<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

all the circumſtances of them, all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Good and Evil that are in them; whatever may commend an action, or blemiſh it; whatever may aggravate a Sin or excuſe it. <hi>Iſa</hi> 26.7. <hi>Thou moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right doſt weigh the path of the juſt.</hi> There's not a good word that we ſpeak but God hears it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>And the Lord hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him</hi>; and all we do is <hi>noted in his Book,</hi> Pſa. 56.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He takes notice of thoſe Actions which are moſt ſecret and hidden, the good as well as the bad; when we <hi>do our alms in ſecret,</hi> when we <hi>enter into our Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets and ſhut the doors, our Father ſeeth in ſecret,</hi> Mat. 6. Nor can we retire our ſelves to any place, where we can ſin ſo as God ſhall not ſee us, where we can hide our ſins from his ſight, or our ſelves from his wrath.

            <p n="2">II. God knows the hearts and thoughts of Men, which implys theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> God perfectly knows the hearts of Men, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the hearts and try the reins</hi>; where by <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>reins,</hi> which are the moſt inward parts of the Body; and lie leaſt open to diſcovery, are ſignified the moſt ſecret Thoughts and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul, theſe God is ſaid to <hi>ſearch</hi> and <hi>try,</hi> not as if it were a work of Labour and Difficulty to the Divine Knowledge to penetrate the hearts of Men, and to dive into their Thoughts, but to ſignifie to us the Perfection and Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Divine Knowledge; as when Men would know a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, they ſearch into every part of it, and examine every thing narrowly;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:35252:74"/>
ſo God is ſaid <hi>to ſearch the heart,</hi> to ſignifie to us that he knows the hearts of Men, as throughly as we do any thing upon the ſtricteſt Search and moſt diligent Examination; upon the ſame account he is ſaid elſewhere in Scripture <hi>to weigh the Spirits of Men,</hi> Prov. 16.2. <hi>All the ways of Man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weigheth the Spirits</hi>; that is, he hath as perfect a Knowledge of the ſecret Motions and Inclinations of Mens hearts, as Men have of thoſe things which they weigh in a Ballance with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exactneſs.</p>
            <p>Now that God hath this perfect Knowledge of Mens hearts, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture frequently declares to us; that he knows the hearts of all Men, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.39. <hi>For thou, even thou knoweſt the hearts of all the Children of Men.</hi> 1 Chron. 28.9. <hi>The Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.</hi> How cloſe and reſerved ſoever Men may be, what diſguiſe ſoever they may uſe to hide their purpoſes from Men, yet God ſees them; the things which are moſt dark and ſecret are open to his view, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.21. <hi>He knoweth the ſecrets of the hearts,</hi> 
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:35252:75"/>
Prov. 15.11. <hi>Hell and Deſtruction are before him, how much more the hearts of the Children of Men?</hi> Whatever pretences Men may make, God ſees through them, and diſcovers the very intentions of their hearts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.9. <hi>The righteous Lord tryeth the hearts and reins.</hi> Heb. 4.13. It is ſaid there of <hi>the Word of God,</hi> that it is <hi>a diſcerner of the thoughts and intentions of the Heart; for all things are naked and open to the Eye of him with whom we have to do, and there is no Creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight</hi>; nay he knows our thoughts at a diſtance, what they will be, before they actually are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2. <hi>Thou knoweſt my thoughts afar off.</hi> 'Tis true indeed every Man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to his own Thoughts, and privy to the Motions of his own Mind, when they are preſent, and when they are paſt, if he have not forgot them; but no Man knows what he ſhall think to morrow, but this God knows, for he knows us more intimately and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than we do our ſelves; <hi>God is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than our hearts, and knows all things,</hi> 1 John 3.20.</p>
            <p>And tho' the Scripture had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed this ſo plainly, yet we had not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35252:75"/>
been wholly ignorant of it; it is a Principle implanted in us, and born with us, as being part of that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion which Men have of God; the Reaſon of our Minds tells us that God knows our Hearts; and the Fears and Jealouſies of our Minds are an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1<hi>ſt.</hi>) The Reaſon of every Man's mind tells him, that the Supreme Being, whom we call God, is endowed with all Perfection, and among his other Perfections, that <hi>he excels in Knowledge</hi>; and to the Perfection of Knowledge it is required, that it extend it ſelf to all Objects, and that nothing be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from it. The Knowledge of God in reſpect of all Objects, is like the Sun, in reſpect of this lower World, <hi>nothing is hid from the light of it.</hi> We have naturally this Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, that he is an immenſe Being, every where preſent, that he intimately penetrates all places and things, and conſequently that he is preſent to our Spirits, and ſees all the motions of our Minds, and diſcerns the very ſecrets of our Hearts; and there can be no ſuch thing as ſecreſie and retirement from an Eye that is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35252:76"/>
where, and a Knowledge that pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth into all things.</p>
            <p>And to convince us that theſe are the dictates of Natural Reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help and aſſiſtance of Divine Revelation, we ſhall find that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who had only the advantage of Natural Light, were firmly poſſeſt with this apprehenſion, that God knows the hearts of Men. This may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Collected from the frequent ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the wiſer Heathens to this purpoſe; that the beſt and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable worſhip of the Deity is that which is inward, that of the Heart and Mind. To this Senſe <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Cultus autem deorum eſt optimus, idemque caſtiſſimus atque ſanctiſſimus pleniſſimuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que pietatis, ut eos ſemper purâ, integrâ atque incorruptâ mente &amp; voce venere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, The beſt and holieſt worſhip of the Gods is to worſhip them with a pure and upright and ſincere Mind.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe is that known ſaying of the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Compoſitum jus faſque animi, ſanctoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que receſſus</l>
                  <l>Mentis, &amp; incoctum generoſo pectus honeſto,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:35252:76"/>Haec cedo ut admoveam templis &amp; farre litabo;</l>
               </q>
               <hi>Do but offer to God a mind inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be juſt and honeſt, and the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſacrifice will pleaſe him.</hi> Now from hence, that they judged the purity of our Hearts and Thoughts, and an honeſt diſpoſition of Mind, to be moſt acceptable to their Gods, we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that they did moſt firmly believe that God knows the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Mens Hearts; otherwiſe there had been no need for Men to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to recommend themſelves this way to the Divine acceptance.</p>
            <p>But we need not argue this by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, there are many expreſs paſſages in their Writings, which do ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie their belief of this Principle. <hi>Thales,</hi> one of their moſt ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, being askt, <hi>if an unjuſt Man could conceal himſelf from God,</hi> he anſwer'd, <hi>he cannot ſo much as hide from him the very thoughts and deſign of it. Socrates</hi> (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> tells us) was wont to inculcate this Principle upon his Scholar, that <hi>the Gods know all things, what we ſay, and what we do, and what we think in ſilence.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Arrian</hi> in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35252:77"/>
upon <hi>Epictetus</hi> laying down the Principles of a virtuous life, <hi>firſt of all,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we muſt learn this, that there is a God who takes care of the World, and that there is nothing hid from him, not only what we do, but not ſo much as what we think, and deſign.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Tully</hi> in his Book of Laws, <hi>let every Man be firmly perſwaded of this, that the Gods ſee what every Man is, and with what Mind and Devotion they ſerve them</hi>: I will add but one Teſtimony more, and that is of <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Epiſtles, <hi>nihil Deo clauſum eſt, intereſt animis noſtris, &amp; cogitationibus mediis intervenit, we can keep nothing cloſe from God, for he is preſent to our Minds, and intimate to our Thoughts</hi>; ſo that you ſee this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is deeply rooted in the Minds of Men, and that Men do naturally Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon themſelves into it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The natural fears of Men are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſecret acknowledgement of this; and I take this to be a great Truth, that a Man's natural Actions, and ſuch as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon Surpriſe and without Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are a better argument of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate ſenſe of our Minds, and do more truly diſcover what lies at the bottom of our Hearts, and what Notions are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35252:77"/>
to us, than our contrived and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Diſcourſe. If I ſee a Man upon the ſudden ſight of a Serpent recoil and ſtart back, tho' he tell me never ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that he is not afraid, yet I am ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently convinc'd of the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee in his Countenance and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage a natural acknowledgment of Fear and Danger: ſo if Men find that upon the deſigning of a ſecret Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which never went further than their own Hearts, their Conſciences do ſting and laſh them, that they have a ſenſe of Guilt, and feel inward Frights and Horrours, whatever they may ſay to the contrary, this is a natural acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of an inviſible Eye that ſees them, and diſallows their wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. If that be true which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poet ſays, That
<q>Scelus intra ſe tacitum qui cogitat ullum, Facti crimen habet.</q>
               <hi>He that meditates any ſecret Wickedneſs in his Heart, is guilty to himſelf, as if he had committed it</hi>; this is a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that the Man ſtands in Awe of ſomething beſides Himſelf, and is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that there is one that is Conſcious to what he thinks.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:35252:78"/>2. That to have a perfect and thorough knowledge of Mens Hearts, is the peculiar Prerogative of God. This is imply'd in the Anſwer to that Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Who can know the heart of man?</hi> Jer. 17.10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, and try the reins</hi>; this is the Prerogative of God, and one of his chief Titles, that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a knower of the heart,</hi> 1 King. 8.39. <hi>Thou, even thou only knoweſt the hearts of all the children of men.</hi> Men may make a probable conjecture at the Thoughts and Deſigns of others, from their Words and Actions; but God only knows them. Men are conſcious to their own Thoughts and Purpoſes, <hi>the ſpirit of a man that is in him, knows the things of a man</hi>; but they cannot ſee into the Secrets of another Man's Mind; 'tis God alone that knows the Hearts of all Men. The Heart of Man is a priviledg'd place, and the ſecret and inward work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it are not ſubject to the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of any but God alone. The limits of Humane Knowledge are the outward appearances of Actions, 1 Sam. 16.7. <hi>The Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth; for man look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart</hi>; our Knowledge is but ſuperficial, and glides upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35252:78"/>
and ſurface of things, but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledge pierceth to the very center of every thing. Now the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place, the moſt inward retirement, the privateſt Cloſet in the whole World, is the Heart of Man, and this God only is privy to; <hi>Deus autor omnium &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culator omnium, à quo nihil ſecretum eſſe poteſt, tenebris intereſt, intereſt &amp; cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus noſtris quaſi alteris tenebris,</hi> ſaith <hi>Min. Foelix, God made all things, and ſees all things, and therefore nothing can be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from him; he is preſent in Darkneſs, and he is preſent to the Thoughts of Men, which are as it were another</hi> and a thicker <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Devil indeed pretends to this Knowledge; he would take upon him to know the integrity of <hi>Job</hi>'s Heart better than God himſelf, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Teſtimony which God gave of his Integrity, yet if he were but ſoundly tried by Affliction, he would renounce God, and curſe him to his face: but the event proved how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and malicious this ſuggeſtion was. But there is a far greater difficulty in this matter, from the paſſages of ſome Divines concerning the Devil's imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate acceſs to the Minds of Men, and <pb n="142" facs="tcp:35252:79"/>
his Power to caſt in Wicked Thoughts into them; which ſeems by conſequence to grant him ſome knowledge of Mens Hearts; for by the ſame Reaſon that he can imprint Thoughts upon Mens Minds, he may ſee thoſe that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed there.</p>
            <p>That the Devil is a very ſagacious Spirit, and can make very ſhrewd Conjectures at the bent and inclinations of Mens Minds, and the probable workings of our Thoughts, from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Knowledge and Obſervation of our Tempers and Paſſions, of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and Deſigns, and from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tenour of our Actions in Publick and Private, and from our Prayers and Confeſſions to God (if he permit him at any time to be ſo near Good Men) I think there is no doubt: but this is far from a Knowledge of our Hearts; all this is but Conjecture, and ſuch as men may make of one another in a lower degree.</p>
            <p>But as to the buſineſs of caſting in blaſphemous and deſpairing Thoughts into the Minds of Men, to this I would ſay theſe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there are few of theſe caſes which may not more probably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35252:79"/>
into the Wickedneſs and Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mens Hearts, or into the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Melancholy of our tempers, which are apt to raiſe and ſuggeſt ſtrange Thoughts to Men, and ſuch as we may be apt to think have no riſe from our ſelves, not conſidering what an odd and ſtrange influence the diſorder of our bodily Humours may have upon our Minds, as we ſee in violent Fevers, and ſeveral other Diſeaſes; and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> tho' the workings of it are more ſtill and quiet, is as truly a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> as any other; ſo that I chuſe rather to aſcribe as much of theſe to a bodily Diſtemper as may be, becauſe it is a very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable conſideration, to think that the Devil hath ſuch an immediate Power upon the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do not ſee how by any means it can be granted, without prejudice to this Prerogative of God, which the Scripture plainly gives him, of being <hi>the only Knower of the Heart,</hi> that the Devil can have ſo immediate an acceſs to our Minds, as to put wicked Thoughts into them; nor can I think, that when it is ſaid, 1 Chron. 21.1. That <hi>Satan provoked David to number the people,</hi> and Luke 22.3. That <hi>the devil entred into Judas,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:35252:80"/>
and Acts 5.3. That <hi>Satan had filled the heart of Ananias to lie unto the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and Eph. 2.2. That <hi>the devil is the ſpirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience</hi>; I ſay I cannot think that any or all of theſe expreſſions do amount to ſuch an immediate power of putting wicked Thoughts into Mens Minds, but they only ſignifie that the Devil hath a greater hand in ſome ſins than others, and that a Heart wickedly bent and inclined give him a great advantage to tempt Men more powerfully, by preſenting the occaſions of ſuck wicked Thoughts and Actions to them; for it is uſual in Scripture-phraſe, as to aſcribe all good Motions to God's Spirit, ſo all evil Thoughts and Actions to the Devil, not that he is the immediate Cauſe of them, but becauſe he is always ready to tempt Men to them, and one way or other to promote them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſee no Reaſon to grant (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have done) an immediate Power to the Devil over the fancies and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, and that he may know the workings of them, tho' not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts of Mens Minds; for this ſeems to me to be in effect to grant him
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35252:80"/>
the Knowledge of Mens Hearts, and to give him a Key to that Cloſet which God hath reſerved to himſelf: for it is a very nice Diſtinction which is here made between the Thoughts of Mens Minds, and the Images of their Fancies; and if theſe ſhould happen to be but words that ſignifie the ſame thing, we ſhall unawares intrench upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of God. Therefore becauſe the Scripture is a ſtranger to theſe nice and ſubtile diſtinctions between the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Fancy, and the Thoughts of the Heart, I think it is much ſafer to aſſert the Prerogative of God in that latitude that the Scripture uſeth the word <hi>heart,</hi> for all the inward motions of the Mind, for the Thoughts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Heart, and roundly to affirm that all the inward motions of our Souls are totally exempt from the immediate cognizance of any other Spirit but God's alone; and that neither Angel nor Devil hath any further Knowledge of them, than may be collected and inferr'd in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjecture from the particular Knowledge of Mens Tempers and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Deſigns, and the Courſe of their Actions. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:35252:81"/>III. Particular; God's Knowledge of future Events. This God propoſes as the way to diſcern the true God from Idols, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 41.21, &amp;c. <hi>Produce your Cauſe, ſaith the Lord, bring forth your ſtrong Reaſons, ſaith the King of Jacob,</hi> that is, let them bring ſome Argument that may convince us that they are Gods; and he inſtanceth in foretelling future Evants, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Let them ſhew the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things, what they be, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come. Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods.</hi> God puts it upon this iſſue, if they can <hi>foretel future things,</hi> then they are <hi>Gods</hi>; if not, they are <hi>vanity, and a work of naught, and he is an abomination that chuſeth them,</hi> v. 24. By <hi>things to come,</hi> I underſtand ſuch Effects as do not depend upon any neceſſary Cauſe, but upon the Will of Free Agents, and ſo may be, or may not be; from whence it is plain, that it is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of God, proper and peculiar to Him, to know future Events. And here I ſhall conſider theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:35252:81"/>
               <item>1. That God knows future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</item>

            <p n="1">1. God knows future Events; which will appear from the dictates of Natural Light, and from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) From the dictates of Natural Light, as it is a Perfection, and that which among Men is accounted the beſt part of Wiſdom; and unleſs this did belong to God, how could he govern the World? The Heathens, except only the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> generally granted this, as appears in thoſe wiſe Counſels, which we frequently meet with in them to this purpoſe, that we ſhould not be anxious for the future, but having done our endeavour, leave the Events of things to God, who only knows them and diſpoſeth them.</p>

               <hi>At illis notum, qui pueri, qualiſque futura ſit uxor</hi>; and that this was their Opinion, appears yet more clearly from thoſe apprehenſions which they had of <hi>Divination. Tully</hi> lays down this for a Principle, <hi>Deos poſſe nobis ſigna futurarum reum oſtendere</hi>; de Legibus, and in his Book <hi>de Divin.</hi> he tells us, <hi>that there was ſuch a thing as Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for it was an old Opinion, jam uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ab Heroicis ducta temporibus, eaque Pop. Rom. &amp; omnium gentium firmata conſenſu,</hi> and afterward that <hi>this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was not, ſine inſtinctu afflatúque divino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know they did variouſly explain this, according to their ſeveral Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Contingency,</hi> and their Apprehenſions about the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of God. One Sect of them, the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> held that there was a fatal Chain of Cauſes from firſt to laſt, and things did neceſſarily follow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and by this Means they made Fore-knowledge eaſie and explicable, and tho' in their Diſputes they ſeem to grant no ſuch thing as <hi>Events</hi> and <hi>Contingencies,</hi> yet they are agreed in the thing, that thoſe things which <hi>we</hi> call <hi>Events,</hi> tho' <hi>they</hi> would not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35252:82"/>
call them ſo, were Fore-known to God. And for this I ſhall only cite one Teſtimony of <hi>Seneca,</hi> ſpeaking of God's Fore-knowledge of the moſt contingent things, the Diſpoſitions of Men long before they are Born; he adds, <hi>nota eſt enim illis operis ſui ſeries, omniúmque illis rerum per manus ſuas iturarum ſcientia in aperto ſemper eſt; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ex abdito ſubit; &amp; quae repentina pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus, illis proviſa veniunt &amp; familiaria</hi>; and how peremptory ſoever this Sect is in their diſputes about <hi>Fate,</hi> yet when they ſpeak of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and generally in their Moral Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they ſeem plainly to me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt <hi>the will of Man</hi> from this <hi>fatal neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thoſe other Sects of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers that denyed <hi>Fate,</hi> did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grant <hi>God's Fore-knowledge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent things.</hi> I grant indeed, that they did rather make God's Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Voluntary</hi> than <hi>a neceſſary</hi> Perfection, that is, that God, when he pleaſed to apply himſelf to it, could Fore-know all future Events: but their general Opinion was, that as his Providence did not extend to ſmall and inconſiderable things, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:35252:83"/>
his Fore-knowledge. But <hi>Tully</hi> ſeems to attribute a very perfect Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to him, and a Fore-knowledge of the leaſt things, <hi>Quis non timeat omnia providentem, cogitantem, animadvertentem, &amp; omnia ad ſe pertinere putantem, curioſum &amp; negotij plenum deum</hi>? But I cannot ſay he is conſtant to himſelf: but they all agree in granting to him this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of knowing all future things, if he pleaſed to trouble himſelf with it; and had they not in this miſtaken the Nature of God, they might eaſily have apprehended, that 'tis no trouble nor wearineſs to an Infinite Underſtanding that is always in Act, to know the leaſt things how many ſoever they be.</p>

God foretels the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s deliverance after 430 Years, which he punctually accompliſht. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40, 41. The Prophet that propheſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Altar at <hi>Bethel</hi> named the Man that ſhould do it, <hi>Joſias,</hi> 350 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.2. The delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity was foretold 100 Years before to be done particularly by <hi>Cyrus</hi>; which is ſo ſtrange, that the Prophet brings it in with a Preface of God's Wiſdom and Power, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which was afterward preciſely fulfilled, when the 70 Years were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. How are the Life and Death of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> with many particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances foretold? And did not <hi>he</hi> foretel the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 40 Years before?</p>
            <p>But becauſe there may be no contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency in good things, God himſelf may be reſolved to effect them, or excite Men to do them, when he hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them; you ſhall find that the worſt things have been foretold; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 31.16. and their Infidelity in times of the Goſpel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1, 5, 9, 26.

            <p>I Have conſider'd this Perfection of God, in ſome of the greateſt and moſt difficult inſtances of it, his Knowledge of the moſt ſecret Things, the hearts of Men, and future Events; againſt the laſt of which there are ſome Objections, which I come now briefly to conſider, and paſs on to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi>; The <hi>impoſſibility</hi> of the thing. Certainty of all Knowledge depends upon the certainty of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, therefore there cannot be a certain and determinate Knowledge of any thing, but what is certainly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately true; but future Events,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35252:85"/>
which may or may not be, have no certain and determinate Truth, that is, it is not certain either that they will or will not be, becauſe they have no certain Cauſe, therefore there can be no infallible Knowledge concerning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This I confeſs is the grand Difficulty; I ſhall not be ſo ſolicitous to take it away, as to give ſatisfaction to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I might ſay with a very fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that the certainty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth not depend upon the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> but of the <hi>Object,</hi> which may be certain, tho' the <hi>Cauſe</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent. Which I prove thus, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Event hath actually happened, as becauſe now it is paſt, it is certainly true that <hi>it was,</hi> ſo becauſe it once was, it was certainly true before it was, that <hi>it would be</hi>; as in <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying of Chriſt. If it be now true that <hi>he hath denied him,</hi> it was true before, that <hi>he would deny him</hi>; and it being determinately true, God ſaw it <hi>as it was</hi>; ſo that here is an <hi>Object</hi> of a certain Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho' we could not explain the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of God's knowing future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, much leſs the manner how; yet we are ſufficiently aſſured that God doth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35252:85"/>
know them. I will give but one inſtance for the Proof of this. Nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi>; yet God fore-knew this; how elſe was Chriſt <hi>decreed before the Foundation of the World?</hi> Chriſt was a remedy upon the occaſion of ſin, now the remedy could not be deſigned before the ſin was foreſeen: and this being certain, <hi>cum conſtat de re, fruſtra inquiritur de modo, when we are certain of the thing, 'tis not neceſſary to know the manner.</hi> We are ſatisfied of many things, the manner whereof we do not know; we believe the union of the Soul and Body, tho' no Man can explain how a Spirit can be united to Matter; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the continuity of matter, that is, that the parts of it hang together, of which whoſoever ſaith he can give an account, doth but betray his own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And ſo in many other things; that Man doth not know himſelf, nor the meaſure of his own underſtanding, nor the nature and obſcurity of things, that will not confeſs himſelf poſed in many things, that doth not acknowledge that there are many <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, many things the manner whereof is unimagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and of which our beſt Reaſon and Underſtanding can give no account.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:35252:86"/>3. 'Tis very unreaſonable to expect we ſhould know all the ways which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Knowledge hath of knowing things. We have but finite Faculties and Meaſures, which bear no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to infinite Powers and Objects. Could we explain the manner how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Knowledge knows things, we ſhould be <hi>like God in Knowledge,</hi> our underſtandings would be infinite like his; and in this caſe eſpecially it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to put on the modeſty of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to remember that we are finite and limited. Some arrogant Spirits take it for an affront to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, that any one ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they ſhould believe any thing, tho' they have the higheſt aſſurance of it, if they cannot explain the particular manner of it; they make nothing to deny God's Knowledge of future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, unleſs they may be ſatisfied of the particular way how he knows them.</p>
            <p>I know there are thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to explain the particular manner. Some ſay that God ſees future Events <hi>in ſpeculo voluntatis</hi>; others ſay that the Eternity of God is actually commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to all Duration, as his Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35252:86"/>
to all Space, and ſo God doth not ſo properly <hi>fore-ſee</hi> and <hi>fore-know,</hi> as <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>know</hi> future things by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiality and coexiſtence of all things in Eternity; for they ſay that future things are actually preſent and exiſting to God, tho' not in <hi>menſurâ propriâ,</hi> yet in <hi>menſurâ alienâ</hi>; the School-men have much more of this Jargon and canting Language; and I envy no Man the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding theſe Phraſes, but to me they ſeem to ſignifie nothing, but to have been words invented by idle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Men, which a great many ever ſince, leſt they ſhould ſeem to be ignorant, would ſeem to underſtand; but I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der moſt, that Men, when they have amuſed and puzzled themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with hard Words, ſhould call this <hi>explaining</hi> things.</p>
            <p>The ſum of the Anſwer is this; that when we have done all we can, God's fore-knowledge of future Events may ſeem contradictious and impoſſible to us, much leſs do I expect ever to be able to give a particular account of the manner of it: but we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſſurance of the thing, and unleſs we had infinite underſtandings, it were vanity to pretend to explain all the ways of infinite Knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:35252:87"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is Objected, That if we can admit ſuch a Knowledge in God as ſeems contradictious and impoſſible to our Reaſon, why may we not allow and frame ſuch Notions of his Goodneſs and Juſtice?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, There is a great difference between thoſe Perfections of God which are imitable, and thoſe which are not. Knowledge of future Events is a Perfection wherein we are not bound to be like God; and if we are aſſured of the thing, that he doth know them, it is not neceſſary that we ſhould know the manner of it, and diſ-intangle it from contradiction and impoſſibility; but it is otherwiſe in God's Goodneſs and Juſtice, which are imitable; he that imitates, endeavours to be like ſomething that he knows, and we muſt have a clear Idea and Notion of that which we would bring our ſelves to the likeneſs of; theſe Perfections of God we are capable of knowing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Knowledge of theſe Perfections is chiefly recommended to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24. By theſe God reveals himſelf, and declares his Name, and makes himſelf known to us, even by thoſe Attributes which declare his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:35252:87"/>
Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Juſtice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.3, 4, 5. When God would give a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he promiſes <hi>to cauſe his goodneſs to paſs before him.</hi> So that it doth not follow, that becauſe God's Knowledge of future Events is to be admitted, notwithſtanding the ſeeming contradiction and impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, therefore we are to admit of any Notion of God's Juſtice or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſeems contradictious or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. The</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third,</hi> Objection is made up of ſeveral inconveniencies that would follow from God's Knowledge of future Events.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It would Prejudice the Liberty of the Creature. For if God have an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Knowledge of what we will do, then we cannot but do what he infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly foreſees we will do; for otherwiſe his Knowledge would be fallible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> God's-Fore-knowledge lays no neceſſity upon the Event. In every Event, we may conſider the Effect <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> or with relation to the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and the manner how it comes to paſs; conſider'd <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> it is <hi>future,</hi> with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its <hi>Cauſes</hi> it is <hi>contingent.</hi> God ſees it as <hi>both,</hi> and ſo, as that which till it

is, may be or not be; and when it comes to paſs, he ſees the Man do it freely; and ſo before it be done, it hath no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; but upon ſuppoſition of fore-ſight; as <hi>when it is,</hi> it hath upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <hi>that it is,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> excellently explains it. Fore-knowledge is not <hi>the cauſe</hi> of the things that are fore-known; but becauſe the thing is future and ſhall be, this is the Reaſon why it is fore-known; for it doth not, becauſe it was known, come to paſs; but becauſe it was to come to paſs, therefore it was fore-known; and bare Knowledge is no more the Cauſe of any Event, which becauſe it is known muſt infallibly be, than my ſeeing a Man run, is the Cauſe of his running, which, becauſe I do ſee, is infallibly ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> If God infallibly fore-knows what Men will do, how can he be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Exhortations to Repentance, in his Expectation of it, and his griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Impenitency of Men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> All theſe are founded in the liberty of our Actions. God exhorts to Repentance and expects it, becauſe by his Grace we may do it; he is ſaid to grieve for our Impenitency, becauſe we may do otherwiſe, and will not. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35252:88"/>
are not vain in themſelves, but very proper to their end, tho' through our obſtinacy and hardneſs they may be rendred vain to us and without effect. If the weight of the Objection lie upon <hi>ſerious,</hi> and you ask how God can exhort Men <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> to that which he fore-ſees that they will not do, thoſe whom he fore-knows will be finally impenitent? I anſwer, if his Exhortations were not <hi>ſerious,</hi> he could not foreſee the final impenitency of Men. To foreſee Mens final impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, is to foreſee their willful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods Warnings and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Rejection of his Grace; now Mens willful contempt of his Warnings and Exhortations cannot be foreſeen, unleſs God foreſee that his Exhortations are <hi>ſerious</hi> and in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</p>
            <p>Having anſwer'd the Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God's fore-knowing future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, I proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="2">II. That God only knows future Events. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.6, 7. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the King of Iſrael, and his Redeemer the Lord of Hoſts, I am the firſt, and I am the laſt, and beſides me there is no God: and who, as I, ſhall call, and ſhall declare
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35252:89"/>
it, and ſet it in order for me, ſince I appointed the ancient People, and the things that are coming, and ſhall come? let them ſhew unto them.</hi> Iſa. 46.9, 10. <hi>Remember the former things of old, for I am God, and there is none elſe. I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, ſaying my counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon is evident, becauſe the Knowledge of future Events is beyond the reach of any finite underſtanding; eſpecially if we grant it to be beyond our finite underſtanding, to explain the poſſibility of ſuch a Knowledge; for to be ſure that is out of the reach of our Knowledge, which we cannot ſo much as underſtand how it is poſſible it ſhould be known by any Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But it may here be Objected; Did not the Oracles among the Heathens fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel ſeveral things, which Chriſtians are ſatisfied came from the Devil? I have no time at preſent to examine the buſineſs of Heathen Oracles; I could eaſily ſhew there was much impoſture in them: but grant they were really
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35252:89"/>
delivered and given out by a Spirit; yet the darkneſs and ambiguity, the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contrived ambiguity, is ſuch as ſhews that the Devil was conſcious to himſelf of the uncertainty of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in thoſe matters; and thoſe few that came to paſs, and are in any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Senſe ſaid to be accompliſht, were in ſuch matters, either wherein prudent Conjecture might go far (and I grant the Devil to be a ſagacious Spirit;) or elſe in diſ-junctive Caſes, as when there are but two ways for a thing to be, it muſt either be ſo, or ſo, in which a bold gueſſing may often hit right: but <hi>gueſſing</hi> at future things, is far from <hi>a Knowledge</hi> of them, which only can clearly be made out by punctual and particular Predictions of Things, with Circumſtances of Time and Perſon, ſuch as we find in Scripture in many inſtances, to the prediction of which, the greateſt ſagacity and the utmoſt gueſſing could do nothing, ſuch as thoſe Predictions of which I gave inſtances out of Scripture.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the <hi>Firſt</hi> general Head, I propos'd to be ſpoken to from theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove that this
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:35252:90"/>
Attribute of <hi>Knowledge</hi> belongs to God. I proceed to the,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> viz. To conſider the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Prerogative of the Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which I ſhall ſpeak to in theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's Knowledge is <hi>Preſent</hi> and <hi>Actual,</hi> his Eye is always open, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is in the view of it. The Knowledge of the Creature is more <hi>Power</hi> than <hi>Act</hi>; it is not much that we are capable of knowing, but there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little that we do actually know; 'tis but one thing that we can fix our Thoughts upon at once, and apply our Minds to; we can remove them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Object, but then we muſt take off our Minds from the former, and quit the actual knowledge of it: but the knowledge of God is an actual and ſteady Comprehenſion of things, he being every where preſent, and all eye, nothing can eſcape his ſight, but all Objects are at once in the view of the Divine Underſtanding. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Neither is there any Creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight: but all things are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:35252:90"/>2. God's Knowledge is an <hi>intimate</hi> and <hi>thorough</hi> Knowledge, whereby he knows the very Nature and Eſſence of things. The Knowledge which we have of things 'tis but in part, but outward and ſuperficial; our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge glides upon the ſuperficies of things, but doth not penetrate into the intimate Nature of them, it ſeldom reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth further than the skin and outward appearance of things; we do not know things in their realities, but as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and are repreſented to us with all their Masks and Diſguiſes: but God knows things as they are. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. <hi>The Lord ſeeth not as Man ſeeth; for Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the Heart</hi>; God knows things throughout, all that can be known of them. The quick and piercing Eye of God Penetrates into every thing, the light of the Divine Underſtanding lays all things <hi>open and naked,</hi> Heb. 4.13. In which expreſſion the Apoſtle alludes to the Sacrifices of Beaſts, which were flead and cleft down the back bone, that the Prieſt might look into them, and ſee whether they were without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. To the Eye of our underſtandings moſt Objects are cloſe, and have their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:35252:91"/>
Skins upon them: but to the Eyes of God all things are uncovered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected, and he open to his view.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God's Knowledge is <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>diſtinct.</hi> Our Underſtandings in the Knowledge of things are liable to great confuſion; we are often deceived with the near likeneſs and reſemblance of things, and miſtake one thing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; our Knowledge is but a twi-light, which doth not ſufficiently ſeparate and diſtinguiſh things from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſee things many times together and in a heap, and do but know them in groſs; but there is no confuſion in the Divine Underſtanding, <hi>that</hi> is a clear Light which ſeparates and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth things of the greateſt nearneſs and reſemblance; God hath a particular Knowledge of the leaſt things, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.7. <hi>Even the very hairs of your Head are all numbred</hi>; thoſe things which are of the leaſt conſideration, and have the greateſt likeneſs to one another, <hi>the very hairs of our Head,</hi> are ſeverally and diſtinctly known to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God's Knowledge is <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infallible.</hi> We are ſubject to doubt and error in our underſtanding of things, every thing almoſt impoſeth upon our
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35252:91"/>
Underſtandings, and tinctures our Minds, and makes us look on things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than they are; our Temper and Complexion, our Education and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, our Intereſt and Advantage, our Humours and Diſtempers, theſe all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent things, and darken our Minds, and ſeduce our Judgments, and betray us to Error and Miſtake: but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Underſtanding is a clear, fixt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and undiſturbed Light, a pure Mirrour that receives no ſtain from Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or Intereſt, or any other thing. Men are many times confident and apt to impoſe upon others, as if they were infallible: but this is the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of God, the Priviledge of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Underſtanding, that it is ſecure from all poſſibility of Errour; 'tis <hi>God</hi> only <hi>that cannot lie,</hi> Tit. 1.2. becauſe he cannot be deceived; the <hi>infallibility</hi> of God is the Foundation of his <hi>veracity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Knowledge of God is <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>without difficulty.</hi> We muſt dig deep for Knowledge, take a great deal of pains to know a little; we do not attain the Knowledge of things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſearch and ſtudy and great intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mind; we ſtrive to comprehend ſome things, but they are ſo vaſt that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:35252:92"/>
we cannot; other things are at ſuch a diſtance, that our Underſtanding is too weak to diſcern them; other things are ſo little, and ſmall, and nice, that our Underſtanding cannot lay hold of them, we cannot contract our Minds to ſuch a Point as to faſten upon them: but the Underſtanding of God being infinite, there is nothing at a diſtance from it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too great and vaſt for it's compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, nor is there any thing ſo little that it can eſcape his Knowledge and animadverſion. The great Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> is compared to <hi>the Sand on the Sea ſhore</hi>; the ſhore is vaſt, but the Sands are little (ſaith one) to ſignifie that the vaſt Mind of <hi>Solomon</hi> did comprehend the leaſt things. 'Tis much more true of God, his Underſtanding is a vaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the leaſt things, as well as the greateſt; and all this God does without difficulty or pain; he knows all things without ſtudy, and his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is in continual exerciſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wearineſs. How many things are there which we cannot find out without ſearch, without looking narrowly into, and bending our Minds to underſtand them? But all things are obvious to God, and lie open to his view.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:35252:92"/>He is ſaid indeed in Scripture <hi>to ſearch the Heart,</hi> and <hi>to try the Reins,</hi> and <hi>to weigh the Spirits</hi>; but theſe Expreſſions do not ſignifie the <hi>painfulneſs,</hi> but the <hi>perfection</hi> of his Knowledge, that he knows thoſe things as perfectly, as we can do any thing about which we uſe the greateſt diligence and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Knowledge of God is <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,</hi> and extends to <hi>all Objects.</hi> We know but a few things, our Ignorance is greater than our Knowledge, <hi>maxima pars eorum quae ſcimus, eſt minima pars eorum que neſcimus</hi>: but the Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is vaſt and comprehenſive, and by an imperious view commands all Objects; <hi>he is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things</hi>; he knows himſelf, and the excellency and perfection of his own Nature, and the ſecrets of his Will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The Spirit of God ſearcheth the deep things of God</hi>; he knows all other things that are not, and all things that are, in all differences of time, their Powers and Qualities. The Knowledge of God is infinite, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.5. <hi>His underſtanding is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi>; he knows himſelf and his own Perfections, and all the poſſibilities of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35252:93"/>
things, which are all infinite. Now the Underſtanding of God being infinite is incapable of any Addition, or Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Change. Our finite Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are liable to alterations, they may grow or decline: but the Knowledge of God is a full conſtant Light, 'tis always the ſame, not liable to any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe, nor capable of any exaltation or improvement, but remains for ever the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I come now to draw ſome Inferences from the ſeveral parts of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. From the Perfection of God's Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perfection of the Divine Knowledge calls for our Veneration. Every Excellency commands Reverence, and raiſeth our admiration, and none more than <hi>Knowledge,</hi> there is nothing that we value our ſelves or others more by, than this; the higheſt Knowledge of Man, the moſt glorious Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that ever any one of the Sons of Men were endowed with, is, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Knowledge of God, but as a glow-Worm to the Sun. If we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire theſe <hi>Candles of the Lord,</hi> which ſhine ſo imperfectly in the dark; if we reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:35252:93"/>
a little Knowledge, compaſs'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ignorance; how ſhould we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire <hi>the Father of Lights, in whom is no darkneſs at all,</hi> that Knowledge which hath nothing of blemiſh or imperfection in it!</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may hence learn Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that on this double Account. As we have all our Knowledge from him; <hi>what have we that we have not received</hi>? And as our Knowledge is very imperfect, when compared with the Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. We are blind and ignorant, 'tis but a few things that we are capable of knowing; and we know but a few of thoſe things which our Natures are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of knowing; and of thoſe things we do know, our Knowledge is very imperfect, 'tis ſlight and ſuperficial, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with much difficulty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in the attaining of it, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and confuſion in the uſe of it; the cleareſt Reaſon, and the brighteſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Man hath many flaws and defects in it; ſo that the more we know of God, and of our ſelves, the more humble we ſhall be. It is <hi>an empty Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and falſely ſo call'd,</hi> that <hi>puffs up</hi>; as the empty ears of Corn are pert and raiſe up themſelves, but thoſe which are big and full, droop and hang down
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:35252:94"/>
their Heads; ſo 'tis only Ignorance that is proud and lifts Men up, but true Knowledge makes Men humble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is matter of Comfort and Encouragement. He knows our wants and weakneſs, and <hi>will lay no more upon us than we are able to bear, for he conſiders that we are but Duſt</hi>; he knows the rage and malice of our Enemies, and can when he pleaſes <hi>put a Hook in their Noſe,</hi> and <hi>his Bridle in their Lips,</hi> as he did to <hi>Senacherib,</hi> 2 Kings 19.28.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From God's knowing our ſecret Actions, I infer</p>
            <p n="1">1. If God ſees our moſt ſecret Actions, this diſcovers and confutes the ſecret Atheiſm of many. He that commits the moſt ſecret ſin denies the Omniſcience of God. Thus <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Atheiſm of ſome in his Days; <hi>he hath ſaid in his heart, God hath forgot, he hideth his face, he will never ſee it; the Lord ſhall not ſee, neither ſhall the God of Jacob regard it</hi>; and is not this, in effect, to deny God's Being? for it is to deny him to be what he is. A Man may as well deny there is a Sun, as deny that it ſhines and enlightens the World.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Relicks of this even in the beſt Men, which do at ſometimes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35252:94"/>
diſcover themſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.10, 11. <hi>Therefore his People return hither; and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</hi> And <hi>they ſay, how doth God know? is there knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> that is, the People of God come to this, when they are come to an afflicted ſtate, and ſee the Proſperity of Wicked Men, they come to this, to queſtion the Providence of God, whether he takes knowledge of the Affairs of the World. But this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm reigns in wicked Men; while they live in their Sins, they live in the Denyal of God's Omniſcience; for did Men really believe that <hi>God ſees in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> that his Eye perceiveth the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and lays <hi>open</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> all things before it, how durſt they Lie, and Steal, and Swear falſely? Vain Man! why doſt thou ſeek Darkneſs and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? how art thou alone, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt that God is every where? how can'ſt thou retire from him? how canſt thou ſhut him out? If thou believeſt that <hi>he is Light,</hi> what Security is Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thee? if he look upon thee, who is the greateſt and beſt Perſon in the World, who is thy Soveraign, thy Judge, thy Father, and thy Maſter, and thy beſt Friend (for we uſe to reverence

            <p n="2">2. Live as thoſe that believe this; be continually under the power of this Apprehenſion, That God takes a particular and exact notice of all thy Actions. The firm Belief of this would have a double influence upon us, it would encourage us in well-doing, and be a reſtraint upon us as to ſin; <hi>ſic vivamus tanquam in conſpectu vivamus, Sen.</hi> It were well if Men would live as if any body ſaw them; but to live as if ſome Worthy and Excellent Perſon were always preſent with us, and did obſerve us, this will be a far greater curb upon us. There are ſome ſins of that Uglineſs and Deformity, that a Man would not commit them in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:35252:96"/>
preſence of any one, of a Child or a Fool; and there are ſome Perſons of ſuch Worth and Reverence, <hi>quorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terventu perditi quoque homines vitia ſupprimerent. Epicurus</hi> had this good Conceit of himſelf, that he could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe others ſo to act as if he ſtood by, <hi>fac omnia tanquam ſpectet</hi> Epicurus; but <hi>Seneca</hi> inſtanceth much better in <hi>Cato,</hi> or <hi>Scipio,</hi> or <hi>Laelius,</hi>

               </q>
and ſhall not the preſence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty be an eternal reſtraint upon us?</p>
            <p>This was <hi>David</hi>'s courſe to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I will take heed to my way, while the wicked is before me</hi>; how much more in the preſence of God? <hi>I have kept thy Precepts and thy Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for all my ways are before thee,</hi> Pſal. 119.168. And it was wiſely adviſed by <hi>Seneca, That we ſhould ſo live when we are among Men, as believing God ſees us</hi>; and <hi>when there is none but he ſees us, let us behave our ſelves before him, as if Men did ſtare upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. God's <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Heart teacheth us,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:35252:97"/>1. The Folly of Hypocriſie; how vain it is to make a ſhew of that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, which inwardly and in our Hearts we are not; to put on a Mask of Religion, and paint our ſelves beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully without, when <hi>inwardly we are full of rottenneſs and uncleanneſs</hi>; to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God with our lips, when our Hearts are far from him.</hi> If we were to deal with Men, this were not a very wiſe way, for there is danger of diſcovery even from them, therefore the beſt way for a Man to ſeem to be any thing, is really to be what he would appear; but having to deal with God, who <hi>knows our thoughts afar off,</hi> to whom all our Diſguiſes are tranſparent, and all our little Arts of concealment ſignifie nothing, 'tis a madneſs to hide our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in our Boſom. With this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our Saviour convinceth the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Phariſees, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. <hi>Ye are they that juſtifie your ſelves before Men; but God knoweth your Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If God know your Hearts, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to approve your Hearts to him; charge your ſelves with inward Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Holineſs, becauſe of the pure Eyes which behold the moſt intimate and ſecret motions of your Souls; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:35252:97"/>
               <hi>cleanſe your Hearts from wickedneſs; how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within you</hi>? Fear and Shame from Men lay a great reſtraint upon our outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but how licentious are we many times in our Hearts? what a ſtrange freedom do we take within our own Breaſts? This is an Argument of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Atheiſm that lies at the bottom of our Hearts. He that allows himſelf in any wicked Thoughts and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which (out of a regard to Men) he will not put in practice, this man plainly declares, That he reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceth Men more than God; that he either disbelieves a God, or deſpiſeth him.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>keep your Hearts with all diligence,</hi> becauſe they are peculiarly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God's inſpection; and when you are ready to take the liberty of your Thoughts, becauſe no Eye ſees you, ask your ſelves, <hi>doth not he that pondereth the Heart conſider it? and he that keepeth thy ſoul, doth he not know it</hi>? as the wiſe Man ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.12.</p>
            <p>And whatever you do in the ſervice of God, <hi>do it heartily as to the Lord.</hi> Indeed if we did only worſhip God <hi>to be ſeen of Men,</hi> an external Worſhip would

be ſufficient: but Religion is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to pleaſe men, but God; he is a Spirit, and ſees our Spirits, therefore we muſt <hi>worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.4. <hi>Not as pleaſing men, but God, who trieth our Hearts. David</hi> uſeth this Argument to his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Chron. 28.9. <hi>And thou, Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind; for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.</hi> Whatever liberty we may take to our ſelves now, and how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoever we are of our Thoughts, and the inward frame of our Hearts; yet the Scripture aſſures us, that he, who now ſees our Hearts, will one day judge us according to them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reins, even to give to every Man according to his ways.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>a day coming wherein God will judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 4.13. Rev. 2.23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is matter of encouragement to us in many caſes. In our ſecret Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.3. <hi>When my Spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou kneweſt my path.</hi> In Caſes of difficulty which
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:35252:98"/>
depend upon the Hearts of other men, which tho' we do not know, yet God knows them. So the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.24. when they did not know whom to chuſe for an Apoſtle, they refer it to God, and <hi>they prayed and ſaid, thou Lord which knoweſt the hearts of all, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen.</hi> But eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally this is matter of comfort to us, when we ſuffer by the Calumnies and Reproaches of Men, when the World chargeth us with Crimes of Hypocriſie, and Falſeneſs, and Inſincerity, then to be able to appeal to <hi>the ſearcher of hearts,</hi> as to our Innocency and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to ſay with the Prophet <hi>Jer. O Lord of hoſts, that tryeſt the righteous, and ſeeſt the reins and the heart, unto thee have I opened my Cauſe,</hi> Ch. 20.12. and with St. <hi>Peter, God which knoweth the hearts bare them witneſs,</hi> Acts 15.8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This renders all the deep and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Policies of Wicked Men a vain thing. <hi>The Lord knows the Thoughts of men that they are vanity,</hi> Pſal. 94.11. They are <hi>Vanity,</hi> becauſe he knows them, and can defeat them; he can <hi>bring their counſels to nought, and make their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of none effect.</hi> He is conſcious to the firſt motions of their Hearts; he <pb n="180" facs="tcp:35252:99"/>
ſees thoſe Cobwebs which they are ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and can blow them away with a Breath, he can ſnare them in their own Policies, and <hi>turn their Counſels into foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs.</hi> Thou that putteſt a Mask up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wicked Deſign, and hideſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge of thine Heart, under a diſſembling Countenance, God ſees thy Deſign, and hath a thouſand ways to prevent it. When the Politicians of the World think they have laid their Deſign ſure, with all imaginable cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that their Counſels cannot miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, being out of all poſſibility of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſcovery or prevention, for all this <hi>their counſels</hi> may <hi>come to nought,</hi> and tho' <hi>they have reſolved it,</hi> yet it may <hi>not ſtand; he that ſits in the heavens laughs at them, the Lord hath them in deriſion.</hi> As Wiſe as they are, they are guilty of this over-ſight, that they did not take God into conſideration, by whom they are ſurprized and diſcovered. He that ſees their Deſign can blaſt it in a moment; he can <hi>ſpeak the word,</hi> and <hi>thy breath ſhall go forth, and thou ſhalt return to thy duſt; and in that very day thy thoughts periſh,</hi> Pſal. 146.4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If God only knows the Hearts of Men, then <hi>what art</hi> thou, <hi>O man! that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:35252:99"/>
judgeſt another's heart?</hi> This condemns the Uncharitableneſs of Men, who take upon them to judge and cenſure Mens Hearts, which is <hi>to ſpeak evil of the things which they know not</hi>; to meddle with things which do not fall under their cognizance. What St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith ch. 4.12. <hi>There is one law-giver, that is able to ſave and to deſtroy; who art thou that judgeſt another?</hi> is proportionably true in this caſe; there is but <hi>one that knows the heart; who art thou then that judgeſt another Man's heart?</hi> Who art thou, O Man! that takeſt upon thee to ſit in judgment upon thy Brother, and to paſs Sentence upon his Heart, to pronounce him a Hypocrite, a wicked Man, and a damned Wretch? Art thou <hi>a Man,</hi> and <hi>the ſon of Man,</hi> and wilt thou aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to thy ſelf the Prerogative of <hi>God</hi>? Man can only look to the <hi>outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>; but <hi>God ſeeth the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There's nothing doth more palpably diſcover the Un-chriſtian Spirit of that new Sect which is of late riſen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, than their taking upon them to judge Men's Hearts, and as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to cenſure every Man they meet, as if they had a window into his Breaſt: But they are not alone guilty of this;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:35252:100"/>
thoſe who are ſo ready to call Men Hypocrites, they invade this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of God. We may pronounce an action wicked, if it be contrary to the Rule; or a Man wicked, as to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, if the general courſe of his Life and Actions be wicked; for our Saviour tells us, <hi>by their Fruits ye ſhall know them</hi>; this we may do, provided we be called to it, and be ſure it is ſo: but to call any Man an Hypocrite, who makes an outward profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whoſe external Converſation is unblameable; this is to judge a Man in a matter of which thou canſt have no Evidence; this is <hi>to aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and ſtep into <hi>the Throne of God, and to be like the moſt high</hi>; for <hi>he, even he only, knows the hearts of the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. From God's Knowledge of Future Events, we may learn,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Vanity of Aſtrology, and all other Arts that pretend to foretell future Events, things that depend on the Will of Free Agents. The vanity of theſe Arts hath been ſufficiently ſhewn by Learned Men, from the Weakneſs and Uncertainty of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they rely upon; I ſhall only for
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:35252:100"/>
the preſent take notice, that it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts this Principle of Religon, that <hi>God only knows future events.</hi> From pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Collections and Obſervations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjectures may be made of what will happen in ſome Caſes; but there are no certain Proſpective-Glaſſes, with which we can ſee Future Events, but Divine Revelation; therefore whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever takes upon him to foretell Future Events without Divine Revelation, he arrogates to himſelf that which is the Prerogative of the Deity; and God delights to chaſtiſe the Curioſity, and croſs the Predictions of theſe vain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.24, 25. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord that formed thee, I am the Lord that maketh all things, that ſtretcheth forth the Heavens alone, that ſpreadeth abroad the Earth by my ſelf: that fruſtrateth the tokens of the Lyars, and maketh Diviners mad; that turneth wiſe-men backward, and maketh their knowledge fooliſh.</hi> As he alſo in Scripture threatens thoſe who conſult them, and rely upon them. Thoſe who go to Aſtrologers, or Wiſe Men, as they call them, to know their Fortunes, and enquire of the Events of their Life, they <hi>forſake God,</hi> and <hi>betake themſelves to lying vanities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:35252:101"/>2. Refer future Things to God who only knows them, truſt him with all Events; <hi>caſt your care upon him.</hi> When you have uſed your beſt Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Wiſdom, and Diligence for your Supply and Security for the future, leave the reſt to God, <hi>for your Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father knoweth</hi> both your Wants and your Dangers. When we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolicitous about future Things, we take God's proper Work out of his Hands, and uſurp the Government of the World. Why do we <hi>take too much upon us? We are but of yeſterday,</hi> and <hi>know not what will be to morrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mind your preſent Duty and Work, and leave Events to God. <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord our God; but thoſe things that are revealed, to us and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for ever, to do all the words of his law,</hi> Deut. 29.29. Do your Duty, <hi>commit</hi> the reſt <hi>to God in well-doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this World we are in a mixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is made up of Good and Evil, of Happineſs and Miſery; what is good for us to know, is revealed, that is our Duty; but in great Wiſdom and pity to Mankind, God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed and hid the reſt from us. He hath hid from us the Good that may happen
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:35252:101"/>
to us, becauſe the beſt things of this World are but ſhallow and empty, and if we could ſee them before-hand, we ſhould prevent our ſelves in the enjoyment of them, and eat out the ſweetneſs which is in them by delightful fore-thoughts of them.

            <p>I, AM treating of the Attributes of God; particularly of thoſe which relate to the Divine Underſtanding, his <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> The <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of God only implies his bare Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of things, but his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> implies the skill of ordering and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing things to the beſt Ends and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the skill of making and governing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:35252:103"/>
and adminiſtring all things in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Weight, and Meaſure. The <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of God rather conſiders things abſolutely, and in themſelves: The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God conſiders rather the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and Relations of Things, looks upon things under the Notion of Means, and Ends; accordingly I deſcribed them thus. The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God is a Perfect comprehenſion of the Nature of all things, with all their Qualities, Powers, and Circumſtances. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God is a perfect Comprehenſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and Relations of things one to another; of their Harmony and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, their fitneſs and unfitneſs to ſuch and ſuch Ends. I have largely ſpoken to the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe; I come now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; together with his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,</hi> as they are here joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I begin with the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>God is the only wiſe God.</hi> In handling of this, I ſhall ſhew</p>
            <p n="1">1. In what ſenſe God may be ſaid to be the <hi>only wiſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Prove that this Attribute belongs to God.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:35252:103"/>1. In what ſenſe God may be ſaid to be <hi>the only wiſe God.</hi> For anſwer to this, we may take Notice, that there are ſome Perfections of God that are <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable</hi> to the Creatures; as his <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi> and <hi>Eternity.</hi> Theſe God only poſſeſſeth, and they are to be attributed to him alone, God only is <hi>independent</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi>: But there are other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which are <hi>communicable,</hi> that is, which the Creatures may in ſome meaſure and degree partake of, as <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and the like; yet theſe the Scriptures do peculiarly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to God, not that they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incommunicable to the Creature, but that they belong to God in ſuch a peculiar and Divine manner, as doth ſhut out the Creature from any claim or Title to them, in that degree and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection wherein God poſſeſſeth them. I ſhall give you ſome inſtances of this. His <hi>goodneſs,</hi> this is reſerved to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Why calleſt thou me good? there is none good, but one, that is God:</hi> His <hi>power</hi> and <hi>immortality,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.15, 16. <hi>Who is the bleſſed and only potentate; who only hath immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi>:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:35252:104"/>
His <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17. <hi>The only wiſe God</hi>; Rom. 16.27. <hi>To God only wiſe be Glory:</hi> His <hi>Holineſs</hi> Rev. 15.14. <hi>For thou only art Holy.</hi> The tranſcendent degree and ſingularity of theſe Divine Perfections which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, is beyond what we are able to conceive; ſo that altho' the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures partake of them, yet in that Degree and Perfection wherein God poſſeſſeth them, they are peculiar and proper to the Deity; ſo that in this ſenſe, <hi>there is none good but God</hi>; he only is <hi>holy,</hi> he is <hi>the only wiſe</hi>; in ſo inconceiveable a manner doth God poſſeſs even thoſe Perfections which in ſome degree he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and we can only underſtand them as he communicates them, and not as he poſſeſſeth them; ſo that when we conſider of any of theſe Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, we muſt not frame Notions of them, contrary to what they are in the Creature; but we muſt ſay that the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God are all this which is in the Creature, and much more which I am not able to comprehend.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed in general, God may be ſaid to be <hi>only wiſe</hi> in theſe <hi>two</hi> reſpects.</p>

            <p>Nothing in Oppoſition to it; <hi>Job</hi> 5.13. <hi>He taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs.</hi> Job 9.4. <hi>He is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength; who hath hardned himſelf againſt him, and proſper'd.</hi> Prov. 21.30. <hi>There is no Wiſdom, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, againſt the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.19. <hi>He will deſtroy the Wiſdom of the Wiſe</hi>; v. 29. <hi>and by fooliſh things confound the wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing in Compariſon of it. There are a great many that pretend to Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but moſt are deſtitute of true Wiſdom; and thoſe who have it, they have it with many Imperfections and Diſadvantages. Uſually thoſe who are deſtitute of true Wiſdom pretend moſt to it, <hi>Job</hi> 11.12. <hi>Vain Man would be wiſe, tho' he be born like a wild Aſſe's colt.</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:35252:105"/>
The High and the Great of this World pretend to it, <hi>Job</hi> 32.9. <hi>Great Men are not always Wiſe.</hi> Learned Men they pretend to it; the heathen Philoſophers were great profeſſers of Wiſdom, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools,</hi> they were <hi>wiſe to do evil, but to do good they had no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> As the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22. The Politicians of the World they pretend to it; but theirs is rather a <hi>Craftineſs</hi> than a <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; Men call it <hi>Prudence,</hi> but they are glad to uſe many Arts to ſet it off, and make it look like Wiſdom; by Silence, and Secreſie, and Formality, and affected Gravity, and Nods, and Geſtures. The Scripture calls it <hi>the Wiſdom of this World,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.6. and a <hi>fleſhly Wiſdom,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. 'Tis Wiſdom miſapply'd, 'tis the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of a wrong End. The petty Plots and Deſigns of this World are far from Wiſdom, 1 Cor. 3.20. <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the Wiſe, that they are vain.</hi> That cannot be Wiſdom, which miſtakes its great End, which minds mean Things, and neglects thoſe which are of greateſt Concernment to them. <hi>Job</hi> 22.2. <hi>He that is Wiſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himſelf.</hi> Prov. 9.12. <hi>If thou
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:35252:106"/>
be Wiſe, thou ſhalt be Wiſe for thy ſelf. Tully</hi> tells us, <hi>Ennius</hi> was wont to ſay <hi>Nequicquam ſapere ſapientem, qui ſibi ipſi prodeſſe non quiret.</hi> The wiſe <hi>Sages</hi> of the World as to the beſt things are Fools, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.25. <hi>God hath hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent.</hi> There are many that are <hi>wiſe in their own Conceits, but there is more hope of a Fool than of them,</hi> Prov. 26.12. So that the greateſt part of that which paſſeth for Wiſdom among Men is quite another thing. <hi>Nihil tam valde vulgare quàm nihil ſapere</hi>; we talk much of Prodigies, <hi>maximum portentum vir ſapiens, Tul.</hi> Thoſe few in the World that are <hi>the Children of true Wiſdom,</hi> they have it in a very imperfect degree, they are not uſually ſo wiſe for their Souls, and for Eternity, as Men of this World, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.8. <hi>The Children of this World are in their Generation wiſer than the Children of Light.</hi> It is attended with many inconveniencies, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.18. <hi>in much wiſdom there is much grief</hi>; he ſpeaks of the wiſdom about natural things.</p>
            <p>But we need not inſtance in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of wicked Men, and worldly Men, and in the imperfect degrees of Wiſdom which are to be found in good Men,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:35252:106"/>
in <hi>Wiſdom's</hi> own <hi>Children</hi>; the Wiſdom of God needs not theſe foils to ſet it off: the Wiſdom of Man in Innocency, or of the higheſt Angel in Heaven, bears no proportion to the un-erring and infinite Wiſdom of God. We mortal men many times miſtake our End out of Ignorance, apply unfit and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means for accompliſhing good Ends; the Angels in Glory have not a perfect comprehenſion of the harmony and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of things, of the unfitneſs and oppoſition of them one to another: but the Divine Wiſdom propounds to it ſelf the higheſt and beſt Ends, and hath a perfect comprehenſion of the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unfitneſs of all things one to another; ſo that Angels are but fooliſh Beings to God; <hi>Job</hi> 4.17. <hi>His Angels he chargeth with folly. Job,</hi> upon a full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after Wiſdom, concludes that it belongs only to God, that he only is perfectly poſſeſt of it, <hi>Job</hi> 28.12. <hi>&amp;c.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. From the dictates of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I have often told you the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of God are not to be proved by way of <hi>demonſtration,</hi> becauſe there is no Cauſe of them; but by way of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> by ſhewing the abſurdity and inconvenience of the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Contrary is an Imperfection, and argues many other Imperfections, therefore Wiſdom belongs to God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men Folly is look'd upon as the greateſt defect; it is accounted a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reproach and Diſgrace, than Vice and Wickedneſs; it is of ſo ill a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in the World, that there are not many but had rather be accounted Knaves than Fools; but in a true E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and Value of things, it is, next to Wickedneſs, the greateſt Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and, on the contrary, Wiſdom is the higheſt Perfection next to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs; it is uſually more cryed up in the World than any thing elſe. Reaſon tells us, tho' the Scripture had not ſaid it, that <hi>wiſdom excells folly as much as light doth darkneſs,</hi> Eccl. 2.13. <hi>The wiſdom of a man maketh his Face
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:35252:107"/>
to ſhine,</hi> Eccl. 8.1. <hi>Wiſdom is a defence,</hi> 7.12. and <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Wiſdom ſtrengthneth the wiſe more than ten mighty men that are in the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the denyal of this Perfection to God would argue many other Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; it would be an univerſal Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to the Divine Nature, and would darken all his other Perfections. It would weaken the Power of God. How impotent and ineffectual would Power be without Wiſdom! what irregular things would it produce! what untow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Combinations of Effects would there be, if Infinite Power ſhould act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conduct and Direction of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom! It would eclipſe the Providence of God, and put out the <hi>Eyes</hi> that are in the <hi>Wheels,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet repreſents God's Providence. There can be no Counſel, no Fore-caſt, no orderly Government of the World without Wiſdom. The Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Juſtice, and Truth of God, could not ſhine with that luſtre, were it not for his Wiſdom which doth illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate theſe with ſo much advantage.</p>
            <p>I need not bring Teſtimonies from Heathen Writers to confirm this, their Books are full of Expreſſions of their admiration of God's wiſe Government
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:35252:108"/>
of the World. I will not trouble you with Quotations of particular Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. <hi>Epicurus</hi> indeed denyed that God either made or govern'd the World; but he muſt needs acknowledge him to have been a very wiſe Being, becauſe he made him happy, which cannot be without Wiſdom, tho' he had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all other evidence of his Wiſdom. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to have ſuppoſed the World to be a neceſſary reſult and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation from God: but then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sects of Philoſophers did ſuppoſe the World to be the free Product of God's Goodneſs and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From Scripture; <hi>Job.</hi> 9.4. <hi>He is wiſe in heart</hi>; 36.5. <hi>He is mighty in ſtrength and wiſdom.</hi> Dan. 2.20. <hi>Bleſſed be the name of God for ever and ever, for wiſdom and might are his.</hi> Hither we may refer thoſe Texts which attribute Wiſdom of God in a ſingular and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.27. and thoſe which ſpeak of God as the Fountain of it, who communicates and beſtows it upon his Creatures, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. <hi>James</hi> 1.5. and thoſe Texts which ſpeak of the Wiſdom of God in the Creation of the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24. <hi>O Lord, how wonderful are thy works, in wiſdom haſt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:35252:108"/>
thou made them all</hi>; Jer. 10.12. <hi>who hath eſtabliſht the world by his wiſdom, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth the heavens by his diſcretion</hi>; in the Providence and Government of the World, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Wiſdom and ſtrength are his, and he changeth times and ſeaſons, he removeth Kings and ſetteth up Kings</hi>; and in many other places; in the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind; therefore Chriſt is called <hi>the Wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. and the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, <hi>the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wiſdom of God, and the manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> Eph. 2.10.</p>
            <p>If then God be <hi>only wiſe,</hi> the <hi>Original</hi> and only Fountain of it, from hence we learn,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To go to him for it. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>If any man lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God.</hi> There are many conceited Men, that think they are Rich and increaſed, and ſtand in need of nothing. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth not ſpeak as if there were ſome that did not want Wiſdom, but becauſe there are ſome ſo proud and conceited, that they think that they lack nothing; thoſe are ſtark Fools, and God <hi>reſiſts</hi> ſuch fooliſh and proud Men: but if any Man, ſenſible of his Defect and Imperfection, cometh to God, <hi>he gives liberally and upbraids no man.</hi> We
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:35252:109"/>
are aſhamed to learn Wiſdom of Men, leſt they ſhould contemn and upbraid us with our Folly; Men are envious and unwilling that others ſhould be as wiſe as themſelves: but God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes him willing to impart Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>he gives liberally, and upbraids no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the moſt deſirable Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and Perfection; <hi>happy is the man that getteth wiſdom; wiſdom is the principal thing, therefore get wiſdom</hi>; it is better than thoſe things that are of higheſt value among men, as <hi>Solomon</hi> often makes the Compariſon. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it comes down from above,</hi> we ſhould <hi>look up</hi> for it; it's by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Will, and the wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of his Word, that we are made <hi>wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> therefore we ſhould beg of him, that <hi>he would give us the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of himſelf,</hi> Eph. 1.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If God be <hi>only Wiſe</hi> in ſuch an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and tranſcendent Degree, then let us be humble. There's no cauſe <hi>of boaſting,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>we have nothing but what we have receiv'd.</hi> The loweſt inſtance, the leaſt ſpecimen of Divine Wiſdom out-ſhines the higheſt pitch of Humane Wiſdom; <hi>the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:35252:109"/>
of God is wiſer than men,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.25. therefore <hi>let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom,</hi> Jer. 9.29. Of all things we ſhould not be proud of Wiſdom; the proud man throws down the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Wiſdom, by the way that he would raiſe it. No ſuch evidence of our Folly, as as a conceit that we are Wiſe; <hi>ſapientis animus nunquam tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſcit, nunquam tumet, Cic.</hi> To pride our ſelves in our own Wiſdom, is the way to have our Folly made manifeſt. God threatens <hi>to deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe man,</hi> and <hi>to turn their wiſdom into fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhould labour to partake of the Wiſdom of God, ſo far as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable. The greateſt Wiſdom that we are capable of, is to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Good and Evil; <hi>to be wiſe to that which is good,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.19. that is, to provide for the future in time, to make proviſion for Eternity, to think of our latter end, to fear God and obey him, to be pure and peaceable, to receive inſtruction, and to win Souls; theſe are the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which the Scripture gives of Wiſdom. When <hi>Job</hi> had declared that the excellency of the Divine Wiſdom
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:35252:110"/>
was not to be attained by men; he tells us what that Wiſdom is, which is proper for us; <hi>And unto man he ſaid, the fear of the Lord that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil, that is underſtanding.</hi> There are many that are wiſe to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ends and Purpoſes, as our Saviour tells us, wiſe to get Riches, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to Honours: But this is not the wiſdom which we are to labour after; this is but a ſhort-witted Prudence, to ſerve a preſent turn, without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the future, without regard to the next World, and the Eternity which we are to live in; this is to be wiſe for a moment, and fools for ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If God be only Wiſe, then put your Truſt and Confidence in him. Whom ſhould we truſt rather than Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which manageth and directs Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs and Power? In all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of difficulty truſt him for direction, <hi>acknowledge him in all thy ways,</hi> that he may <hi>direct thy ſteps, commit thy way unto the Lord, and lean not to thine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. The race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battel to the ſtrong,</hi> but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God diſpoſeth all theſe things. And if we rely upon our own Wiſdom, that will prove <hi>a broken reed.</hi> And as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:35252:110"/>
our own Wiſdom is a broken Reed, ſo the Wiſdom of other men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1, 2. God curſeth them that <hi>go down into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and truſt to their ſtrength and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but look not to the holy one of Iſrael, neither ſeek the Lord; yet he alſo is wiſe,</hi> ſaith the Prophet.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us adore the Wiſdom of God, and ſay with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17. <hi>To the only wiſe God be honour and glory, for ever and ever Amen</hi>; and with <hi>Daniel, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the name of God for ever and ever, for wiſdom and might are his.</hi> Veneration is the acknowledgement of an Infinite Excellency and Perfection. We reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence any extraordinary degree of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Men; but the Divine Wiſdom which is Perfect and Infinite, is matter of our Adoration, and Bleſſing, and Praiſe. <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> reſpects the Benefits we receive: but we <hi>bleſs</hi> God when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any Excellency; for as God's <hi>Bleſſing</hi> us is to do us good, ſo our <hi>Bleſſing</hi> him is to ſpeak good of him; and as all God's Perfections are the Objects of our <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> ſo more eſpecially his Wiſdom is of our <hi>Praiſe</hi>; for to praiſe God is to take notice of the wiſe Deſign and Contrivance of his Goodneſs and Mercy towards us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:35252:111"/>Before I paſs on to the other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars contained in theſe words, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice that this <hi>wiſe God,</hi> here ſpoken of, is ſtiled <hi>our Saviour,</hi> which ſome underſtand of <hi>our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and bring this place as an Argument to prove his Divinity; and if that were ſo, it were all one to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which is in the next place to ſhew that <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> belong to the Divine Being. But altho' I would not willingly part with any place that may fairly be brought for the proof of the Divinity of Chriſt, yet ſeeing there are ſo many plain Texts in Scripture for the proof of it, we have the leſs reaſon to ſtretch doubtful places; and that this is ſo, will appear to any one who conſiders that the Title of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> is ſeveral times in Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God the Father; beſides that in a very Ancient and Authentick Copy, we find the words read ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what otherwiſe, and ſo as to put this out of all Controverſie, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having premiſed thus much for the clearing of theſe words, I ſhall briefly conſider, <hi>firſt</hi> God's <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty,</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:35252:111"/>
and then his <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> God's <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty.</hi> By <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> we may underſtand the greatneſs, or eminent excellency of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which reſults from his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and whereby the Divine Nature is ſet and placed infinitely above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beings; I ſay the eminent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Divine Nature, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from his Perfections, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from thoſe great Perfections, his Goodneſs, and Wiſdom, and Power, and Holineſs.</p>
            <p>And his <hi>Glory</hi> is a manifeſtation of this Excellency, and a juſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and due opinion of it. Hence it is, that in Scripture God is ſaid to be <hi>glorious in power,</hi> and <hi>glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and his Goodneſs is call'd <hi>his glory</hi>; and here in the Text, <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> are aſcribed to him upon the account of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That theſe belong to God, I ſhall prove,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the acknowledgment of Natural Light. The Heathens did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly aſcribe Greatneſs to God, and that as reſulting chiefly from his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as appears by their frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of theſe two Attributes, <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:35252:112"/>
and <hi>Greatneſs. Opt. Max.</hi> were their moſt familiar Titles of the Deity; to which I will add that known place of <hi>Seneca, primus deorum cultus eſt deos crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, dein reddere illis majeſtatem ſuam, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere bonitatem, ſine quâ nulla majeſtas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From Scripture. It were endleſs to produce all thoſe Texts wherein Greatneſs and Glory are aſcribed to God. I ſhall mention two or three. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17. <hi>the Lord is a great God; Pſal.</hi> 24.10. he's call'd <hi>the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; 104, 1. he is ſaid to be <hi>cloathed with majeſty and honour. The whole Earth is full of his glory.</hi> Hither belong all thoſe Doxologies in the Old and New Teſtament, wherein Greatneſs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Majeſty are aſcribed to God.</p>
            <p>From all which we may learn,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is that makes a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon great and glorious, and what is the way to Majeſty, <hi>viz. real worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,</hi> and particularly that kind of excellency which Creatures are capable of in a very eminent degree, and that is <hi>goodneſs</hi>; this is that which advanceth a Perſon, and gives him a pre-eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy above all others; this caſts a luſtre upon a man, and <hi>makes his face to ſhine. Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that <hi>Honour</hi> is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:35252:112"/>
nothing elſe but the <hi>ſignification of the eſteem which we have of a Perſon for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be good,</hi> and <hi>to do good, is the higheſt glory.</hi> God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is his higheſt Glory; and there is nothing ſo glorious in any Creature, as herein to be like God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us give God the Glory which is due to his Name; <hi>Aſcribe ye greatneſs to our God,</hi> Deut. 32.3. <hi>Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and power,</hi> Pſal. 29.1. The Glory and Majeſty of God calls for our Eſteem and Honour, our Fear and Reverence of him. Thus we ſhould <hi>glorifie God in our Spirits,</hi> by an inward eſteem and reverence of his Majeſty. The thoughts of Earthly Majeſty will compoſe us to reverence: how much more ſhould the Apprehenſions of the Divine Majeſty ſtrike an awe upon our Spirits in all our Addreſſes to him? <hi>his excellency</hi> ſhould <hi>make us afraid,</hi> and keep us from all ſaucy boldneſs and familiarity with him. Reverence is an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſtance which is between the Majeſty of God and our meanneſs. And we ſhould <hi>glorifie him in our bodies,</hi> with outward Worſhip and Adoration; that is, by all external ſignifications of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:35252:113"/>
reverence and reſpect; and we ſhould glorifie him in our Lives and Actions. The higheſt glory a Creature can give to God, is to endeavour to be like him; <hi>ſatis illos coluit, quiſquis imitatus eſt,</hi> Sen. hereby we manifeſt and ſhew forth his Excellency to the World, when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be conformed to the Divine Perfections. And in caſe of ſin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, we are to give glory to God by repentance, which is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his Holineſs, who hates ſin; and of his Juſtice, which will puniſh it; and of the mercy of God, which is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pardon it; for it <hi>is the glory of God to paſs by a provocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhould take heed of robbing God of his Glory, by giving it to any Creature, by aſcribing thoſe Titles, or that Worſhip to any Creature, which is due to God alone. This is the Reaſon which is given of the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>I the Lord am a jealous God</hi>; God is jealous of his Honour, <hi>and will not give his glory to another, nor his Praiſe to graven Images,</hi> Iſa. 42.8. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we find the Apoſtle reproves the Idolatry of the Heathens, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they debaſed the eſteem of God, and did ſhew they had unworthy thoughts
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:35252:113"/>
of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 23. <hi>When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but became vain in their imaginations. And changed the glory of the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible God into an image made like to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible man, and to birds and four-footed beaſts, and creeping things.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they denyed the glorious Excellency of the Divine Nature; that is, that he is a Spirit, and ſo incapable of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by any material or ſenſible I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I come now to ſpeak of the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> of God. In which I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> What we are to underſtand by the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> of God. By theſe we mean the full and abſolute Right and Title and Authority which God hath to, and over all his Creatures, as his Creatures, and made by him. And this Right reſults from the Effects of that Goodneſs, and Power, and Wiſdom whereby all things are and were made; from whence there doth accrew to God a <hi>Soveraign</hi> Right and Title to all his Creatures, and a full and abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them; that is ſuch a Right and Authority which doth not depend upon any Superior, nor is ſubject and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:35252:114"/>
to any for any thing that he does to any of his Creatures. And this is that which is call'd <hi>ſummum imperium,</hi> becauſe there is no power above it to check or control it, and therefore there can be none greater than this. And it is <hi>abſolute,</hi> becauſe all the Creatures have what they have from God, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his Goodneſs, and therefore they owe all poſſible Duty and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Subjection ſo long as they continue in Being, becauſe it is ſolely by his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Goodneſs that they continue; and therefore whatever Right or Title any one can pretend to any Perſon or Thing, <hi>that</hi> God hath to all things, <hi>in Deo omnes tituli omnia jura concurrunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a full Right and Title and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in all his Creatures, and an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority over them, to govern them and diſpoſe of them, and deal with them in any way he pleaſeth, that is not contrary to his eſſential Dignity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or repugnant to the Natural State and Condition of the Creature.</p>
            <p>And for our better underſtanding of this, and the preventing of Miſtakes which Men are apt to fall into about the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of God, I will ſhew,
<list>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:35252:114"/>
                  <item>I. Wherein it doth not conſiſt. And,</item>
                  <item>II. Wherein it doth conſiſt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Wherein it doth not conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not in a Right to gratifie and delight himſelf in the extreme Miſery of innocent and undeſerving Creatures; I ſay, not in a <hi>right</hi>; for the <hi>right</hi> that God hath in his Creatures is founded in the Benefits he hath conferred upon them, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation they have to him upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Now there's none, who becauſe he hath done a Benefit, can have, by vertue of <hi>that,</hi> a <hi>right</hi> to do a greater Evil than the Good which he hath done amounts to; and I think it next to mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to doubt whether extreme and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Miſery be not a greater Evil, than ſimple Being is a Good. I know they call it <hi>phyſical goodneſs</hi>; but I do not underſtand how any thing is the better for being call'd by a hard Name. For what can there be that is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>deſirable</hi> in <hi>Being,</hi> when it only ſerves to be a foundation of the greateſt and moſt laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Miſery</hi>? and we may ſafely ſay, that the juſt God will never challenge more than <hi>an equitable right.</hi> God doth not claim any <hi>ſuch ſoveraignty</hi> to himſelf, as to cruſh and oppreſs innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

without a cauſe, and to make them miſerable without a provocation. And becauſe it ſeems ſome have been very apt to entertain ſuch groundleſs Jealouſies and unworthy Thoughts of God, he hath given us his Oath to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us of the contrary. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn and live.</hi> So far is he from taking Pleaſure in the miſery and ruin of innocent Creatures, that in caſe of ſin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, he would be much rather plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if ſinners would, by Repentance, avoid and eſcape his Juſtice, than that they ſhould fall under it. The good God cannot be glorified or pleaſed in doing Evil to any, where Juſtice doth not require it; nothing is further from infinite Goodneſs than to rejoice in Evil. We account him a Tyrant and a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Men, and of a deviliſh temper, that can do ſo; and we cannot do a greater Injury to the good God, than to paint him out after ſuch a horrid and deformed manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> of God doth not conſiſt in impoſing Laws upon his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are impoſſible either to be underſtood or obſerved by them. For
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:35252:115"/>
this would not only be contrary to the dignity of the Divine Nature, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the nature of a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, in reaſon, cannot be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by any Power to impoſſibilities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> of God doth not conſiſt in a liberty to tempt Men to Evil, or by any inevitable Decree to neceſſitate them to ſin, or effectually to procure the ſins of Men, and to puniſh them for them. For as this would be contrary to the Holineſs, and Juſtice, and Goodneſs of God; ſo to the nature of a reaſonable Creature, who cannot be guilty or deſerve Puniſhment for what it cannot help. And men cannot eaſily have a blacker thought of God, than to imagin that he hath, from all Eternity, carried on a ſecret Deſign to circumvent the greateſt part of men into deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and underhand to draw Men into a Plot againſt Heaven, that by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy practice he may raiſe a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of glory to his Juſtice. There's no generous and good man, but would ſpit in that man's Face that ſhould charge him with ſuch a Deſign: and if they who are but very drops of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in compariſon of God, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Ocean of Goodneſs, would take it
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:35252:116"/>
for ſuch a Reproach; ſhall we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <hi>that</hi> to the beſt Being in the World, which we would deteſt and abominate in our ſelves?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Wherein the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of God doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a right to diſpoſe of, and deal with his Creatures in any way that doth not contradict the Eſſential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, and the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Creature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In a right to impoſe what Laws he pleaſeth upon his Creatures, whether natural and reaſonable; or poſitive, of Tryal of Obedience, provided they contradict not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God or of the Creature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In a right to inflict due and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Puniſhment in caſe of provocation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In a right to afflict any of his Creatures, ſo the Evil he inflicts be ſhort of the Benefits he hath conferred on them; yea, and farther, in a right when he pleaſeth to annihilate the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and turn it out of Being, if it ſhould ſo ſeem good to him, tho' that Creature have not offended him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what he gave was his own, and he may without injury take it away again when he pleaſeth. In theſe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:35252:116"/>
the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of God conſiſts, and if there be any thing elſe that can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the eſſential Perfections of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Proof and Confirmation of this. This is univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by the Heathens, that God is <hi>the Lord and Soveraign of the World, and of all Creatures.</hi> Hence <hi>Plato</hi> calls him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and <hi>Tully, omnium rerum Dominum, Lord of all</hi>; and this the Scripture doth every where attribute to him, calling him <hi>Lord of all, King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords</hi>; to which we may refer all thoſe Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologies, in which Power, and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Authority are aſcribed to God. I will only mention that eminent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> a great King, who, when his Underſtanding came to him, was forced to acknowledge that <hi>God was the moſt high,</hi> Dan. 4.34, 35. I infer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Negatively, we cannot, from the <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> of God, infer a right to do any thing that is unſuitable to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we are to reſt ſatisfied with ſuch a Notion of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> in God, as doth not plainly
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:35252:117"/>
and directly contradict all the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that we have of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>: nay it would be little leſs than a horrid and dreadful Blaſphemy, to ſay that God can, out of his Soveraign Will and Pleaſure, do any thing that contradicts the Nature of God, and the eſſential Perfections of the Deity; or to imagin that the Pleaſure and Will of the Holy, and Juſt, and Good God is not always regulated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the eſſential and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Laws of Goodneſs, and Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Poſitively; we may infer from the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> of God,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we ought to own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God for <hi>our Lord</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> who by creating us, and giving us all that we have, did create to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Right in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we owe to him the utmoſt poſſibility of our Love, <hi>to love him with all our hearts, and ſouls, and ſtrength</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Souls that we have he gave us; and that we are in a capacity to love him, is his Gift; and when we render theſe to him, we do but give him of his own.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:35252:117"/>3. We owe to him all imaginable ſubjection, and obſervance, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and are with all diligence, to the utmoſt of our endeavours, to conform our ſelves to his Will, and to thoſe Laws which he hath impoſed upon us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In caſe of Offence and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we are without murmuring, to ſubmit to what he ſhall inflict upon us, <hi>to accept of the puniſhment of our iniquity,</hi> and <hi>patiently to bear the indignation of the Lord,</hi> becauſe we have ſinned againſt <hi>him,</hi> who is <hi>our Lord and Soveraign.</hi>

            <p>I Am treating of the Attributes and Properties of God, particularly thoſe which relate to the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which I told you are his <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> I have finiſht the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God. The laſt Day I ſpake concerning the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God in general; but there are <hi>Three</hi> eminent Arguments, and famous Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God's <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a more large and particular handling. The Wiſdom of God ſhines forth in the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, in the <hi>Government</hi> of it, and in the <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:35252:119"/>
of Mankind by Jeſus Chriſt. Of theſe <hi>Three</hi> I ſhall ſpeak ſeverally.</p>
            <p>I begin with the <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Argument of God's <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which the <hi>Creation</hi> doth furniſh us withal. In this viſible frame of the World which we behold with our Eyes, which way ſoever we look, we are encountred with ocular demonſtrations of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God. What the Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>Power</hi> of God is true likewiſe of his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Rom. 1.20. <hi>The inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God-head</hi>: ſo the <hi>eternal wiſdom</hi> of God is underſtood <hi>by the things which are made.</hi> Now the <hi>Creation</hi> is an Argument of the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God, as it is an effect of admirable Counſel and Wiſdom. As any curious Work, or rare Engine doth argue the Wit of the Artificer; ſo the variety, and order, and regularity, and fitneſs of the Works of God, argue the <hi>infinite wiſdom</hi> of him who made them; a Work ſo beautiful and magnificent, ſuch a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pile as Heaven and Earth is, ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſeveral pieces of it, ſo harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in all its parts, every part ſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſervice of the whole, and each
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:35252:119"/>
part for the ſervice of another; is not this a plain Argument that there was <hi>infinite wiſdom</hi> in the contrivance of this Frame?</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall endeavour to prove to you that this Frame of Things which we ſee with our Eyes, which we call the <hi>World,</hi> or the <hi>Creation,</hi> is contrived af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beſt manner, and hath upon it evident impreſſions of Counſel and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I grant the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and that many of the Ends and Deſigns of his <hi>wiſdom</hi> are <hi>unſearchable, and paſt finding out,</hi> both in the Works of Creation and Providence; and that <hi>tho' a Wiſe man ſeek to find out the work of God from the beginning to the end, he ſhall not be able to do it</hi>; and we ſhall never be able to exhauſt all the various Wiſdom and Contrivance which is in the Works of God; tho' the oftner and the nearer we meditate upon them, the more we ſhall ſee to admire in them; the more we ſtudy this Book of the Creation, the more we ſhall be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd at the Wiſdom of the Author: but this doth not hinder but that we may diſcover ſomething of the Wiſdom of God, tho' it be Infinite. As the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>Infinite Power</hi> may fall under our
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:35252:120"/>
               <hi>Senſes,</hi> ſo the Deſigns of <hi>Infinite Wiſdom</hi> may fall under our <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi>; and when things appear to our beſt Reaſon, plainly to be order'd for the beſt, and the greateſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the World and Mankind, ſo far as we are able to judge; and if they had been otherwiſe, as they might have been a hundred thouſand ways, they would not have been ſo well; we ought to conclude, that things are thus, and not otherwiſe, is the reſult of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Wiſdom of God in the Creation will appear by conſidering the Works of God. Thoſe who have ſtudied Nature can diſcourſe theſe things more exactly and particularly. It would require perfect skill in <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the motions and order of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodies; and in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> to read Lectures of the rare contrivance of the Bodies of living Creatures. But this, as it is beyond my ability, ſo it would probably be above moſt of your Capacities; therefore I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf with ſome general and more obvious inſtances of the Divine Wiſdom, which ſhine forth ſo clear in his Works, that <hi>he that runs may read it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:35252:120"/>1. I ſhall take a ſhort ſurvey of the ſeveral parts of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Single out Man the Maſter-piece of the viſible Creation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we ſurvey the World, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel over the ſeveral parts of it in our thoughts, we ſhall find that all things in it are made with the greateſt exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ranged in the moſt beautiful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſerve the wiſeſt and beſt Ends.</p>
            <p>If we look up to Heaven, and take notice only there of that which is moſt viſible, the Sun; you ſee how by the wiſe order and conſtancy of its courſe it makes Day and Night, Winter and Summer. This the Pſalmiſt takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1, 2. <hi>The heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God; and the firmament ſheweth his handy work. Day unto Day ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge.</hi> It may eaſily be imagin'd many ways, how the Sun might have had another Courſe in reference to the Earth; but no Man can deviſe any other that ſhould not be very much to the prejudice of the World; ſo that this being the beſt, it is an Argument that Wiſdom had the ordering and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:35252:121"/>If we look down to the Earth, we ſhall ſee <hi>God's aſcending and deſcending</hi>; I mean clear repreſentations of Divine Wiſdom in the Treaſures that are hid in the Bowels of it, and thoſe Fruits that grow upon the ſurface of it. What vaſt Heaps, and what variety of uſeful Materials and Minerals are ſcatter'd up and down in the Earth, as one would think, with a careleſs Hand, but yet ſo wiſely diſperſt, as is moſt proper for the Neceſſities and Uſes of ſeveral Countries! Look upon the ſurface of the Earth, and you ſhall find it cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adorned with Plants of a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and admirable Frame, and Beauty, and Uſefulneſs. Look upon the vaſt Ocean, and there you may ſee the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in bridling and reſtraining that unruly Element, I mean in ſinking it below the Earth; whereas the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might have been above and cover'd the Earth, and then the Earth had been in a great meaſure uſeleſs, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of thoſe Inhabitants which now poſſeſs it.</p>
            <p>Look again upon the Earth, and in the Air, and Sea, and you ſhall find all theſe inhabited and furniſht with great ſtore of living Creatures of ſeveral kinds,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:35252:121"/>
wonderfully made in the frame of their Bodies, endowed with ſtrong inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to increaſe their kinds, and with a natural Affection and Care toward their Young ones; and every kind of theſe Creatures armed either with ſtrength or wit to oppoſe their Enemy, or ſwiftneſs to flie from him, or ſtrong Holds to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves. But the Creation is a vaſt Field, in which we may eaſily loſe our ſelves. I ſhall therefore call home our wandring Thoughts; for we need not go out of our ſelves for a proof of Divine Wiſdom. I ſhall therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Select the choiceſt piece of it, <hi>Man,</hi> who is the top and perfection of this viſible World. What is ſaid of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant, or <hi>Behemoth, Job</hi> 40.19. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the vaſt bigneſs and ſtrength of his Body, is only abſolutely true of Man, that he is <hi>divini opificii caput, the chief of the ways of God,</hi> and <hi>upon Earth there is none like him.</hi> Man is <hi>Mundi utriuſque nexus, the bond of both Worlds,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> calls him, in whom the World of Bodies, and the World of Spirits do meet, and unite; for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Body, he is related to this viſible World, and is of the Earth; but in reſpect of his Soul, he is allied to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:35252:122"/>
and deſcended from above. We have looked above us, and beneath us, and about us, upon the ſeveral repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of God's Wiſdom, and the ſeveral parts of the Creation; but we have not yet conſider'd the beſt piece of the viſible World, which we may ſpeak of, without flattery of our ſelves, and to the praiſe of our Maker. God, when he had made the World, <hi>he made man after his own Image.</hi> When he had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the other part of the Creation, he was pleaſed to ſet up this Picture of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, as a Memorial of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Now we ſhall a little more particularly conſider this piece of God's Workmanſhip, being it is better known, and more familiar to us, as it is more excellent than the reſt, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a higher inſtance of the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It is obſerved by ſome, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the parts of the Creation, God ſpeaks the word, <hi>let there be light,</hi> and <hi>let there be a firmament, and there was ſo</hi>: but when he comes to make Man, he doth, as it were, deliberate, and enter into conſultation about him; <hi>And God ſaid, let us make man in our image, after our likeneſs; and let him have dominion.</hi> Gen. 1.26; as if <hi>Man,</hi> above all the reſt,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:35252:122"/>
were the Effect and Reſult of Divine Wiſdom, and the Creature of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
            <p>Man may be conſider'd either in himſelf, and in reſpect of the Parts of which he conſiſts, Soul and Body; or with relation to the Univerſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Creation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider him in himſelf, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Soul and Body. Conſider Man in his outward and worſe part, and you ſhall find <hi>that</hi> to be admirable, even to aſtoniſhment; in reſpect of which, the Pſalmiſt cries out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.14. <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made, marvellous are thy works, and that my ſoul knoweth right well.</hi> The frame of our Bodies is ſo curiouſly wrought, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of it ſo full of Miracle, that <hi>Galen</hi> (who was otherwiſe backward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the Belief of a God) when he had anatomized Man's Body, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſurvey'd the frame of it, viewed the fitneſs and uſefulneſs of every part of it, and the many ſeveral intentions of every little Vein, and Bone, and Muſcle, and the beauty of the whole; he fell into a pang of Devotion, and wrote a Hymn to his Creator. And thoſe excellent Books of his, <hi>de uſu
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:35252:123"/>
partium, of the uſefulneſs and convenient contrivance of every part of the Body,</hi> are a moſt exact demonſtration of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, which appears in the make of our Body, of which Books, <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> ſaith, the whole work is writ with a kind of <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> The Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, in the frame of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, very much appears by a curious conſideration of the ſeveral parts of it; but that requiring a very accurate skill in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> I chuſe rather wholly to forbear it, than by my unskilfulneſs to be injurious to the Divine Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>domicilium corporis, this Houſe of our Body,</hi> tho' it be indeed a curious piece; yet it is nothing to the noble <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant</hi> that dwells in it. This <hi>Cabinet,</hi> tho' it be exquiſitely wrought, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich; yet it comes infinitely ſhort in value of the <hi>Jewel</hi> that is hid and laid up in it. How does the glorious facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reaſon and Underſtanding exalt us above the reſt of the Creatures! Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath not made that particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for Man, which it hath made for other Creatures, becauſe it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him in general, in giving him a Mind and Reaſon. Man is not born cloathed, nor armed with any
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:35252:123"/>
conſiderable Weapon for defence; but he hath Reaſon and Underſtanding to provide theſe things for himſelf; and this alone excells all the advantages of other Creatures; he can keep himſelf warmer and ſafer, he can fore-ſee Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and provide againſt them; he can provide Weapons that are better than Horns, and Teeth, and Paws, and by the advantage of his Reaſon, is too hard for all other Creatures, and can defend himſelf againſt their Violence.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the Mind of Man yet nearer, how many Arguments of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity are there in it! That there ſhould be at once in our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings diſtinct comprehenſions of ſuch variety of Objects; that it ſhould paſs in its Thoughts from Heaven to Earth in a moment, and retain the memory of things paſt, and take a proſpect of the future, and look forward as far as Eternity! Becauſe we are familiar to our ſelves, we cannot be ſtrange and wonderful to our ſelves: But the great Miracle of the World is the Mind of Man, and the contrivance of it an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Inſtance of God's Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider Man with relation to the Univerſe, and you ſhall find the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:35252:124"/>
Wiſdom of God doth appear, in that all things are made ſo uſeful for Man, who was deſign'd to be the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of this viſible World, the Gueſt whom God deſign'd principally to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain in this Houſe which he built. Not that we are to think, that God hath ſo made all things for Man, that he hath not made them at all for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and poſſibly for many other uſes than we can imagine; for we much over-value our ſelves, if we think them to be only for us; and we diminiſh the Wiſdom of God in reſtraining it to one end: but the chief and principal End of many things is the Uſe and Service of Man; and in reference to this End, you ſhall find that God hath made abundant and wiſe Proviſion.</p>
            <p>More particularly we will conſider Man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his <hi>natural</hi> capacity, as a part of the World. How many things are there in the World for the ſervice and pleaſure, for the uſe and delight of Man, which, if Man were not in the World, would be of little uſe? Man is by Nature a contemplative Creature, and God has furniſh'd him with many Objects to exerciſe his Underſtanding
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:35252:124"/>
upon, which would be ſo far uſeleſs and loſt, if Man were not. Who ſhould obſerve the Motions of the Stars, and the Courſes of thoſe Heavenly Bodies, and all the Wonders of Nature? Who ſhould prie into the ſecret Virtues of Plants, and other natural things, if there were not, in the World, a Creature endowed with Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Would the Beaſts of the Field ſtudy Aſtronomy, or turn Chymiſts, and try Experiments in Nature?</p>
            <p>What variety of beautiful Plants and Flowers is there! which can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd to be of little other uſe but for the Pleaſure of Man. And if Man had not been, they would have loſt their grace, and been trod down by the Beaſts of the Field, without pity or obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they would not have made them into Garlands and Noſe-gays. How many ſorts of Fruits are there which grow upon high Trees, out of the reach of Beaſts! and indeed they take no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them. What would all the vaſt bodies of Trees have ſerved for, if Man had not been to build with them, and make Dwellings of them? Of what uſe would all the Mines of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal have been, and of Coal, and the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:35252:125"/>
Quarries of Stone? Would the Mole have admired the fine Gold? Would the Beaſts of the Foreſt have built themſelves Palaces, or would they have made Fires in their Dens?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider Man in his <hi>Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Capacity, as I may call it, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Habitation in this or that Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, or Country. The Wiſdom of God hath ſo order'd Things, that the Neceſſities of every Country are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed one way or other. <hi>Egypt</hi> hath no Rains; but the River <hi>Nilus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows it, and makes it fruitful. Under the Line, where there are exceſſive Heats, every day there are conſtant gales and breezes of cool Wind, to fan and refreſh the ſcorched Inhabitants. The hotter Countries are furniſht with Materials for Silk, a light Cloathing; we that are cooler here in <hi>England,</hi> with materials for Cloth, a warmer Cloathing; <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> which are extreme Cold, are provided with warm Furs, and Skins of Beaſts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider Man in his capacity of <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Entercourſe.</hi> Man is a <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Creature</hi>; beſides the advantages of <hi>Commerce</hi> with remoter Nations, for ſupplying every Country with thoſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:35252:125"/>
Conveniences and Commodities which each doth peculiarly afford. And here the Wiſdom of God does plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in diſpoſing the Sea into ſeveral parts of the World, for the more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Commerce and Entercourſe of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations. Now if every Country had brought forth all Commodities; <hi>that</hi> had been needleſs and ſuperfluous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might have been had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Commerce; beſides that the great encouragement of Entercourſe among Nations, which is ſo agreeable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, would have been taken away: If every Country had been, as now it is, deſtitute of many things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries have, and there had been no Sea to give an opportunity of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick; the World had been very defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive as to the Uſe of Man. Now here appears the Wiſdom of God, that the World, and all things in it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd for the beſt.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavour'd to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing toward the diſplaying of God's Wiſdom in the workmanſhip of the World; altho' I am very ſenſible how much I have been maſter'd and oppreſt by the greatneſs and weight of ſo noble an Argument. For <hi>who can declare the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:35252:126"/>
works of God! and who can ſhew forth all his praiſe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Uſe I ſhall make of what has been ſaid, ſhall be in three Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This confutes the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who impute the World, and this orderly and beautiful Frame of Things to Chance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoſe things which are the proper Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Counſel, and bear the plain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Wiſdom upon them, ought not to be attributed to Chance. What a madneſs is it to grant all things to be as well made, as if the wiſeſt Agent upon Counſel and Deſign had contriv'd them; and yet to aſcribe them to Chance! Now he that denies things to be ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed, muſt pick holes in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhew ſome fault and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in the Frame of Things, which no Man ever yet pretended to do. Did ever any <hi>Anatomiſt</hi> pretend to ſhew how the Body of Man might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contriv'd, and fitter for the Uſes of a Reaſonable Creature than it is; or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> to rectifie the Courſe of the Sun. As for the Extravagant and Blaſphemous Speech of <hi>Alphonſus, That if he had ſtood at God's Elbow when he made the World, he could have told him how to have made it better</hi>; beſides his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:35252:126"/>
               <hi>Pride,</hi> it ſhews nothing but his <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>; that he built his <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> upon a falſe Hypotheſis, as is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved now by the Learned in that Science; and no wonder he found fault with the World, when he miſtook the Frame of it: But thoſe who have been moſt verſt in Nature, and have moſt pried into the ſecrets of it, have moſt admired the workmanſhip both of the great World, and the leſs.</p>
            <p>But if we muſt ſuppoſe the World to be as well made as Wiſdom could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it, which is generally granted; it is a monſtrous folly to impute it to Chance. A man might better ſay, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi> did not make any of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines by Skill, but by Chance; and might more eaſily maintain that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Richlieu</hi> did not manage Affairs by any Arts or Policies, but they fell out by meer Chance. What pitiful ſhifts is <hi>Epicurus</hi> put to, when the beſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he can give of the World, is this; <hi>That Matter always was, and the parts of it in motion, and after a great many Tryals, the parts of Matter at length hamper'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this fortunate order wherein they now are; that men, at firſt, grew out of the Earth, were nouriſht by the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:35252:127"/>
and when they were ſtrong enough, broke looſe and weaned themſelves; that the Noſtrils were made by the Waters making themſelves a paſſage out of the Body; and the Stomack and Bowels by the Waters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a paſſage downward; that the Members of the Body were not made for thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes for which they ſerve, but chanced to be ſo, and the uſes afterwards found out.</hi> Is it worth the while to advance ſuch ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Opinions as theſe, to deny the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God? Is it not much eaſier, and more reaſonable to ſay, that the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God made all theſe things, than to trouble our ſelves to imagin how all things ſhould happen thus convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Chance? Did you ever know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great work, in which there was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of parts, and an orderly diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them required, done by Chance, and without the direction of Wiſdom and Counſel? How long time might a Man take to jumble a ſet of four and twenty Letters together, before they would fall out to be an exact Poem; yea, or make a Book of tolerable Senſe, tho' but in Proſe? How long might a Man ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle Oil and Colours upon Canvas, with a careleſs Hand, before this would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the exact Picture of a Man? And
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:35252:127"/>
is a Man eaſilier made by Chance, than his Picture? He that tells me that this great and curious frame of the World was made by Chance, I could much more believe him, if he ſhould tell me that <hi>Henry</hi> the VII's Chappel, in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> was not built by any mortal man, but the Stones did grow in thoſe forms into which they ſeem to us to be cut and graven; that the Stones; and Timber, and Iron, and Braſs, and all the other Materials, came thither by Chance, and upon a day met all happily together, and put themſelves into that delicate order, in which we ſee them ſo cloſe compacted, that it muſt be a great Chance that parts them again. Now is it not much eaſier to imagin how a skilful Workman ſhould raiſe a Building, than how Timber, and Stones, and how that variety of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials which is required to a great and ſtately Building, ſhould meet together all of a juſt bigneſs, and exactly fitted, and by chance take their places, and range themſelves into that order. I inſiſt the longer upon this, becauſe I am ſenſible how much Atheiſm hath gained in this Age.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:35252:128"/>2. Let us Admire, and Adore, and Praiſe the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, <hi>who hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht the world by his wiſdom, and ſtretched out the heavens by his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; who hath made all things in number, weight, and meaſure,</hi> that is, by exact <hi>wiſdom.</hi> The wiſe Works of God are the proper Object of our praiſe; and this is a day proper for this Work of Praiſe and Thanks-giving. Now under the Goſpel, ſince Chriſt was clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, we have new matter of Praiſe and Thanksgiving; but as God has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo he hath given us our <hi>Beings.</hi> We are not ſo to remember our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> as to forget our <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> The Goodneſs, and Power, and Wiſdom of God, which appears in the Creation of the World, ought ſtill to be matter of Admiration and Praiſe to Chriſtians. It is a great Fault and Neglect among Chriſtians, that they are not more taken up with the Works of God, and the Contemplation of the Wiſdom which ſhines forth in them. We are apt enough to admire other things, little Toys; but we overlook this vaſt curious Engine of the World, and the great Artificer of all things. It was truly ſaid of one, that moſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:35252:128"/>
men are ſo ſtupid and inconſiderate, as to admire the Works of a Painter or a Carver, more than the Works of God. There are many that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed more Eloquence in the Praiſe of a curious Picture, or an exact Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than ever they did upon this noble and exquiſite frame of the World, or any of the works of God. We can admire the wiſdom, and deſign, and skill of petty Artiſts, and little Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers; but <hi>here</hi> is <hi>wiſdom</hi> in the Beauty and Order of the <hi>Creation.</hi> Did we love God, and take pleaſure in the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Wiſdom and Power, we ſhould be more in the Contemplation of them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2. <hi>The works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein.</hi> Let us then ſay with the Pſalmiſt,; <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wiſdom haſt thou made them all; the Earth is full of thy riches,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>More particularly let us, with an humble thankfulneſs, admire the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which hath made and diſpoſed all things ſo fitly for our Uſe and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and with ſo merciful a reſpect to us; The Light and Influence of Heaven;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:35252:129"/>
the Beaſts and the Fruits of the Earth. We find the Pſalmiſt often praiſing God upon this Account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.4, 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Wiſdom which hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med theſe Bodies of ours. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.14, 15, 16. Which hath endowed us with Knowledge and Underſtanding. <hi>Elihu</hi> complains, that Men were apt to over-look theſe great Bleſſings of God, <hi>Job</hi> 35.10, 11, 12. <hi>But none ſaith, where is God my maker, who giveth Songs in the night? Who teacheth us more than the Beaſts of the earth, and maketh us wiſer than the Fowls of Heaven? There they cry, but none giveth anſwer, becauſe of the pride of evil men.</hi>

            <p>AMONGST the ſeveral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which towards the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Epiſtle the Apoſtle exhorts Chriſtians to, this is one, not to be over-much ſolicitous and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about what may befal us, but to refer our ſelves to the providence of God, which takes care of us. In ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Argument, I ſhall

                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. For the nature of the Duty here required. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies an <hi>anxious care</hi> about Events; a care that is accompanied with trouble and diſquiet of Mind about what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us; about the good that we hope for, and deſire; or about the Evil which we fear may come upon us. This the Apoſtle exhorts us to throw off; and to leave to the Providence of God and his Care, all thoſe Events which we are apt to be ſo ſolicitous and diſquieted about. The Expreſſion ſeems to be taken out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22. <hi>caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that we may not miſtake our Duty in this matter, I ſhall ſhew what is not here meant by <hi>caſting all our care upon God,</hi> and then what is meant by it.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle doth not hereby intend to take Men off from <hi>a provident care and diligence,</hi> about the concernments of this life; this is not only contrary to Reaſon, but to many expreſs Precepts and Paſſages of Scripture, wherein Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is recommended to us, and the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:35252:131"/>
Bleſſing of God, and the good Succeſs of our Affairs promiſed thereto; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are commanded to provide for thoſe of our Family, which cannot be done without ſome ſort of care; and wherein Sloathfulneſs and Negligence are condemned, and threatned with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; ſo that this is not <hi>to caſt our care upon God,</hi> to take no care of our ſelves, to uſe no diligence and endeavour for the obtaining of the Good which we deſire, and the prevention of the Evil we fear; this is to tempt the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and to caſt that Burthen upon him, which he expects we ſhould bear our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But by <hi>caſting our care upon God,</hi> the Apoſtle intends theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That after all prudent Care and Diligence have been uſed by us, we ſhould not be <hi>farther ſolicitous,</hi> nor trouble our ſelves about the event of Things, which, when we have done all we can, will be out of our power. And this certainly is our Saviour's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he bids us, <hi>take no care for the morrow.</hi> When we have done what is fit for us for the preſent to do, we ſhould not diſquiet and torment our ſelves about the Iſſue and Event of Things.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:35252:132"/>2. <hi>Caſting our care upon God,</hi> implies, that we ſhould refer the iſſue of Things to his Providence, which is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigilant over us, and knows how to diſpoſe all things to the beſt, entirely confiding in his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that he will order all things for our good, and in that confidence, reſolving to reſt ſatisfied and contented with the diſpoſals of his Providence, whatever they be.</p>
            <p>You ſee then the nature of the Duty which the Apoſtle here exhorts to, <hi>viz.</hi> That after all prudent Care and Diligence have been uſed on our parts, we ſhould not be diſquieted in our Minds about the event of things, but leave them to God, who hath the Care of us and of all our Concernments. Which is the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing I propoſed to ſpeak to, and which I intend chiefly to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> The Argument which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here uſeth to perſwade us to this Duty, of <hi>caſting all our care upon God</hi>; becauſe <hi>it is he that careth for us</hi>; and this implies in it theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general, That the Providence of God governs the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it ſelf in the Affairs of Men, and diſpoſeth of all Events that happen to us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:35252:132"/>2. More particularly, That this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is peculiarly concerned for good Men, and that he takes a ſpecial care of them and their Concerns; <hi>He careth for you.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks this to them, not only as <hi>Men,</hi> but as <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And thus the Pſalmiſt, from whom theſe words ſeem to be taken, does apply and limit this Promiſe; <hi>Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain thee; he ſhall never ſuffer the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That God taketh care of us, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in general, That the Providence of God governs the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it ſelf in the Affairs of Men, and diſpoſeth of all Events that happen to us. I ſhall not now enter upon a large Proof of <hi>the Providence of God</hi>; that is too large and intricate an Argument for a ſhort Diſcourſe, and hath a great deal of nicety and difficulty in it; and tho' it be a fundamental Principle of Religion, and hath been almoſt general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained and believed by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and that upon very good Reaſon; yet becauſe the vindication of many particular appearances of Providence, does in a great meaſure depend upon a full view and comprehenſion of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:35252:133"/>
whole deſign, therefore we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily refer our ſelves, for full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as to ſeveral difficulties and Objections, to the other World, when we ſhall ſee God's works, together with the relation of every part to the whole deſign, and then many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Paſſages, which may now ſeem odd and crooked, as we look upon them by themſelves, will in Relation to the whole, appear to have a great deal of Reaſon and Regularity in them.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall at preſent only briefly, and in the general, ſhew that it is very credible, that there is a wiſe Providence, that governs the World, and intereſts it ſelf in the affairs of Men, and diſpoſeth of all Events which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us.</p>
            <p>And I deſire it may be obſerved in the entrance upon this Argument, that the handling of this Queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Providence,</hi> doth ſuppoſe <hi>the Being of God,</hi> and that <hi>he made the World,</hi> as Principles already known and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before we come to diſpute of his <hi>Providence</hi>; for it would be in vain, to argue about the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, with thoſe who queſtion his <hi>Being,</hi> and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:35252:133"/>
whether <hi>the World was made by him:</hi> But ſuppoſing theſe <hi>two</hi> Principles, <hi>that God is,</hi> and <hi>that he made the World,</hi> it is very credible, that he ſhould <hi>take care of the Government of it,</hi> and eſpecially of one of the nobleſt Parts of it, the race of <hi>Mankind.</hi> For we cannot believe, that he who employed ſo much Power and Wiſdom, in the raiſing of this great and magnificent Pile, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing every part of it with ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Creatures, ſo exquiſitely and ſo wiſely fitted for the uſe and ſervice of one another, ſhould ſo ſoon as he had perfected it, forſake his own Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and take no farther care of it; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially conſidering that it is no trouble and diſquiet to him, either to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what is done here below, or to interpoſe for the regulating of any Diſorders that may happen; for Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Knowledge, and Wiſdom, and Power can do this with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eaſe, knows all things, and can do all things, without any diſturbance of its own happineſs.</p>
            <p>And this hath always been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apprehenſion of Mankind, that God knows all things, and obſerves every thing that is done in the World,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:35252:134"/>
and when he pleaſeth, interpoſes in the affairs of it. 'Tis true indeed the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> did deny that God either made the World, or governs it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſe Men always doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did indeed believe the Being of God, or not; but being unwilling to incur the danger of ſo odious an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, they were content for faſhion ſake, to own his Being, provided they might take away the beſt and moſt ſubſtantial Arguments for the proof o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it. The reſt of the Philoſophers owned a Providence, at leaſt a general Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that took care of great and more important Matters, but did not deſcend to a conſtant and particular care of every Perſon, and every little Event belonging to them. <hi>Interdum cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſus ſingulorum,</hi> ſays <hi>Tully; now and then, when he pleaſes, he takes care of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, and their leſſer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; but many of them thought, that God did generally neglect the ſmaller and more inconſiderable affairs of the World, <hi>Dii minora negligunt, neque agello<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſingulorum &amp; viticulas perſequuntur, The Gods overlook ſmaller matters, and do not mind every Mans little Field and Vine.</hi> Such imperfect apprehenſions had they
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:35252:134"/>
of the Providence of God. And tho' they would ſeem hereby to conſult the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and eaſe of the Deity, by exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from the care and trouble of leſſer Matters, yet in truth and reality, they caſt a diſhonourable reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as if it were a burthen to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Knowledge, and Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to take care of every thing.</p>
            <p>But now Divine Revelation hath put this matter out of doubt, by aſſuring us of God's particular care of all Perſons and Events. Our Saviour tells us, that God's Providence extends to the leaſt and moſt inconſiderable Creatures, <hi>to the graſs of the Field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the Oven,</hi> Mat. 6.30. <hi>To the fowls of the air,</hi> and that to the leaſt of them, even to <hi>the Sparrows, two of which are ſold for a Farthing, and yet not one of them falleth to the ground without God, Mat.</hi> 10.29. Much more doth the Providence of God extend to <hi>Men,</hi> which are Creatures far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and to the very leaſt thing that belongs to us, <hi>to the very hairs of our head, which are all numbered,</hi> the loweſt inſtance that can be thought on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:35252:135"/>So that the light of Nature owns a more <hi>general Providence</hi>; and Divine Revelation hath rectified thoſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect apprehenſions which Men had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and hath ſatisfied us, that it extends it ſelf to <hi>all particulars,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the leaſt things and moſt inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. And this is no ways incredible, conſidering the Infinite Perfection of the Divine Nature, in reſpect of which, God can with as much and greater eaſe, take care of every thing, than we can do of any one thing; and the belief of this is the great foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Men therefore pray to God for the good they want, and to be freed from the evils they fear, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he always regards and hears them. Men therefore make Conſcience of their Duty, becauſe they believe God obſerves them, and will reward and puniſh their good and evil Deeds. So that take away the Providence of God, and we pull down one of the main Pillars upon which Religion ſtands, we rob our ſelves of one of the greateſt Comforts and beſt Refuges in the Afflictions and Calamities of this life, and of all our hopes of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:35252:135"/>And tho' there be many diſorders in the World, eſpecially in the Affairs of Men, the moſt irregular and intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Piece of God's Creation; yet this is far from being a ſufficient Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt <hi>the Providence of God,</hi> if we conſider, that God made Man a free Creature, and capable of abuſing his Liberty, and intends this preſent life for a ſtate of trial in order to another, where Men ſhall receive the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their Actions here: And then if we conſider, that many of the evils and diſorders, which God permits to happen, are capable of being over-ruled by him to a greater good, and are made many times to ſerve wiſe and excellent purpoſes, and that the Providence of God does ſometimes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and remarkably interpoſe, for the prevention and remedy of great Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Confuſions; I ſay conſidering all this, it is no blemiſh to the Divine Providence, to permit many of thoſe Irregularities which are in the World, and ſuffer the Fates of good and bad Men to be ſo croſs and unequal in this life. For ſuppoſing another life after this, wherein Men ſhall come to an Account, and every Man ſhall receive
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:35252:136"/>
the juſt recompence of his Actions, there will then be a proper Seaſon and full Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, of ſeting all things ſtreight, and no Man ſhall have reaſon then, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to glory in his wickedneſs, or to complain of his ſufferings in this World. This is the <hi>firſt,</hi> that God's Providence governs the World, and intereſts it ſelf in the affairs of Men, and diſpoſeth of all Events that happens to them; and this is a very good Reaſon, why we ſhould <hi>caſt</hi> our particular <hi>cares upon him,</hi> who hath undertaken the Government of the whole.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Providence of God is more peculiarly concerned for good Men, and he takes a more particular and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial care of them. The Apoſtle ſpeaks this to Chriſtians, <hi>caſt all your care on him, for he careth for you.</hi> And this <hi>David</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits in a more peculiar manner to good Men; <hi>caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he will ſuſtain thee, he ſhall never ſuffer the righteous to be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Providence of God many times preſerves good Men from thoſe Evils which happen to others, and by a peculiar and remarkable interpoſition, reſcues them out of thoſe Calamities which it ſuffers others to fall into;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:35252:136"/>
and God many times bleſſeth good Men, with remarkable proſperity and ſucceſs in their Affairs. To which purpoſe there are innumerable Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Promiſes in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo well known that I ſhall not trouble you with the recital of them.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which, it cannot de denyed, that good Men fall into many Evils, and are harraſſed with great Afflictions in this World: but then the Providence of God uſually ordereth it ſo, that they are armed with great Patience to bear them, and find great comfort and ſupport under them, and make better uſe and improvement of them than others; ſo that one way or other they turn to their advantage. So the Apoſtle aſſures us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.</hi> All the Evils and Afflictions, which happen to good men, conſpire one way or other to the promoting of their happineſs, many times in this World, to be ſure they make a great addition to it in the other. So the ſame Apoſtle tels us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:35252:137"/>
weight of glory, whilſt we look not,</hi> &amp;c. And can we ſay God's Providence neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects us, when he rewards our temporal Sufferings with eternal Glory; when through <hi>many hardſhips and tribulations,</hi> he at laſt brings us to <hi>a Kingdom</hi>? Was <hi>Joſeph</hi> neglected by God, when, by a great deal of hard uſage, and a long impriſonment, he was raiſed to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dignity in a great Kingdom? Or rather, was not the Providence of God very remarkable towards him, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe Sufferings ſo many Steps to his Glory, and the occaſion of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement? And is not God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards good men as kind and as remarkable, in bringing them to an infinitely better and more glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by Tribulations and Sufferings; and making <hi>our light Afflictions which are but for a moment, to work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>?</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what is implyed in God's <hi>care</hi> of us in general; that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the World, and diſpoſeth all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; and particularly, that he is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly concerned for good Men, and takes a more eſpecial care of them. Let us now ſee of what force this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:35252:137"/>
is, to perſwade to the Duty enjoyned in the Text, <hi>to caſt all our care upon God</hi>; that is, after all prudent Care and Diligence hath been uſed on our part, not to be anxious and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about the event of things, but to leave that to God. Now this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that <hi>God cares for us,</hi> ſhould be an Argument to us, <hi>to caſt all our care upon him,</hi> upon theſe <hi>two</hi> Accounts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Becauſe if <hi>God cares for us,</hi> our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments are in the beſt and ſafeſt hands.</item>
               <item>2. Becauſe all our Anxiety and Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will do us no good.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe if <hi>God cares for us,</hi> our Concernments are in the beſt and ſafeſt hands, and where we ſhould deſire to have them; infinitely ſafer, than under any Care and Conduct of our own. And this ought to be a great ſatisfaction to our Minds, and to free us from all diſquieting Thoughts; for if God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes the care of us, then are we ſure that nothing ſhall happen to us, but by the diſpoſal or permiſſion of Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things indeed, which to us ſeem <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Accident</hi>; but in reſpect of God, they are <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi>;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:35252:138"/>
they may appear to happen by chance, or may proceed from the ill-will and malicious intent of ſecond Cauſes; but they are all wiſely deſigned; and as they are appointed or permitted by God, they are the reſult of the deepeſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and the greateſt Goodneſs. And can we wiſh that we and our Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be in better or ſafer hands, than of Infinite Power and Wiſdom, in conjunction with Infinite Love and Goodneſs? And if we be careful to do our Duty, and to demean our ſelves towards God as we ought, we may reſt aſſured of his Love and Care of us; and if we do in good earneſt believe the Providence of God, we cannot but think that he hath a peculiar regard to thoſe that love and ſerve him, and that he will take a peculiar care of their Concernments, and that he can, and will diſpoſe them better for us, than we could manage them our ſelves, if we were left to our ſelves, and our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were put into <hi>the hands of our own Counſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Put the caſe we had the entire or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and diſpoſal of our ſelves, what were reaſonable for us to do in this caſe? We would ſurely, according to our
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:35252:138"/>
beſt wiſdom and judgment, do the beſt we could for our ſelves, and when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on experience of our own manifold ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and weakneſs, we had found our weightieſt Affairs and Deſigns fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to miſcarry, for want of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, or power, or skill to obviate and prevent the infinite Hazards and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments which humane Affairs are liable to, we ſhould then look about us; and if we knew any Perſon much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and more powerful than our ſelves, who we believed did heartily love us, and wiſh well to us, we would out of kindneſs to our ſelves, ask his Counſel in our Affairs, and crave his aſſiſtance; and if we could prevail with him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the care of our Concernments, we would commit them all to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Government, in confidence of his great Wiſdom and Good-will to us.</p>
            <p>Now God is ſuch an one, he loves us as well as we do our ſelves, and deſires our Happineſs as much, and knows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better than we do, what means are moſt conducing to it, and will moſt effectually ſecure it. And every Man that believes thus of God, (as every Man muſt do, that believes there is a God,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:35252:139"/>
for theſe are the natural and eſſential Notions which all Men have of the Deity) I ſay, every Man that believes thus of God, the firſt thing he would do (if he knew not already that God had voluntarily, and of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, undertaken the care of him and of his Affairs) would be to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, and to beſeech him with all earneſtneſs and importunity, that he would permit him to refer his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments to him, and be pleaſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the care of them; and he would, without any demur or difficulty, give up himſelf wholly to him, to guide and govern him, and to diſpoſe of him as to him ſhould ſeem beſt.</p>
            <p>Now if God have prevented us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and without our Deſire taken this care upon himſelf, we ought to rejoice in it, as the greateſt happineſs that could poſſibly have befallen us; and we ſhould without any farther care and anxiety, uſing our own beſt diligence, and ſtudying to pleaſe him, chearfully leave our ſelves in his Hands, with the greateſt confidence and ſecurity, that he will do all that for us which is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſt; and with a firm perſwaſion, that that condition, and thoſe circumſtances
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:35252:139"/>
of Life, which he ſhall chuſe for us, will be no other but the very ſame which we would chuſe for our ſelves, if we were as wiſe as he.</p>
            <p>And it is ſo natural for Men to think thus of God, that the very Heathen Poet had the ſame Idea of him, and upon that ground, adviſeth us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all our Concernments to him.
<q>
                  <l>Permittes ipſis expendere numinibus, quid</l>
                  <l>Conveniat nobis, rebuſque ſit utile no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris;</l>

               <hi>Leave it,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to the wiſer gods, to conſider and determine what is fitteſt for thee, and moſt for thy advantage; and tho' they do not always give thee what thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt, and that which pleaſeth thee beſt, yet they will give that which is moſt fit and convenient for thee; for Man is more dear to the gods, than he is to himſelf.</hi> Not much different from this, is the Divine Counſel of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 3.5, 6. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own underſtanding. In all
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:35252:140"/>
thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thy paths.</hi> It is conſiderable who it is that gives this Advice; the <hi>wiſeſt of the Sons of men</hi>; and yet he adviſeth <hi>to truſt in God for direction, and not to lean to our own underſtandings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore we be fully perſwaded of God's infinitely Wiſe and Good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we ought certainly to refer our ſelves to him, and perfectly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in his diſpoſal, and to reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in whatever he does, and whatever condition he aſſigns to us, we ought to be contented with it: if we be not, we find fault with his Wiſdom, and reproach his Goodneſs, and wiſh the Government of the World in better hands.</p>
            <p>So that a firm belief of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, as it would take away all Anxiety concerning future Events, ſo would it likewiſe ſilence all thoſe Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and Diſcontents, which are apt to ariſe in us, when things fall out croſs to our Deſires, when Diſaſters and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments happen to us, and the Providence of God caſts us into Sickneſs, or Poverty, or Diſgrace. This quieted <hi>David,</hi> when he was ready to break out into murmuring at the Afflictions and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:35252:140"/>
Calamities which befell him. <hi>I held my peace</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and ſpake not a word, becauſe thou Lord didſt it.</hi> And this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould keep us from fretting and vexing at Inſtruments, and ſecond Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; to conſider that the Wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God over ruleth and diſpoſeth the Actions of Men, and that no harm can happen to us without his permiſſion. This Conſideration reſtrained <hi>David</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, under that high provocation of <hi>Shimei,</hi> when he follow'd him, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him and curſing him; <hi>let him alone, the Lord hath ſaid unto him, curſe David.</hi> He conſider'd that God's Providence permitted it; and looking upon it as coming from a higher hand, this calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Paſſion, and made him bear it patiently. If a Man be walking in the Street, and one fling Water upon him, it is apt to provoke him beyond all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; but no man is in a paſſion for being wet ten times as much by Rain from Heaven. What Calamity ſoever befalleth us, when we conſider it as coming from Heaven, and ordered and permitted there, this will ſtill and huſh our Paſſion, and make us with <hi>Eli</hi> to hold our peace, or only to ſay, <hi>it is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:35252:141"/>We are indeed liable to many things in this World, which have a great deal of evil and affliction in them, to Poverty, and Pain, and Reproach, and Reſtraint, and the loſs of our Friends and near Relations, and theſe are great Afflictions, and very croſs and diſtaſtful to us, and therefore when we are in Danger of any of theſe, and apprehend them to be making towards us, we are apt to be anxious and full of trouble, and when they befal us, we are prone to cenſure the Providence of God, and to judge raſhly concerning it, as if all things were not ordered by it for the beſt: but we ſhould conſider, that we are very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ſhort ſighted Creatures, and ſee but a litttle way before us, are not able to penetrate into the Deſigns of God, and to look to the End of his Providence. We cannot (as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>ſee the work of God from the beginning to the end</hi>; whereas if we ſaw the whole deſign of Providence together, we ſhould ſtrangly admire the beauty and proportion of it, and ſhould ſee it to be very wiſe and good. And that which upon the whole matter, and in the laſt iſſue and reſult of things,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:35252:141"/>
is moſt for our good, is certainly beſt, how grievous ſoever it may ſeem for the preſent. Sickneſs cauſed by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is many times more troubleſome for the preſent, than the Diſeaſe we take it for; but every wiſe Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf to bear it as well as he can, becauſe it is in order to his Health: the evils and afflictions of this life are the Phyſick, and Means of cure, which the Providence of God is often neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to make uſe of; and if we did truſt our ſelves in the hands of this great Phyſician, we ſhould quietly ſubmit to all the ſeverities of his Providence, in confidence that they would <hi>all work together for our good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Children are under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Parents, or the diſcipline of their Teachers, they are apt to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at them, and think it very hard to be denyed ſo many things which they deſire, and to be conſtrained by ſeverities to a great many things which are grievous and tedious to them: but the Parent and the Maſter know very well, that it is their Ignorance and Inconſiderateneſs which makes them to think ſo, and that when they come to Years, and to underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:35252:142"/>
better, then they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that all that which gave them ſo much diſcontent, was really for their good, and that it was their Childiſhneſs and Folly, which made them to think otherwiſe, and that they had in all probability been undone, had they been indulged in their humour, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in every thing to have their own will; they had not Wit and Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough, to truſt the Diſcretion of their Parents and Governours, and to believe that even thoſe things which were ſo diſpleaſing to them, would at laſt tend to their good.</p>
            <p>There is a far greater diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wiſdom of God and Men, and we are infinitely more Ignorant and Childiſh in reſpect of God, than our Children are in reſpect of us; and being perſwaded of this, we ought to reckon, that while we are in this World, under God's care and diſcipline, it is neceſſary for our good, that we be reſtrained in many things, which we eagerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and ſuffer many things that are grievous to us; and that when we come to Heaven, and are grown up to be Men, and <hi>have put away childiſh thoughts,</hi> and are come to underſtand things,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:35252:142"/>
as they truly are, and not <hi>in a riddle,</hi> and darkneſs, as we now do; then <hi>the Judgement of God will break forth as the light, and the righteouſneſs</hi> of all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>as the noon Day,</hi> then all the Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of Providence will be clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to us, and we ſhall ſee a plain Reaſon for all thoſe Diſpenſations which we were ſo much ſtumbled at, and acknowledge the great Wiſdom and Goodneſs of them.</p>
            <p>You ſee then what Reaſon there is to refer our ſelves to the Providence of God, and <hi>to caſt all our care upon him,</hi> to truſt him with the Adminiſtration and Diſpoſal of all our Concernments, and firmly to believe, that if we love God, and be careful to pleaſe him, every thing in the iſſue will turn to the beſt for us; and therefore we ſhould not anxiouſly trouble our ſelves about the Events of things, but reſign up ourſelves to the good pleaſure of him, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth all things <hi>according to the Counſel of his Will,</hi> entirely truſting in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in his Fatherly care of us, and affection to us, that he will order all things for us, for the beſt, referring the ſucceſs of all our Concernments to him, <hi>in whoſe hands are all the ways of <pb n="268" facs="tcp:35252:143"/>
the Children of Men,</hi> chearfully ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his determination, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of his Providence in every caſe.</p>
            <p>And this is a proper Expreſſion of our Confidence in God's Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to refer things to him before the Event, and to ſay with the Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.14. <hi>The will of the Lord be done,</hi> becauſe this ſhews that we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God will do better for us, than our own Counſel and Choice; and to ſubmit to his will after the Event, is likewiſe a great inſtance of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him, and that we believe that he hath done that which is beſt: For when God, by his Providence, declares his Will in any caſe, we ſhould look upon it, as the Sentence of a wiſe and juſt Judge, in which all Parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ought to acquieſce, and reſt fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p>And this may well be expected from us Chriſtians, who have much greater aſſurance of the <hi>Particular</hi> Providence of God, than the Heathen had; and yet ſome of them, were able to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all trouble and anxiety, from murmuring and diſcontent. Upon this Conſideration, <hi>Epictetus</hi> (as <hi>Arrian</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:35252:143"/>
tells us) would expreſs himſelf thus, <hi>I had always rather have that which happens; becauſe I eſteem that better which God wills, than that which I ſhould will</hi>; and again, <hi>lift up thine Eyes,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to God, and ſay, henceforth, Lord, deal with me as thou pleaſeſt, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, If Men ſhall cenſure this Providence towards me, and ſay thou dealeſt hardly with me, I will apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſe for thee, I will undertake and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thy cauſe, that what thou doſt is beſt for me.</hi> What could a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſay more or better, by way of reſignation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Providence of God? It al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tranſports me to read ſuch paſſages from a <hi>Heathen,</hi> eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in what condition <hi>Epictetus</hi> was, he had a maimed and deformed Body,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:35252:144"/>
was in the extremity of Poverty, a Slave, and very cruelly and tyranically uſed, ſo that we can hardly imagine a Man in worſe and more wretched Circumſtances; and yet he juſtifies the Providence of God in all this, and not only ſubmits to his Condition, but is contented with it, and embraces it, and ſince God hath thought it fitteſt and beſt for him, he is of the ſame mind, and thinks ſo too. I confeſs it doth not move me to hear <hi>Seneca,</hi> who flowed in wealth, and lived at eaſe, to talk magnificently, and to ſlight Poverty and Pain, as not worthy the Name of Evil and Trouble: but to ſee <hi>this poor Man,</hi> in the loweſt Condition and worſt Circumſtances of Humanity, bear up ſo bravely, and with ſuch a chearfulneſs and ſerenity of Mind to entertain his hard Fortune, and this not out of ſtupidity, but from a wiſe ſenſe of the Providence of God, and a firm perſwaſion of the wiſdom and goodneſs of all his dealings, <hi>this</hi> who can chuſe but be affected with it, as an admirable temper for a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> much more for a <hi>Heathen!</hi> To which we may apply that ſaying of our Lord, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heathen Centurion, <hi>Verily I ſay
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:35252:144"/>
unto you, I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael</hi>; ſo wiſe, ſo equal, ſo firm a temper of Mind is ſeldom to be found, <hi>no not amongſt Chriſtians.</hi> And this is the <hi>Firſt</hi> Conſideration, That if <hi>God cares for us,</hi> we and our Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in the beſt and ſafeſt hands, and therefore we ſhould <hi>caſt all our care upon God.</hi> The</p>
            <p n="2">2. is, Becauſe all our Anxiety and Care will do us no good; on the contrary, it will certainly do us hurt. We may fret and vex our own Spirits, and make them reſtleſs, in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the evils and diſappointments which we are afraid of, and may make our lives miſerable, in the ſad Reflexions of our own Thoughts; but we cannot, by all our Anxiety and Care, controul the courſe of Things, and alter the Deſigns of Providence; we cannot by all our vexation and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble over-rule Events, and make things happen as we would have them. And this is the Argument our Saviour uſeth to this very purpoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Which of you, by taking thought, can add one cubit to his ſtature?</hi> So that all this trouble is unreaſonable, and to no
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:35252:145"/>
purpoſe, becauſe it hath no influence upon the Event, either to promote or hinder it. Things are governed and diſpoſed by a higher hand, and placed out of our reach; we may delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and contrive, and uſe our beſt endeavours, for the effecting of our Deſigns, but we cannot ſecure the Event againſt a thouſand interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Divine Providence, which we can neither foreſee nor hinder; but yet notwithſtanding, theſe our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are reaſonable, becauſe they are the ordinary Means which God hath appointed, for the procuring of good and prevention of Evil, and tho' they may miſcarry, yet they are all we can do: but after this is done, trouble and anxiety about the Event is the vaineſt thing in the World, becauſe it is to no purpoſe, nor doth at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to what we deſire; <hi>we diſquiet our ſelves in vain,</hi> and we diſtruſt God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Care of us, and thereby provoke him to defeat and diſappoint us.</p>
            <p>Let us then by theſe Conſiderations be perſwaded to this Duty, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice whereof is of continual and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal uſe in the whole courſe of our
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:35252:145"/>
lives; in all our affairs and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after we have uſed our beſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, let us ſit down and be ſatisfied, and refer the reſt to God, whoſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence governs the World, and takes care of all our Intereſts, and of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his Church and Religion, when they ſeem to be in greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>We cannot but be convinced, that this is very reaſonable, to leave the Management of things to him who made them, and therefore underſtands beſt how to order them. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World is a very curious and complicated Thing, and not to be tamper'd with by every unskilful Hand; and therefore as an unskilful Man, after he hath tampered a great while with a Watch, thinking to bring it into better order, and is at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he can do no good upon it, carries it to him that made it, to mend it and put it into order; ſo muſt we do, after all our Care and Anxiety about our own private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, or the publick State of Things, we muſt give over governing the World, as a buſineſs paſt our Skill, as a Province too hard, and <hi>a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:35252:146"/>
too wonderful for us,</hi> and leave it to him, who made the World, to Govern it, and take care of it.</p>
            <p>And if we be not thus Affected and Diſpoſed, we do not believe the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, whatever profeſſion we make of it; if we did, it would have an influence upon our Minds, to free us from Anxious Care and Diſcontent. Were we firmly perſwaded of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we ſhould confidently rely upon it, and according to the Apoſtle's advice here in the Text, <hi>caſt all our care upon him, becauſe he careth for us.</hi>

            <p>I Have in the ordinary courſe of my Preaching been treating of the Attributes and Perfections of God, more particularly thoſe which relate to the Divine Underſtanding; the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe I have finiſht; and made ſome progreſs in the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God; which I have ſpoken to in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and have propounded more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:35252:147"/>
to conſider thoſe famous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Arguments of the Divine Wiſdom, in the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World; the <hi>Government</hi> of it; and the <hi>redemption of mankind by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>two</hi> firſt of theſe I have ſpoken to, namely the Wiſdom of God, which appears in the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the World. I come now to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. Inſtance of the Divine Wiſdom, <hi>the redemption of mankind by Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; which I ſhall, by God's aſſiſtance, ſpeak to from theſe words, <hi>Chriſt, the wiſdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle in the beginning of this Epiſtle, upon occaſion of his mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diviſions and Parties that were among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where one ſaid, <hi>I am of Paul</hi>; another, <hi>I am of Apollos</hi>; asks them, whether <hi>Paul was crucified for them?</hi> or whether <hi>they were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name of Paul?</hi> To convince them that they could not pretend this, that they were Baptized into his Name, he tells them at the 14, and 15<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes</hi>; that <hi>he had not ſo much as baptized any of them, except two or three</hi>; ſo far was he from having Baptized them into his own Name; and at the 17<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe,</hi> he ſays, that his work, his principal work, was
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:35252:147"/>
               <hi>to preach the Goſpel,</hi> which he had done, not with Humane Eloquence, <hi>not in wiſdom of words,</hi> but with great plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſimplicity, <hi>leſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect</hi>; leſt, if he ſhould have uſed any Artifice, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould have been leſs powerful. And indeed his Preaching was unaffectedly plain, and therefore the Goſpel did ſeem to very many to be a fooliſh and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous thing. The Story which they told of <hi>Chriſt Crucified,</hi> was <hi>to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> who expected another kind of <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that ſhould come in great Pomp and Glory, to be a mighty Temporal Prince, they were angry at the Story of <hi>a crucified Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Philoſophers, who expected ſome curious Theories, adorned with Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and delivered and laid down according to the exact Rules of Art, they derided this plain and ſimple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But tho' this Deſign of the Goſpel appeared ſilly and fooliſh to raſh and inconſiderate and prejudiced Minds, yet <hi>to them that are called,</hi> to them that do believe, <hi>both Jews and Gentiles, Chriſt, the power of God, and the Wiſdom of God;
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:35252:148"/>
Chriſt,</hi> that is, the way of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle preached, <hi>the wiſdom of God,</hi> an eminent Inſtance of it.</p>
            <p>So that the <hi>redemption of Man by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is a Deſign of admirable <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſhall endeavour to confirm to you.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. By general Teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And</item>
               <item>II. By a more particular enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of this Deſign, and the Means how it is accompliſh'd.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. By Teſtimonies from Scripture. You know I have all along, in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the Attributes of God, uſed this Method of proving them, from the Dictates of Natural Light, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Scripture: But now I muſt forſake my wonted Method, for here the Light of Nature leaves me. The Wiſdom of <hi>Creation</hi> is manifeſt in <hi>the things which are made; the heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God's</hi> Wiſdom, <hi>and the firmament ſhews his handy-work.</hi> The Works of God do preach and ſet forth the Wiſdom of the Creator; but the Sun, Moon, and Stars, do not preach the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> The Wiſdom of <hi>redemption</hi> is
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:35252:148"/>
               <hi>Wiſdom in a myſtery, hidden wiſdom, which none of the Princes,</hi> or Philoſophers, <hi>of this World knew.</hi> The ſharpeſt Wits, and the higheſt and moſt raiſed Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings amongſt the Heathens, could ſay nothing of this. Here <hi>the Wiſdom of the Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the Prudent</hi> is poſed, and we may make the Apoſtles challenge, <hi>v.</hi> 20. of this Chapter, <hi>Where is the Wiſe, where is the Diſputer of this World?</hi> There is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light diſcovers Chriſt; the <hi>Wiſe men</hi> cannot find him out, unleſs a <hi>ſtar</hi> be created on purpoſe to lead and direct to him. Therefore in this I ſhall only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Divine Revelation. 1 Cor. 2.7, 8. the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is called <hi>the wiſdom of God in a myſtery, even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory; Which none of the Princes of this world knew.</hi> Eph. 1.7, 8. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded toward us in all Wiſdom and Prudence.</hi> Eph. 3.10, 11. <hi>The manifold wiſdom of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eternal purpoſe which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> This work of <hi>our redemption by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is ſo various and admirable, that it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:35252:149"/>
the Angels to know and underſtand it. <hi>To the intent, that unto principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. By inquiring more particularly into the nature of this Deſign, and the Means how it is accompliſht. This is <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to fit Means to Ends; and the more difficult the End, the greater Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is required to find out ſuitable and ſufficient Means for the accompliſhment, of the End. Now <hi>the wiſdom of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> will appear, if we conſider the caſe of fallen Man; and what fit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſuitable Means, the Wiſdom of God hath deviſed for our Recovery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the Caſe of fallen Man, which was very ſad, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Miſery, and the Difficulty of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the Miſery of it. Man, who was made Holy and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right by God, having, by his voluntary Tranſgreſſion, and wilful Diſobedience, fall'n from him, did preſently ſink into a corrupt and degenerate, into a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and curſed Condition, of which Heaven and Earth, and his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bore him Witneſs. Man, being become a Sinner, is not only deprived
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:35252:149"/>
of the Image of God, but is liable to his Juſtice; here was his Miſery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The difficulty of the Caſe was this, Man could not recover himſelf and raiſe himſelf out of his own ruin; no Creature was able to do it; ſo that our help is only in God; and indeed he is a merciful God, and doth not deſire our Ruin, nor delight in our Deſtruction: But ſuppoſe his Mercy never ſo willing to ſave us, will not his Holineſs, and Juſtice, and Truth, check thoſe forward Inclinations of his Goodneſs, and hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er all the Deſigns of his Mercy? Is not ſin contrary to the Holy Nature of God? hath not he declared his Infinite hatred of it? hath not he threatned it with heavy and dreadful Puniſhment? and ſaid, that <hi>the ſinner ſhall die,</hi> that <hi>he will not acquit the guilty,</hi> nor <hi>let ſin go unpuniſh'd?</hi> Should he now, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſatisfaction to his offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, pardon the Sinner, remit his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and receive him to favour? would this be agreeable to his Holineſs, and Juſtice, and Truth? would this become the Wiſe Governour of the World, who loves Righteouſneſs and Order; who hates ſin, and is obliged

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:35252:151"/>
by the eſſential rectitude of his Nature to diſcountenance ſin?</p>
            <p>So that here is a conflict of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Perfections of God. The Mercy of God pities our Miſery, and would recover us, would open <hi>Paradiſe</hi> to us; but there is a <hi>flaming Sword</hi> that keeps us out; the incenſed Juſtice of God that muſt be ſatisfied; and if he take vengeance of us, we are eternally ruin'd; if he ſpare us, how ſhall <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Juſtice meet together?</hi> how ſhall God at once expreſs his Love to the Sinner, and his hatred to ſin? here is the difficulty of our Caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us now enquire what Means the Wiſdom of God uſeth for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. The Wiſdom of God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed this expedient to accommodate all theſe Difficulties, to reconcile the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Juſtice of God. The Son of God ſhall undertake this work, and ſatisfie the offended Juſtice of God, and repair the ruin'd Nature of Man. He ſhall bring God and Man together, make up this Gulph, and renew the Commerce and Correſpondence between God and us, which was broken off by Sin. The work that God deſigns is the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man, that is, his recovery from
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:35252:151"/>
a ſtate of Sin and Eternal Death, to a ſtate of Holineſs and Eternal Life. The Son of God is to engage in this Deſign of our Redemption, to ſatisfie the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Juſtice of God toward us, ſo as to purchaſe our deliverance from the Wrath to come, and ſo as to reſtore us to the Image and Favour of God, that we may be ſanctified, and be made Heirs of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>For opening of this, we will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<list>
                  <item>1. The fitneſs of the Perſon deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this Work.</item>
                  <item>2. The fitneſs of the Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was to accompliſh it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The fitneſs of the Perſon deſign'd for this Work; and that was the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son of God,</hi> who in reſpect of his Infinite Wiſdom and Power, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Credit of his Perſon, his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Father, and Intereſt in him, was very fit to undertake this Work, to mediate a Reconciliation between God and Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The fitneſs of the Means whereby he was to accompliſh it; and theſe I ſhall refer to <hi>two</hi> Heads, his <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Exaltation.</hi> All the Parts of theſe are very ſubſervient to the Deſign of our Redemption.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:35252:152"/>I. The <hi>Humiliation</hi> of Chriſt, which conſiſts of <hi>three</hi> principal Parts; his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi> his <hi>Life, and his Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Incarnation,</hi> which is ſet forth in Scripture by ſeveral Expreſſions; his being <hi>made fleſh, and dwelling among us,</hi> John 1.14. His being <hi>made of the ſeed of David according to the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 1.3. His being <hi>made of a woman,</hi> Gal. 4.4. The <hi>manifeſtation of God in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. His <hi>taking part of fleſh and blood,</hi> Heb. 2.14. His <hi>taking on him the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> and <hi>being made like unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> Heb. 2.16, 17. His <hi>coming in the fleſh,</hi> 1 John 2.2. All which ſignifies his taking upon him Humane Nature, and being really a Man as well as God. The Eternal Son of God, in the fulneſs of time took our Nature; that is, aſſumed a real Soul and Body into Union with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. Now this Perſon, who was really both God and man, was admirably fitted for the Work of our Redemption.</p>
            <p>In general, this made him a fit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, an equal and middle Perſon to interpoſe in this Difference, and take up this Quarrel between God and Man. Being both God and man, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for both Parties, and intereſted both in the Honour of God, and the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:35252:152"/>
Happineſs of Man, and engaged to be tender of both; and to procure the one by ſuch ways as might be conſiſtent with the other.</p>
            <p>More particularly, his <hi>Incarnation</hi> did fit him for thoſe <hi>two</hi> Offices which he was to perform in his Humiliation, of <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Office of <hi>Prophet,</hi> to teach us both by his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and his <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his Doctrine. His being in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Man,</hi> this made him more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to us. He was <hi>a Prophet raiſed up from among his Brethren,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, and he makes this an Argument why we ſhould hear him. Should God ſpeak to us immediately by himſelf, we <hi>could not hear him and live.</hi> God condeſcends to us, and complies with the weakneſs of our Nature, and <hi>raiſeth up a Prophet from among our brethren</hi>; We ſhould <hi>hear him.</hi> And then his being <hi>God,</hi> did add Credit and Authority to what he ſpake; he could confirm the Doctrine which he taught, by Miracles. Of his teaching us by his <hi>Life,</hi> I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak preſently.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Office of <hi>Prieſt.</hi> He was fit to be our <hi>Prieſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from among Men,</hi> as the Apoſtle
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:35252:153"/>
ſpeaks; fit to ſuffer as being, <hi>Man</hi> having <hi>a body prepared,</hi> as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. and fit to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> by his ſufferings for the Sins of all Men, as being <hi>God,</hi> which put an infinite Dignity and Value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the ſufferings of an <hi>infinite Perſon</hi> being equal to the offences done againſt an <hi>Infinite God.</hi> And thus the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God is exalted, without the Diminution of his <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as his <hi>Incarnation</hi> did qualifie him for ſuffering, ſo for compaſſion, and fellow-ſuffering with us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-prieſt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people; for in that he himſelf hath ſuffer'd being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>Life</hi> was a means admirably fitted to bring Men to Holineſs and Goodneſs. I might go through all the parts of it, but becauſe I intend to be very ſhort upon theſe Heads, I ſhall only take notice of that Part of his Life, which was ſpent in his publick Miniſtry; <hi>he went about doing good</hi>; the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that he Preached was Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the deſtroying of Sin, and the promoting of Holineſs; the great End
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:35252:153"/>
and Deſign of it was to advance Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Goodneſs, and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Patience, and Self-denial; to make us mortifie our ſenſual Deſires, and brutiſh Paſſions, to contemn and renounce this preſent World; and this being the deſign of it, it was a moſt proper Engine to demolſh the Works of the Devil: and to make way for the entertainment of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the whole frame of his <hi>Life,</hi> and all the circumſtances of it did contribute. His <hi>Life</hi> was the practice of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and a clear comment upon it. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Condition in the World, that he had no ſhare of the poſſeſſions of it, were a great advantage to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſelf-denial and contempt of the World. <hi>The Captain of our Salvation,</hi> that he might draw off our Affections from the World, and ſhew us how little the things of it are to be valued, would himſelf have no ſhare in it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.20. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have neſts; but the ſon of Man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> The mean circumſtances of his Condition were very eminently for the advantage of his Deſign; for had he not been ſtript of all worldly Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:35252:154"/>
he could not have been ſo free from ſuſpition of a worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Deſign; nay he could not have been ſo Conſiderable; he was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>greater</hi> for his Meanneſs. The very Heathens did account this true Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (as we find in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) not to admire the Pleaſures, and Greatneſs, and Pomp of the World. And that his Meanneſs might be no Diſadvantage to him, thoſe Evidences that he gave of his Divinity in the wonderful Things that he did, rendred him conſiderable, and gained more Reverence and Authority to his Doctrine, then his Meanneſs could bring Contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the manner of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was a very great Advantage to him; he was of a very ſweet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable and obliging Temper; and by this Means he did gain upon the People, and was acceptable to them; and thus he did apply himſelf to them in the moſt Humane ways, to make way for the Entertainment of his Doctrins. The Miracles that he wrought did confirm his Doctrine beyond all Exception, as being a Divine Teſtimony, and ſetting the Seal of God to the truth of it; yet
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:35252:154"/>
becauſe many were blinded with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and tho' they <hi>did ſee,</hi> yet <hi>would not ſee,</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Wiſdom of God</hi> did ſo order the buſineſs of his Miracles, as to make them Humane ways of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, for they were generally ſuch as were beneficial, <hi>he healed all manner of Diſeaſes</hi> and <hi>Maladies</hi> by this Miraculous Power; and ſo his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles did not only tend to confirm his Doctrine, as they were <hi>Miracles,</hi> but to make way for entertainment of it, as they were <hi>benefits</hi>; this was a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtration to them that he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> them good, becauſe he <hi>did</hi> them good; they would eaſily believe, that he who healed their <hi>Bodies,</hi> would not harm their <hi>Souls.</hi> This for his <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. His <hi>Death,</hi> which was the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtep of his <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of his ſufferings. Now the <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt did eminently contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to this Deſign of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Death of Chriſt did not only expiate the guilt of Sin, and pacifie Conſcience, by making plenary Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Divine Juſtice; but did eminently contribute to the killing of Sin in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old Man is crucified with him, that the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:35252:155"/>
body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we might not ſerve Sin.</hi> Rom. 8.3. <hi>God ſending his own Son in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin</hi> (that is by being a ſacrifice for Sin) <hi>condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> The <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt convinceth Sin to be a great Evil; and doth <hi>Condemn it,</hi> becauſe the impartial Juſtice of God did ſo ſeverely puniſh it in his own Son, when he appeared in the Perſon of a Sinner; and this is the moſt powerful Argument to us to crucifie Sin, that it crucified our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. That ſo Innocent and Holy a Perſon ſhould ſuffer ſo cruel and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious a Death for our Sins, ſhould ſet us for ever againſt it, and make us hate it with a perfect hatred.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of Chriſt's ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings are with admirable Wiſdom fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the conquering of Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Sin came by the <hi>Woman:</hi> the <hi>ſeed of the Woman</hi> ſuffers for Sin, and by ſuffering Conquers it. Sin began in the <hi>Garden</hi>: and there our Saviour began his ſufferings for Sin. Sin came by the <hi>Tree:</hi> and Chriſt bears the curſe of it <hi>in hanging upon the Tree,</hi> and crucifies it by his Croſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:35252:155"/>And as he conquer'd ſin, ſo he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame Satan by his own Arts. The Devil found Chriſt in the likneſs of a Man, he judged him Mortal, and his great Deſign was to procure his Death, and get him into his Grave. Chriſt permits him to bring about his Deſign, he lets him enter into <hi>Judas,</hi> he lets the <hi>Jews</hi> crucifie, and put him into his Grave, and roll a great ſtone upon it: but here his <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> appears, in ruining the Devil by his own Deſign, and <hi>ſnaring him in the works of his hands</hi>; Heb. 2.14. <hi>By death he deſtroys him, that had the power of death, that is the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the ſufferings of Chriſt were, by the <hi>wiſe of the World,</hi> made the great Objection againſt the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of this diſpenſation; the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt was to the Greeks fooliſhneſs</hi>: and yet the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> of them had determined otherwiſe in general, tho' not in this particular Caſe. <hi>Plato</hi> (in the ſecond Book of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth) ſaith,
<q>That a Man may be a perfect Pattern of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, and be approved by God and Men, he muſt be ſtript of all the things of this World, he muſt be poor and diſgraced, and be
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:35252:156"/>
accounted a wicked and unjuſt Man, he muſt be whipt, and tormented, and crucified as a Malefactor;</q> which is, as it were, a prophetical Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour's ſufferings.
And <hi>Arrian,</hi> in his <hi>Epict.</hi> deſcribing a Man fit to reform the World, whom he calls <q>the Apoſtle, the Meſſenger, the Preacher and Miniſter of God, ſaith, he muſt be without Houſe and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and worldly Accommodations; muſt be armed with ſuch Patience for the greateſt ſufferings, as if he were a Stone, and devoid of Senſe; he muſt be a ſpectacle of Miſery and Contempt to the World.</q>
So that by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of theſe <hi>two</hi> wiſe Heathens, there was nothing in the ſufferings of Chriſt that was unbecoming the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, and improper to the End and Deſign of Chriſt's coming into the World; beſides that they ſerved a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, which <hi>they</hi> did not dream of, <hi>the ſatisfying of Divine Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> His <hi>Exaltation.</hi> The ſeveral parts of which, his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,</hi> and <hi>ſitting the right hand of God,</hi> were eminently ſubſervient to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and carrying on of this Deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:35252:156"/>The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt is the great confirmation of the truth of all that he deliver'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Declared to be the ſon of God with power, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the Reſurrection from the Dead.</hi> This great Miracle of his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the Dead did <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi> the Controverſie, and put it out of all Doubt and Queſtion, that he was <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And then his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> and <hi>ſitting at the right hand of God,</hi> this gives us the aſſurance of a Bleſſed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and is a demonſtration of a life to come, and a pledge of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory and Happineſs. And can any thing tend more to the encouragement of Obedience, and to make us Dead to the Pleaſures and Enjoyments of this life, than the aſſurance of Eternal Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And then the Conſequents of his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,</hi> they do eminently conduce to our recovery. The ſending of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>to lead us into all truth,</hi> to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, to aſſiſt us, and to comfort us under the greateſt Troubles and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; and the powerful <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of Chriſt in our behalf; and his <hi>return to Judgment</hi>; the expectation whereof is the great Argument to Repentance
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:35252:157"/>
and Holineſs of Life. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30, 31. <hi>And the times of this ignorance God wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, but now commandeth all Men every where to repent: Becauſe he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the World in righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all Men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> And thus I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove that the <hi>Redemption of Man by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is a Deſign of <hi>admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>uſe</hi> I ſhall make of it, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the Uunreaſonableneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and the Folly and Madneſs of Impenitency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The unreaſonableneſs of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. The Goſpel reveals to us the wiſe Counſel and Diſpenſation of God for our Redemption; and thoſe who disbelieve the Goſpel, <hi>they reject the counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> as it is ſaid of the unbelieving Phariſees and Lawyers, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. The Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals to us a deſign ſo reaſonable and full of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that they who can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe it are deſperate Perſons, devoted to ruin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The croſs of Chriſt is to them that periſh fooliſhneſs.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <hi>But if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:35252:157"/>
to them that are loſt; in whom the God of this World hath blinded the eyes of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> The Goſpel carries ſo much light and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it, that it cannot be hid from any but ſuch whoſe Eyes are blinded by the Devil and their Luſts.</p>
            <p>He that will duly weigh and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Things, and look narrowly into this <hi>wiſe diſpenſation</hi> of God, ſhall find nothing to object againſt it; nay ſhall diſcover in it the greateſt motives and inducements to believe. We are apt to believe any thing that is reaſonable, eſpecially if it be for our Advantage; now this <hi>wiſe diſpenſation</hi> of God is not only reaſonable in it ſelf, but benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to us; it does at once highly gratifie our Underſtandings, and ſatisfie our Intereſt; why ſhould we not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and entertain it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The deſign of the Goſpel is <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</hi> and gratifies our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And in this reſpect the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath incomparable Advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any other Religion. The end of all Religion is to advance Piety and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and real Goodneſs among Men;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:35252:158"/>
and the more any Religion advanceth theſe, the more reaſonable it is. Now the great Incitements and Arguments to Piety, are the Excellency and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Divine Nature; fear of Puniſhment, and hopes of Pardon and Rewards. Now the Goſpel repreſents all theſe to the greateſt advantage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It repreſents the Perfections of God to the greateſt advantage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe which tend moſt to the promotion of Piety, and the love of God in us; his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) His <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The Goſpel repreſents it inflexible in its Rights, and inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and that will not in any caſe let Sin go unpuniſh'd. The impartiality of the Divine Juſtice appears in this Diſpenſation, that when God pardons the Sinner, yet he will puniſh Sin ſo ſeverely in his own Son who was the Surety. Now what could more tend to diſcountenance Sin, and convince us of the great evil of it?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) His <hi>Mercy.</hi> This Diſpenſation is a great demonſtration of the Mercy, and Goodneſs, and Love of God, in ſending his Son to die for Sinners, and in ſaving <hi>us</hi> by devoting and ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>him,</hi> John 3.16. <hi>For God ſo loved
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:35252:158"/>
the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> 1 John 4.9, 10. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Now this repreſentation of God's Mercy and Love which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel makes, is of great force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to melt our Hearts into love to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Argument to Piety is fear of Puniſhment. The Goſpel hath revealed to us the miſery of thoſe who continue in their Sin; it hath made clear and terrible diſcoveries of thoſe Torments which attend ſinners in another World, and hath open'd to us the Treaſures of God's Wrath; ſo that now under the Goſpel, <hi>hell is naked before us, and deſtruction hath no covering</hi>; and this is one thing which makes the Goſpel ſo powerful an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to deſtroy ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 18. <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for therein is the wrath of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:35252:159"/>
from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Hopes of Pardon and Reward. And this, added to the former, renders the Goſpel the moſt powerful Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take men off from ſin, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to Holineſs, that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. The Means to draw Men from ſin, when they are once awaken'd with the fear of Vengeance, is hopes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Mercy; and the way to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Obedience for the future, is hope of Reward. Now as an Argument to us to retreat and draw back from ſin, the Goſpel promiſes pardon and indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to us; and as an incitement to Holineſs, the Goſpel opens Heaven to us, and ſets before us everlaſting Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Happineſs, and gives us the greateſt aſſurance of it.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Deſign of the Goſpel is <hi>reaſonable,</hi> in that it does e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently and directly ſerve the ends of Piety and Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This Diſpenſation of God is <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi> to us, and ſatisfies our Intereſt; and this adds to the unreaſonableneſs of our Unbelief, this Deſign of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only <hi>reaſonable in it ſelf,</hi> but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable to us,</hi> that it ſhould be ſo; becauſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:35252:159"/>
of the eminent Advantages that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to us by it. The Deſign of the Goſpel is to deliver from the Guilt and Dominion of Sin, and the Tyranny of Satan; to reſtore us to the Image and Favour of God; and by making us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of a Divine Nature, to bring us to Eternal Life. And is there any thing of real Advantage which is not comprehended in this? Is it not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to every Man, that there ſhould be a way whereby our guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may be quieted and appeaſed; whereby we may be delivered from the fear of Death and Hell? Is it not deſirable to be freed from the ſlavery of our Luſts, and reſcued from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Power of the great Deſtroyer of Souls? Is it not deſirable to be like God, and to be aſſured of his Love and Favour, who is the beſt Friend, and the moſt dangerous Enemy; and to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, that when we leave this World, we ſhall be unſpeakably happy for ever? Now the Goſpel conveys theſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to us; and if this be the Caſe of the Goſpel, and there be nothing in this Deſign of our Redemption, but what is Wiſe and Reaſonable, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly for our Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:35252:160"/>
why ſhould any Man be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the Belief of it? Why ſhould Unbelief be counted a piece of Wit? Is it Wit to ſet our ſelves againſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to oppoſe our beſt Intereſt? 'Tis Wickedneſs, and Prejudice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs which disbelieves the Goſpel. Thoſe who do conſider things welcome this good News, and embrace theſe glad Tidings. <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children.</hi> To them who are truly ſenſible of their own Intereſt, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept of reaſonable Evidence, this is not only <hi>a true ſaying,</hi> but <hi>worthy of all acceptation; that Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This doth convince Men of the madneſs and folly of impenitency. Now the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God hath contrived ſuch a way of our Recovery, and by the Declaration of God's Wrath, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt ſin, hath given us ſuch Arguments to Repentance, and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering a way of Pardon and Mercy, hath given us ſuch encouragement to Repentance, how great muſt the Folly of impenitency be? For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That impenitency Directly ſets it ſelf againſt the <hi>Wiſdom of God.</hi> If
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:35252:160"/>
after all this we continue in our Sins, <hi>we reject the counſel of God againſt our ſelves,</hi> we deſpiſe the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, and <hi>charge</hi> that <hi>with Folly</hi>; and we do it <hi>againſt our ſelves,</hi> to our own injury and ruine. If we live in our Sins, and cheriſh our luſts, we directly oppoſe the end of our Redemtion, we contradict the great Deſign of the Goſpel, we contemn the admirable Contrivance of <hi>God's Wiſdom,</hi> who ſent his Son into the World on purpoſe to deſtroy Sin; for we uphold <hi>that</hi> which he came to deſtroy, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ye know that he was manifeſted to take away our Sins.</hi> Now ſhall we continue in Sin, when we know, <hi>the Son of God was manifeſted to take away Sin?</hi> God cannot but take it very ill at our hands, when he hath laid out <hi>the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his Wiſdom</hi> in this deſign, for us to go about to defeat him in it; this is at once to be unthankful to God, and injurious to our ſelves; 'tis ſuch a madneſs, as if a condemned Man ſhould deſpiſe a Pardon, as if a Priſoner ſhould be fond of his Fetters, and refuſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; as if a Man, deſperately ſick ſhould fight with his Phyſician, and put away Health from him. If we do not comply with the <hi>wiſdom of God,</hi> which hath contrived our recovery; <hi>we
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:35252:161"/>
forſake our own mercy,</hi> and <hi>neglect a great Salvation; we love death, and hate our own Souls,</hi> Prov. 8.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, we cannot expect <hi>the wiſdom of God</hi> ſhould do more for our recovery, than hath been already done; <hi>the wiſdom of God</hi> will not try any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means. Mat. 21.37. <hi>laſt of all he ſent his Son.</hi> If we deſpiſe this way, if we <hi>tread under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the Covenant, whereby we are ſanctified, an unholy thing, there will remain no more ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> Heb. 10.26, 29. What can expiate the guilt of ſin, if the Blood of Chriſt do not? What ſhall take us off from ſin, what ſhall ſanctifie us, if <hi>the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> be ineffectual? We reſiſt our laſt Remedy, and make void the beſt Means the Wiſdom of God could deviſe for our Recovery, if, after the revelation of the Goſpel, we continue in our Sins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we fruſtrate this Deſign of <hi>God's Wiſdom</hi> for our Recovery, our Ruin will be the more dreadful and certain. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency under the Goſpel will increaſe our Miſery. <hi>If Chriſt had not come, we had had no ſin,</hi> in compariſon of what we now have; <hi>but now our ſin remains,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:35252:161"/>
and there is no cloak for our ſin,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. We ſhall not be able at the day of Judgment to Preface any thing by way of Excuſe or Apology for our Impenitency. What ſhall we be able to ſay to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, when <hi>that</hi> ſhall condemn us, who rejected his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which would have ſaved us. We would all be ſaved, but we would be ſaved without Repentance; now <hi>the Wiſdom of God</hi> hath not found out any other way to ſave us from Hell, but by ſaving us from our ſins.

            <p>IN treating of the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, I have conſidered <hi>thoſe</hi> which relate to <hi>the Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> viz. <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; I come now to conſider <hi>thoſe</hi> which relate to <hi>the Divine Will,</hi> viz. theſe <hi>four,</hi> the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God. I begin with the <hi>Firſt,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:35252:163"/>At the 17 <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>chapter,</hi> God, by a great and wonderful Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his goodneſs, reveals to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his Intention concerning the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi>; upon this, <hi>Abraham</hi> v. 23. interceded with God for the ſaving of the Righteous Perſons, that were there; and to this end, he Pleads with God his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> with which he apprehended it to be in conſiſtent, <hi>to deſtroy the Righteous with the wicked,</hi> which, without a Miracle, could not be avoided in a general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Wilt thou alſo deſtroy the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, with the Wicked? Peradventure there be fifty Righteous within the City, wilt thou alſo deſtroy, and not ſpare the place for the fifty Righteous that are therein? that be far from thee to do after this manner, to ſlay the Righteous with the Wicked, and that the Righteous ſhould be as the Wicked, that be far from thee, ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> This Negative Interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is equivalent to a vehement affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>ſhall not the Judge all the Earth do right?</hi> that is, <hi>undoubtedly he will.</hi> This we may take for a certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Principle, that <hi>in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of rewards and puniſhments the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:35252:163"/>
Judge of the World will do Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Argument that lies under our Conſideration is the <hi>Juſtice of God in the diſtribution of Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> for the clearing of which, we will conſider it,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> in regard to the particular Caſe, which is here put by <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In <hi>Theſi,</hi> we will conſider it in General, in <hi>the Diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We will conſider it in <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſi,</hi> in regard to the particular Caſe which is here put by <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Text, and the rather, becauſe if we look well into it, there is ſomething of real Difficulty in it, not eaſie to be cleared; for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s reaſoning, if it be true, does plainly Conclude, that it would have been <hi>unrighteous</hi> with God in the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> not to make a difference between the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the Wicked, but to involve them equally in the ſame common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to ſlay the Righteous with the Wicked, and that the Righteous ſhould be as the Wicked, that be far from
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:35252:164"/>
thee, ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>ſurely the Judge of all the Earth will never do ſo unrighteous a Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding this, we ſee it is very uſual for the Providence of God to involve good Men in general Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and to make no viſible difference between the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked.</hi> Now the difficulty is, how to reconcile theſe appearances of Providence with this reaſoning of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Text.</p>
            <p>And for the doing of this, I ſee but one poſſible way, and that is this, that <hi>Abraham</hi> does not here ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Judgments of God which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal Men in the ordinary Courſe of his Providence, which many times happen promiſcuouſly, and involve good and bad Men in the ſame ruine; and the reaſon hereof is Plain, becauſe God in his ordinary Providence does permit the Cauſes, which produce theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to Act according to their own Nature, and they either <hi>cannot</hi> or <hi>will not</hi> make any diſtinction; for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which ordinarily happen in the World are produced by two ſorts of Cauſes either thoſe which we call <hi>Natural,</hi> or thoſe which are <hi>Voluntary.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:35252:164"/>
Natural</hi> Cauſes, ſuch as Wind, and Thunder, and Storms, and the infection of the Air, and the like, theſe acting by a Neceſſity of Nature, without any Knowledge or Choice, <hi>can</hi> make no diſtinction between the Good and the Bad. And the <hi>Voluntary</hi> Cauſes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, as Men are, they many times <hi>will</hi> make no difference between the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi>; nay many times they are Maliciouſly bent againſt the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and the effects of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice fall heavieſt upon them. Now we ſay that things happen in the way of ordinary Providence, when <hi>Natural</hi> Cauſes are permitted to Act according to their <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Voluntary</hi> Cauſes are left to their <hi>Liberty</hi>; and therefore in the courſe of ordinary Providence, it is not to be expected that ſuch a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould be made; it is neither poſſible, nor does Juſtice require it; it is not poſſible, ſuppoſing Natural Cauſes left to Act according to their Nature, and Voluntary Cauſes to be left to their Liberty; nor does Juſtice require it, for every Man is ſo much a Sinner, that no evil that befals him in this World, can be ſaid to be unjuſt in reſpect of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:35252:165"/>So that <hi>Abraham</hi> is not here to be underſtood, as ſpeaking of ſuch Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as befal Men in the ordinary courſe of God's Providence, in which, if the Good and Bad be involv'd alike, it cannot be expected to be otherwiſe, nor is there any injuſtice in it; but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> here ſpeaks of Miraculous and Extraordinary Judgments, which are immediately inflicted by God for the Puniſhment of ſome crying Sins, and the example of the World, to deter others from the like. And ſuch was this Judgment, which God intended to bring upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and which <hi>Abraham</hi> hath Relation to in this Diſcourſe of his. In <hi>this</hi> Caſe it may be expected from the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, that a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſhould be made between the-<hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi>; and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this is a Judgment which God himſelf executes. It is not an Event of common Providence, which always follows the Nature of its Cauſe; but an Act of God, as a <hi>Judge.</hi> Now it is eſſential to a Judge to make a Diſcrimination between the Good and the Bad, ſo as to puniſh the one, and ſpare the other; and this is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:35252:165"/>
to all <hi>proper Acts of Judgment</hi> in this World, as the other; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other difference between them, but that one is a <hi>Particular</hi> Judgment, and the other the <hi>General</hi> Judgment of the whole World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God goes out of the way of his ordinary Providence in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, it may reaſonably be expected that he ſhould make a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Good and the Bad; for the Reaſon, why he does not in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Providence is, becauſe he will not break and interrupt the eſtabliſht order of things, upon every little occaſion: But when he does go beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of Things in puniſhing, the Reaſon ceaſeth, which hindred him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from making a Difference; and 'tis reaſonable enough to expect, that in the inflicting of a <hi>Miraculous Judgment,</hi> a <hi>Miraculous Difference</hi> ſhould be made. Without making this difference, the end of theſe Miraculous Judgments would not be attained, which is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably to puniſh the crying Sins of Men, and by that example to deter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the like Sins: But if theſe Judgments ſhould fall promiſcuouſly upon the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked,</hi> it
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:35252:166"/>
would not be evident, that they were deſigned for the Puniſhment of ſuch Sins, when Men did ſee, that they fell likewiſe upon thoſe who were not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Sins, and conſequently the example could not be ſo effectual to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Men from Sin.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe accounts you ſee that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s reaſoning was very Strong and well Grounded, as to thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are <hi>Miraculous</hi> and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,</hi> and <hi>immediately inflicted</hi> by God, for the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of great and hainous Sins, which was the Caſe he was ſpeaking of. And accordingly we find, that in theſe Judgments which have been <hi>Immediately</hi> and <hi>Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly</hi> inflicted by God, he hath always made this difference between the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked.</hi> In the <hi>Deluge</hi> which he brought upon the old World, the Spirit of God gives this Reaſon why the Judgment was ſo univerſal, becauſe <hi>all Fleſh had corrupted his way upon the Earth</hi>; and the Reaſon, why he ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family was, becauſe in this general corruption of Mankind, he alone was Righteous; <hi>thee have I ſeen Righteous before me in this Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> So likewiſe in that Miraculous
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:35252:166"/>
Judgment of <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, when <hi>God made a new thing, and the Earth opened her mouth to ſwallow them up,</hi> none periſhed but <hi>he</hi> and <hi>his complices,</hi> the reſt had warning given them by God to <hi>remove from the tents of thoſe wicked Men.</hi> Thus you ſee that as to the particular Caſe in the Text, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s reaſoning concerning the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God is very firm, and concluding. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> Thing, which was that, which I principally intended to Diſcourſe upon, <hi>viz.</hi> to conſider the <hi>Juſtice of God in general, in the diſtribution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments.</hi> And here I cannot but grant, that the beſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this is yet wanting. We have clear demonſtrations of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God in this vaſt and admirable frame of Things which we ſee: but we muſt ſtay till <hi>the Day of Judgment</hi> for a clear and full Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of <hi>the Divine Juſtice</hi>; for which Reaſon <hi>the Day of Judgment</hi> is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture call'd, <hi>the Day of the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God.</hi> But in the mean time we may receive ſufficient aſſurance of this, both from <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> and from <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:35252:167"/>1. From <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> which tells us, that <hi>God loves Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>hates Iniquity,</hi> and conſequently that it muſt be agreable to his Nature to countenance and encourage the <hi>one,</hi> and to diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the <hi>other</hi>; that is, to give ſome publick Teſtimony of his liking and Affection to the <hi>one,</hi> and of his Hatred and Diſlike of the <hi>other,</hi> which cannot otherwiſe be done, but by <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however the Heathen reaſoned about this matter, whatever premiſes they laid, they firmly believed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that <hi>God is Juſt.</hi>
               <hi>Plato</hi> lays down this as a certain and undoubted Principle, <q>that God is in no wiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, but as Righteous, as is poſſible, and that we cannot reſemble God more, than in this quality and diſpoſition.</q>
So likewiſe <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us,
<q>That the Gods are neither capable of receiving an injury, nor of doing any thing that is unjuſt.</q>
               <hi>Antoninus</hi> the great Emperour and Philoſopher, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubtfully, whether good Men are extinguiſht by Death, or remain after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<q>If it be juſt, ſays he, you may be ſure it is ſo: if it be not juſt, you may certainly conclude the contrary,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:35252:167"/>
for God is juſt, and being ſo, he will do nothing that is unjuſt or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</q>
And indeed the Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers looked upon this as the great ſanction of all moral Precepts, that God was the <hi>Witneſs</hi> and the <hi>Avenger</hi> of the breach and violation of them, <hi>Qui ſecus faxit, deus ipſe vindex erit, If any Man do contrary to them, God himſelf will puniſh it</hi>; which ſhews, that there is a <hi>Natural Awe</hi> upon the Minds of Men of the <hi>Divine Juſtice,</hi> which will overtake offenders either in this World or the other. But this will more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear in the</p>
            <p n="2">2. Place, from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> And thoſe Texts which I ſhall produce to this purpoſe, may be reduced to theſe <hi>two</hi> Heads; either ſuch as prove the <hi>rectitude of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and his <hi>Juſtice</hi> in general; or ſuch as ſpeak more particularly of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> of his Providence <hi>in the diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments.</hi> I begin, <hi>firſt,</hi> with thoſe which declare the <hi>rectitude of the Divine Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God in general, and that either by attributing this Perfection to him, or by removing the contrary, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice</hi>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:35252:168"/>
and <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtance from him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe which attribute this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to God. I ſhall mention but a few of many, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.4. <hi>The Lord is Righteous.</hi> Dan. 9.7. <hi>O Lord! Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs belongeth unto thee.</hi> This good Men have acknowledged, when they have lain under the hand of God, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.15. <hi>O Lord God of Iſrael, thou art Righteous.</hi> And this the worſt of Men have been forced to own, when they have been in extremity, <hi>Ex.</hi> 9.27. then <hi>Pharoah ſaid, the Lord is Righteous.</hi> This hath been likewiſe acknowledged by thoſe who have layn under the greateſt temptation to doubt of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments, wherefore doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, notwithſtanding he ſaw the proſperous Condition of wicked Men, and the afflicted ſtate of the godly, which ſeemed hard to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile with the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet before he would ſo much as reaſon about it, he lays down this as a certain concluſion, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord.</hi> To this Head likewiſe
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:35252:168"/>
belong all thoſe Texts which ſpeak of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>God's dwelling Place</hi> and his <hi>Throne,</hi> of his <hi>Delight in Juſtice,</hi> and of the <hi>Duration</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> of it, which I need not particularly recite.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are likewiſe other Texts, which remove the contrary, <hi>viz. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice</hi> and <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> at the greateſt diſtance from God, as being moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Nature and Perfection. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4. <hi>A God of truth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iniquity.</hi> 2 Chron. 19.7. <hi>There is to iniquity with the Lord our God, nor accepting of Perſons, nor taking of Gifts.</hi> Job 8.3. <hi>Doth God pervert Judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert Juſtice?</hi> which is a vehement negation of the Thing. <hi>Job</hi> 34.10, 11, 12. <hi>Far be it from God, that he ſhould do wickedneſs, and from the Almighty, that he ſhould commit ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. For the work of a Man ſhall he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto him, and cauſe every Man to find according to his ways. Yea ſurely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert Judgment.</hi> Rom. 9.14. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? is there unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God? God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are other Texts which ſpeak more particularly of <hi>the Juſtice and Righteouſneſs of God in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:35252:169"/>
of Rewards and Puniſhments.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God doth not conſtantly appear in this World in the diſpenſations of his Providence becauſe this is a time of Patience and forbearance to Sinners, and of tryal and exerciſe to good Men; but there is a Day a coming, when all things ſhall be ſet ſtraight, and every Man ſhall receive the juſt reward of his Deeds when the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God ſhall be evident to all the World, and every Eye ſhall ſee it, and ſhall acknowledge <hi>the Righteous Judgment</hi> of God; and this the Scripture moſt clearly and expreſly declares unto us; and hence it is, that <hi>the Day of Judgment</hi> is call'd <hi>the Day of the Revelation of the Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</hi> The <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God doth not now ſo clearly appear, but that there are many Clouds over it; but there ſhall be <hi>a Day of Revelation,</hi> when the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God ſhall be made manifeſt to all the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>remunerative Juſtice</hi> of God ſhall then appear in the rewarding the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; and the <hi>punitive Juſtice</hi> of God in puniſhing the Wicked and Ungodly, <hi>ſo that a Man ſhall ſay, verily there is a reward for the Righteous, verily there is a God that judgeth the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:35252:169"/>Now the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of this venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, which God will take upon Sinners, is further ſet forth to us in Scripture, from the <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. From the <hi>Equity</hi> of it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that the Sins of Men have juſtly deſerved the Puniſhment, that ſhall come upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>Who knowing the judgment of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the righteous judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things, are worthy of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In that the Judgment of God ſhall be proportioned to the Degree and Heinouſneſs of Mens Sins; ſo as the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer or greater Sins ſhall be puniſht with more or leſs Severity. So our Saviour threatens to thoſe who continue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent under the Goſpel and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of it, their caſe ſhall be more ſad than <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> and <hi>it ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah at the Day of Judgment, than for them.</hi> Mat. 11.20, 21. and <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47, 48. There you have different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Puniſhment threatned, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Aggravations of the Sins, which Men have committed; <hi>The ſervant which knew his Lord's will, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:35252:170"/>
not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes: but he that knew it not, but did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes</hi>; and ſo proportionably of all other Aggravations of Sins, <hi>for to whom much is given, of him ſhall much be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and unto whom Men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</hi> So likewiſe God will vindicate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> more ſeverely, than of the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe the confirmation of it is clearer, and the Salvation offered by it greater. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward; how ſhall we eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape?</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>And however Men may bear up themſelves <hi>now</hi> upon their worldly Greatneſs and Power, certainly there is <hi>a time a coming,</hi> when the greateſt Perſons in the World, thoſe who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Kingdoms, and lay waſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and oppreſs and ruin Millions of Mankind for the gratifying of their own Luſts and Ambition, I ſay there is <hi>a Day coming,</hi> when even <hi>theſe,</hi> as much, nay more than others, ſhall fear and tremble before <hi>the impartial Juſtice</hi> of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15. <hi>And the Kings of the earth, and the great Men, and the rich Men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty Men, and every Bond-man, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Free-man hid themſelves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains; for the great Day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> The <hi>impartial Juſtice</hi> of God will treat the greateſt and the meaneſt Perſons alike, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in the books,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:35252:173"/>
according to their works.</hi> All judged <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould next proceed to vindicate <hi>the Juſtice of God in the Diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments</hi> from thoſe <hi>Objections,</hi> which ſeem to impeach it. But before I enter upon this, it will be convenient to ſatisfie one queſtion, which hath occaſioned great diſputes in the World, and that is, how far <hi>Juſtice,</hi> eſpecially as to <hi>the Puniſhment of Offenders</hi> is <hi>eſſential to God</hi>? And for the clearing of this matter I ſhall briefly lay down theſe Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I take this for a certain and undoubted Truth, that every <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is <hi>eſſential</hi> to God, and cannot be imagined to be ſeperated from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, becauſe this is the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion which Men have of God, that he is <hi>a Being that hath all Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The actual conſtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of thoſe Divine Perfections, the effects whereof are <hi>without himſelf,</hi> is not <hi>eſſential</hi> to God. For inſtance, tho' God be <hi>eſſentially powerful,</hi> and <hi>good</hi>; yet it is not neceſſary, that he ſhould <hi>always exerciſe</hi> his Power and Goodneſs; but at ſuch times, and in ſuch a manner,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:35252:174"/>
as ſeems beſt to his <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; and this is likewiſe true of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> becauſe <hi>theſe</hi> are Perfections, the effects whereof are terminated upon ſomething <hi>without himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is <hi>eſſential</hi> to God to love Goodneſs, and hate Sin, wherever he ſees them. It is not neceſſary there ſhould be a World, or reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in it: but upon ſuppoſition that God makes ſuch Creatures, it is agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Divine Nature, to give them good and righteous Laws, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in the doing of that which is good, and to diſcourage them from doing that which is evil, which cannot be done, but by <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and therefore it is agreable to the Perfection of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>to reward Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As for thoſe rewards which the Goſpel promiſeth, and the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which it threatens, there is ſome difference to be made between the <hi>rewarding</hi> and <hi>puniſhing juſtice</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for that abundant <hi>reward</hi> God is pleaſed to promiſe to good Men, the <hi>promiſe</hi> of it is founded in his <hi>goodneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:35252:174"/>
and <hi>the performance</hi> of that promiſe in his <hi>juſtice</hi>; for it is <hi>juſtice</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> what he promiſes, tho' the <hi>promiſe</hi> of ſo great and abundant a reward was meer <hi>goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the <hi>puniſhing juſtice</hi> of God, about which hath been the great Queſtion, whether <hi>that</hi> be <hi>eſſential</hi> to God or not, it ſeems very plain, that it is not <hi>neceſſary</hi> that God ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict thoſe judgments which he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, <hi>becauſe</hi> he hath threatned them; for there is not the like obligation upon Perſons <hi>to perform their threatnings,</hi> that there is <hi>to perform their promiſes</hi>; becauſe God by his <hi>promiſe</hi> becomes <hi>a Debtour</hi> to thoſe, to whom he makes the promiſe; but when he <hi>threatens,</hi> he is the <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi> and we are Debtors to his Juſtice; and as <hi>a Creditor,</hi> he may remit the Puniſhment which he hath threatned: But then if we conſider God as <hi>loving goodneſs</hi> and <hi>hating Sin</hi>; if we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as <hi>Governor of the World,</hi> and concerned to preſerve good Order, to encourage Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, and to diſcountenance Sin, under this conſideration it is <hi>eſſential</hi> to him <hi>to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Sin</hi> at ſuch times, and in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:35252:175"/>
and circumſtances, as ſeems beſt to his <hi>Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I am not at all moved by that, which is urged by ſome learned Men to the contrary, that if <hi>puniſhing juſtice</hi> were <hi>eſſential</hi> to God, then he muſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Sinner <hi>immediately,</hi> ſo ſoon as he hath offended, and to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of his Power; becauſe whatever Acts <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> Acts <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> and to the <hi>utmoſt:</hi> for I do not ſuppoſe <hi>ſuch a juſtice</hi> eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to God as Acts <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> but <hi>ſuch a juſtice,</hi> which as to the time, and manner, and circumſtances of its Acting is regulated and determined by his <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; and there is the ſame Reaſon likewiſe of his <hi>goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the Objections which are taken partly from the diſpenſations of God in <hi>this</hi> World; and partly from the puniſhments of <hi>the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the diſpenſations of God in <hi>this</hi> World, there are theſe <hi>two</hi> things Objected againſt the <hi>juſtice</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>inequality</hi> of God's dealings with good and bad Men in this World.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>tranſlation</hi> of Puniſhments, puniſhing one Man's Sin upon another,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:35252:175"/>
as the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children, of the Prince upon the People. I begin with the</p>
            <p n="1">I. Objection, the <hi>inequality</hi> of God's dealing with good and bad Men in this World. In this life things happen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, <hi>there is one event to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and to the wicked</hi>; if the Wicked ſuffer and are afflicted, ſo are the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; if the Righteous ſometimes flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſo do the Wicked; and is not this <hi>unjuſt,</hi> that thoſe who are ſo une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual as to their Deſerts ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually dealt withal? or if there be any inequality, it is uſually the wrong way, the Wicked do many times proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per more in the World, and the Righteous are frequently more afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This was the great Objection of old againſt the Providence of God, which the Heathen Philoſophers took ſo much pains to anſwer, nay it did often ſhake the faith of Holy and Good Men in the old Teſtament. <hi>Job</hi> 12.6. <hi>The tabernacles of robbers proſper, and they that provoke God are ſecure, into whoſe hand God bringeth abundantly.</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 21.7, 8, 9. he Expoſtulates the ſame matter again; and <hi>David</hi> ſays this was a great ſtumbling-Block to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2, 3.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:35252:176"/>
and the like we find in the Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection I have elſe-where conſidered, I ſhall now very briefly offer two or three Things, which I hope will be ſufficient to break the force of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt be granted, that it is not neceſſary to <hi>juſtice</hi> to ſhew it ſelf <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> and to diſpence Rewards and Puniſhments ſo ſoon as there are Objects for them. This is not thought neceſſary among Men, much more ought we to leave it to the Wiſdom of God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the time and circumſtances of the exerciſing of his Juſtice; and we are not to conclude that the Providence of God is unjuſt, if he do not beſtow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and inflict Puniſhments, juſt when we think he ſhould.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If God intended this Life for a State of Tryal, wherein he would prove the obedience of Men, and their free inclination to good or evil, it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect that he ſhould follow Men with preſent Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; for that would lay too great a force upon Men, ſo that there would hardly be any oportunity of <hi>trying</hi> them; but on the contrary, there is all the Reaſon in the World to preſume that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:35252:176"/>
God ſhould exerciſe the Graces and Virtues of good Men with afflictions and ſufferings, and ſuffer bad Men to take their Courſe for a while, and walk in their own ways, without continual Checks by frequent and remarkable Judgments upon them, ſo often as they offend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If there be another Life after this, wherein Men ſhall be Judged <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works,</hi> then this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vaniſheth, for that great Day will ſet all things ſtraight, which ſeem now to be ſo Crooked and Irregular. The deferring of Rewards and Puniſhments to the moſt convenient Seaſon, is ſo far from being a reflection upon the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God, that it is highly to the commendation of it. What <hi>Claudian</hi> ſays of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> a very bad Man, whoſe long impunity had tempted Men to call in queſtion the juſtice of God, is conſiderable in this Caſe;
<q>
                  <l>Abſtulit hunc tandem Ruffini poena tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multum,</l>
                  <l>Abſolvitque Deos.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Puniſhment which overtook him at laſt, did quiet thoſe tumultuous
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:35252:177"/>
thoughts, and abſolved the gods from all blame.</q>
When Men look but a little way, and conſider only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Things, they are ready to quarrel at the Juſtice of them; but if they would look at the end of Things, and have Patience to ſtay till the laſt, to ſee the Concluſion and Winding up of things, they would then acquit God in their thoughts from all thoſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of injuſtice, which from the <hi>inequality</hi> of preſent diſpenſations, raſh and inconſiderate Men are apt to charge him withal.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Objection, from the <hi>tranſlation</hi> of Puniſhments, the puniſhing of one Man's Sin upon another, as of <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the Children,</hi> which God threatens in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Commandment, and did in ſome ſort fulfil in <hi>Ahab,</hi> in <hi>bringing the evil he had threatned him withal, in his Son's Days,</hi> 1 Kings 21.19. The puniſhing the Sin of one Perſon upon a People, as that of <hi>Achan</hi> upon the whole Congregation, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Did not Achan the ſon of Zerah commit a treſpaſs in the accurſed thing? and wrath fell on all the congregation of Iſrael, and that man periſhed not alone in his iniquity.</hi> And the Sin of <hi>David</hi> upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:35252:177"/>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. When <hi>ſeventy thouſand</hi> Dyed of the Plague, for <hi>David</hi>'s Sin in numbring the People. Now how is this agreable to <hi>juſtice?</hi> is it not a known Rule, <hi>Noxa caput ſequitur, Miſchief purſues the Sinner?</hi> What can be more reaſonable, <hi>Quam ut peccata ſuos teneant Authores, Than that Men's faults ſhould be charged upon the Authors,</hi> and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fall upon the guilty?</p>
            <p>For anſwer to this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not unreaſonable that one Man ſhould bear the puniſhment of another's Fault, if he be willing and content to bear it, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria, There is no wrong done to thoſe, that are willing to undergo it,</hi> tho' they be <hi>innocent,</hi> which was the caſe of our Bleſſed Saviour ſuffering for us, <hi>the juſt for the unjuſt,</hi> as the Scripture expreſſeth it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where the Perſon, upon whom the puniſhment is trasfer'd, is likewiſe <hi>a ſinner,</hi> and obnoxious to God, there can be no <hi>injuſtice</hi>; becauſe he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it upon his own account, and God may take what occaſion he pleaſeth to puniſh them that deſerve to be puniſht.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In puniſhing the iniquity of <hi>the Father upon the Children,</hi> the guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is, <hi>the Father,</hi> is puniſht in the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:35252:178"/>
Calamity of <hi>his Children,</hi> for a Man's <hi>Children</hi> are <hi>himſelf Multiplyed</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very remarkable that in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Commandment, God promiſeth <hi>to ſhew mercy to thouſands of Generations of them that love him</hi>; but <hi>he viſits the iniquities of the Fathers upon the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> but <hi>to the third and fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is ſo far as a Man may live to ſee them puniſht, and ſuffer in their Puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the Puniſhment of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> for the ſins of their <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> and <hi>one part</hi> of a community for <hi>another,</hi> ſuppoſing all of them to be <hi>Sinners,</hi> which is the true caſe, God may lay the puniſhment where he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and there is no more injuſtice then when a Man is whipt on the <hi>Back</hi> for the theft which his <hi>hand</hi> committed, a community being <hi>one Body</hi>; beſides the <hi>Prince</hi> is puniſht in the loſs of his <hi>People,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> conſiſting in the <hi>Multitude</hi> of his <hi>Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Objection with reſpect to the <hi>other</hi> World, the puniſhment of <hi>temporal</hi> Evils with <hi>Eternal,</hi> is elſe-where an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd.</p>
            <p>The uſe we ſhould make of this whole Diſcourſe is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:35252:178"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If God be <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Righteous,</hi> let us acknowledge it in all his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, even in thoſe, the Reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is moſt hidden and obſcure. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.33. Speaking of the great afflictions that had befal'n God's own People, yet this he lays down as a firm Principle, <hi>howbeit thou art juſt in all that is brought upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is matter of terrour to wicked Men. God doth <hi>now</hi> exerciſe his <hi>milder</hi> Attributes towards Sinners, his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi>; but if we deſpiſe theſe, that <hi>terrible</hi> Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> will deſplay it ſelf; and this the Scripture deſcribes in a ſevere manner, <hi>the Lord revengeth, and is jealous; the Lord will take vengeance on his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> and <hi>reſerveth wrath for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. What we are to underſtand by the <hi>Truth</hi> of God. I ſhall take it as the Scripture uſeth it in a large Senſe, ſo as
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:35252:180"/>
to include not only the <hi>veracity</hi> of God; but his <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> Hence it is that in Scripture <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> are ſo often put together, and frequently put one for another, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of old are faithfulneſs and truth.</hi> Rev. 21.5. <hi>Theſe words are true and faithful.</hi> And the <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of God, in <hi>performing his Promiſes,</hi> is frequently call'd his <hi>Truth.</hi> And becauſe the Scripture uſeth them promiſcuouſly, we need not be very ſolicitous to find out diſtinct No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them; but if you will, they may be diſtinguiſht thus; the <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>veracity</hi> of God hath place in <hi>every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> of his Mind; the Faithfulneſs of God only in his <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>veracity</hi> or <hi>truth</hi> of God; this hath place in <hi>every Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his Mind, and ſignifies an exact Correſpondence and Conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his <hi>Word</hi> and his <hi>Mind,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently between his <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality of Things.</hi> The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of his <hi>Word</hi> with his <hi>Mind,</hi> depends upon <hi>the rectitude</hi> of his <hi>Will</hi>; the conformity of his <hi>Word</hi> with <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of Things,</hi> not only upon the <hi>recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> but the <hi>Perfection</hi> of his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and the <hi>infallibility</hi> of his

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi>; ſo that when we ſay God is <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>ſpeaks Truth,</hi> we mean thus, that his <hi>Words</hi> are a plain Declaration of his <hi>Mind,</hi> and a true repreſentation of <hi>Things,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Falſe-hood,</hi> which is ſpeaking otherwiſe than the <hi>thing</hi> is; and <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> that is, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe than we <hi>think.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when God declares any thing to be ſo, or not to be ſo, to have been thus, or not to have been thus, the thing really is ſo, and he thinks ſo; when he expreſſeth his deſire of any thing, he does really deſire it; when he commands any thing, or forbids us any thing, it is really his Mind and Will that we ſhould do what he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and avoid what he forbids; when he declares and foretels any thing future, it really ſhall come to paſs, and he really intended it ſhould; if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration be to be underſtood abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſhall abſolutely come to paſs; if the Declaration be to be underſtood Conditionally, it ſhall come to paſs, and he intends it ſhall, if the Condition be performed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of God. This only hath place in his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> in which
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:35252:181"/>
there is an Obligation of <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his <hi>Word</hi>; for God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth not only declare what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and what ſhall be; but confers a right upon them to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made, ſo as that the breach of his Promiſe would not only caſt an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation upon his <hi>Truth,</hi> but upon his <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That this Perfection belongs to God. And this I ſhall endeavour to prove,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the Dictates of <hi>Natural Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the Dictates of <hi>Natural Light. Natural Light</hi> tells us, that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> are <hi>Perfections,</hi> and conſequently belong to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that <hi>Falſe-hood</hi> and <hi>a Lie</hi> are <hi>Imperfections,</hi> and to be removed from God. There is nothing that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men eſteemed a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely and reproach, than <hi>to give a Man the Lie,</hi> to call him a <hi>Lyar,</hi> becauſe it is an Argument of ſo much baſeneſs, and of a low and mean and ſervile ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the uſual Temptation to it being fear of loſing ſome Advantage, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:35252:181"/>
ſome danger. Hence was that ſaying, that <hi>it is the property of a Slave to lie, but of a free Man to ſpeak truth:</hi> Now whatever argues baſeneſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, our Reaſon tells us is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to be ſeparated from the moſt Perfect Being. <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil,</hi> the Divine Nature being all-ſufficient, can have no temptation to be otherwiſe than Good and Juſt, and True and Faithful. Men are tempted to Lie by advantage, and out of fear: but the Divine Nature hath the ſecurity of its fullneſs and all-ſufficiency, that it cannot hope for any increaſe, nor fear any impairment of its Eſtate. Men are unfaithful, and break their Words, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they are raſh and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in paſſing of them, or forgetful in minding them, or inconſtant in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, or impotent and unable to perform them: but none of theſe are incident to God, his infinite Wiſdom, and perfect Knowledge, and clear fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of all Events, ſecure him both from inconſiderateneſs, and inconſtancy, and forgetfulneſs; and his infinite Power renders him able to perform what he hath ſpoken, and to make good his Word. And that theſe are the <hi>Natural</hi>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:35252:182"/>
Dictates and Suggeſtions of our Minds, appears clearly from the reaſonings of the Heathen in this matter, who were deſtitute of Divine Revelation. <hi>Plato de Repub.</hi> l. 2. lays down this as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth,
<q>That lying and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are imperfections, and odious to God and Men, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</q>
And afterwards he tells us,
<q>That the Divine Nature is free from all Temptation hereto, either from advantage or fear; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;</q>
and Concludes,
<q>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is true, and deals plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, both in his Words and Actions, and is neither changed himſelf, nor deceives us.</q>
               <hi>Porphyry</hi> in the Life of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> tells us,
<q>That this was one of his Precepts, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;</q>
and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he adds,
<q>that Truth is ſo great a Perfection, that if God would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf viſible to Men, he would chuſe <hi>Light for his body, and Truth for his Soul.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:35252:182"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From <hi>Scripture.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth very frequently attribute this to God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.28. <hi>And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and thy words be true</hi>; Pſal. 25.10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth</hi>; Pſal. 31.5. <hi>Into thy hand I commit my ſpirit: thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me, O Lord God of truth.</hi> Rev. 3.7. <hi>Theſe things ſaith he, that is holy, he that is true.</hi> Rev. 6.10. <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true?</hi> 15.3. <hi>Juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints.</hi> 16.7. <hi>True and righteous are thy judgments.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may refer thoſe Texts which ſpeak of the Plenty and Abundance of God's truth, <hi>Ex.</hi> 34.6. <hi>Abundant in goodneſs and truth.</hi> Pſal. 86.15. <hi>Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in mercy and truth</hi>; and thoſe which ſpeak of the Duration and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.5. <hi>And his truth endureth to all generations.</hi> 117.2. <hi>And the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> 146.6. <hi>Who keepeth truth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Scripture doth attribute this Perfection to God, ſo it removes the contrary from him with the greateſt abhorrence and deteſtation, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. <hi>God is not a Man that he ſhould lie, neither the ſon of Man that he ſhould repent, hath he ſaid, and ſhall not he do it? hath he
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:35252:183"/>
ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> They are <hi>Balaam's</hi> Words, but God put them into his Mouth. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael will not lie nor repent, for he is not a Man that he ſhould repent.</hi> Rom. 3.4. <hi>Yea let God be true, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man a Lyar.</hi> Nay the Scripture goes further, does not only remove lying and falſe-hood and inconſtancy from God, but ſpeaks of theſe as things <hi>impoſſible</hi> to the Divine Nature; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the World began.</hi> Heb. 6.18. <hi>That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Scripture doth not only in general attribute this Perfection to God, but doth more particularly aſſure us of his <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Of his <hi>ſincerity</hi>; that he deals plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, and ſpeaks what he intends, that his Words are the image of his Thoughts, and a true repreſentation of his Mind. God is very careful to remove this jealouſie out of the Minds of Men, who are apt to entertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Thoughts of God, as if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:35252:183"/>
all that he hath declared, he had a ſecret deſign to ruin Men; therefore he interpoſeth his Oath for our greater aſſurance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live.</hi> When God ſpeaks to us, he ſpeaks his Mind, and hath no deſign to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and poſſeſs us with Errour and Deluſion; if he offer Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we may believe he is real, and that if he did not intend to beſtow it upon us, or if there were no ſuch thing as a future Glory, he would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to us; this was the temper of our Saviour, who was <hi>the expreſs image of the Father, full of Grace and Truth.</hi> John 14.2. <hi>In my Father's houſe are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manſions; if it were not ſo, I would have told you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Scripture aſſures us of his <hi>Sincerity,</hi> ſo of his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of all his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> and <hi>performance</hi> of all his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi> As for the truth of his <hi>Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and certain accompliſhment of them, the Scripture frequently uſeth this Proverbial Speech, to aſſure us of the certainty of their accompliſhment;
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:35252:184"/>
               <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs away.</hi> Mat. 24.35. For the Faithfulneſs of God in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> the Scripture makes frequent mention of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy.</hi> Pſal. 89.33, 34. <hi>I will not ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail, my covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing which is gone out of my lips.</hi> The Scripture doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord God's punctual and full perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Promiſes; particularly of that Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> after four hundred Years to bring the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt, and to give them the Land of Canaan for an Inheritance.</hi> Gen. 15.13. the Punctual accompliſhment you have recorded, <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.41. <hi>And it came to paſs at the end of the four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty Years, even the ſelf ſame day it came to paſs, that all the hoſts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt</hi>; ſee likewiſe <hi>Joſ.</hi> 21.44, 45. and 23.14. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.56. And upon this account it is that God is ſo frequently in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtyl'd <hi>the God that keepeth covenant.</hi> 1 Kings 8.23. Neh. 1.5.9.32. and in ſeveral other Places. And ſo likewiſe of <hi>Predictions of evil to come,</hi> God is
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:35252:184"/>
true in fulfilling his Word. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I come to remove ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may be made againſt the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> of God.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to <hi>three</hi> of theſe Texts, it is a known <hi>Hebraiſm</hi> to expreſs things in an <hi>imperative</hi> and <hi>active</hi> form, which are to be underſtood only <hi>permiſſively.</hi> So where <hi>the Devils beſought Chriſt, that he would ſuffer them to enter into the herd of Swine, he ſaid unto them go,</hi> Mat. 8.31.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:35252:185"/>
himſelf to be <hi>a lying ſpirit in the mouth of the Prophet,</hi> and God ſays <hi>go forth and do ſo</hi>; this only ſignifies <hi>a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> not <hi>a command.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.10. where the Prophet complains that God had greatly deceived the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>ſaying they ſhould have peace, when the ſword reached to the Soul</hi>; we are to underſtand this no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but that God <hi>permitted</hi> the falſe Prophets to deceive them, by Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying Peace to them, as appears by the Hiſtory. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.9. <hi>I the Lord have deceived that Prophet,</hi> that is <hi>permitted him to be deceived, and to deceive the People,</hi> as a juſt judgment upon them for their Infidelity with reſpect to his true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Covenant of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was upon conſideration of his paſt Faith and Obedience, tho' it ſeems the full performance of it did likewiſe depend upon the future Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his poſterity; in purſuance of this Covenant, notwithſtanding all the murmerings and rebellions of that People, God did bring them into the promiſed Land, tho' <hi>they provoked him to deſtroy them many a time; becauſe he remembred his covenant with</hi> Abraham; when they were poſſeſt of it, God gave them a <hi>title</hi> to the reſt, and would have aſſiſted them in the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> of it, if they had performed the <hi>Condition</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on their part, that is, continued Faithful and Obedient to him, but they did not, and thereby diſcharged God from any further performance of his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:35252:187"/>
Promiſe; and God when he had done this, had fully performed the Covenant he made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>his</hi> part, as appears by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> even in a time when a great part of the Land was unconquer'd, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21.44. and of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> 1 Kings 8.56. yea and had it not been that God had made this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as well upon conſideration of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Faith and Obedience, as upon Condition of the future Obedience of his Poſterity, the Rebellions and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the People in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had releaſed God wholly from the Promiſe, and he had not been unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful if <hi>he had deſtroyed utterly that People, and made a full end of them,</hi> and they had <hi>never entred into that Land,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a failure of the <hi>Condition</hi> doth make the <hi>Obligation</hi> to ceaſe; and that this Condition was imply'd in this Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> appears by theſe Texts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12, 13.11.22.23.42. and <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.20. God gives this Reaſon why he ſuſpended the compleat performance of his Promiſe, <hi>the anger of the Lord was hot againſt Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and he ſaid, becauſe that this People
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:35252:188"/>
hath tranſgreſſed my Covenant which I commanded their Fathers, and have not harkned to my voice, I alſo will not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth drive out any of the Nations which Joſhua left when he died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Objection, God is not punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in performing his <hi>Threatnings</hi>; as when he threatned <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die</hi>; which yet was not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht, for he lived many hundred Years after. God threatned <hi>Ahab to bring evil upon him and his family,</hi> 1 Kings 21.21. But upon his Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he is pleaſed to reſpite it, <hi>v.</hi> 29. So God threatned <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with <hi>Death,</hi> but upon his prayer <hi>adds fifteen Years to his Life.</hi> 2 Kings 20. Thus <hi>Nineveh</hi> was threatned, but upon their Repentance, <hi>God repented of the evil,</hi> Jon. 3.10. Now how is this deferring and turning away of judgment conſiſtent with the <hi>Truth</hi> of God? doth not this ſeem to charge him with <hi>falſe-hood or levity</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This may be ſaid in general, that every one that underſtands the Nature of God, cannot but be very well aſſur'd, that <hi>falſe-hood</hi> and <hi>levity</hi> are very far from God; and tho' he could
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:35252:188"/>
not untie ſome particular Knots, and anſwer all difficulties, yet he ought to reſt ſatisfied in this aſſurance. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this Objection is troubleſom, and requires a diſtinct Conſideration. I will not be peremptory in nice matters, but I ſhall, with ſubmiſſion, offer theſe things in anſwer to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for the expreſſion of <hi>God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,</hi> we are to underſtand it, as many others in Scripture, <hi>after the manner of Men,</hi> and ſpoken by way of <hi>conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention</hi> to our Weakneſs, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to our Capacities, and not as caſting any imputation of <hi>falſe hood</hi> or <hi>inconſtancy</hi> upon God, as if either he did not intend what he ſaith, or out of levity did alter his Mind. When God is ſaid <hi>to repent,</hi> the expreſſion only ſignifies thus much, that God <hi>doth not execute</hi> that which <hi>ſeemed</hi> to us to have been his purpoſe, that he is pleaſed to do otherwiſe than his threatnings <hi>ſeemed openly to expreſs,</hi> becauſe of ſome <hi>tacit Condition</hi> implyed in them; and this doth not derogate either from the <hi>truth,</hi> or <hi>ſincerity,</hi> or <hi>conſtancy</hi> of God in his Word. Not from his <hi>truth</hi>; for he ſpeaks what he intends really, if ſomething did nor intervene to prevent the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:35252:189"/>
Judgment threatned, upon which he was reſolved, when he threatned, to be taken off and ſtop his Judgments: Nor doth it derogate from his <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>plainneſs</hi>; for he hath told us that his threatnings have ſuch Conditions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in them: Nor doth it derogate from the <hi>conſtancy</hi> and <hi>immutability</hi> of God; becauſe God doth not <hi>mutare conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium ſed ſententiam, he doth not change his counſel and purpoſe, but takes off the ſentence,</hi> which he had paſt with reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Conditions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Inſtances, that I may give more particular ſatisfaction to them, I ſhall Conſider the threatnings of God with this double reſpect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with relation to <hi>Law,</hi> or with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Event</hi>; with relation to <hi>a Law,</hi> as they are the <hi>ſanction</hi> of it; or with relation to the <hi>Event,</hi> as they are <hi>Predictions</hi> of ſomething to come.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Some threatnings have only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>a Law,</hi> as they are the <hi>ſanction</hi> of it. And thus conſider'd, they differ from <hi>Promiſes</hi>; for <hi>Promiſes</hi> confer a <hi>Right, omne promiſſum cadit in debitum</hi>; but a <hi>threatning</hi> doth not convey any <hi>Right,</hi> nor if forborn can the party com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of <hi>Wrong</hi> done to him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:35252:189"/>
in this Caſe it can only ſignifie what the offence againſt the Law deſerves, and what the offender may expect; for the <hi>end</hi> of threatning is not <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> but the <hi>avoiding</hi> of it. And this may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the <hi>firſt</hi> Inſtance. God gave <hi>Adam a Law</hi>; and by way of <hi>Sanction,</hi> not of <hi>Prediction</hi> of an Event, he threatned the breach of it with Death: Now God did not execute the Puniſhment threatned at the time threatned, but deferr'd it, and this without any impeachment of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> becauſe this threatning was only the <hi>Sanction of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We may conſider Threatnings with Relation to <hi>the Event</hi> and as <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi>; and as to the accompliſhment of theſe, there ſeems to be a greater degree of Neceſſity, becauſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God's <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> ſeem to be concerned in them; for if his Word be not fulfill'd, it muſt either be for want of <hi>Knowledge</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee Events, or <hi>Power</hi> to bring them to paſs, or <hi>Conſtancy</hi> to his Word. Now if we conſider Threatnings with reſpect to the <hi>Event,</hi> as they are <hi>Predictions</hi> of future <hi>Judgements,</hi> I think all the other Inſtances may be ſatisfied, by laying down this Rule for the underſtanding
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:35252:190"/>
of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That all Prophetical Threatnings or Predictions of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to be underſtood with this <hi>tacit Condition,</hi> if there do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene the Humiliation, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Prayer of the Perſons againſt whom the Judgment is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and if ſo, God may upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without any impeachment of the honour of his <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> either defer, or abate, or remit the Puniſhment.</q>
And that the <hi>Predictions</hi> of Judgments are to be underſtood with this Condition, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears clearly from that known Text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8.</p>
            <p>I come now to the laſt thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to make ſome <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If God be <hi>a God of Truth,</hi> then this gives us aſſurance that he doth not deceive us, that the Faculties which he hath given us are not falſe, but when they have clear perceptions of Things, they do not err and miſtake. Were it not for the <hi>veracity</hi> of God, we might, for any thing we know, be under a conſtant Deluſion; and no Man could demonſtate the contrary, but that this is our make and temper, and the very
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:35252:190"/>
frame of our Underſtandings, to be then moſt of all deceived, when we think our ſelves to be moſt certain; I ſay no Man could be aſſured of the contrary, but from hence, becauſe <hi>veracity</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> is <hi>a Divine Perfection</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God cannot be the Author of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Deluſion. Therefore we may be aſſured, that the frame of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings is not a Cheat, but that our Faculties are true, and unleſs it be our own fault, we need not be deceived in things that are neceſſary to our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If God be <hi>a God of Truth,</hi> then there is Reaſon why we ſhould believe and aſſent to whatever we are ſatisfied is revealed to us by God. A Divine Revelation is a ſufficient ground for the moſt firm aſſent; for this very thing, that any thing is revealed by God, is the higheſt Evidence, and ought to give us the moſt firm aſſurance of the truth of it. Hence it is that the Word of God is call'd <hi>the Word of truth,</hi> yea and <hi>truth it ſelf,</hi> John 17.17. <hi>Thy Word is truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore whoever entertains the <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>criptures as the Word of God, and is ſatisfied of the Divine Authority of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:35252:191"/>
them, ought in Reaſon to believe every thing contained in them, yea tho' there be ſome things of which no reaſonable account can be given, and which our Reaſon and Underſtanding cannot give us particular ſatisfaction in; yet becauſe we are ſatisfied that they are revealed by <hi>God who cannot lie,</hi> whoſe Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is infallible, and whoſe Word is true, we ought upon this higher and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Reaſon to yield a firm aſſent to the truth of them: if we do not, we diſhonour this Perfection of God, and rob him of this <hi>eſſential property,</hi> his <hi>Veracity.</hi> 1 John 5.10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeh not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that God gave of his Son.</hi> As on the other hand, if we do believe what God hath revealed, we glorifie this Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his, and ſet our ſeal to his Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So 'tis ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.20. That <hi>he was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning our Saviour, ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.33. <hi>He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeal, that God is true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:35252:191"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If God be <hi>a God of truth,</hi> and faithful in performing his Promiſe, then here is a firm Foundation for our Hope and Truſt. If God have made any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, we may ſecurely rely upon it, that it ſhall be made good; we may <hi>hold faſt</hi> our hope <hi>without wavering, becauſe he is faithful who hath promiſed,</hi> Heb. 10.23. Hence it is that the Bleſſings of God's Covenant are call'd <hi>ſure mercies,</hi> Iſa. 55.3.</p>
            <p>We attribute much to the Word of a faithful Friend, and look upon the Promiſe of an honeſt Man as very good ſecurity; but <hi>Men</hi> may fail us when we rely upon them: but <hi>God is true,</hi> tho' <hi>all Men ſhould prove Lyars.</hi> Men are fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle and murable; but the Nature of God is fixt, he cannot fail thoſe that truſt in him. When God hath made any Promiſe to us, we may plead it with him, and urge him with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. So we find <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.25. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Only we ſhould be careful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>Condition</hi> which is required on our part, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. we ſhould <hi>take heed leſt a Promiſe being left us, any one ſhould come ſhort of it,</hi> by not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Condition</hi>; for <hi>that</hi> doth releaſe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:35252:192"/>
and diſcharge him of the Promiſe, and <hi>he is faithful,</hi> tho' he doth not perform what he promiſed, becauſe he did not promiſe but upon <hi>Condition</hi>; and this ſeem to be the meaning of thoſe Words, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf.</hi> He ſaid before, that if we perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required, God will beſtow the Bleſſings promiſed, <hi>It is a faithful ſaying, for if we be dead with him, we alſo ſhall live with him; if we ſuffer, we alſo ſhall reign with him; but if we deny him,</hi> the Curſe threatned will then take place, and <hi>he will deny us</hi>; and God is <hi>not unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in doing this, <hi>he does not deny himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we have ſuch aſſurance, we may truſt him with our greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, and venture our Souls with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. <hi>Into thy hands I commit my ſpirit, O Lord God of truth.</hi> We ſhould rely upon him, when there are the greateſt improbabilities of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his Promiſes. Thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.17. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This ſhould alſo make us <hi>patient in hope</hi>; if a Promiſe be not ſpeedily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht, we ſhould not be dejected or diſquieted. <hi>David</hi> challengeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon this account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:35252:192"/>
               <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? and why art thou diſquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</hi> And ſo likewiſe in reference to the Rewards of another World, tho' at a diſtance, yet we ſhould, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, <hi>wait for the bleſſed Hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Truth</hi> of God is matter of terrour to the Wicked. All the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of temporal Evils may juſtly be expected, becauſe their Sins deſerve them, and there is no <hi>Condition</hi> implyed in them, upon which thou canſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hope for the avoiding or abating of the Evils threatned, but of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe threatnings thou conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueſt in thy Sins, and <hi>bleſſeſt thy ſelf, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhall have peace, tho' thou walk in the imaginations of thy heart,</hi> by this very thing thou provokeſt the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God <hi>not to ſpare thee,</hi> and makeſt <hi>his wrath and his jealouſie to ſmoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee</hi>; and if thou continueſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, however he may defer the execution of <hi>temporal</hi> Evils, his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> is concerned to inflict <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Puniſhments upon thee; for <hi>he
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:35252:193"/>
hath ſworn in his wrath</hi> that ſuch <hi>ſhall no enter into his reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let us propound to our ſelves the <hi>truth</hi> of God for our pattern and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Would you be like God? be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful. Truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> are <hi>Divine Perfections</hi>; but <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> are the Properties of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the predominant qualities of <hi>Hell.</hi> The character of the Devil is, that <hi>he abode not in the truth, and there is no truth in him, when he ſpeaketh a lie, 'tis of his own, for he is a lyar and the Father of it.</hi> John 8.44.</p>
            <p>One of the firſt and moſt natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that we have of Religion is, that it is <hi>to imitate God,</hi> and to endeavour to be like him, ſo far as we are capable; and to contradict any of the Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Perfections is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sin, becauſe it is againſt the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Dictates of our Mind, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to thoſe Principles which are moſt deeply rooted in our Nature. No Man can be Cruel and Unmerciful, Falſe and Treacherous, without a very high degree of guilt, becauſe theſe Sins are contrary to the chiefeſt and moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Perfections of God. <hi>Lying</hi> is a Sin that would fly in the Face of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:35252:193"/>
becauſe it directly contradicts thoſe Natural Notions which every Man hath of God and Religion; therefore we find that there is hardly any thing that Men are more aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of than <hi>to be taken in a Lie,</hi> and 'tis eſteemed the higheſt reproach to be charged with it, it argues ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrariety to that which is the Rule of Perfection, <hi>the Nature of God,</hi> and conſequently ſo much imperfection and baſeneſs. He that tells a Lie out of fear is at once bold towards God, and baſe towards Men.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe accounts God expreſſeth himſelf highly offended with thoſe that practiſe <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Falſe-hood,</hi> and to have a deteſtation of them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> It renders us unlike to him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24, 25. <hi>Put on the new Man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs</hi> (or <hi>in the Holineſs of truth.)</hi> And from hence he infers, <hi>Wherefore putting away lying, ſpeak every Man truth with his Neighbour: for we are members one of another.</hi> Col. 3.9.10. <hi>Lie not one to another, ſeeing that ye have put off the old Man with his deeds: And have put
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:35252:194"/>
on the new Man, which is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, after the image of him that created him</hi>; that is, becauſe we profeſs to be conformed to <hi>the image of God.</hi> More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, we ſhould charge our ſelves with <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> towards God and Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Towards God,</hi> in our <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Vows,</hi> and <hi>Covenants.</hi> In our Oaths, when we ſwear in any Matter, we tell God that what we ſpeak is Truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to bear Witneſs to it. To falſifie in an <hi>Oath</hi> is one of the moſt ſolemn affronts that we can put upon the God of Truth.</p>
            <p>And ſo in our <hi>Vows,</hi> which are a ſolemn Promiſe to God, of ſuch things in which we have no precedent Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lying upon us. He that regardeth truth will neither be raſh in making a Vow, nor careleſs to perform it. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.4. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow to God, defer not to pay it, for he hath no pleaſure in Fools.</hi> Not to perform what we have vowed, is an Argument of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; either of raſhneſs in the making of it, or of inconſtancy in not keeping it.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe in all our <hi>Covenants</hi> with God, to ſerve him and obey him, and
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:35252:194"/>
keep his Commandments, we ſhould ſtrictly charge our ſelves with perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe. There is a Natural Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon us to theſe Things from the very Law of our Creation, tho' we ſhould never ſolemnly make any ſuch Promiſe, nor enter into any ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, becauſe it is a <hi>tacit</hi> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Beings; but the taking of this <hi>Covenant</hi> ſolemnly upon us in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> ſtrengthens the Obligation, and makes our unfaithfulneſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sin. All our hopes of Happineſs are founded in the Faithfulneſs of God; and if thou be falſe to him, how canſt thou expect he ſhould be faithful to thee? 'Tis true indeed, that <hi>he abides faithful, he cannot deny himſelf</hi>; but if thou haſt any ingenuity in thee, this ſhould be an Argument to thee to be faithful to him; I am ſure this can be no Encouragement to thee to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful; for if thou breakeſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant thou haſt entred into, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legcteſt the Conditions upon which God hath ſuſpended the performance of his Promiſe, thou diſchargeſt the Obligation on his part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Towards Men</hi>; we ſhould charge our ſelves with <hi>Truth</hi> in all our <hi>Words,</hi>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:35252:195"/>
and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> in all our <hi>Promiſes.</hi> It becomes us who worſhip <hi>the God of truth,</hi> to ſpeak truth; to uſe plainneſs and ſincerity in all our Words, to abhor Falſehood and Diſſimulation, and thoſe more refined ways of lying by equivocation of Words, and ſecret reſervations of our Minds on purpoſe to deceive. Thoſe that plead for theſe, 'tis a ſign they do not underſtand the Nature of God, and of Religion, which is to conform our ſelves to the Divine Perfections.

none of all God's Attributes, which Divines have ſpoken more ſparingly of than this.</p>
            <p>The general Notion of <hi>Holineſs</hi> is, that it is <hi>a ſeparation from a common and ordinary, to a peculiar and excellent uſe.</hi> And this Notion of <hi>Holineſs</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable either to <hi>Things</hi> or <hi>Perſons.</hi> To <hi>Things</hi>; thus the Veſſels of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the Veſtments of the Prieſts were ſaid to be <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe they were ſeparated from common Uſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the peculiar and excellent uſe of the ſervice of God. <hi>Holineſs</hi> o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:35252:197"/>
where <hi>Holineſs</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>all filthineſs.</hi> Sometimes by the negation of Sin and Defilement: So we find <hi>holy and without blame</hi> put together, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Holy and without blemiſh,</hi> Eph. 5.27. <hi>Holy, harmleſs, and undefiled,</hi> Heb. 7.26. 'Tis true indeed, this <hi>Negative</hi> Notion doth imply ſomething that is <hi>Poſitive,</hi> it doth not only ſignifie the abſence of Sin, but a contrariety to it; we cannot conceive the abſence of Sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the preſence of Grace; as take away crookedneſs from a Thing, and it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately becomes ſtraight. When e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we are made <hi>Holy,</hi> every Luſt and Corruption in us is ſupplanted by the contrary Grace.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>habitual Holineſs</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which conſiſts in <hi>a ſeparation from Sin,</hi> is <hi>a conformity to the Holineſs of God</hi>; and by this we may come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what <hi>Holineſs</hi> in God is; and it ſignifies <hi>the peculiar eminency of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, whereby it is ſeparated and removed at an infinite diſtance from moral Imperfection, and that which we call Sin</hi>; that is, there is no ſuch thing as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or Envy, or Hatred, or Revenge, or Impatience, or Cruelty, or Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or Injuſtice, or Falſe-hood, or
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:35252:198"/>
Unfaithfulneſs in God; or if there be any other Thing that ſignifies Sin, and Vice, and moral Imperfection, <hi>Holineſs</hi> ſignifies that the Divine Nature is at an infinite diſtance from all theſe, and poſſeſt of the contrary Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Therefore all thoſe Texts that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Moral Imperfection from God, and declare the repugnancy of it to the Divine Nature, do ſet forth the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil.</hi> Job 8.3. <hi>Doth God pervert Judgment, or doth the Almighty pervert Juſtice?</hi> Job. 34.10, 12. <hi>Far be it from God that he ſhould do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and from the Almighty, that he ſhould commit iniquity.

                  </gap>, the holy mercies of David,</hi> which will not fail.</p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God is not a <hi>particular,</hi> but an <hi>univerſal</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and runs through all the <hi>moral</hi> Perfections of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 'tis the Beauty of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Perfection of all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perfections.

and Soveraignty Tyranny; and Goodneſs, Malice and Envy; and Juſtice, Cruelty; and Mercy, Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Pity; and Truth, Falſe-hood: And therefore the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>this,</hi> as God's higheſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Perfection. God is ſaid to be <hi>glorious in Holineſs.</hi> Ex. 15.11. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is call'd <hi>God's throne.</hi> Pſal. 47.8. <hi>He ſitteth upon the throne of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> This is that which makes Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15.

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the Light of Nature. The Philoſophers in all their Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God agree in this, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſounds like Vice and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is to be ſeparated from the Divine Nature; which is, to acknowledge his <hi>Holineſs.

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From Scripture. There is no Title more frequently given to God in Scripture, and ſo often ingeminated, as this of his <hi>Holineſs.</hi> He is called <hi>Holineſs</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15. Where <hi>Heaven</hi> is call'd <hi>the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Holineſs,</hi> that is, <hi>of God.</hi> His <hi>Name</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Holy,</hi> Luke 1.49. <hi>And holy is his name.</hi> He is called <hi>the holy one,</hi> Iſa. 40.25. <hi>The holy one of Iſrael.</hi> Iſa. 41.20. <hi>The holy one of Jacob.</hi> 49.23. He is ſaid to be <hi>holy in all his Works and Promiſes.</hi> Pſal. 105.42. <hi>In all his ways and works,</hi> Pſal. 145.17. This Title is given to each of the three Perſons in the Bleſſed Trinity. To God the Father in innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Places: To God the Son, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>To anoint the moſt holy.</hi> The Devil cannot deny him this Title, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.34. <hi>I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God:</hi> And the Spirit of God hath this Title conſtantly given it, <hi>the holy Ghoſt,</hi> or <hi>the holy Spirit,</hi> or <hi>the Spirit of Holineſs.</hi> The Scripture attributes this Perfection in a peculiar manner to God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. <hi>There is none holy as the Lord.</hi> Rev. 15.4. <hi>For thou only art
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:35252:200"/>
holy.</hi> Holineſs is a communicable Perfection; but no Creature can partake of it in ſuch a manner and degree as the Divine Nature poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth it. God is eternally Holy, the Fountain of Holineſs: the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are derivatively and by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation Holy. God is eminently and tranſcendently ſo: the Creatures in a finite Degree. God is immutably ſo, 'tis impoſſible it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: but no Creature is out of an abſolute poſſibility of Sin. In this ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 4.18. That <hi>he putteth no truſt in his Saints, and his Angels he chargeth with folly,</hi> And Chap. 15.15. <hi>He putteth no truſt in his Saints, and the Heavens are not pure in his ſight.</hi> From all which I ſhall draw theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If <hi>Holineſs</hi> be a Perfection of the Divine Nature, and a Property of God, if in the Notion of God, there be included an everlaſting ſeparation and diſtance from Moral Imperfection, an eternal repugnance to Sin and Iniquity; from hence we may infer, that there is an <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal good and evil</hi> in Things, and the Reaſons and Reſpects of <hi>moral
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:35252:201"/>
good and evil</hi> do not depend upon any mutable, and inconſtant, and arbitrary Principle, but are fixt and immutable, eternal and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable. Therefore they do not ſeem to me to ſpeak ſo ſafely, who make the Divine <hi>Will,</hi> preciſely and abſtractedly conſider'd, the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Moral good and evil,</hi> as if there were nothing good or evil <hi>in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> antecedently to the <hi>Will</hi> of God, but that all things are therefore good or evil, becauſe God <hi>Wills</hi> them to be ſo; for if this were ſo, Goodneſs, and Righteouſneſs, and Truth, and Faithfulneſs would not be eſſential, and neceſſary, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Properties of the Divine Nature, but accidental, and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and uncertain, and mutable; which is to ſuppoſe that God, if he pleaſed, might be otherwiſe than good, and juſt, and true. For if theſe depend meerly upon the <hi>Will</hi> of God, and be not <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Divine Nature, then the contrary of theſe, Malice, and Envy, and Unrighteouſneſs, and Falſe-hood do not imply any eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:35252:201"/>
repugnancy to the Divine Nature; which is plainly contrary to what the Scripture tells us, that <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil,</hi> that <hi>'tis impoſſible he ſhould lie,</hi> that he <hi>cannot be</hi> unrighteous.</p>
            <p>If any Man ſay that God hath now declared himſelf to be Juſt, and Good, and Faithful, and now he cannot be otherwiſe, becauſe <hi>he is a God of Truth, and he changeth not,</hi> this is to grant the thing; for this ſuppoſeth the <hi>veracity</hi> and <hi>immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of God to be <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Perfections of the Divine Nature; and why not <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> as well? I ſay it ſuppoſeth <hi>veracity</hi> and <hi>immutability</hi> to be <hi>eſſential</hi> Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not to depend upon the <hi>Will</hi> of God, that is, that God cannot <hi>Will</hi> to be otherwiſe than true and unchangeable; for if he could, what aſſurance can we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have, but that when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf to be good and juſt, he is or may be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But I need not inſiſt upon this, which ſeems to be ſo very clear, and to carry its own Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:35252:202"/>
with it. I will only uſe this Argument to prove it, and ſo leave it. No Being can <hi>Will</hi> its own <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>eſſential Perfections,</hi> that is, chuſe whether it will be thus or otherwiſe; for that were to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be before it is, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath a Being, to deliberate about its own Nature. Therefore if this be <hi>the Nature</hi> of God, (which I think no body will deny) to be <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to be what he is; then <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> do not depend up-the <hi>Will</hi> of God, but there are ſuch Things, ſuch Notions antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to any Act of the Divine Will. And this does no ways preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the <hi>Liberty</hi> of God; for this is the higheſt Perfection to be <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> Good, and Juſt, and True; and a Liberty or Poſſibility to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is impotency and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For Liberty no where ſpeaks Perfection, but were the Things and Actions about which 'tis converſant are indifferent; in all other things, 'tis the higheſt Perfection not to be free and indifferent, but immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:35252:202"/>
and fixt, and neceſſarily bound up by the eternal Laws of Goodneſs, and Juſtice, and Truth, ſo that it ſhall not be poſſible to ſwerve from them; and this is the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which we call his <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If <hi>Holineſs</hi> be the chief Excellency and Perfection of the Divine Nature, this ſhews us what account we are to make of Sin, and Wickedneſs, and Vice. We may judge of every Privation by the Habit, for they bear an exact Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one to another. <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> are oppoſed, as Habit and Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if <hi>Light</hi> be pleaſant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, then <hi>Darkneſs</hi> is diſmal and horrid. And ſo <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> are oppoſed; if <hi>Holineſs</hi> be the higheſt Perfection of any Nature, then <hi>Sin</hi> is the grand Imperfection and the loweſt Debaſement of any Being; becauſe it is the moſt oppoſite to <hi>that,</hi> and at the furtheſt diſtance from <hi>that</hi> which is the firſt Excellency and Perfection.</p>
            <p>This ſhould rectifie our Judgment and Eſteem of Things and Perſons.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:35252:203"/>
We admire and eſteem Riches, and Power, and Greatneſs; and we ſcorns and contemn Poverty, and Weakneſs, and Meanneſs; yea Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, if it be in the Company of theſe. We are apt to reverence and and value the Great, and the Rich, and the Mighty of this World, tho' they be Wicked; and <hi>to deſpiſe the poor Man's Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi>; but we make a falſe Judgment of Things and Perſons. There is nothing that can be a Foundation of reſpect, that ought to command our Reverence and eſteem, but real Worth and Excellency and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and according to the Degrees of this, we ought to beſtow our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and raiſe our Eſteem. What St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith of <hi>reſpect of Perſons,</hi> I may apply in this Caſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Are ye not then partial in your ſelves, and become judges of evil thoughts?</hi> We are extreamly <hi>partial,</hi> we make a falſe Judgment, and Reaſon ill concerning Things, when we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire gilded Vices, and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs exalted to high Places; I mean ungodly rich Men, and ungodly

great men; for wicked Men they are properly ungodly, unlike to God; and when we contemn poor, and mean, and afflicted Holineſs, and Piety. Were but our Eyes open, and our Judgment clear and unprejudic'd, we ſhould ſee a beauty and reſplendency in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: even when it is under the greateſt diſadvantage, when it is cloathed with Raggs, and ſits upon a Dunghill, it would ſhine through all theſe Miſts, and we ſhould ſee a Native Light and Beauty in it, throw the darkneſs of a poor and low Condition: And we ſhould ſee Wickedneſs to be a moſt vile and abject thing, when it appears in all its gallantry and bravery; we ſhould look upon the poor <hi>righteous</hi> Man, as <hi>more excellent than his Neighbour</hi>; and the prophane Gallant, as the <hi>off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of the Earth.</hi> We ſhould value a Man that <hi>does juſtice, and loves mercy, and ſpeaks the Truth to his Neighbour</hi>; we ſhould eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one more upon the Account of any one of theſe ſimple Qualities, then we would another Man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of theſe, upon the account

of a Hundred Titles of Honour, and Ten Thouſand Acres of Land. A Wicked and Unholy Man, he is <hi>a vile Perſon,</hi> who deſerves <hi>to be contemned</hi>; and a <hi>holy</hi> man he is <hi>the right honourable.</hi> Pſal. 15.4. <hi>In whoſe Eyes a vile Perſon is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</hi> The <hi>vile perſon</hi> is oppoſed to him that <hi>fears the Lord.</hi> He that is bold to affront God, and ſin againſt him, is the <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>ignoble</hi> Perſon.

I do not ſpeak this to bring down the value of any that are advanced in this World, or to leſſen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which is due to them; I would have nothing undervalued, but Wickedneſs and Vice; and I would have thoſe who have ſtore of worldly Advantages to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, to add <hi>Religion</hi> to their <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> to their <hi>Honour,</hi> that they may be current for their <hi>intrinſick</hi> value, rather than for the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Picture</hi> of worth which the World hath ſtampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>

hath ſuch a repugnancy in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſin, then this is matter of terror to wicked Men. The <hi>Holy</hi> God cannot but hate ſin, and be an Enemy to wickedneſs; and the hatred of God is terrible. We dread the hatred of a great Man, becauſe where hatred is back'd with power, the Effects of it are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. But the Hatred of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and Eternal God, is much more dreadful, becauſe the Effects of it are greater, and more laſting, than of the hatred of a weak mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man. We know the utmoſt they can do, <hi>they can but kill the body; after that, they have no more that they can do</hi>; they cannot hurt our Souls; they cannot follow us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave, and purſue us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another World: But the Effects of God's Hatred and Diſpleaſure are mighty and laſting, they extend themſelves to all Eternity; for who knoweth the Power of his Anger?

God is far from being of an indifferent negative Temper to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſin and wickedneſs; therefore the Pſalmiſt adds, <hi>thou hateſt all the workers of iniquity</hi>; and then in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> to ſhew what is the effect of God's Hatred, <hi>thou ſhalt deſtroy them that ſpeak leaſing.</hi> Therefore Sinner, fear and tremble at the thoughts of God's <hi>Holineſs.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. Imitate the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God; this is the Inference here in the Text, <hi>be ye holy; for I am holy. Holineſs,</hi> in one word, contains all the imitable Perfections of God; and when it is ſaid, <hi>be ye holy,</hi> 'tis as much as if

And our imitation of God is expreſt by our <hi>putting on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.24. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then this is the chief Excellency and Perfection of God, and the ſum of all the Perfections which we are to imitate, and wherein we are to endeavour to be like God, let us conform our ſelves to the <hi>holy</hi> God; endeavour to be <hi>habitually holy,</hi> which is our conformity to the <hi>Nature</hi> of God; and <hi>actually holy,</hi> which is our conformity to the <hi>Will</hi> of God. I will not enlarge upon this, becauſe I have preſt the imitation of theſe particular Perfections, Goodneſs, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Juſtice, Truth, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs upon other Texts. I ſhall only mention <hi>two</hi> Arguments, to excite and quicken our Deſires and Endeavour after <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:35252:207"/>1. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is an imitation of the <hi>higheſt</hi> Excellency and Perfection. <hi>Holineſs,</hi> I told you, ſignifies a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Sin and Vice, and all moral Imperfection, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth comprehend and take in all the moral Perfections of the Divine Nature, the Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Patience, and Juſtice, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, and Faithfulneſs of God; now theſe are the very <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the Divine Nature. The firſt thing that we attribute to God, next to his <hi>Being,</hi> is his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and thoſe other <hi>Attributes</hi> which have a neceſſary connexion with it; for his <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the <hi>Glory</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from his <hi>united Perfections,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially from his Goodneſs, and thoſe Perfections which are akin to it. Separate from God theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which Holineſs includes in it, and what would be left but an <hi>Omnipotent Evil,</hi> an Eternal Being infinitely Knowing, and infinitely able to do miſchief? which is as plain and notorious a Contradiction, and as impoſſible a thing as can be-imagin'd;
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:35252:207"/>
ſo that if we have any ſparks of ambition in us, we cannot but aſpire after <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which is ſo great an Excellency and Perfection of God himſelf. There is a vulgar prejudice againſt <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as if it were a poor mean thing, and below a great and generous Spirit; whereas <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the only true greatneſs of Mind, the moſt genuine Nobility, and the higheſt gallantry of Spirit; and however it be deſpiſed by Men, it is of a Heavenly Extraction, and Divine Original. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the firſt part of the Character of <hi>the wiſdom that is from above.</hi> Jam. 3.17. <hi>The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, full of mercy, and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is an <hi>eſſential and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ingredient of Happineſs.

of envy, or malice, or hatred, or revenge, or impatience, or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, or injuſtice, or unfaithfulneſs, it would be liable to vexation and diſcontent, than which nothing can be a greater diſturbance of <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs:</hi> ſo that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is neceſſary to our Felicity and Contentment; not only to the <hi>happineſs</hi> of the next life, but to our preſent Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. If reaſonable Creatures could be happy, as brute Beaſts are in their degree, by enjoying their depraved Appetites, and following the Dictates of Senſe and Fancy, God would not have bound us up to a <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> but have left us, as he hath done unreaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſatisfie our Luſts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, without check and control: but Angels and Men, which are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, have the Notions of Good and Evil, of Right and Wrong, of Comlineſs and Filthineſs, ſo woven and twiſted into their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Natures, that they can never be wholly defaced, without the ruine of their Beings; and therefore it is impoſſible that ſuch Creatures ſhould
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:35252:209"/>
be happy otherwiſe, than by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with theſe Notions, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural Dictates and Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of their Minds; which if they neglect, and go againſt, they will naturally feel remorſe and Torment in their own Spirits; their Minds will be uneaſie and unquiet, and they will be inwardly grieved and diſpleaſed with themſelves for what they have done. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. That even the moſt degenerate Heathens had <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> which did <hi>accuſe or excuſe them,</hi> according as they obeyed, or did contrary to the dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light. God therefore, who <hi>knows our frame,</hi> hath ſo adapted his <hi>Law</hi> to us, which is <hi>the rule of holineſs,</hi> that if we live up to it, we ſhall avoid the unſpeakable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a guilty Conſcience; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if we do contrary to it, we ſhall always be at diſcord with our ſelves, and in a perpetual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet of Mind; for nothing can do contrary to <hi>the Law of its Being,</hi> that is, <hi>to its own Nature,</hi> without
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:35252:210"/>
diſpleaſure and reluctancy, the conſequence of which, in <hi>Moral</hi> Actions, is <hi>Guilt,</hi> which is nothing elſe, but the Trouble and Diſquiet which ariſeth in one's Mind, from conſciouſneſs of having done ſome thing that contradicts the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Principle of his Being, that is ſomething which did not become him, and which, being what he is, that is <hi>a reaſonable Creature,</hi> he ought not to do.</p>
            <p>So that in all <hi>reaſonable</hi> Creatures there is a certain kind of <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> that is <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and that is <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; which as it is the <hi>Perfection,</hi> ſo it is the great <hi>Felicity</hi> of the Divine Nature: And on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is one chief part of the Miſery of thoſe wicked and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Spirits the Devils, and of unholy Men, that they are of a temper contrary to God, they are Envious, and Malicious, and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, of ſuch a temper as is naturally a Torment and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to it ſelf; and here the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:35252:210"/>
foundation of Hell is laid in the evil diſpoſition of our Spirits, and till <hi>that</hi> be cured, which can only be done by <hi>Holineſs,</hi> 'tis as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a wicked Man to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and contented in himſelf, as it is for a Sick Man to be at eaſe; and the external preſence of God, and a local Heaven would ſignifie no more to make a wicked Man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and contented, than heaps of Gold, and Conſorts of Muſick, and a well ſpread Table, and a rich Bed, would contribute to a Man's eaſe in the paroxyſms of a Feaver, or in a violent fit of the Stone. If a ſenſual, or covetous, or ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man were in Heaven, he would be like <hi>the rich Man in Hell,</hi> he would be <hi>tormented</hi> with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Thirſt,</hi> and burnt up in the Flames of his own ardent Deſires, and would not meet with the leaſt <hi>drop</hi> of ſuitable Pleaſure and Delight, to <hi>quench</hi> and allay the Heat; the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch a Man hath <hi>that</hi> within him which torments him, and he cannot be at eaſe,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:35252:211"/>
till <hi>that</hi> be removed. <hi>Sin</hi> is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and unnatural and uneaſie State of our Soul, every wicked Man's Spirit is out of order, and till the Man be put into a right Frame by <hi>Holineſs,</hi> he will be perpetually diſquieted, and can have no reſt within himſelf. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet fitly deſcribes the condition of ſuch a Perſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20, 21. <hi>But the wicked are like the troubled ſea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt forth mire and dirt; there is no peace ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> So long as a Man is unholy, ſo long as filthineſs and corruption abound in his Heart, they will be reſtleſty working, like Wine which is in a perpetual motion and agitation, till it have purged it ſelf of its Dregs and Foulneſs. Nothing is more turbulent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet than the Spirit of a wicked Man; it is like <hi>the Sea,</hi> when it roars and rages through the ſtrengh of contrary Winds; it is the ſcene of furious Luſts and wild Paſſions, which as they are contrary to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, ſo they maintain perpetual
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:35252:211"/>
conteſts and fewds among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>All Sin ſeparates us from God, who is the Foundation of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Our limited Nature, and the narrowneſs of our Beings, will not permit us to be happy in our ſelves; it is peculiar to God to be his own Happineſs; but Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is finite, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſelf-ſufficient, is carried forth by an innate deſire, of Happineſs, to ſeek his Felicity in God. So that there is in the nature of man a Spring of reſtleſs Motion, which with great impatience forceth him out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and toſſes him to and fro, till he comes to reſt in ſomething that is ſelf-ſufficient. Our Souls, when they are ſeparated from God, like <hi>the unclean Spirit</hi> in the Goſpel, when it was <hi>caſt out,</hi> they <hi>wander up and down in dry and deſart places, ſeeking reſt, but finding none.</hi> Were the whole World calm about a Man, and did it not make the leaſt attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, were he free from the fears of Divine Vengeance; yet he could
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:35252:212"/>
not be ſatisfied with himſelf, there is ſomething within him that would not let him be at reſt, but would tear him from his own Foundation and Conſiſtency; ſo that when we are once broken off from God, the ſenſe of inward want doth ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and force us to ſeek our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment elſe-where. So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which re-unites us to God, and reſtores our Souls to their primitive and original ſtate, can make us <hi>happy,</hi> and give peace and reſt to our Souls. And this is the conſtant voice and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Scripture, and the tenour of the Bible. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God, that thou mayeſt be at Peace.</hi> Job 22.21. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart,</hi> Pſal. 97.11. <hi>The work of righteouſneſs is peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance for ever,</hi> Iſa. 32.17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:35252:212"/>Seeing then <hi>Holineſs</hi> is ſo <hi>high a Perfection,</hi> and ſo <hi>great a Happineſs,</hi> let theſe Arguments prevail with us, to aſpire after this temper, that <hi>as he who hath called us is holy, ſo we may be holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, becauſe it is written, be ye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for I am holy.</hi>

            <p>To inſtruct the Ignorant, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe that are in Error; <hi>to turn the diſobedient to the wiſdom of the juſt,</hi> and reclaim thoſe that are engaged in any evil Courſe, by good Counſel, and ſeaſonable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, and by prudent and kind Reproof; to reſolve and ſatisfie the doubting Mind; to confirm the weak; to heal the broken-hearted, and to comfort the melancholy and troubled Spirits. Theſe are the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:35252:215"/>
nobleſt Ways of Charity, becauſe they are converſant about the Souls of Men, and tend to procure and promote their eternal Felicity.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>to feed the hungry, to cloath the naked, releaſe the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; to redeem the Captives, and to vindicate thoſe who are injur'd and oppreſs'd in their Perſons, or Eſtates, or Reputation; to repair thoſe who are ruin'd in their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; and, in a word, to relieve and comfort thoſe who are in any kind of Calamity or Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>All theſe are but the ſeveral Branches and Inſtances of this great Duty here in the Text, of <hi>doing good</hi>; tho' it hath, in this place, a more particular reſpect to the Charitable ſupply of thoſe, who are in Want and Neceſſity; and therefore with a more particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that, I ſhall Diſcourſe of it at this time. You ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Duty. We will in the</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:35252:215"/>2. Place, briefly ſay ſomething of the Ecellency of it, which will appear, if we conſider, That it is the imitation of the higheſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Perfection. To do Good, is to be like God, who <hi>is Good, and doth good</hi>; and it is to be like to him, in that which he eſteems his greateſt Glory. It is to be like the Son of God, who, when he was pleaſed to take our Nature upon him, and live here below, and to dwell amongſt us, <hi>went about doing good.</hi> And it is to be like the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels, the higheſt Rank and Order of God's Creatures; whoſe great Employment it is to be <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Spirits, for the good of Men.</hi> So that for a Man to be kind, and helpful, and beneficial to others, is to be a good Angel, and a Saviour, and a kind of God too.</p>
            <p>It is an Argument of a great, and noble, and generous Mind, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our Thoughts and Cares to the concernments of others, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our intereſt, and power, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:35252:216"/>
endeavours for their benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: Whereas a low, and mean, and narrow Spirit, is contracted and ſhrivel'd up within it ſelf, and cares only for its own things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the good and happineſs of others.</p>
            <p>It is the moſt noble work in the World, becauſe that inclination of Mind, which prompts us to do good, is the very temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Happineſs. Solomon,</hi> after all his Experience of worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſure, at laſt pitched upon this, as the great felicity of humane Life, and the only good Uſe that is to be made of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous and plentiful Fortune. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>I know</hi> (ſays he, ſpeaking of Riches) <hi>that there is no good in them, but for a Man to rejoice and do good in his life.</hi> And certainly the beſt way to take joy in an Eſtate, is to do good with it; and a great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er and wiſer than <hi>Solomon</hi> has ſaid it, even he <hi>who</hi> is <hi>the Power and Wiſdom of God</hi> has ſaid it,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:35252:216"/>
that <hi>it is a more bleſſed thing to give than to receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider farther, That this is one of the great and ſubſtantial parts of Religion, and next to the love and honour, which we pay to Almighty God, the moſt acceptable Service that we can do to him; it is one Table of the Law, and next the <hi>Firſt and great Commandment,</hi> of <hi>loving the Lord our God,</hi> and very like to it. <hi>And the ſecond is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it,</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf</hi>; like to it, in the excellency of it; and equal to it, in the neceſſary obligation of it. For <hi>this Commandment</hi> (ſays St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 21). <hi>we have from him, that he who loveth God, love his Brother alſo.</hi> The Firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment indeed excels in the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Object, becauſe it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins the Love of God; but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſeems to have the advantage in the reality of its Effects: for the Love of God conſiſts in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and honour of him; but our <hi>righteouſneſs and goodneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:35252:217"/>
not to him</hi>; we can do him no real Benefit and Advantage: But our love to Men is really Uſeful and Beneficial to them; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, God is contented in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that the external Honour and Worſhip which he requires of us by his poſitive Commands, ſhould give way to that Natural Duty of Love and Mercy which we owe to one another. <hi>I will have mercy</hi> (ſays God in the Prophet <hi>Amos) and not ſacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſhew how great a value God puts upon this Duty, he hath made it the very Teſtimony of our love to himſelf; and for want of it, hath declared that he will reject all our other Profeſſions and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of love to him, as falſe and inſincere. <hi>Who ſo hath this worlds good,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 3.17.) <hi>and ſeeth his Brother have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> And again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>If any man ſay, I love God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his Brother, he is a lyar; for he
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:35252:217"/>
that loveth not his Brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God, whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee the Duty here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, both in the Extent and in the Excellency of it; <hi>let us do good.</hi> I proceed to conſider, in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Place, the Extent of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in reſpect of its Object, which is all Mankind, but more eſpecially Chriſtians, thoſe that are of the ſame Faith and Religion. <hi>Let us do good unto all men, eſpecially unto thoſe that are of the houſhold of Faith.</hi> So that the Object, about which this Duty is converſant, is very large, and takes in all Mankind; <hi>let us do good unto all men.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Love and Kindneſs to their own Kindred and Nation; and becauſe they were prohibited familiarity with Idolatrous Nations, and were enjoined to maintain a perpetual Enmity with <hi>Amalek,</hi> and the ſeven Nations of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whom God had caſt out before them, and devoted to Ruin; they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:35252:218"/>
themſelves as perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd from all Obligation of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the reſt of Mankind: And yet it is certain, that they were expreſly enjoin'd by their Law, to be kind to Strangers, becauſe they themſelves had been Strangers in the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath reſtored this Law of Love and Charity to its Natural and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal extent; and hath declared every one that is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with our ſelves to be our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and our <hi>Brother</hi>; and that he is to be treated by us accordingly, when ever he ſtands in need of our kindneſs and help; and to ſhew that none are out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of our Charity, he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded us to extend it to thoſe, who of all others can leaſt pretend to it, even our <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Perſecutors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if the Queſtion be about the extent of our Charity in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, theſe <hi>two</hi> things are plainly enjoined by the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:35252:218"/>1. Negatively, That we ſhould not hate or bear ill-will to any man, or do him any harm or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. <hi>Love worketh no Evil to his Neighbour,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. And this negative Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty every Man may exerciſe towards all Men, without Exception, and that equally; becauſe it does not ſignifie any poſitive Act, but only that we abſtain from Enmity and Hatred, from Injury and Revenge, which it is in every Man's power, by the Grace of God, and the due care and government of himſelf, to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Poſitively, The Law of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity requires, that we ſhould bear an univerſal good-will to all Men, and wiſh every Man's happineſs, and pray for it, as ſincerely as we wiſh and pray for our own; and if we be ſincere in our Wiſhes, and Prayers for the good of others, we ſhall be ſo in our Endeavours to procure and promote it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:35252:219"/>But the great difficulty is, as to the exerciſe of our Charity, and the real Expreſſions and Effects of it, in doing good to others; which is the Duty here meant in the Text, and (as I told you before) does more particularly relate to the Relief of thoſe who are in Want and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. And the reaſon of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is, becauſe no Man can do good to all in this kind, if he would; it not being poſſible for any Man to come to the knowledge of every man's Neceſſity and Diſtreſs; and if he could, no man's Ability can poſſibly reach to the ſupply and the relief of all men's Wants. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this limitation the Text gives to this Duty; <hi>as we have opportunity</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>let us do good unto all men</hi>; which either ſignifies, as occaſion is offered, or as we have Ability of doing, or both; as I ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>
            <p>So that it being impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe this Charity to all Men that ſtand in need of it, 'tis neceſſary
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:35252:219"/>
to make a difference, and to uſe Prudence and Diſcretion in the Choice of the moſt fit and proper Objects. We do not know the Wants of all men, and therefore the bounds of our Knowledge do of neceſſity li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our Charity within a certain compaſs; and of thoſe whom we do know, we can relieve but a ſmall part, for want of Ability; from whence it follows, that tho' a man were never ſo Charitably diſpoſed, yet he muſt of neceſſity ſet ſome Rules to himſelf, for the management of his Charity to the beſt advantage. What thoſe Rules are, cannot mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely and nicely be determined; when all is done, much muſt be left to every man's prudence and diſcretion, upon a full view and conſideration of the Caſe before him, and all the Circumſtances of it; but yet ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules may be given, as may ſerve for the direction of our Practice in moſt Caſes; and for the reſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man's prudence, as well as it can, muſt determine the matter. And the Rules which I ſhall give, ſhall be theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:35252:220"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Caſes of Extremity ought to take the firſt place, and do for that time challenge precedence of all other Conſiderations. If a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be in great and preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and his Neceſſity ſo urgent, that if he be not immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, he muſt periſh; this is ſo violent a Caſe, and calls ſo loud for preſent help, that there is no reſiſting of it, whatever the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be; though a perfect Stranger to us, though moſt unworthy, though the greateſt Enemy we have in the World, yet the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Diſtreſs does ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plead for him, as to ſilence all Conſiderations to the contrary; for after all, he is <hi>a man,</hi> and is of the ſame Nature with our ſelves, and the conſideration of <hi>Humanity</hi> ought, for that time, to prevail over all Objections againſt the Man, and to prefer him to our Charity, before the neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Friend, who is not in the like Extremity. In other caſes, we not only may, but ought to
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:35252:220"/>
relieve our Friends, and thoſe that have deſerved well of us in the firſt place: but if our Enemy be in Extremity, then that Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept takes place, <hi>if thine Enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him to drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the next place, I think, that the Obligation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the nearneſs of Relation, does challenge a Preference; for there is all the Reaſon in the World, if other things be equal, that we ſhould conſider and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the neceſſity of thoſe, who are of our Blood and Kindred, and Members of our Family, before the Neceſſities of Strangers, and thoſe who have no relation to us. There is a ſpecial Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us, and another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation beſide that of Charity, to have a particular Care and Regard for them. In this caſe not only Chriſtianity, but Nature tyes this Duty upon us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>If any man provide not for his own, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for his Domeſticks,</hi> for them
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:35252:221"/>
that are of his Family, <hi>he hath deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel</hi>; that is, he doth not only offend againſt the Law of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but againſt the very Dictates of Nature, which prevail even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Infidels. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath told us, that when our Parents ſtand in need of relief, it is more acceptable to God, to employ our Eſtates that way, than to devote them to him, and his immediate ſervice; and that it is a kind of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege</hi> to Conſecrate that to God, whereby our Parents may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, and provided for in their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Obligation of Kindneſs and Benefits, lays the next claim to our Charity. If they fall into Want, who have obliged us by their former Kindneſs and Charity, both Juſtice and Charity do chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge from us a particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Caſe; and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, if we our ſelves have been obliged to their Family, or to any that are nearly related to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:35252:221"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Thoſe <hi>who are of the houſhold of faith,</hi> and of the ſame Religion; and Members of the ſame Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and do partake of the ſame Holy Myſteries, the Body and Blood of our Bleſſed Saviour, the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bond of Love and Charity, Theſe fall under a very particular Conſideration in the exerciſe of our Charity. And of this the Apoſtle puts us in Mind, in the laſt words of my Text; <hi>let us do good unto all Men, eſpecially unto thoſe that are of the houſhold of faith.</hi> God hath a ſpecial Love and Regard for ſuch; and thoſe whom God Loves, ought to be very dear to us.</p>
            <p>And this, perhaps, was a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the firſt rank in thoſe times, when Chriſtians liv'd among Heathens, and were expoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Wants and Sufferings; but it ſignifies much leſs now, that Chriſtianity is the general Profeſſion of a Nation, and is too often made uſe of to very uncharitable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes;
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:35252:222"/>
to confine Men's Bounty and Benefits to their own Sect and Party, as if they, and none but they, were <hi>the houſhold of Faith</hi>; A Principle, which I know not whether it hath more of <hi>Judaiſme</hi> or of <hi>Popery</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> After theſe, the Merit of the Perſons, who are the Objects of our Charity, and all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances belonging to them, are to be valu'd and conſider'd, and we are accordingly to proportion our Charity, and the degrees of it. I ſhall inſtance in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, by which a prudent Man may judge of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who labour in an honeſt calling, but yet are oppreſt with their charge, or diſabled for a time by Sickneſs, or ſome other caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; theſe many a time need as much, and certainly deſerve much better than common Beggars; for theſe are uſeful members of the Common-Wealth; and we cannot
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:35252:222"/>
place our Charity better, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, who do what they can to ſupport themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thoſe likewiſe who are fallen from a rich and plentiful Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion, without any fault or Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of their own, meerly by the Providence of God, or ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Calamity; theſe are more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Objects of our Charity, and liberal Relief.</p>
            <p>And thoſe alſo, who have been Charitable, and have liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved others, when they were in Condition to do it; or the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or near Relations of thoſe, who were eminently Charitable and beneficial to Mankind, do deſerve a particular regard in our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Mankind being (as I may ſay) bound in Juſtice, and for the honour of God's Providence, to make good his Promiſe, to preſerve ſuch from extream neceſſity.</p>
            <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> thoſe, whoſe viſible Wants, and great Age and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:35252:223"/>
do plead for more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Pity, and do, at firſt ſight, convince every one that ſees them, that they do not Beg out of Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but of neceſſity, and becauſe they are not able to do any thing towards their own ſupport and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
            <p>There are innumerable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more, which it would be endleſs to reckon up; but theſe which I have mentioned are ſome of the chief, and by proportion to theſe, we may direct our ſelves in other Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Thoſe whom we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know to be true Objects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are to be conſider'd by us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who are ſtrangers to us, and whoſe Condition we do not know, yea, tho' in common Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we do not diſ-believe them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Reaſon and Prudence we are obliged to prefer thoſe, who are certainly known to us, ſince we find by experience, that there are many Cheats and counterfit Beggars, who can tell a fair Story, and carry
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:35252:223"/>
about Teſtimonials of their own making; and likewiſe becauſe we run the Hazard of miſplacing our Charity, when there are Objects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough beſides, where we are ſure we ſhall place it right; and Charity miſplaced, as it is in Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity no Charity in it's ſelf, ſo it is hardly any in us, when we ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſo imprudently as to paſs by a certain and real Object, and give it to thoſe of whom we are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that they are true Objects of Charity. In this blind way a Man <hi>may give all his Goods to the Poor,</hi> as he thinks, and yet do no real <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And therefore, unleſs we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to relieve <hi>every one that asks,</hi> we muſt of neceſſity make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and uſe our beſt Prudence in the choice of the moſt proper Objects of our Charity.</p>
            <p>And yet we ought not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Rule ſo ſtrictly, as to ſhut out all whom we do not know, without exception; becauſe their Caſe, if it be true, may ſometimes be much more pitiable, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extremity, than the caſe of many
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:35252:224"/>
whom we do know; and then it would be uncharitable to reject ſuch, and to harden our Hearts ſo far againſt them, as utterly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe them; becauſe it is no fault of theirs, that we do not know them; no, their Wants may be real, notwithſtanding that; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when their Extremity ſeems great, we ought not to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too rigorous a Proof and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, but ſhould accept of a fair probability.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Thoſe who ſuffer for the Cauſe of Religion, and are ſtript of all for the ſake of it, ought to have a great Precedence in our Charity to moſt other caſes. And this of late hath been, and ſtill is, the caſe of many among us, who have fled hither for Refuge, from the Tyranny and Cruelty of their Perſecutors, and have been by a moſt extraordinary Charity of the whole Nation, more than once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them, moſt ſeaſonably reliev'd; but eſpecially by the Bounty of this great City, whoſe
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:35252:224"/>
Liberality, upon theſe Occaſions, hath been beyond all Example, and even all belief. And I have often thought, that this very thing, next to the Mercy and Goodneſs of Almighty God, hath had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Influence upon our Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Deliverance from thoſe terrible Calamities, which were juſt ready to break in upon us; and were we not ſo ſtupidly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of this great Deliverance which God hath wrought for us, and ſo horribly unthankful to him, and to the happy Inſtruments of it, might ſtill be a means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Favour of God to us. And what cauſe have we to thank God, who hath allotted to us this <hi>more bleſſed,</hi> and more merciful part, <hi>to give,</hi> and not <hi>to receive</hi>; to be free from Perſecution our ſelves, that we might give Refuge and Relief to thoſe that are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted!</p>
            <p n="3">III. We muſt conſider the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Charity, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which our Tranſlation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:35252:225"/>
               <hi>as we have Opportunity</hi>; others, <hi>as we have Ability</hi>: So that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may refer, either to the Occaſions of our Charity, or to the Seaſon of it, or to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and Degree of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may refer to the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Charity, <hi>as we have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity let us do good,</hi> that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Occaſions of doing good ſhall preſent themſelves to us, ſo often as an Opportunity is offer'd. And this is an Argument of a very good and charitable Diſpoſition, gladly to lay hold of the occaſions of doing good; as it were to meet Opportunities when they are a coming towards us. This forwardneſs of Mind, in the work of Charity, the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.2. <hi>I know the forwardneſs of your minds, for which I boaſt of you to them of Macedonia:</hi> And this he requires of all Chriſtians, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. That they ſhould <hi>be ready to every good work</hi>; And 1 Tim. 6.18. That we be <hi>ready to diſtribute, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:35252:225"/>
to communicate.</hi> Some are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ready to decline theſe Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, and to get out of the way of them; and when they thruſt themſelves upon them, and they cannot avoid them, they do what they do <hi>grudgingly,</hi> and not <hi>with a willing mind.</hi>

And this Conſideration holds in all times in ſome degree, that our Lives are ſhort and uncertain, that it is but a little while that we can ſerve God in this kind, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while we are in this World, in this Vale of Miſery and Wants. In the next World there will be no occaſion, no Opportunity for it; we ſhall then have nothing to do, but to reap the Reward of
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:35252:226"/>
the good we have done in this Life, and to receive that bleſſed Sentence from the Mouth of the great Judge of the World, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, before the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Euge bone ſerve! Well done good and faithfull Servant! thou haſt been faithfull in a little, and I will make thee Ruler over much.</hi> God wil then declare his Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs to us, and open thoſe inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Treaſures of Glory and Happineſs, which all good Men ſhall partake of, in proportion to the good which they have done in this World. Or elſe,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (Which I take to be the moſt probable meaning of this Phraſe) It may refer to the Degree of this Duty in proportion to our Ability and Eſtate; as we have Ability, <hi>let us do good unto all Men.</hi> And this the Phraſe will bear, as Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men have obſerv'd; and it is very reaſonable to take in this
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:35252:226"/>
Senſe, at leaſt, as part of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, either expreſt or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd. For without this we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe Charity, tho' there were never ſo many Occaſions for it; and then this Precept will be of the ſame Importance with that of the Son of <hi>Sirach, Ecclus.</hi> 35.10. <hi>Give unto the moſt high accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he hath enriched thee</hi>; and with that Counſel, <hi>Tob.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Give Alms, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to thy Subſtance,</hi> and 8. v. <hi>If thou haſt abundance, give Alms according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> And this may be reaſonably expected from us; for where-ever his Providence gives a Man an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, it is but in Truſt for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Uſes and Purpoſes, among which Charity and Alms is the chief: And we muſt be accountable to him, whether we have diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it faithfully to the Ends, for which it was committed to us. It is an eaſie thing with him to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Mens Eſtates, and to give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man a Competency; but he does on purpoſe ſuffer things to be diſtributed ſo unequally, to try and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:35252:227"/>
exerciſe the Virtues of Men in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways; the Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Poor, the Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe in a middle Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Charity and Bounty of the Rich. And in truth, Wealth and Riches, that is, an Eſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what ſufficeth our real Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and Neceſſities, is in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe <hi>a Bleſſing,</hi> than as it is an Opportunity put into our Hands, by the Providence of God, of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more good; and if we do not faithfully employ it to this end, it is but a Temptation and a Snare; and <hi>the ruſt of our Silver and our Gold will be a witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us</hi>; and we do but <hi>heap up Treaſures together againſt the laſt Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what Proportion our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to bear to our Eſtates, I ſhall not undertake to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. The Circumſtances of Men have too much variety in them to admit of any certain Rule; ſome may do well, and others may do better; every Man, as God hath
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:35252:227"/>
put into his Heart, and according to his Belief of <hi>the recompence which ſhall be made at the reſurrection of the juſt.</hi> I ſhall only ſay in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that <hi>if there be firſt a</hi> free and <hi>willing Mind,</hi> that will make a Man charitable to his Power; For <hi>the liberal Man will deviſe libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things.</hi> And we cannot propoſe a better Pattern to our ſelves in this kind, than the King and Queen, who are, as they ought to be (but as it very ſeldom happens) the moſt bright and ſhining Examples of this greateſt of all Graces and Virtues, Charity and Compaſſion to the poor and perſecuted. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Thing conſiderable in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> Our unwearied Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in this work of doing good, <hi>let us not be weary in well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> After we have done ſome few Acts of Charity, yea tho' they ſhould be very conſiderable, we muſt not ſit down and ſay we have done enough. There will ſtill be new Objects, new Occaſions,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:35252:228"/>
new Opportunities for the exerciſe of our Charity, ſpringing up and preſenting themſelves to us. Let us never think, that we can do enough in the way of doing good. The beſt and the happieſt Beings are moſt conſtant and unweary'd in this work of doing good. The holy Angels of God are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually employed in <hi>miniſtring for</hi> the good of <hi>thoſe, who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation</hi>: And the Son of God, when he appear'd in our Nature, and <hi>dwelt among us,</hi> that he might be a perfect and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Example to us of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Virtue, <hi>he went about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good</hi> to the Bodies and to the Souls of Men. How diligent and unweary'd was he in this work! It was his Employment and his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, his <hi>Meat and Drink,</hi> the Joy and the Life of his Life. And God himſelf, tho' he is infinitely and perfectly good in himſelf, yet he ſtill continues <hi>to do good,</hi> and is never weary of this bleſſed work. It is the Nature, and the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Felicity of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:35252:228"/>
and how can we be weary of that work, which is an Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the higheſt Excellency and Perfection, and the very Eſſence of Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And laſtly, Here is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Encouragement to the chearful diſcharge of this Duty, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not; therefore as we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, let us do good unto all Men. In due ſeaſon we ſhall reap,</hi> that is, ſooner or later, in this World, or in the other, we ſhall receive the full reward of our well-doing.</p>
            <p>And now I have explain'd this Duty to you, as plainly and briefly as I could, the hardeſt part of my Task is yet behind, to perſwade Men to the practice of it; and to this purpoſe I ſhall only inſiſt upon the promiſe in the Text, <hi>be not weary in well-doing; for in due ſeaſon ye ſhall reap, if ye faint not.</hi> We ſhall reap the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſatisfaction of it in our own Minds, and all the other mighty Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of it in this World, and
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:35252:229"/>
the vaſt and unſpeakable Reward of it in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſhall reap the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Satisfaction of it in our own Minds; and there is no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſure that is comparable to the delight of Doing good. This <hi>Cato</hi> makes his boaſt of, as the great Comfort and Joy of his old Age, <hi>Conſcientia bene actae vitae, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torumque benefactorum recordatio ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundiſſima.</hi> The remembrance of a well ſpent Life, and of many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Kindneſſes done by us to others, is one of the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things in the World. Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pleaſures ſoon die and vaniſh; but that is not the worſt of them, they leave a Sting behind them, and when the Pleaſure is gone, nothing remains but Guilt, and Trouble, and Repentance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Reflection upon any good we have done, is a perpetual Spring of Peace and Pleaſure to us, and no Trouble and Bitterneſs enſues upon it; the Thoughts of it lye even and eaſy in our Minds, and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:35252:229"/>
ſo often as it comes to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, it miniſters freſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhall likewiſe reap other mighty Advantages by it in this World. It is the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive a laſting Bleſſing upon our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. What we give in Alms and Charity is conſecrated to God, and is one of the chiefeſt and moſt acceptable Sacrifices in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; ſo the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. <hi>To do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> It is like the firſt-Fruits under the Law, which being dedicated and offered up to God, did derive a Bleſſing upon their whole Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</p>
            <p>And it procures for us alſo the Bleſſings and Prayers of thoſe, to whom we extend our Charity; their Bleſſing, I ſay, upon us and ours, and all that we have; and <hi>is it a ſmall thing in our eye, to
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:35252:230"/>
have</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>the Bleſſing of them, who are ready to periſh, to come upon us? The fervent Prayer</hi> of the poor for us <hi>availeth much,</hi> for God hath a ſpecial <hi>regard to the Prayers of the deſtitute, and his Ear is open to their cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Few Men have Faith to believe it, but certainly Charity is a great ſecurity to us in the times of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and that not only from the ſpecial Promiſe and Providence of God, which is engaged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe from want, who are ready to relieve the Neceſſity of others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.25. <hi>The liberal Soul ſhall be made fat; and he that watereth ſhall be watered alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and Prov. 28.27. <hi>He that giveth to the poor ſhall not lack; he ſhall not be afraid in the evil time, and in the days of Dearth he ſhall be ſatisfiyed,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt: But beſides the Promiſe and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, our Charity and Alms are likewiſe a great ſecurity to us, from the Nature and Reaſon of
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:35252:230"/>
the thing it ſelf. Whoſoever is charitable to others, does wiſely beſpeak the Charity and Kindneſs of others for himſelf, againſt the day of neceſſity; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that makes a Man more, and ſurer Friends, than our Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; this will plead for us, and ſtand our Friend in our greateſt Troubles and Dangers; <hi>For a good Man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, for one that is ready to oblige others by great Kindneſſes and Benefits, <hi>one would even dare to die.</hi> It has ſometimes happened, that the Obligation which a man hath laid upon others by a chearful and ſeaſonable Charity, hath in time of Danger and Extremity done him more kindneſs, than all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate could do for him. <hi>Alms,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe Man, <hi>hath delivered from Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in times of publick Diſtreſs, and when we are beſet with cruel and powerful Enemies, who, <hi>if God were not on our ſide, would ſwallow as
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:35252:231"/>
up quick,</hi> the publick Charity o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a Nation does many times prove its beſt Safeguard and Shield. There is a moſt remarkable Paſſage to this purpoſe, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 29.11, 12, 13. <hi>Lay up thy Treaſure according to the commandment of the moſt high, and it ſhall bring thee more profit, than Gold; ſhut up thine alms in thy Store-houſe, and it ſhall deliver thee from all affliction, it ſhall fight for thee againſt thy enemies, more than a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shield and a ſtrong Spear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of this I doubt not, but we of this Nation, by the great Mercy and Goodneſs of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, have had happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in our late wonderful Deliverance, under the Conduct and Valour, of one of the beſt and braveſt of Princes, and to whom by too many among us, the moſt unworthy and unthankful Returns have been made, for the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried pains he hath undergone, and for the deſperate hazards he hath expos'd himſelf to for our ſakes,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:35252:231"/>
that ever were made to ſo Great and Generous a Benefactour; ſo great a Benefactour I ſay, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to theſe Nations, but to all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> in aſſerting and vindicating their Liberties againſt the inſolent Tyranny and Pride of one of the greateſt oppreſſours of Mankind, of whom I may ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> does of the Leviathan, <hi>Job</hi> 41.33, 34. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the earth is not his like, he behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all high things, and is the King of all the Children of Pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beyond all this, the Bleſſing of God does deſcend upon the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of thoſe, who are eminently Charitable, and great Benefactours to Mankind. This <hi>David</hi> obſerves in his time; <hi>I have been young</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and now am old; yet have I not ſeen the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging Bread</hi>; and what he means by <hi>the righteous Man,</hi> he explains in the next Words, <hi>he is ever merciful and lendeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:35252:232"/>I ſhall only add upon this Head, that the practice of this Virtue will be one of our beſt comforts at the hour of Death, and that we ſhall then look back upon all the good we have done in our life, with the greateſt contentment and joy imaginable. <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which he deſign'd for the perfect Idea of a good Prince, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſents him in the laſt minutes of his life, addreſſing himſelf to God to this purpoſe, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I have been a lover of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and now that I am leaving this World, I hope to find that mercy from thee, which I have ſhewed to others.</hi> Theſe Words that excellent heathen Hiſtorian thought fit to come from the mouth of ſo excellent a Prince, as he had deſcrib'd him, juſt as he was leaving the World; by which we may ſee, what the Light of Nature thought to be the beſt comfort of a dying Man. This brings me to the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:35252:232"/>
               <hi>Third,</hi> and laſt particular which I mentioned, the vaſt and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reward, which this grace and virtue of Charity will meet with in the other World. It will plead for us at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and procure for us a moſt glorious <hi>recompence at the reſurrection of the Juſt,</hi> and that proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the degrees of our Charity; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. <hi>He which ſoweth ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall reap ſparingly: and he which ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>; and from this Conſideration, the Apoſtle encourageth our Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in Well-doing, <hi>let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not</hi>; that is, we ſhall certainly meet with the reward of it, if not in this World, yet in the other.</p>
            <p>And now that I have declar'd this Duty to you, together with the mighty pleaſure, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and rewards of it, I crave leave to preſent you with ſome
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:35252:233"/>
of the beſt Occaſions, and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of the exerciſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it. And for your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement hereto, I ſhall read to you, the preſent State of the chief Hoſpitals belonging to this great City, and of the diſpoſal of their Charity for the laſt Year.</p>
            <p>And now I have laid before you theſe great Objects of your Charity, and the beſt Arguments I could think of to incline and ſtir up your Minds to the exerciſe of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Grace and Virtue; as there is no time left for it, I having, I am afraid already tir'd your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo I hope there is no need to preſs this Duty any farther up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, ſince you are ſo willing and forward of your ſelves, and ſo very ready to every good Work. This great City hath a double Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our due to it, of being both the greateſt Benefactours in this kind, and the moſt faithful Managers, and Diſpoſers of it; and I am now in a place moſt proper for the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:35252:233"/>
mention of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Foundation of that moſt Pious and Excellent Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> VI. Which I believe is one of the beſt inſtances of ſo large and ſo well manag'd Charity, this Day in the World.</p>
            <p>And now to Conclude all, if any of you know any better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, than <hi>to do good</hi>; any work that will give truer Pleaſure to our Minds; that hath greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promiſes made to it, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the life that now is, and that which is to come</hi>; that we ſhall reflect upon with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when we come to dye; and that through the mercies and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our Bleſſed Saviour, will ſtand us in more ſtead at the Day of Judgment; let us mind that work: but if we do not; let us apply our ſelves to this buſineſs of Charity, with all our might, and <hi>let us not be weary in well-doing, becauſe in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not.</hi>

               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:35252:234"/>
               <hi>Now the God of Peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work, to do his will through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with thee, O Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glory, thanksgiving and praiſe, both now and for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
