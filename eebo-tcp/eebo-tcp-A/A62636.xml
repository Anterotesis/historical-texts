         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion which our Saviour draws from tho≈øe Precepts which he had given his Di≈øciples of <hi>greater perfection,</hi> than any Laws that were extant in the world before. <hi>V.</hi> 44. <hi>I ≈øay unto you, love your Enemies, ble≈øs them that cur≈øe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for tho≈øe that de≈øpitefully u≈øe you, and per≈øecute you.</hi> And to per≈øwade them hereto, he propounds to them the Pattern of the <hi>Divine Perfection</hi>; telling them, that being thus affected towards their Enemies, they ≈øhould re≈øemble God, <hi>v.</hi> 45.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35252:9"/>
               <hi>That ye may be the Children of your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father; for he maketh the Sun to ri≈øe on the evil, and on the good, and ≈øendeth Rain on the ju≈øt, and on the unju≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then he tells us, that if we be not thus affected towards our Enemies, and tho≈øe that have been injurious to us, we are ≈øo far from being like God, that we are but ju≈øt level with the wor≈øt of Men, <hi>v.</hi> 46, 47. <hi>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even the Publicans the ≈øame? And if ye ≈øalute your Brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the Publicans ≈øo?</hi> And then concludes, that if we would attain that <hi>perfection</hi> which the Chri≈øtian Religion de≈øigns to advance Men to, we mu≈øt endeavour to be like God in the≈øe <hi>perfections</hi> of Goodne≈øs, and Mercy, and Patience; <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> In which words we have,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The ab≈øolute <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature ≈øuppo≈øed; <hi>as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is propounded as a Pattern to our imitation. <hi>Be ye therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In handling of the≈øe words, I ≈øhall do the≈øe <hi>four</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35252:9"/>I. Con≈øider how we are to conceive of the <hi>Divine Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I ≈øhall lay down ≈øome Rules whereby we may govern and rectifie our Opinions concerning the Attributes and <hi>Perfections</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. How far we are to imitate the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and particularly what tho≈øe Divine Qualities are, which our Saviour doth here more e≈øpecially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our imitation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I ≈øhall endeavour to clear the true meaning of this Precept, and to ≈øhew that the Duty here intended by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is not impo≈ø≈øible to us; and then conclude this Di≈øcour≈øe with ≈øome u≈øeful Inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ≈øhall con≈øider how we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the <hi>Divine Perfections.</hi> The≈øe two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a≈øcribing all imaginable and po≈ø≈øible <hi>Perfection</hi> to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By ≈øeparating and removing all manner of <hi>Imperfection</hi> from him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a≈øcribing all imaginable, and po≈ø≈øible <hi>Perfection</hi> to God; ab≈øolute and univer≈øal <hi>Perfection,</hi> not limited to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind, or to certain particulars; but whatever we can conceive, and imagin to be a <hi>Perfection,</hi> is to be a≈øcribed to him;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35252:10"/>
yea and beyond this, whatever po≈ø≈øible <hi>Perfection</hi> there is, or po≈ø≈øible degree of any <hi>Perfection,</hi> which our ≈øhort Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandings cannot conceive or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, is to be a≈øcribed to him. For we are not to confine the <hi>Perfection</hi> of God to our imagination, as <hi>if we could find out the Almighty to Perfection</hi>: But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to believe the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature to be boundle≈øs and unlimited, and infinitely to exceed our highe≈øt thoughts and apprehen≈øions.</p>
            <p>More particularly, all kinds and all degrees of <hi>Perfection</hi> are to be a≈øcribed to God, which either do not imply a plain Contradiction, or do not argue ≈øome <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,</hi> or are not evidently incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with ≈øome other and greater <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some things may ≈øeem to be <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which in truth are not; becau≈øe they are plainly impo≈ø≈øible, and involve a Contradiction; as that what has once been, ≈øhould by any Power be made not to have been; or that a thing, which by its Nature is limited and confin'd to one place, ≈øhould at the ≈øame time be in another. The≈øe things in Rea≈øon are impo≈ø≈øible, and therefore not to be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to fall under any Power how unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35252:10"/>
≈øoever. For if we once a≈øcribe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions to God, we de≈øtroy his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becau≈øe then to be, and not to be, Power, and no Power would be all one.</p>
            <p>And then there are ≈øome <hi>Perfections,</hi> which do argue and ≈øuppo≈øe Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in them; as Motion, the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and ≈øwiftne≈øs thereof in Creatures is a <hi>Perfection,</hi> but then it ≈øuppo≈øeth a finite and limited Nature: For a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs and immen≈øe Being, that is every where pre≈øent at once, hath no need to move from one place to another; and therefore though Motion be a <hi>Perfection</hi> in Creatures, there is no Rea≈øon to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe it to God, becau≈øe it ≈øuppo≈øeth a greater <hi>Imperfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are al≈øo ≈øome imaginable degrees of <hi>Perfection,</hi> which becau≈øe they are incon≈øi≈øtent with other <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> are not to be admitted in the Divine Nature. For in≈øtance, ≈øuch degrees of Goodne≈øs and Mercy may be imagined, as would quite exclude and ≈øhut out Ju≈øtice; and on the other hand ≈øuch a ≈øtrictne≈øs and a rigour of Ju≈øtice, as would leave no room at all for Patience and Mercy; and therefore ≈øuch degrees are not really to be e≈øteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Perfections.</hi> For this is a certain truth, that nothing is a Divine <hi>Perfection,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35252:11"/>
which evidently cla≈øheth with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nece≈ø≈øary and e≈ø≈øential <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature. We mu≈øt ≈øo con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, that they may accord and con≈øi≈øt together; and therefore it cannot be a <hi>Perfection</hi> of God to be ≈øo good and gracious, as to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Sin, and to overthrow the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his own Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Tis not Goodne≈øs, but Ea≈øine≈øs and Weakne≈øs, to be contented to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually injur'd and affronted. 'Tis not Patience, to be willing to be everla≈øting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trampled upon. So likewi≈øe on the other hand, 'tis not a <hi>Perfection</hi> to be ≈øo ≈øevere and rigorous, as to ≈ømite a Sinner in the in≈øtant that he offends, not to be able to refrain from Puni≈øhment, and to give time for Repentance.</p>
            <p>But whatever <hi>Perfection</hi> is conceivable or po≈ø≈øible, and argues no <hi>Imperfection,</hi> nor is repugnant to any other nece≈ø≈øary <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> is to be a≈øcribed to God; for this is the mo≈øt natural and ea≈øie conception that we can have of God, that he is the mo≈øt <hi>perfect</hi> Being. This natural Light doth fir≈øt ≈øugge≈øt and offer to the Minds of Men, and we cannot conceive of God as meer Power and Will without Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodne≈øs. Hence it is that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35252:11"/>
               <hi>Greeks</hi> call God very often, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, the be≈øt of Beings, and the Latin <hi>Optimus, Maximus, the be≈øt and the Greate≈øt, beati≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma &amp; perfecti≈ø≈øima natura, con≈øtans &amp; perfecta Ratio, the happie≈øt and mo≈øt perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, immutible and ab≈øolute Rea≈øon</hi>; and many other ≈øuch expre≈ø≈øions which we meet with in the Writings of the Heathen Philo≈øophers. I readily grant, that the fir≈øt and mo≈øt obvious thought which men have of God, is that of his Greatne≈øs and Maje≈øty; but this nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily involves or infers his Goodne≈øs; as <hi>Seneca</hi> excellently rea≈øons, <hi>Primus Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cultus e≈øt Deos credere, dein reddere illis maje≈øtatem ≈øuam, reddere bonitatem, ≈øine qu√¢ nulla Maje≈øtas,</hi>
               <q>The fir≈øt Wor≈øhip of the Gods is to believe their Being; next to a≈øcribe to them Greatne≈øs and Maje≈øty, to a≈øcribe to them Goodne≈øs, without which there can be no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And we ≈øhall find all along in <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tully,</hi> and the be≈øt and wi≈øe≈øt Writers among the Heathen, that they every where attribute the highe≈øt Excellencies and <hi>Perfections</hi> to the Divine Nature, and do ≈øteer and govern all their Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes of God by this Principle, that <hi>Perfection</hi> is to be a≈øcrbied to him: And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35252:12"/>
whenever any thing is ≈øaid of God, they examin whether it be a <hi>Perfection</hi> or not; if it be, they give it him as his due; if it be not, they lay it a≈øide, as a thing not fit to be ≈øpoken of him.</p>
            <p>And in the Scripture we do every where find <hi>Perfection</hi> a≈øcribed to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Works, and Laws of God, to every thing that belongs to him, or proceeds from him: <hi>Job</hi> 37.16. <hi>Do≈øt thou know the wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge?</hi> And again, <hi>Can≈øt thou by ≈øearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing find out God? Can'≈øt thou find out the Almighty to perfection? P≈ø.</hi> 18.30 <hi>As for God his way is perfect</hi> P≈ø. 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ≈øhall not need to con≈øider particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ≈øeveral <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine Nature, I ≈øhall only give you a brief Scheme and Draught of them. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Perfection</hi> can be imagined either in the manner of Being or Acting is to be a≈øcribed to God; therefore as to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we ≈øay that he is a Spirit, that is, that he is not meer Body or Matter, becau≈øe that would exclude ≈øeveral other <hi>Perfections</hi>; for meer Matter is incapable both of Knowledge and Liberty, being determined by nece≈ø≈øary Laws of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet without Knowledge and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35252:12"/>
Liberty, there can be no Wi≈ødom nor Goodne≈øs. We ≈øay of God, that he is of him≈øelf, and without Cau≈øe, and does not owe his Being to any other; and con≈øequently that he is nece≈ø≈øarily, and that he cannot but <hi>be,</hi> and cannot be otherwi≈øe than he is; for that which is of its ≈øelf did not chu≈øe whether it would be or not, nor whether it would be thus or otherwi≈øe; for to ≈øuppo≈øe any thing to deliberate or con≈øult about it's own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is to ≈øuppo≈øe it to be before it is.</p>
            <p>We mu≈øt ≈øay of God likewi≈øe that he is immen≈øe, and every where pre≈øent, becau≈øe to be limited is an <hi>Imperfection</hi>; and that he is eternal, that is, ever was, and ≈øhall be; for to cea≈øe to be, is a greater <hi>Imperfection</hi> than ≈øometime not to have been.</p>
            <p>And then we are to ≈øay of God, that he is the Cau≈øe of all other Beings, that they are made by him and depend upon him; that he knows all things, and can do all things in the mo≈øt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner, by a glance of his Mind, and by the meer beck and nod of his Will, without long ≈øtudy or deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without laborious pains and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and con≈øequently that nothing is exempted from his Knowledge, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35252:13"/>
Power, and Providence, and that he admini≈øters all things in a way of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Wi≈ødom, of Ju≈øtice and Truth; and therefore all things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to him, as their la≈øt end. All the≈øe <hi>Perfections,</hi> and all other that are po≈ø≈øible, we are to look upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature as fully and immutably po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øt of, and that in an higher and more excellent degree, than our finite Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandings are able to conceive or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we are to a≈øcribe all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, po≈ø≈øible <hi>Perfections</hi> to God, ≈øo we are to ≈øeparate and remove all manner of <hi>Imperfection</hi> from him. We mu≈øt not ob≈øcure or blemi≈øh the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the lea≈øt ≈øhadow or blot of <hi>Imperfection.</hi> If we once admit of this, to a≈øcribe any thing to God which argues <hi>Imperfection,</hi> we ≈øtrike at the foundation, and de≈øtroy one of the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt and mo≈øt e≈ø≈øential Notions, which Men have of God. And therefore we find the Scripture very careful to remove all kind of natural or moral <hi>Imperfection</hi> from God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. <hi>That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to ≈ølay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous ≈øhould be as the wicked,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35252:13"/>
that be far from thee; ≈øhall not the Judge of all the world do right?</hi> Deut. 32.4. <hi>A God of truth and without iniquity.</hi> Rom. 9.14. <hi>What ≈øhall we ≈øay then, is there unrighteou≈øne≈øs with God? God forbid,</hi> far be it from him.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that in Scripture Holine≈øs is ≈øo frequently a≈øcrib'd to God, which ≈øignifies the purity and freedom of the Divine Nature from that which we call Sin; and God is very ≈øolicitous to give us ≈øuch a notion of him≈øelf, as may remove Sin and unrighteou≈øne≈øs at the greate≈øt di≈øtance from him, becau≈øe that is the greate≈øt of <hi>Imperfections.</hi> Is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to countenance Sin? the Scripture acquits God of it. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Thou art not a God that hath plea≈øure in wickedne≈øs, neither ≈øhall evil dwell with Thee.</hi> Is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to go from ones word, or to change ones mind? this likewi≈øe is remov'd from God. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. <hi>The ≈øtrength of I≈ørael will not lie or repent, he is not a man, that he ≈øhould repent.</hi> Is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to want any thing, to be liable to any thing, to depend upon any thing without one's ≈øelf for their happine≈øs? this al≈øo is to be ≈øet far from him. <hi>Job</hi> 22.2, 3. <hi>Can a man be profitable to God? or is it a gain
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35252:14"/>
to him, that thou make≈øt thy way perfect? Job</hi> 35.6, 7. <hi>If thou ≈øinne≈øt, what do≈øt thou again≈øt him? or if thy tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions be multiplied, what do≈øt thou unto him? If thou art righteous, what give≈øt thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wickedne≈øs may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteou≈øne≈øs may profit the Son of man.</hi> Is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to tempt, or to be tempted to Sin? this is to be ≈øeparated from God, <hi>He cannot be tempted of evil, neither tempteth he any man,</hi> ≈øaith St. <hi>James. Chap.</hi> 1.17. And to mention no more, is it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> to be in any re≈øpect mutable? This is denyed of God, <hi>with him there is no variablene≈øs, or ≈øhadow of turning.</hi> Thus you ≈øee how we are to conceive of the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, by a≈øcribing all imaginable and po≈ø≈øible <hi>Perfection</hi> to him, and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ≈øhadow of <hi>Imperfection</hi> from him. I proceed in the</p>

and rectifie all our other Apprehen≈øions of God, and Rea≈øonings about him, by the≈øe; and the≈øe are his Power, Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Goodne≈øs, to which mo≈øt of the re≈øt may be reduced. Right Apprehen≈øions and a firm Belief of the≈øe will make it ea≈øily credible to us, that all things were made and are governed, by him; for his Goodne≈øs will di≈øpo≈øe and incline him to communicate Being to other things, and to take care of them when they are made. An infinite Power and Wi≈ødom render him able to do all this without any labour or difficulty, and without any di≈øturbance of his ea≈øe or happine≈øs, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> would ≈øeem vainly to fear; who in truth did not believe a God, but pretended only to deny his Providence, and that he either made or govern'd the world; becau≈øe he was loth to lay ≈øo much trouble upon him. Vain man! as if tho≈øe things which are impo≈ø≈øible and difficult to our Weakne≈øs and Folly, might not be infinitely ea≈øie to infinite Power and Wi≈ødom.</p>
            <p>Particularly the Goodne≈øs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice of God are not ≈øo difficult to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, as the Di≈øputes and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øies about them have rendred them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35252:15"/>
to many. When we con≈øider infinite Knowledge and Power, we may ea≈øily lo≈øe our ≈øelves, and go out of our depth, by wading too far into them: There is ≈øomething concerning the≈øe, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable, and unaccountable to our Rea≈øon; we may not be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand how Something may be produc'd from Nothing; becau≈øe it argues ≈øuch an exce≈øs of Power, as we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; but yet we are forc'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that either the World mu≈øt be produc'd from Nothing, or that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was eternally of it ≈øelf, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very whit as hard to imagine, as that infinite Power ≈øhould be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it from nothing. So likewi≈øe we are not able to conceive, how God can certainly know future Events, which depend upon voluntary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Cau≈øes, becau≈øe we cannot comprehend infinite Knowledge; but this we may ea≈øily be ≈øatisfied in, that infinite Power and Knowledge may be able to do, and know many things, which we cannot conceive how they can be known or done, no more than a Child can imagine how a great Mathematician can demon≈øtrate his Propo≈øitions. Only this we are ≈øure
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35252:15"/>
of, as we can be of any thing, that no Power can do that which is evidently impo≈ø≈øible, and implies a plain Contradiction.</p>
            <p>We are not able perhaps to reconcile the particular Providences of God with his univer≈øal Goodne≈øs, Ju≈øtice, and Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, becau≈øe we cannot ≈øee to the end of his Ways and Works at one view, and ≈øee every part with relation to the whole; which would appear very wi≈øe, if we knew the whole ≈øeries of things, and ≈øaw the entire de≈øign together, as God him≈øelf does, to whom (as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us) <hi>all his ways are known from the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that however we may be at a lo≈øs in our Conceptions of God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Knowledge and Power, yet Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and Ju≈øtice, and Truth, are Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ea≈øie and familiar; and if we could not under≈øtand the≈øe, the whole Bible would be in≈øignificant to us. For all Revelation from God ≈øuppo≈øeth us to know what is meant by Goodne≈øs, Ju≈øtice, and Truth: And therefore no man can entertain any Notion of God, which plainly contradicts the≈øe. And it is fooli≈øh for any man to pretend, that he cannot know what Goodne≈øs, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35252:16"/>
Ju≈øtice, and Truth in God are: for if we do not know this, 'tis all one to us, whether God be good or not, nor could we imitate his Goodne≈øs; for he that imitates, endeavours to make him≈øelf like ≈øomething that he knows, and mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity have ≈øome Idea of that to which he aims to be like: So that if we had no certain and ≈øetled Notion of the Goodne≈øs, and Ju≈øtice, and Truth of God, he would be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether an unintelligible Being; and Religion, which con≈øi≈øts in the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, would be utterly impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Now the≈øe being the mo≈øt ea≈øie, and intelligible <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, by which he is ≈øaid in Scripture to declare his Name, that is, to make him≈øelf known to us, we ≈øhould govern all our Rea≈øonings about God (as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Decrees, and his concurrence with the Free Actions of Men, and his particular Providence, which are things more dark and ob≈øcure) by what is more clear; and we ≈øhall find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that in all the≈øe points holy Men do con≈øtantly appeal to the≈øe unque≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable and intelligible <hi>Perfections</hi> of God. <hi>Wilt thou de≈øtroy the righteous
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35252:16"/>
with the wicked?</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Abraham) That be far from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the world do right</hi>? We may be mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; but God certainly knows who are wicked, and who are righteous; and he knows how to puni≈øh the wicked, and ≈øave the righteous: But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mi≈øtaken in this Principle, <hi>that the Judge of all the world will do right.</hi> Thus <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øatisfies him≈øelf, and others concerning the particular Providences of God towards the People of <hi>I≈ørael.</hi> Deut. 32.3, 4. <hi>I will publi≈øh the name of the Lord: All his ways are judgement; a God of truth, and without iniquity, ju≈øt and right is He.</hi> This we certainly know of God. So St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Thou art inexcu≈øable, O Man!</hi> What≈øoever Excu≈øe men may pretend for their faults, he lays down this for a Principle, <hi>We are ≈øure the Judgment of God is according to truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us always con≈øider the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> of God in conjunction, and ≈øo as to reconcile them with one another. Do not con≈øider God as meer Power and Soveraignty, as meer Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, as meer Ju≈øtice and Severity; but as all the≈øe together, and in ≈øuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure and degree as may make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35252:17"/>
with one another. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt mi≈øtakes in Religion are certainly ≈øprung from this root, from ≈øeparating the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and con≈øidering them ≈øingly, and framing ≈øuch wide and large notions of one, as to exclude ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whereas the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God agree together, and that is not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Perfection,</hi> which contradicts any other <hi>Perfection.</hi> Among men indeed an eminent degree of any one Excellency does u≈øually ≈øhut out ≈øome other; and therefore it is ob≈øerv'd, that Power and Moderation, Love and Di≈øcretion, do not often meet together; that a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and a ≈ømall Judgment, a good Wit and an ill Nature, are many times found in conjunction: But in infinite <hi>Perfection</hi> all <hi>Perfections</hi> do eminently meet and con≈øi≈øt together; and it is not nece≈ø≈øary that one Excellency ≈øhould be rai≈øed upon the ruines of another.</p>
            <p>And if this had been well con≈øider'd, Men would not, by being too intent upon God's Soveraignty, with neglect of his other <hi>Perfections,</hi> have ≈øpoken tho≈øe hard things about Prede≈øtination: for the Soveraignty of God doth by no means ≈øet him above the Eternal Laws of Goodne≈øs, and Truth, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35252:17"/>
And if this were con≈øidered, men would not, by poring upon the Ju≈øtice and Severity of God, be ≈øo ≈øwallowed up in de≈øpair: for God is not ≈øo ≈øevere, but he is merciful to the penitent, and hath left a retreat for the returning Sinner. If this were well con≈øider'd, it would check the pre≈øumption of tho≈øe, who incourage them≈øelves in ≈øin, by fancying to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves a God all of Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; and <hi>becau≈øe ≈øentence again≈øt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil work is not ≈øpeedily executed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their heart is fully ≈øet in them to do evil:</hi> For it is not Goodne≈øs and Mercy finally to bear with and forgive ob≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Offenders; but want of Prudence and good Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Among different Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God (as there always have been, and will be in the world) chu≈øe tho≈øe which are farthe≈øt from extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; becau≈øe Truth as well as Virtue u≈øually lyes between the Extreams. And here I will in≈øtance in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie, which has much di≈øquieted the Church almo≈øt in all Ages, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Decrees of God; about which there are two Extreams, the one that God peremptorily decrees the final
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35252:18"/>
condition of every particular per≈øon, that is, their everla≈øting happine≈øs or mi≈øery, without any regard or con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> Actions of Men. The other, that God decrees nothing concerning any particular per≈øon, but only in general that men found under ≈øuch and ≈øuch Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ≈øhall be happy or mi≈øerable, and puts it into their own power to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie them≈øelves. Now he that is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this matter, as every man mu≈øt be that under≈øtands the difficulties on both ≈øides, had be≈øt take up in the middle Opinion, that God decrees the final condition of particular per≈øons with re≈øpect to certain Qualifications, which ≈øpeaking ab≈øolutely are not in every Man's power; but yet, under the influence of God's grace, which is never wanting to the ≈øincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of men, may be ≈øaid to be in our power, in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øays, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chri≈øt ≈øtrengthning me</hi>: For be≈øides that this in all probability is the Truth, there will be this advantage in it, that he that ≈øtands in the middle, is like to be more moderate towards the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenters on both ≈øides, than either of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35252:18"/>
them will be to one onother; becau≈øe the middle is not ≈øo far from either Extream, as the Extreams are from one another. At the wor≈øt, he ≈øtands fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt for an impartial enquiry after Truth, and when he has ≈øatisfied him≈øelf where the Truth lyes, he may more ≈øilently pa≈øs over to it, without any great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of incon≈øtancy; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be remarkable in him, who pa≈ø≈øeth from one Extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and la≈øtly, Entertain no Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning God, that doth evidently contradict the Practice of Religion, and a good Life, though never ≈øo ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ≈øubtile Arguments may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to per≈øwade it. Truth is mo≈øt ea≈øily ≈øeen, and di≈øcern'd in tho≈øe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonings and Opinions which tend to practice; becau≈øe the ab≈øurdity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of them is ≈øoone≈øt di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: whereas we cannot ≈øo certainly find out the truth or fal≈øhood of tho≈øe Opinions, which ≈øpeculative Men devi≈øe in their Studies, without any con≈øideration whether they ≈øerve any real purpo≈øe of Life, or not. Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are very apt to form tho≈øe notions, which are mo≈øt remote from common
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35252:19"/>
≈øen≈øe and u≈øe; becau≈øe more pains and wit are required to make them plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible: but there needs no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make a wi≈øe man de≈øpi≈øe them, than that they are unprofitable, and ≈øignifie nothing to our practice, and to make men truly better.</p>
            <p>This is univer≈øally true in all kind of knowledge, but mo≈øt con≈øiderable in the knowledge of God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becau≈øe that knowledge is of the greate≈øt con≈øideration. We need not ≈øcruple to admit ≈øome things, not ≈øo evident to Natural Rea≈øon, if we be ≈øatisfied of the truth of them, from an higher and more cogent Rea≈øon: As that God has revealed it, and ≈øaid it; this general Rea≈øon may per≈øwade us of a thing that is above and beyond Natural Rea≈øon: But we may not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing for a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which evidently contradicts and weakens the practice of an holy Life; becau≈øe this is the main end of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation; and we know God, only in order to the ≈øervice and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him.</p>
            <p>Let us then look upon all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that contradicts practice, as vain and fal≈øe, becau≈øe it de≈øtroys its end.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35252:19"/>
There are many things that ≈øeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough in Speculation, which yet we mo≈øt pertinaciou≈øly deny, becau≈øe they are not practicable; and there are many things, which ≈øeem doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Speculation, and would admit of great di≈øpute, which yet becau≈øe they are found true in practice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, are to be taken for certain and unque≈øtionable. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, the idle Rea≈øoning of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> was a thing contemned by the wi≈øer Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophers, as a vain and u≈øele≈øs ≈øubtilty. <hi>Zeno</hi> pretends to demon≈øtrate there is no Motion; and what is the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this Speculation, but that Men mu≈øt ≈øtand ≈øtill? But ≈øo long as a man finds he can walk, all the Sophi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the world will not per≈øwade him, that Motion is impo≈ø≈øible. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they that would per≈øwade us, that men can do nothing, nor contribute any more to their own Sanctification, than Stocks or Stones, and upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Metaphors mi≈øunder≈øtood, (as <hi>our being dead in tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes and ≈øins,</hi> and <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to good works)</hi> graft Notions which are impo≈ø≈øible and ab≈øurd in practice, do not con≈øider that the natural con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this is, that men mu≈øt do
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35252:20"/>
nothing at all in Religion, never think of God, nor pray to him, nor read his Word, nor go to Church; but ≈øit ≈øtill, and be wholly pa≈ø≈øive to the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God's grace: but however this may ≈øeem plau≈øible, and men may think they add much to the glory of God's grace, while they deny any power in the Creature; yet every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderate Man will pre≈øently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that this is by no means to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becau≈øe it contradicts Practice, and makes all the Commands and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of God's Word vain, and to no purpo≈øe; becau≈øe it de≈øtroys Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and di≈øcourages the endeavours of Men; makes them ≈øloathful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs of <hi>working out their own Salvation</hi>; than which nothing can ≈øet a man far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God's grace and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, and more immediately di≈øpo≈øe him for ruine; and upon ≈øome ≈øuch fal≈øe Rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as this, the <hi>≈øloathful Servant</hi> in the Parable <hi>hid his talent in a napkin, and buried it in the earth</hi>; but when he was called to account, his excu≈øe was not admitted, but <hi>he was ca≈øt into utter darkne≈øs.</hi> The two other Particulars, namely how far we are to imitate the Divine <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> and particularly what tho≈øe

            <p>IN the≈øe words we have, <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The ab≈øolute <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature ≈øuppo≈øed, not only in tho≈øe before mentioned, of Goodne≈øs, and Mercy, and Patience; but in all other Excellencies what≈øoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Perfection</hi> of God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as a Pattern for our Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>In the handling of the≈øe two Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, I propounded to proceed in this method.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ≈øhew how we are to conceive of the Divine <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:35252:22"/>II. To lay down ≈øome Rules, by which we may rectifie and govern our Opinions concerning the Attributes and <hi>Perfections</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ≈øhew how far we are to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what tho≈øe Divine Qualities are, which our Saviour doth here more e≈øpecially propound to our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To clear the true meaning of this Precept, and to ≈øhew that the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here intended by our Saviour is not impo≈ø≈øible to us; and then to draw ≈øome u≈øeful Inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p>The <hi>two</hi> fir≈øt I have already ≈øpoken to, I now proceed to the <hi>third</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which is to ≈øhew how far we are to imitate the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and particularly what tho≈øe Divine Qualities are, which our Saviour doth here more e≈øpecially propound to our imitation. For though the≈øe words do ≈øuppo≈øe the ab≈øolute <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature, yet becau≈øe there are ≈øeveral <hi>Perfections</hi> of God which are incommunicable, and a Creature, as ≈øuch, is utterly incapable of them, the≈øe cannot be ≈øuppos'd to be intended for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35252:22"/>
a Pattern to us. As the nece≈ø≈øity and independency of the Divine Nature; and the Self-≈øufficiency of it to his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs; to be the Original Cau≈øe of all things, and con≈øequently ≈øupream Lord and Governour; the Immen≈øity and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of his Being; the≈øe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ≈øeveral other <hi>Perfections,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable to a Creature; and it would be an un≈øufferable pride, and a kind of High Trea≈øon again≈øt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Maje≈øty, and a ≈øotti≈øh Ignorance of the nece≈ø≈øary bounds and limits of our own State, as we are Creatures, to think to re≈øemble God in the≈øe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, of which the condition of a Creature is utterly incapable. This was the Sin of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> an ambition to ≈øtep into the Throne of God, and <hi>to be like the mo≈øt high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in our imitation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Perfection,</hi> we are to keep within the ≈øtation of Creatures, not affecting an Independency and Soveraignty like the mo≈øt high, and to be Omnipotent as he is, <hi>to have an arm like God, and to thunder with a voice like him,</hi> as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion is in <hi>Job:</hi> But to endeavour to re≈øemble him, <hi>pro modulo crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> according to the rate and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35252:23"/>
of a Creature, in tho≈øe Divine Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and in ≈øuch mea≈øures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as our finite and dependent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of.</p>
            <p>More e≈øpecially and chiefly in the moral <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ≈øuch as are his Goodne≈øs, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Patience, his Ju≈øtice, and Truth, and Faithfulne≈øs; the≈øe, and only the≈øe, the Scripture ≈øeems to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend under the name of Holine≈øs; not all the Excellencies of the Divine Nature in general, but tho≈øe which we call moral Excellencies and Perfections, ≈øuch as tho≈øe which I have named; for with the≈øe, and hardly with any other, is the Holine≈øs of God joyn'd in Scripture, as <hi>holy and righteous, holy and true,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore when God ≈øays, <hi>be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> it ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that we are to imitate God in his Goodne≈øs, and Mercy, and Patience, and Righteou≈øne≈øs, and Faithfulne≈øs, and Truth; for the≈øe are the Holine≈øs of the Divine Nature, which ≈øet him at the greate≈øt di≈øtance from that which we call Moral Impurity and Sin.</p>
            <p>For that which our Saviour here in the Text more peculiarly recommends <pb n="31" facs="tcp:35252:23"/>
to our imitation, is the Goodne≈øs of God, of which his Mercy and Patience are two eminent Branches. The Mercy of God is his Goodne≈øs to tho≈øe that are in Mi≈øery, or are liable to it. The Patience of God is his Mercy in ≈øparing tho≈øe who have de≈øerved Puni≈øhment, and are liable to it. And the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of God is then greate≈øt, when it is exerci≈øed towards the evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful; tho≈øe who are ≈øo far from de≈øerving it, that they have given great and ju≈øt Provocations to the contrary. And this affection and temper of Mind, which is ≈øo remarkable in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the unworthy and unthankful Sons of Men, our Saviour recommends to our imitation here in the Text. <hi>Be ye therefore Perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is Perfect. Be ye therefore</hi>; this Particle of inference, <hi>therefore,</hi> hath a plain relation to ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ≈øpoken before; and if we look back to <hi>v.</hi> 44. we ≈øhall find our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour there enjoyning his Di≈øciples <hi>to love their Enemies, to ble≈øs them that cur≈øe them, to do good to them that hate them, and to pray for tho≈øe that de≈øpightfully u≈øe them, and per≈øecute them.</hi> And by what other argument doth he inforce
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35252:24"/>
the Practice of this difficult Duty, but by telling us, that this is to be like God, to be good to the evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, <hi>v.</hi> 45. <hi>That ye may be the Children of your Heavenly Father, who maketh his Sun to ri≈øe on the evil and the good, and his Rain to fall on the ju≈øt, and on the unju≈øt.</hi> God is good to all, and exerci≈øeth great Mercy and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience even towards the evil, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øt. And then he concludes, that if <hi>Perfection</hi> it ≈øelf be fit to be a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, we ≈øhould labour after the≈øe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>Be ye therefore Perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> So that though the univer≈øal Perfection of the Divine Nature be here ≈øuppo≈øed, yet the Attributes of his Goodne≈øs, and Mercy, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are here particularly pointed at, and propounded to us for our Pattern; and the Precept of imitating the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Perfection</hi> is more e≈øpecially to be under≈øtood of tho≈øe <hi>Perfections</hi> which our Saviour had been di≈øcour≈ø<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> of before, <hi>viz.</hi> the Goodne≈øs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. And that this is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øo, is evident from St. <hi>Luke's</hi> rendring this Precept, Ch. 6.36. <hi>Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <gap reason="foreign">

full of kindne≈øs and benignity; merciful, as your Father which is in Heaven is merciful</hi>; that is, endeavour you to be ≈øuch as I have de≈øcribed God to be. And this St. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls Perfection, becau≈øe the Goodne≈øs of God is his great Perfection, and the Glory of the Divine Nature, that which reflects a lu≈øtre and beauty upon all his other Attributes, and takes off the terrour of them. From all which it is plain, what tho≈øe Perfections of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are, which our Saviour doth here particularly recommend to our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I come now in the</p>
            <p n="4">IV. and <hi>la≈øt</hi> place, To clear the true meaning of this Precept, and to ≈øhew that the Duty here required, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by our Saviour (when he ≈øays, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect)</hi> is not impo≈ø≈øible to us. And to this purpo≈øe be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to con≈øider the≈øe <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our imitation of God is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly re≈øtrained to the communicable Perfections of God, and ≈øuch as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are capable of, as I have ≈øhewn before. For it is ≈øo far from being a Duty to affect or attempt to be like
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35252:25"/>
God in his peculiar Perfections, that it was probably the Sin of the Apo≈øtate Angels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our imitation of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which are communicable to Creatures, is likewi≈øe to be re≈øtrain'd to ≈øuch degrees of the≈øe Perfections, as Creatures are capable of. For no Creature can ever be ≈øo perfectly Good, as God is; nor partake of any other Excellency in that tran≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent degree, in which the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is po≈ø≈øe≈øt of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But there is no manner of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in having a Pattern propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us of ≈øo great Perfection, as is above our reach to attain to; and there may be great Advantages in it. The way to excel in any kind is, <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima quaeque exempla ad imitandum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere,</hi> to propo≈øe the highe≈øt and mo≈øt perfect Examples to our imitation. No Man can write after too perfect and good a Copy, and though he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reach the Perfection of it, yet he is like to learn more, than by one le≈øs perfect. He that aims at the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which yet he is ≈øure to come ≈øhort of, is like to ≈øhoot higher than he that aims at a mark within his reach.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides that the excellency of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35252:25"/>
Pattern, as it leaves room for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual improvement, ≈øo it kindles Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes Men ≈øtrain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the utmo≈øt to do better: And though he can never hope to equal the Example before him, yet he will endeavour to come as near it as he can. So that a perfect Pattern is no hindrance, but an advantage rather to our improvement in any kind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If any thing can be ≈øuppo≈øed to be our Duty, which is ab≈øolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Power, a Precept of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may with as much rea≈øon be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to be ≈øo, as any thing that can be in≈øtanc'd in: Becau≈øe in ≈øuch a ca≈øe, if we do our be≈øt, and be continnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pre≈ø≈øing forward towards the Mark, though we can never reach it, yet we do very commendably; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the law may require to try and rai≈øe our Obedience, yet in all equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interpretation, ≈øuch a Will and Endeavour will be acceptable with God for the Deed. For if the Perfection of the Law do really exceed our Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and be beyond the po≈ø≈øibility of our Performance, the a≈ø≈øurance we have of God's Goodne≈øs will ≈øufficiently ≈øecure us from any danger and prejudice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35252:26"/>
on that account. And we may rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably pre≈øume, that to do all we can towards the fulfilling of this Precept, will be as acceptable to God, and as beneficial to our ≈øelves, as if our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had been greater, and we had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfill'd it. If our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to try the readine≈øs and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs of our Obedience, bid us do that which he knows we cannot do, though we can do ≈øomething towards it, we may be ≈øure that he will be very well plea≈øed when he ≈øees, that in obedience to him we have done all that we could. And we may in this ca≈øe rea≈øon as our Saviour does; <hi>If we that are evil would deal thus with our Children, how much more ≈øhall our Heavenly Father</hi>? The Goodne≈øs of God ≈øignifies very little, if it does not ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie this, that in any in≈øtance of real and unque≈øtionable Goodne≈øs, God is much better than any Father upon Earth.</p>
            <p>However, at the wor≈øt, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we fall ≈øhort of the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Law, may be ≈øupplyed on our part, by an humble acknowledgment of our own Weakne≈øs and Imperfection, and on God's part by Mercy and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35252:26"/>
for the ≈øake of the perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of our ble≈ø≈øed Redeemer. This is the lea≈øt benefit we can expect in this ca≈øe from the Grace, and Mercy, and Equity of the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> which will fully clear this matter, this Precept doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to come up to a perfect equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with the Pattern propounded to us, but only imports a vigorous imitation of it; that we be perpetually a≈øcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and climbing up higher, ≈øtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing from one degree of Goodne≈øs to another, and continually a≈øpiring after a nearer re≈øemblance to God: And this certainly is po≈ø≈øible to us, to endeavour to be as like God as we can, in this weak and imperfect ≈øtate.</p>
            <p>Whereas any Equality with God, even in the communicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of his Goodne≈øs, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Patience, is not only impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us in this ≈øtate of Sin and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, but above the condition of a Creature, even of <hi>the Spirits of ju≈øt Men made Perfect,</hi> and of the highe≈øt Angels in Glory: for their Perfection is not ab≈øolute, but in compari≈øon with our pre≈øent ≈øtate. And I think there is no great Rea≈øon to doubt, but that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35252:27"/>
the ble≈ø≈øed Spirits above, who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally behold the Face of their Father, are ≈øtill writing after this Copy, which is here propounded to us; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>to be perfect, as their Father which is in Heaven is perfect</hi>; ≈øtill a≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after a nearer and more perfect re≈øemblance of God, who≈øe Goodne≈øs and Mercy is ≈øo far beyond, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of any Creature, that they may be for ever approaching near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to it, and yet never overtake it.</p>
            <p>And this ≈øeems to be no incon≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ingredient, and enhancement of the happine≈øs of Heaven, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs of good men (which is the ≈øimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of God) is never at a ≈øtand, nor at it's full growth and period; but that the glorified Saints (yea and ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Angels too) may be continually growing and improving, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves ≈øtill become better and happier to all eternity. And this in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion is no undervaluing the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs of Heaven, that it is not ≈øo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at fir≈øt, as it ≈øhall be afterwards; becau≈øe it is granted on all hands, that the happine≈øs of tho≈øe good Souls, who are already in bli≈øs, ≈øhall be more
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35252:27"/>
perfect and compleat at the Re≈øurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And why may it not then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increa≈øing, and be augmented ≈øtill more and more, without any ≈øtint or final period of it's perfection? In this world we are apt to faint in a long cour≈øe of goodne≈øs, and to be <hi>weary of well doing.</hi> But in the other ≈øtate, when men ≈øhall be ≈øtrongly by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈ø≈øed to goodne≈øs, and have nothing to pull them back, it will then be ≈øo far from being a trouble, that methinks it ≈øhould be a mighty plea≈øure to the ble≈ø≈øed, to find that there is no end of their doing good and becoming better. For if conformity to God be the ground and foundation of all Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs, then our Ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance proportionably, as we grow more and more like to him. This I confe≈øs were a di≈ømal Con≈øideration, to think that in Heaven we ≈øhould be liable to relap≈øe, to go backward, or fall from that holy and happy ≈øtate. But this is a comfortable Con≈øideration, that our holine≈øs and happine≈øs ≈øhall never be at a ≈øtand, that it is ≈øecure ≈øo far as it goes, and that we cannot lo≈øe what we have once attain'd, as we may do in this world. This methinks
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35252:28"/>
≈øhould be a trouble to no man, that as good and happy as he is at fir≈øt, he ≈øhall ≈øtill be better and better, more and more happy without end.</p>
            <p>But be that as it will, and as God plea≈øeth (for we do but talk in the dark about our future ≈øtate,) this is certain, that an equality with God in any of his <hi>Perfections</hi> is not to be attained by any Creature, and therefore cannot be thought to be the meaning of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: But that which our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, is a vigorous imitation of this Pattern; that we have this Example of the Divine <hi>Perfection</hi> always before us, and that we be continually endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as much as in us lies, to bring our ≈øelves to the neare≈øt re≈øemblance of God, that po≈ø≈øibly we can. And if this be our ≈øincere care and ≈øtudy, we need not doubt but that it will find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, and that he will be graciou≈øly plea≈øed to e≈øteem us for his Children; and if there need a pardon for it, that God will forgive wherein we fall ≈øhort of the <hi>Perfection</hi> of that Pattern, which we can never imitate to Perfection.</p>
            <p>And happy were it for us, if this were all the ground of our fear and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35252:28"/>
trouble, that when we had done all we could, we mu≈øt ≈øtill fall much ≈øhort of the <hi>perfection</hi> of God's Law, and the Duty therein laid upon us; alas! which of us does near ≈øo much as we can, and is not con≈øcious to him≈øelf that it is through his own fault and neglect, that he is ≈øo unlike his heavenly Father in Goodne≈øs and Mercy, in Righteou≈øne≈øs and true Holine≈øs; and that he ≈øtill partakes in ≈øo great a mea≈øure of tho≈øe, not only unrea≈øonable and bruti≈øh, but even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vili≈øh Pa≈ø≈øions of Malice and Hatred, of Rage and Cruelty, of Impatience and implacable Revenge; and that the≈øe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlike Qualities do ≈øo frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon us, and have ≈øo much domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over us!</p>
            <p>We are ≈øo far from being what we ought, in the≈øe and many other re≈øpects, that we are far from what we might be, if we would mind our Duty with care and con≈øcience, and make it our ≈øincere endeavour to ≈øubdue our ≈øelves to a conformity to God, and to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holine≈øs in his fear.</p>
            <p>Would we but often ≈øet God before our eyes, and repre≈øent to our ≈øelves tho≈øe excellent and amiable <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine Nature, which are ≈øo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35252:29"/>
comfortable and beneficial to us, and to which we ≈øtand ≈øo infinitely oblig'd, his Goodne≈øs and Mercy and Patience, upon which all our hopes of Happine≈øs do depend, and to which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, that we are not mi≈øerable pa≈øt recovery; that Goodne≈øs and Patience which he continually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth towards us, (for we provoke him every day,) and exerci≈øeth towards us on purpo≈øe to endear tho≈øe <hi>Perfections</hi> to us, from which we reap ≈øo much comfort and advantage; that by the Pattern of <hi>Perfection</hi> it ≈øelf, and the Example of him who is ≈øo much above us, ≈øo no ways obliged to us, nor tyed by any intere≈øt to be concerned for us, and who being happy in him≈øelf nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hopes nor fears any thing from us; I ≈øay by an Example that has all the≈øe advantages, we might be provok'd to be ≈øo affected towards one another (who have mutual Obligations one to another, and mutual Expectations of Good or Evil one from another) as we have always found God to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and as we de≈øire he ≈øhould ≈øtill continue; and mi≈øerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are we, when ever he cea≈øeth to be ≈øo: And we have rea≈øon to fear he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35252:29"/>
will cea≈øe to be ≈øo, if this Example of his Goodne≈øs and Patience towards us, do not transform us into the Image of the Divine <hi>Perfections,</hi> and prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to imitate tho≈øe Excellencies, which we have ≈øo much rea≈øon to approve and admire, and be in love withal.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Con≈øiderations taken both from ingenuity and intere≈øt ≈øhould awaken our ≈øloath, and ≈øtir up our mo≈øt re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and vigorous endeavours after that <hi>Perfection</hi> which our Saviour here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and make us a≈øhamed of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy complaints, that our Duty is ≈øet ≈øo high, that the endeavours of our whole life cannot reach it; when yet we have hardly made one ≈øtep towards it, and are ≈øo remi≈øs and unconcern'd about it, as if we could do it at any time with the greate≈øt ea≈øe, and at an hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before we leave the world, could fulfil this Precept of our Lord, of <hi>being perfect as our Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet let me tell you, ≈øo far as any of us are from re≈øembling our heavenly Father in ≈øome good degree and mea≈øure, ≈øo far are we di≈øtant from Heaven, and the temper of the ble≈ø≈øed; ≈øo far are we utterly unqualified for the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35252:30"/>
bli≈øsful ≈øight and enjoyment of God: for unle≈øs we be fir≈øt <hi>like him,</hi> we cannot <hi>≈øee him as he is</hi>: Only <hi>the pure in heart ≈øhall ≈øee God,</hi> and therefore <hi>every man that has this hope in him,</hi> ≈øhould <hi>purifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf even as he is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have, as briefly as I could, di≈øpatcht the <hi>four</hi> things I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for the Explication of this Text; namely, how we are to conceive of the Divine <hi>Perfections,</hi> and to give ≈øome Rules to regulate and govern our Opinions concerning the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and <hi>Perfections</hi> of God; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the extent of this Duty, and vindicate the po≈ø≈øibility of it.</p>
            <p>All that now remains, is to draw ≈øome u≈øeful Inferences from this Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe which I have made; and they ≈øhall be the≈øe <hi>two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. That the ≈øtronge≈øt and ≈øure≈øt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonings in Religion, are grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the E≈ø≈øential <hi>Perfections</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the true≈øt and mo≈øt ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantial Practice of Religion, con≈øi≈øts in the <hi>imitation</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the ≈øtronge≈øt and ≈øure≈øt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonings in Religion are grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the E≈ø≈øential <hi>Perfections</hi> of God; ≈øo that even Divine Revelation it ≈øelf
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35252:30"/>
doth ≈øuppo≈øe the≈øe for its Foundation, and can ≈øignifie nothing to us, unle≈øs the≈øe be fir≈øt known and believed. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs we be fir≈øt per≈øwaded of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and his particular Care of Mankind, why ≈øhould we believe that he would make any Revelation of him≈øelf to Men? Unle≈øs it be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally known to us, that God is true, what foundation is there for the belief of his Word? And what ≈øignifie the Laws and Promi≈øes of God, unle≈øs natural Light do fir≈øt a≈ø≈øure us of his Soveraign Authority and Faithfulne≈øs? So that the Principles of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are the foundation of that which is Revealed; and therefore in Rea≈øon nothing can be admitted to be a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God, which plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts his E≈ø≈øential <hi>Perfection,</hi> and con≈øequently if any pretends Divine Revelation for this Doctrine, That God hath from all Eternity ab≈øolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the eternal ruine of the greate≈øt part of Mankind, without any re≈øpect to the Sins and Demerits of Men, I am as certain that this Doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of God, as I am ≈øure that God is Good and Ju≈øt: becau≈øe this grates upon the Notion that Mankind have of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35252:31"/>
Goodne≈øs and Ju≈øtice. This is that which no good man would do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be believed of infinite Goodne≈øs; and therefore if <hi>an Apo≈øtle or Angel from Heaven</hi> teach any Doctrine which plainly overthrows the Goodne≈øs and Ju≈øtice of God, <hi>let him be accur≈øed.</hi> For every man hath greater a≈ø≈øurance that God is Good and Ju≈øt, than he can have of any ≈øubtile Speculations about Prede≈øtination and the Decrees of God.</p>
            <p>And for the ≈øame Rea≈øon I cannot believe, upon the pretended Authority or Infallibility of any Man or Church in the world, that God would not have Men under≈øtand their Publick Prayers, and the Le≈ø≈øons of Scripture which are read to them. A Le≈ø≈øon not to be under≈øtood is non≈øen≈øe: a Le≈ø≈øon is ≈øomething to be learn'd, which how it can be without being under≈øtood, is hard to comprehend.</p>
            <p>And as little can I believe upon the Authority of any Per≈øon or Church what≈øoever, that God ≈øhould reveal his Will to Men in the holy Scriptures, with a de≈øign to have it hid, and lock't up from the generality of Mankind in an unknown Tongue. And much
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35252:31"/>
le≈øs can I believe (which yet is the expre≈øs Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) that the ≈øaving Efficacy of the Sacrament depends upon the Intention of the Prie≈øt. Which is to ≈øay, that though people believe, and live never ≈øo well, they may be damned by Sholes and whole Pari≈øhes together at the plea≈øure of the Prie≈øt, and for no other rea≈øon, but becau≈øe he is ≈øo wicked, as not to intend to ≈øave them. Can any man believe this that hath any tolerable notion of God's Goodne≈øs? May we not in this ca≈øe appeal, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Ju≈øtice of God, and expo≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with greater Rea≈øon, than he did, much after the ≈øame manner, <hi>wilt thou de≈øtroy the righteous for the wicked; That be far from Thee to do after this manner,</hi> to damn the righteous for the wicked, and that righteous people ≈øhould lye at the mercy of a wicked Prie≈øt, to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ≈øaved at his plea≈øure, <hi>that be far from Thee; Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> And can there be a greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the Goodne≈øs and Ju≈øtice of God, than to imagin he ≈øhould deal with men after this manner? If this be to do right, there is no po≈ø≈øibility of doing wrong.</p>

<hi>Pythagoras</hi> was wont to ≈øay, <q>that we honour God mo≈øt, when we are mo≈øt like him in the temper and di≈øpo≈øition of our Minds;</q>
and <hi>Plato</hi> to the ≈øame purpo≈øe,
<q>that the height and <hi>Perfection</hi> of Goodne≈øs, is to re≈øemble God, as near as is po≈ø≈øible; and that we re≈øemble God in being ju≈øt, and holy, and wi≈øe.</q>
So likewi≈øe <hi>Hierocles,</hi> 
               <q>that a good man imitates God in the mea≈øures of Love and Friend≈øhip, who hates no man, and extends his benignity to all Mankind.</q>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath an excellent Di≈øcour≈øe about the Patience of God towards Sinners, and gives this as one Rea≈øon why God doth not pre≈øently puni≈øh

               </q>
And then he cites an excellent ≈øaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> 
               <q>that God manife≈øted him≈øelf, and di≈øplay'd his <hi>Perfections</hi> in the World for our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation; true Virtue being nothing el≈øe, but an imitation of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p>But does not Religion con≈øi≈øt very much in the Duties of God's Wor≈øhip, in the Exerci≈øes of Piety and Devotion, in con≈øtant and frequent Prayers to God, and in the celebration of his Goodne≈øs by Prai≈øe and Thanksgiving, in reading, and hearing, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon God's Word, in Fa≈øting and Ab≈øtinence, and keeping our bodies in ≈øubjection to our ≈øpirits, and in frequent receiving of the holy Sacrament?

            <p>But then it is to be con≈øidered, that the≈øe Exerci≈øes of Piety and Devotion are but the <hi>Means</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35252:35"/>
and not the ultimate <hi>End</hi> and De≈øign of it.

Religion admirably well, and are very good <hi>children of God,</hi> and in a ≈øtate of great grace and favour with him. Whereas the performance of all the≈øe Duties, and the u≈øe of all the≈øe Means, ≈øeparated from that which is the great End of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Conformity of our ≈øelves to God, in tho≈øe Qualities and Di≈øpo≈øitions which I have mention'd, is ≈øo far from finding acceptance with God, that it is an abomination to him. So God every where declares in Scripture, telling us, that <hi>the prayer of the wicked is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord,</hi> and that he di≈ødains to be prai≈øed by men of unhallowed lips and lives; and that unle≈øs with <hi>the prai≈øes we offer to him, we order our conver≈øation aright, we ≈øhall not ≈øee the ≈øalvation of God.</hi> With what contempt does he ≈øpeak of this formal and external Religion, without the power of it upon our hearts and lives! <hi>To what purpo≈øe is the multitude of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to me? Will the Lord be plea≈øed with thou≈øands of Rams, and ten thou≈øands of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Oil? he hath ≈øhewed thee, O man! what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju≈øtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? Is not this the fa≈øt which I have cho≈øen, to break the bands of wickedne≈øs, and to let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed

go free, to deal thy bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and that thou bring the poor that are ca≈øt out to thine hou≈øe; when thou ≈øee≈øt the naked that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ≈øelf from thine own fle≈øh</hi>?</p>
            <p>Nor is it <hi>hearing of the Word</hi> that will avail us, unle≈øs <hi>we be doers of it. Ble≈ø≈øed are they</hi> (≈øays our Saviour) <hi>that hear the word of God and keep it. He that heareth the≈øe ≈øayings of mine, and doth them, ≈øhall be likened to a wi≈øe man, who hath built his hou≈øe upon a rock.</hi> Nor will bare receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sacrament recommend us to God; but performing the Obligation, which thereby we take upon our ≈øelves, to ob≈øtain from all ≈øin and wickedne≈øs; otherwi≈øe <hi>we tread under foot the Son of God, and prophane the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby we ≈øhould be ≈øanctified, as if it were an unholy thing.</hi> Can any man think <hi>that</hi> to be Religion, which has no effect upon the lives of men, which does not teach them to govern their words and actions, who reads tho≈øe plain words of St. <hi>James? If any man among you ≈øeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vain. Pure Religion and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed before God and the Father is this, to vi≈øit the fatherle≈øs and widdows in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35252:37"/>
and to keep him≈øelf un≈øpotted from the world.</hi> When Religion produceth the≈øe real Effects, then the <hi>Means</hi> of Religion do truly ≈øerve the <hi>End</hi> of it, and we are <hi>not</hi> only <hi>hearers of the Word, but doers of it,</hi> and <hi>≈øhall be ble≈ø≈øed in our deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that as there is an obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to u≈øe the <hi>Means</hi> of Religion, which God hath in≈øtituted, with great care and con≈øcience; ≈øo we ≈øhould chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind that, which is the <hi>End</hi> of all Religion, which is to make us <hi>partakers of a Divine Nature,</hi> and make us like to God, e≈øpecially in tho≈øe amiable and excellent Qualities, which are the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and beauty of the Divine Nature, his Benignity and Goodne≈øs, his Mercy and Patience. The≈øe, becau≈øe they are the primary <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, are the principal Duties both of Natural and Revealed Religion, and of an eternal and indi≈øpen≈øable Obligation; becau≈øe they have their foundation in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, which is fixt and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And all po≈øitive In≈øtitutions, when they come in competition with the≈øe, are to ≈øtoop and vail to them. <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, e≈øpecially tho≈øe of Goodne≈øs, and Mercy, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35252:38"/>
Charity, are ≈øo ≈øtrongly bound upon us, that nothing in any <hi>reveal'd</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can cancel the Obligation of them, or ju≈øtifie the violation of the≈øe great and indi≈øpen≈øable Laws. Our Saviour in his Religion has declar'd nothing to the prejudice of them: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary has ≈øtraitned our Obligation to them, as much as is po≈ø≈øible. <hi>The Son of man came not to de≈øtroy mens lives, but to ≈øave them</hi>; ≈øo that they <hi>know not what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ≈øpirit they are of,</hi> who think to plea≈øe God by hating men, who are made after the image of God, &amp; <hi>by killing one another to do him good ≈øervice</hi>; who to advance his Cau≈øe and Religion in the World, will break through all the Obligations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Civil Society, undermine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and di≈øturb the Peace of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Whereas our Saviour did not by any thing in his Religion de≈øign to alter the Civil Government of the World, or to le≈ø≈øen and dimini≈øh the Rights of Princes, or to ≈øet men loo≈øe from Allegiance to them, or to make Trea≈øon and Rebellion, bloody Wars and barbarous Ma≈ø≈øacres lawful, for the propagating of his faith. He had (as any one would imagin) as much Power as the Pope; but yet he depo≈øed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35252:38"/>
no Princes, nor excommunicated and di≈øcharged their Subjects from their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Obedience to them, for their oppo≈øition to his Religion; he hath a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med no ≈øuch Power to him≈øelf. <hi>By what Authority then does</hi> his Vicar <hi>do the≈øe things? and who gave him this Authority</hi>? Our Lord tells us plainly, <hi>his Kingdom was not of this world</hi>; and that without any di≈øtinction of <hi>in ordine ad ≈øpiritualia,</hi> and therefore he wre≈øted no Princes Kingdom out of his hands, nor ≈øeized it as forfeited to him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>But this Power the Pope claims to him≈øelf, and hath exerci≈øed it many a time, di≈øturbing the Peace of Nations, and exerci≈øing the mo≈øt barbarous Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the World, under a pretence of Zeal for God and Religion: as if becau≈øe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ≈øo very good a thing in it ≈øelf, it would warrant men to do the very wor≈øt things for its ≈øake; which is the ready way to render Religion contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and odious, and to make two of the be≈øt things in the World, God and Religion, good for nothing.</p>
            <p>If we would pre≈øerve in the Minds of Men any reverence and e≈øteem for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we mu≈øt take heed how we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy the Principles of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:35252:39"/>
and undermine the Peace and Happine≈øs of Humane Society, for the glory of God, and under pretence of following Divine Revelation, and being led by a Church that cannot err: for every Church doth certainly err, that teacheth any thing plainly contrary to the Principles and Dictates <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f Natural Religion, and utterly incon≈øi≈øtent with the e≈ø≈øential <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, and with the Peace and Order of the World: for <hi>God is not the God of Confu≈øion, but of Order</hi>; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> appealeth to, as a Principle of eternal Truth, and naturally known: But they that pretend that Religion prompts men to Sedition and Cruelty, do repre≈øent God as <hi>the God of confu≈øion,</hi> and <hi>not of order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore whatever men may through an ignorant zeal, or for ambitious Ends, pretend to be Religion; let us place it in that which is unque≈øtionable, the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine <hi>Perfections,</hi> and let us (as the Apo≈øtle exhorts) <hi>put on, as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God, bowels of mercy, kindne≈øs, meekne≈øs, long-≈øuffering, and above all, let us put on Charity, which is the very bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> The great <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature, or rather the very E≈ø≈øence of God is Love. So St. <hi>John</hi> ≈øpeaks, <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35252:39"/>
and God in him.</hi> And 'tis very remarkable that in the≈øe very qualities of Charity, and Kindne≈øs, and Compa≈ø≈øion, which we peculiarly call <hi>Humanity,</hi> we approach neare≈øt to the <hi>Divinity</hi> it ≈øelf, and that the contrary Di≈øpo≈øitions do transform us into wild Bea≈øts and Devils.</p>
            <p>And yet as ≈øeverely as I ≈øpeak again≈øt the≈øe Principles and Practices, I have an hearty pity and compa≈ø≈øion for tho≈øe who are under the power of ≈øo great a Delu≈øion, and upon a pretence of being made the only true Chri≈øtians in the world, are ≈øeduced from <hi>Humanity</hi> it ≈øelf, and ≈øo far from being made good <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> by the≈øe Principles, that they are hardly left to be <hi>Men; being blinded, and led by the blind, they fall into the ditch</hi> of the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt and foule≈øt Immoralities; ≈øuch as are plainly enough condemn'd by the light of Nature, if there were no Bible in the World.</p>
            <p>Not but that we Prote≈øtants have our Faults and our Follies too, and tho≈øe (God knows) too many and too vi≈øible; we po≈ø≈øe≈øs more Truth, but there is little Peace among us; and yet God is as well and as often in Scripture called <hi>the God of peace,</hi> as <hi>the God of truth.</hi> In this great Light and Liberty of the Reform'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

            <p>You ≈øee in what things the Practice of Religion mainly con≈øi≈øts, in our likene≈øs to God, and re≈øemblance of him in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Goodne≈øs; and without this we are utterly incapable of happine≈øs: we cannot <hi>≈øee God,</hi> unle≈øs <hi>we be like him.</hi> The Pre≈øence of God can admini≈øter no Plea≈øure, no Felicity to us, till we be changed into his Image; till we come to this temper, to hate Sin, and delight in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holine≈øs, we can have no delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful communion with the holy God; till our Pa≈ø≈øions be ≈øubdued, and our Souls di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øe≈øt of tho≈øe devili≈øh and ungodlike Qualities of Hatred and Malice, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and Impatience, and till we be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the Spirit of univer≈øal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Charity, we are not fit company for our heavenly Father; we are not qualified <hi>to dwell with God,</hi> who is <hi>love and dwells in love.</hi> So far as we are defective in the≈øe Divine Qualities and <hi>Perfections,</hi>

≈øo far we fall ≈øhort of the temper of Happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>There is a direct and eternal Oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the holy and good God, and the evil di≈øpo≈øitions of wicked men, and till this Oppo≈øition be removed, it is impo≈ø≈øible we ≈øhould find any felicity in the enjoyment of God.

            <p>SINCE all Men naturally de≈øire <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> and thir≈øt after it; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we ≈øhould all de≈øire to know what it is, and where it is to be found, and how it is to be attained by us, in that degree in which Creatures are capable of it. What <hi>Job</hi> ≈øays of <hi>Wi≈ødom,</hi> may be ≈øaid al≈øo of <hi>Happine≈øs, God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</hi> He only, who is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly po≈ø≈øe≈øt of it him≈øelf, knows wherein it con≈øi≈øts, and what are the true ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:35252:42"/>So that to direct us in our ≈øearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> the be≈øt way will be to Contemplate and Con≈øider the Divine Nature, which is the perfect Pattern and Idea of <hi>Happine≈øs,</hi> and the Original Spring and Fountain of all the Felicity that Creatures are capable of. And to that end, I have pitched upon the≈øe Words, wherein the Apo≈øtle attributes this Perfection of <hi>be≈ø≈øedne≈øs</hi> or <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs</hi> to God, <hi>The Ble≈ø≈øed God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' this be as E≈ø≈øential a part as any other of that Notion which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have of God from the Light of Nature, yet I no where find in all the New Te≈øtament, this Attribute of <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs</hi> given to God, but only twice in this Epi≈øtle. 'Tis true indeed, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs</hi> is frequently given both to God and Chri≈øt, but in another Sen≈øe, and in a quite different Notion: As <hi>Mark</hi> 14.61. where the High-Prie≈øt asks our Saviour, <hi>Art thou the Chri≈øt, the Son of the Ble≈ø≈øed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>

Chri≈øt came, who is over all, God Ble≈ø≈øed for evermore</hi>; that is, <hi>for ever to be prai≈øed and celebrated.</hi> But in all the≈øe Texts the Greek Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, which tho' we Tran≈ølate <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed,</hi> yet it is a quite different Notion from the Title of <hi>Ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs</hi> which is given to God in the Text, where the Word is not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>the Ble≈ø≈øed,</hi> or <hi>the Happy God</hi>; and this Title is not any where in all the New Te≈øtament, (that I know of) given to God, but here in the Text, and Chap. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 15. where our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt (who al≈øo is God) is called <hi>the ble≈ø≈øed and the only Potentate.</hi> And whether this Title of <hi>the Ble≈ø≈øed,</hi> or <hi>the Happy God,</hi> be here in the Text given to God the Father, or to his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son, our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt; is not ≈øo much material to my pre≈øent purpo≈øe to enquire. For, ≈øuppo≈øe it be Chri≈øt who is here call'd <hi>the Ble≈ø≈øed God</hi>; this however is certain, that <hi>Ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs</hi> or <hi>Happine≈øs</hi> is a Title belonging to <hi>God,</hi> which is all that is nece≈ø≈øary for a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my pre≈øent Di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
            <p>In ≈øpeaking of this Argument, I ≈øhall do the≈øe <hi>three</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Shew what we are to under≈øtand by the <hi>happine≈øs</hi> of God, and what
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35252:43"/>
are the e≈ø≈øential Ingredients of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That this Title doth belong to God, and that the Divine Nature is perfectly <hi>ble≈ø≈øed</hi> and <hi>happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. How far Creatures are capable of <hi>Happine≈øs,</hi> and by what Ways and Means they may be made partakers of it: And ≈øhall then make ≈øome Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from my Di≈øcour≈øe upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I will con≈øider what we are to under≈øtand by the <hi>ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs</hi> or <hi>happine≈øs</hi> of God, and what are the e≈ø≈øential In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of it. Now the Notion of <hi>happine≈øs</hi> taken at its highe≈øt pitch (as we mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily do when we apply it to God) is no other than a fixt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable ≈øtate of Contentment and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, of Plea≈øure and Delight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øulting from the ≈øecure po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and enjoyment of all that is good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øirable, that is, of all Excellency and Perfection; ≈øo that the≈øe following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients mu≈øt go to make up a perfect ≈øtate of <hi>happine≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Perfect Knowledge, to under≈øtand what it is that con≈øtitutes <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> and to know when one is really po≈ø≈øe≈øt of it. For as he is not <hi>happy,</hi> who is ≈øo only in Imagination or a Dream, without
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35252:43"/>
any real Foundation in the thing; for he may be plea≈øed with his Condition, and yet be far enough from being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>happy</hi>: So on the other hand, he that has all other nece≈ø≈øary Ingredients of <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> and only wants this, that he doth not think him≈øelf ≈øo, cannot be <hi>happy.</hi> For this we often ≈øee in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect felicity of this World, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men who have all the Materials and Circum≈øtances of a worldly <hi>happine≈øs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, yet by the unskilful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the matter, and from a lightne≈øs and injudiciou≈øne≈øs of Mind, not knowing when they are well, they make an hard ≈øhift, even when they are in as good Circum≈øtances as it is almo≈øt po≈ø≈øible for Men to be in this World, to be very di≈øcontented and mi≈øerable in their own Opinions. But God perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows both what makes <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> and that he is po≈ø≈øe≈øt of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To perfect <hi>happine≈øs</hi> is likewi≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a full Power to do whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> and likewi≈øe to check and control whatever would be an hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and di≈øturbance to it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Being is as happy as it can be, that is not All-≈øufficient, and hath not within its Power and Reach whatever
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35252:44"/>
is nece≈ø≈øary to an happy Condition, and nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øecure and continue that <hi>happine≈øs</hi> again≈øt all Attempts and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents what≈øoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is Wi≈ødom al≈øo requir'd to direct this Power, and manage it in ≈øuch a manner, as it may effectually conduce to this end; and this is very different from meer Power, ab≈øtractedly con≈øider'd; for one may have all the Materials of <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> and yet want the Wi≈ødom and Skill to put them ≈øo together, as to frame an happy Condition out of them; and he is not happy, who doth not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly under≈øtand the proper method and means of compa≈ø≈øing and ≈øecuring his own <hi>happine≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Another mo≈øt con≈øiderable and e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øential Ingredient of <hi>happine≈øs</hi> is Goodne≈øs; without which, as there can be no true Maje≈øty and Greatne≈øs, ≈øo neither can there be any <hi>felicity</hi> or <hi>happine≈øs.</hi> Now Goodne≈øs is a generous di≈øpo≈øition of Mind to communicate and diffu≈øe it ≈øelf, by making others partakers of its <hi>happine≈øs</hi> in ≈øuch degrees as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, and as Wi≈ødom ≈øhall direct: For he is not ≈øo happy as he may be, who hath not the plea≈øure of making o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ≈øo, and of ≈øeeing them put into an
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35252:44"/>
happy Condition by his means, which is the highe≈øt plea≈øure (I had almo≈øt ≈øaid <hi>pride,</hi> but I may truly ≈øay <hi>glory</hi>) of a good and great Mind: For by ≈øuch Communications of him≈øelf, an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øe and All≈øufficient Being doth not le≈ø≈øen him≈øelf, or put any thing out of his Power, but doth rather enlarge and magnifie him≈øelf; and does, as I may ≈øay, give great Ea≈øe and Delight to a full and fruitful Being, without the lea≈øt diminution of his Power or Happine≈øs. For the Cau≈øe and Original of all other Beings, can make nothing ≈øo indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon it ≈øelf, as not ≈øtill to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Intere≈øt in it, to have it always under his Power and Government; and no Being can Rebel again≈øt his Maker, without extream hazard to him≈øelf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Perfect <hi>happine≈øs</hi> doth imply the exerci≈øe of all other Virtues, which are ≈øuitable to ≈øo perfect a Being, upon all proper and ≈øitting occa≈øions; that is, that ≈øo perfect a Being do nothing that is contrary to, or unbecoming his Holine≈øs and Righteou≈øne≈øs, his Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs, which are e≈ø≈øential to a perfect Being, and for ≈øuch a Being to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them in any ca≈øe, would be to create di≈øquiet and di≈øturbance to it ≈øelf:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35252:45"/>
For this is a certain Rule, and never fails, that nothing can act contrary to its own Nature without reluctancy and di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, which in moral Agents is that which we call <hi>Guilt</hi>; for <hi>Guilt</hi> is nothing el≈øe but the Trouble and Di≈øquiet which ari≈øeth in one's Mind, from the con≈øciou≈øne≈øs of having done ≈øomething which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the perfective Principles of his Being, that is, ≈øomething that doth not become him, and which, being what he is, he ought not to have done; which we cannot imagine ever to befall ≈øo perfect and immutable a Being as God is.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Perfect <hi>happine≈øs</hi> implies in it the ≈øettled and ≈øecure Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of all tho≈øe Excellencies and Perfections; for if any of the≈øe were liable to fail, or be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh'd, ≈øo much would be taken off from perfect and compleat <hi>Happine≈øs.</hi> If the Deity were ≈øubject to any change, or impairment of his Condition, ≈øo that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Knowledge, or Power, or Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Goodne≈øs, or any other Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, could any ways decline or fall off, there would be a proportionable abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>happine≈øs.</hi> And from all the≈øe does re≈øult in the</p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>th,</hi> and <hi>la≈øt</hi> place, Infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35252:45"/>
and Satisfaction, Plea≈øure and Delight, which is the very <hi>E≈ø≈øence</hi> of <hi>happine≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Infinite Contentment and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Condition. And well may <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs</hi> be contented with it ≈øelf; that is, with ≈øuch a Condition, that he that is po≈ø≈øe≈øt of it, can neither de≈øire it ≈øhould be better, nor have any cau≈øe to fear it ≈øhould be wor≈øe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Plea≈øure and Delight, which is ≈øomething more than Contentment: For one may be contented with an Affliction and painful Condition, in which he is far from taking any Plea≈øure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. <hi>No affliction is joyous for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, but grievous,</hi> as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. But there cannot be perfect <hi>happine≈øs</hi> without Plea≈øure in our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Full Plea≈øure is a certain mixture of Love and Joy, hard to be expre≈øt in Words, but certainly known by inward Sen≈øe and Experience.</p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe to you, as well as I could, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our imperfect Conceptions and Expre≈ø≈øions of God, the <hi>happine≈øs</hi> of the Divine Nature, and wherein it con≈øi≈øts. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing I propo≈øed, which was to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35252:46"/>
≈øhew, that this Attribute of Perfection doth belong to God; and that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is <hi>perfectly Ble≈ø≈øed and Happy</hi>; and this is ≈øo univer≈øal an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Natural Light, that it would be a very ≈øuperfluous and impertinent Work, to trouble you with particular Citations of Heathen Authors to this purpo≈øe; nothing being more frequent in them, than to call the Deity, <hi>beati≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam &amp; perfecti≈ø≈øimam naturam, the mo≈øt happy and mo≈øt perfect Being,</hi> and therefore <hi>happy,</hi> becau≈øe Felicity doth naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult from <hi>Perfection.</hi> It ≈øhall ≈øuffice to take notice of the≈øe <hi>Two</hi> things out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Writers, to my pre≈øent purpo≈øe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they accounted <hi>happine≈øs</hi> ≈øo e≈ø≈øential to the Notion of a God, that this was one of the Ways which they took to find out what Properties were fit to attribute to God, and what not, to con≈øider what things are con≈øi≈øtent with <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> or incon≈øi≈øtent with it; and whatever did ≈øignifie <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> and was a perfection con≈øi≈øtent with it, they a≈øcribed to God, as a ≈øuitable Property of the Divine Nature; and whatever was otherwi≈øe, they remov'd it from God, as unfit to be ≈øaid of Him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:35252:46"/>2. Whatever differences there were among the Philo≈øophers concerning the <hi>Perfections</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> they all agreed in the <hi>perfect felicity</hi> of it; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Epicurus</hi> him≈øelf, who ≈øo boldly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ≈øtrip the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> of mo≈øt of its Perfections, by denying that God either made or govern'd the World, whereby he took away at once his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fir≈øt Cau≈øe and Original of all things, and his Goodne≈øs likewi≈øe, and Wi≈ødom, and Power, and Ju≈øtice; or, at lea≈øt made all the≈øe u≈øele≈øs, by taking away all occa≈øion and opportunity for the exerci≈øe of them; yet this Man does frequently own, and profe≈øs to believe the <hi>happine≈øs</hi> of the Divine Nature; and then out of an ignorant, and officious kindne≈øs to the Deity, and (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) for the ≈øecurity of his Felicity, did in effect take away his other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; he would by no means put God to the Trouble and Burden of making the World, or taking care of the Affairs of it, le≈øt this ≈øhould di≈øcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe the Deity, or be an interruption or di≈øturbance of his Ea≈øe and Felicity. For thus <hi>Lucretius,</hi> the great Di≈øciple of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> de≈øcribes his Opinion of the Divine Nature,
<q>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:35252:47"/>
                  <l>Omnis enim div√ªm, per ≈øe, natura ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øe e≈øt,</l>

            </p>
            <p>That is, <hi>It is nece≈ø≈øary that the Divine Nature ≈øhould be Happy, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unconcern'd in our Affairs; free from all grief and danger, ≈øufficient for it ≈øelf, and ≈øtanding in need of no body, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plea≈øed with our Good Actions, nor provoked by our Faults.</hi> This was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fal≈øe Notion both of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs,</hi> to imagine that the Care of the World ≈øhould be a pain and di≈øturbance to Infinite Knowledge, and Power, and Goodne≈øs. But this is not now my bu≈øine≈øs to con≈øider; that which is to my pre≈øent purpo≈øe, is, That the <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs</hi> of the Divine Nature was Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øally owned; and that <hi>ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs</hi> is

            </p>
            <p>As for the Te≈øtimony of Scripture, I have already told you, that there are but two Texts wherein this Title of <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>As we are <hi>Creatures</hi> of a <hi>finite Power,</hi> and limited Under≈øtandings, and a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Nature, we do nece≈ø≈øarily want many of tho≈øe <hi>perfections,</hi> which are the Cau≈øe and Ingredients of a <hi>perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs.</hi> We are far from being ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our own happine≈øs; we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øo of our ≈øelves, nor can we make our ≈øelves ≈øo by our own Power; for neither are we wi≈øe enough for our own direction, nor good enough for our own ≈øatisfaction.

Friend≈øhip and Good-Will to us, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies all the defects of Power and Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in us: For God being our Friend, we have an Intere≈øt in all his <hi>Perfections,</hi> and a Security, that as occa≈øion requires, they will all be employ'd for our benefit and advantage; ≈øo that tho' we are <hi>weak in our ≈øelves,</hi> we are <hi>≈øtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> and are <hi>able to do all things through him ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us</hi>; and tho' <hi>we want Wi≈ødom,</hi> we may have free recour≈øe to the Fountain of it, and <hi>ask it of God, who gives to all liberally, and upbraideth not.</hi> And it is next to having the≈øe <hi>perfections</hi> in our ≈øelves, to know where to have them for asking, whenever we ≈øtand in need of them, ≈øo far as is nece≈ø≈øary to our <hi>happine≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that tho' our happine≈øs depend upon another, yet if we be careful to qualifie our ≈øelves for it, (and God is always ready to a≈ø≈øi≈øt us by his Grace to this purpo≈øe) it is really and in effect in our own power; and we are every whit as ≈øafe and happy in God's care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of us, as if we were ≈øufficient for our ≈øelves.

            <p>But to what purpo≈øe, may ≈øome ≈øay, is this long De≈øcription and Di≈øcour≈øe of <hi>happine≈øs</hi>? How are we the Wi≈øer and the Better for it? I An≈øwer; very much, in ≈øeveral re≈øpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This plainly ≈øhews us, That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thei≈øm</hi> is a very melancholy and mi≈øchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous thing; it would take away the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> and the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Pattern</hi> of it; it endeavours at once to extingui≈øh the Being of God, and all the Life and Comfort of Mankind, ≈øo that we could neither form any Idea of <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> or be in any po≈ø≈øibility of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it. For it is plain, we are not ≈øufficient for it of our ≈øelves; and if there be not a God, there is nothing that can make us ≈øo? God is <hi>the true light of the World,</hi> and a thou≈øand times more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to the comfort and happine≈øs of Mankind, than the Sun it ≈øelf, which is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35252:49"/>
but a dark Shadow of that infinitely more bright and glorious Being; <hi>the happy and only Potentate</hi> (as the Apo≈øtle de≈øcribes him in the latter end of this Epi≈øtle) <hi>who only hath immortality, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in that light which no man can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto, whom no man hath ≈øeen, nor can ≈øee,</hi> meaning in this mortal ≈øtate.</p>
            <p>So that the greate≈øt Enemies, and mo≈øt injurious of all others to Mankind, are tho≈øe who would bani≈øh the Belief of a God out of the World; becau≈øe this is <hi>to lay the Ax to the root of the Tree,</hi> and at one blow to cut off all Hopes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs from Mankind. So that he is <hi>a Fool</hi> indeed, that <hi>≈øays in his heart there is no God</hi>; that is, that wi≈øheth there were none; becau≈øe it is not po≈ø≈øible for a Man to wi≈øh wor≈øe to him≈øelf, and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to de≈øtroy his own happine≈øs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Divine Nature be ≈øo <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> and <hi>compleatly happy,</hi> this is a very great confirmation of our Faith and Hope concerning the happine≈øs of another Life, which the Scripture de≈øcribes to us, by the Sight and Enjoyment of God. As we are Creatures, we are not capable of the happine≈øs that is ab≈øolutely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely perfect, becau≈øe our Nature is but finite, and limited; but <hi>the ble≈ø≈øed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35252:50"/>
God</hi> who is <hi>infinitely happy</hi> him≈øelf, can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo make us <hi>happy</hi> according to our <hi>finite</hi> Mea≈øure and Capacity. For, as he that is the Fir≈øt and Original Being, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Being to other things, ≈øo He that is the Fountain of Happine≈øs, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive and convey happine≈øs to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>And we ≈øhall the more ea≈øily believe this, when we con≈øider that <hi>Goodne≈øs,</hi> as it is the prime Perfection, ≈øo is it likewi≈øe the chief felicity of the Divine Nature. It is his Glory and Delight to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him≈øelf, and ≈øhed abroad his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; and the highe≈øt expre≈ø≈øion of the <hi>Divine Goodne≈øs,</hi> is to communicate happine≈øs to his Creatures, and to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that they ≈øhould ≈øhare and partake with him in it. Ba≈øe and Envious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are narrow and contracted, and love to confine their Enjoyments and good Things to them≈øelves, and are loth that others ≈øhould take part with them; but the mo≈øt Noble and mo≈øt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Minds are mo≈øt free and enlarged, and cannot be happy them≈øelves unle≈øs they find or make others ≈øo.</p>
            <p>This is the highe≈øt pitch of Goodne≈øs, and con≈øequently the highe≈øt Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ≈øupream delight of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35252:50"/>
Divine Nature. Now it is natural to every Being, to be mo≈øt frequent and abundant in tho≈øe Acts in which it finds the greate≈øt Plea≈øure; <hi>to be good,</hi> and <hi>to do good</hi> is the ≈øupream Felicity of God him≈øelf; therefore we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily believe, that he is very ready and forward to make us happy, by all the ways that are agreeable to his Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Righteou≈øne≈øs; and that He is al≈øo willing to make us abundantly ≈øo, and to advance us to the highe≈øt degree of Felicity, of which our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable, if we do not render our ≈øelves incapable of ≈øuch a Ble≈ø≈øing, by an ob≈øtinate refu≈øal of it, and utter indi≈øpo≈øition for it.</p>
            <p>This, I ≈øay, is very credible, becau≈øe the <hi>happine≈øs</hi> of God him≈øelf con≈øi≈øts in that propen≈øion and di≈øpo≈øition of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which tends to make others <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</hi> And if there can be any acce≈ø≈øion to that which is <hi>infinite,</hi> God him≈øelf finds a new Plea≈øure and Felicity in the communication of his goodne≈øs to his Creatures, and therefore is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented in Scripture, as glad of <hi>the Conver≈øion of a ≈øinner,</hi> becau≈øe the ≈øinner hereby becomes capable of the happine≈øs which God de≈øign'd for his Creatures,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35252:51"/>
and is always ready to confer upon them, whenever they are qualified for it, and he can, with the Honour of his other Perfections, be≈øtow it upon them.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Two</hi> things which rai≈øe our Hopes and expectation of Good from any Per≈øon; if he be <hi>Able</hi> and <hi>Willing</hi> to be≈øtow upon us what we hope for from him. Now if any one can confer <hi>Happine≈øs</hi> upon us, it is He who is <hi>infinitely</hi> po≈ø≈øe≈øt of it, and hath all the Trea≈øures of it in him≈øelf; and <hi>that</hi> God only is; who, as he is <hi>able,</hi> ≈øo is <hi>willing</hi> to make us happy, if we be qualified for it; and it is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of his happine≈øs to make others happy; for even that Goodne≈øs which inclines him to communicate happine≈øs to others, is a great part of his own Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; ≈øo that, as our Saviour argues, <hi>becau≈øe I live, you ≈øhall live al≈øo</hi>; we may rea≈øon in like manner, that <hi>becau≈øe God is happy, we ≈øhall be happy al≈øo,</hi> if we do but ≈øincerely de≈øire and endeavour to qualifie our ≈øelves for it. The Goodne≈øs of God does ≈øtrongly incline him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire our happine≈øs, and makes him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ready to be≈øtow it upon us, when ever we are capable to receive it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:35252:51"/>So that the <hi>Goodne≈øs</hi> of God is the great Foundation of all our Hopes, and the firme≈øt ground of our a≈ø≈øurance of a Ble≈ø≈øed Immortality. It is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs of the Divine Nature to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him≈øelf; and the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God's Goodne≈øs to us are the cau≈øe of our happine≈øs; and therefore, both for our Example and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Goodne≈øs</hi> of God ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be repre≈øented to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Advantage, and we ≈øhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to po≈ø≈øe≈øs our Minds with a firm Belief and Per≈øwa≈øion of it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the Divine Nature (which we all acknowledge to have infinitely more goodne≈øs than is to be found in any of the Sons of Men) whatever we would not attribute to a good Man, and to vindicate God from all ≈øu≈øpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Envy and Ill-will, of Cruelty and Arbitrary dealing with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And I cannot apprehend why Men ≈øhould be aver≈øe from the≈øe ≈øo agreeable and delightful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of God; or how it ≈øhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man's Intere≈øt to le≈ø≈øen the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs</hi> of God; for mo≈øt certainly the better God is in him≈øelf, the better

and happier it will be for us all, if it be not our own fault.</p>

For the very ≈øame Cau≈øes and Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients which make up <hi>the happine≈øs of God,</hi> mu≈øt in an inferior degree be found in us, otherwi≈øe we cannot be <hi>happy</hi>; no, tho' a Man were in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if he be ≈øtill a bad Man, <hi>Coelum, non animum mutavit,</hi> he hath only <hi>changed the Climate,</hi> and is gone into another <hi>Countrey,</hi> but he bears <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf</hi> ≈øtill about him, and his <hi>Mind</hi> is not changed, which would ≈øignifie a thou≈øand times more to his <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> than any <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>outward Circum≈øtance</hi> what≈øoever.

            <p>For there is a certain Temper and Di≈øpo≈øition of Mind, that is nece≈ø≈øary and e≈ø≈øential to <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> is <hi>holine≈øs</hi> and <hi>goodne≈øs,</hi> which is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God; and ≈øo much as any Per≈øon departs from this Temper, ≈øo far he removes him≈øelf, and runs away from <hi>happine≈øs</hi>: And as Sin is <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from God,</hi> ≈øo the Puni≈øhment of it is likewi≈øe expre≈øt by <hi>departing from him; Depart from me ye Cur≈øed; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

his own lu≈øt, and enticed</hi>; and here in the Text he a≈ø≈øerts, that God is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Author of all Good; <hi>do not err, my beloved Brethren</hi>; as if he had ≈øaid, do not mi≈øtake me, tho' Sin and Evil be not from God, but from our ≈øelves, and our own corrupt hearts; yet all good is from God, and not from our ≈øelves: tho' we be the Authors of the ≈øins we commit; yet we are not ≈øo of the good that we do, <hi>that</hi> is from God; <hi>every good Gift, and every perfect Gift is from above, and cometh down from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights.</hi> Sin which is nothing but Evil and Imperfection, is not from God, but wholly from our ≈øelves; but whatever is good and perfect, is not from our ≈øelves, but from God; we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclined to that which is good, nor are able of our ≈øelves to perform it; both the inclination and the power are from God, who is the Fountain of goodne≈øs and perfection, and can never be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, and can never change nor cea≈øe to be ≈øo, <hi>for with him is no variablene≈øs nor ≈øhadow of turning.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> I ≈øhall briefly explain what is meant by the <hi>immutability,</hi> or <hi>unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene≈øs,</hi> of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ≈øhall ≈øhew that this is a perfection e≈ø≈øential to God, to be <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably</hi> what he is, that is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ≈øhall an≈øwer an Objection which lies again≈øt it, from the mention
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35252:58"/>
≈øo often made in Scripture of <hi>God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting him≈øelf.</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Apply the Con≈øideration of it to our ≈øelves.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the Explication of it. By the <hi>immutability</hi> of God, we mean that he always is, and was, and to all Eternity will be the ≈øame, that he undergoes no changes either of his E≈ø≈øence and Being, or of his Properties and Perfections. In reference to the <hi>unchangeablene≈øs</hi> of his <hi>being,</hi> he is ≈øaid to be <hi>eternal, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and only to have immortality.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his <hi>perfections,</hi> he is always the ≈øame infinitely Wi≈øe, and Good, and Powerful, and Holy, and ju≈øt Being; from whence it follows, that he is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant and Immutable in all his Decrees and Coun≈øels, his Purpo≈øes and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes. We are uncertain and mutable in in our very Nature and Beings, and in all tho≈øe Qualities and Perfections which belong to us, in all our Purpo≈øes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutions and Actions; we are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally growing or decrea≈øing in this or that quality, and do frequently change from one extream to another, from that which is more perfect to the contrary, now knowing, and then ignorant, ≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wi≈øe, and oftner fooli≈øh, ≈øtronger
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35252:59"/>
and weaker, better or wor≈øe, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and as we order our ≈øelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually waxing or waining in our Knowledge, and Wi≈ødom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and Power; we frequently change our Minds, and alter our Purpo≈øes, and break our Promi≈øes, and contradict our firme≈øt and mo≈øt ≈øerious Re≈øolutions, and ≈øpeak a thing and do it not, ≈øay it and do not bring it to pa≈øs; but God is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øtingly the ≈øame in all his Perfections, con≈øtant to his Intentions, ≈øteady to his Purpo≈øe, immutably fixt and per≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in all his Decrees and Re≈øolutions. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing I propo≈øed, namely, To ≈øhew that this <hi>Perfection</hi> is e≈ø≈øential to God, to be <hi>unchangeably</hi> what he is. And this I ≈øhall endeavour to make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt both from Natural Rea≈øon, and from the Divine Revelation of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Dictates of natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, which tells us, that nothing Argues greater weakne≈øs and imperfection than Incon≈øtancy and Change. This is the great Vanity of all Creatures, that they are uncertain, and do not long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in one ≈øtate; this is the vanity of the World in general, that <hi>the fa≈øhion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35252:59"/>
of it pa≈ø≈øeth away</hi>; and of Man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that he is liable to ≈øo many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral changes, by Age, and Di≈øea≈øes, and Death, for which Rea≈øon he is ≈øaid by the P≈øalmi≈øt, to be <hi>in his be≈øt e≈øtate alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity</hi>; and that he is liable to ≈øo many moral changes, to be deluded and deceived in his Under≈øtanding, and to alter his Opinion ≈øo often, to be ≈øo fickle in his Will, and to change ≈øo often his Purpo≈øes and Re≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the alteration or appearance of things. We attribute Change and Incon≈øtancy to Per≈øons of the weake≈øt Age and Under≈øtanding, as Children, who are liable <hi>to be to≈øt to and fro, and carried about with every wind,</hi> as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>Now if the Divine Nature were ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to change, this would ca≈øt an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal Cloud upon all the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and ob≈øcure all other Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and make them <hi>like the flower of the field,</hi> which, how gay and glorious ≈øoever, is fading and peri≈øhing; and the greater the Divine Perfections are, the greater Imperfection would mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be; for as <hi>the corruption of the be≈øt things is the wor≈øt,</hi> ≈øo the better any thing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35252:60"/>
is, ≈øo much the wor≈øe it would be to have it liable to Corruption and Change.</p>
            <p>And as mutability in God would darken all his other Perfections, ≈øo would it take away the Foundation and comfort of all Religion; the ground of our Faith, and Hope, and Fear, of our Love and E≈øteem of God would be quite taken away. We could have no great Honour or E≈øteem for a Being that is fickle and incon≈øtant; if his Power and Ju≈øtice were uncertain, his Threatings would in a great mea≈øure lo≈øe their awe and force; if his Truth and Faithfulne≈øs could fail, no Promi≈øes and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how gracious ≈øoever, would be any ≈øecurity or firm ground of Tru≈øt and Confidence.</p>
            <p>And this Rea≈øoning is not the re≈øult of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> but clearly founded in the <hi>natural</hi> Notions and Sugge≈øtions of our Minds, as will appear by citing one or two Te≈øtimonies to this burpo≈øe, of tho≈øe who had no other Guide but Natural Light. <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phoedo</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
<q>Whether the mo≈øt perfect (that is God) be always the ≈øame, or ≈øometimes thus, and ≈øometimes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, that is (≈øaith he) whether that which is Equality and Goodne≈øs and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35252:60"/>

                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in any wi≈øe upon, any account, ≈øubject to any Change or Alteration what≈øoever? To which he an≈øwers, That it is nece≈ø≈øary that he ≈øhould be the ≈øame and always alike.</q>
And <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Repub.</hi> where he lays down the Fundamental Laws and Con≈øtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion, he mentions the≈øe <hi>two</hi> (which one would almo≈øt think he borrow'd from St. <hi>James,</hi> but that he lived ≈øo long before him) <hi>viz.</hi> Fir≈øt,
<q>That God is the Cau≈øe of all good, and and in no wi≈øe of any evil;</q>
an≈øwerab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to what our Apo≈øtle here a≈ø≈øerts, that <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any Man: but that every good and perfect gift is from him.</hi>
Secondly,
<q>That God doth not deceive us, by making various Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him≈øelf to us, ≈øometimes in one form, and ≈øometimes in another; for he is unchangeable and always the ≈øame, and cannot, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, pa≈øs out of his own Idea, or be any other than what he is;</q>
which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35252:61"/>
he further confirms by this excellent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoning,
<q>That which is the be≈øt and mo≈øt perfect Being is not liable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Alteration; but ≈øuch a Being is God, and therefore he cannot be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any thing that is weaker and le≈øs perfect than him≈øelf, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not will to change him≈øelf; for if he ≈øhould, it mu≈øt either be for the better or for the wor≈øe; it cannot be for the better, for being already po≈ø≈øe≈øt of all Perfection, there can be no acce≈ø≈øion of any to him by any change; and certainly there is no Wi≈øe Being, as God is, that will change for the wor≈øe,</q>
and therefore he concludes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>,
<q>That being the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie≈øt and be≈øt Being that is po≈ø≈øible, he always continues ≈øimply the ≈øame.</q>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> likewi≈øe ≈øpeaking of the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of God's Coun≈øels (<hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>de Benef.) Statuerunt</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>quae non mutarent, neque unquam primi con≈øilii Deos poenitet,</hi>
               <q>The Gods make unchangeable decrees, and never repent them of their fir≈øt coun≈øel.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This will yet more clearly appear from the Divine Revelation of the Holy Scriptures, which tell us that God
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35252:61"/>
is <hi>unchangeable</hi> in his Nature and in his Perfections, in all his Decrees and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes and Promi≈øes. In his <hi>e≈ø≈øence</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> Exod. 3.14. <hi>I am that I am,</hi> this is his Name, whereby he made known him≈øelf to the comfort of his People, and to the terrour of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øors. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 90.2. <hi>From everla≈øting to everla≈øting thou art God.</hi> P≈øal. 102.27. <hi>Thou art the ≈øame, and thy years fail not.</hi> Mat. 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord and change not.</hi> Hence it is that the Title of <hi>the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God</hi> is ≈øo frequently attributed to him; and he ≈øwears by this, as denoting not only his <hi>eternity,</hi> but his <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablene≈øs; As I live, ≈øaith the Lord.</hi> Hither likewi≈øe we may refer tho≈øe Texts where he is call'd the <hi>incorruptible God,</hi> Rom. 1.23; <hi>The immortal King,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17; and is ≈øaid <hi>only to have immortality,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16. And he is immutable likewi≈øe in his <hi>perfections</hi>; hence it is ≈øo often ≈øaid in the <hi>P≈øalms,</hi> that <hi>his goodne≈øs</hi> and <hi>his mercy endure for ever; his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs</hi> likewi≈øe is ≈øaid <hi>to endure for ever.</hi> P≈øal. 111.3. and P≈øal. 36.6; <hi>To be like the great Mountains,</hi> not only <hi>vi≈øible</hi> and <hi>con≈øpicuous,</hi> but <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>immoveable</hi>; and the ≈øame likewi≈øe is ≈øaid of his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulne≈øs,</hi> P≈øal. 117.2. <hi>His truth

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:35252:62"/>III. Thing I propo≈øed, which is to an≈øwer an Objection, which may ≈øeem to lie again≈øt what hath been ≈øaid, from the mention ≈øo often made in Scripture of <hi>God's repenting him≈øelf</hi>; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. where it is ≈øaid that <hi>it repented God that he had made Man</hi>; 1 Sam. 15.11. That <hi>he repented that he had made Saul King</hi>; and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16. When <hi>the Angel had ≈øtretched out his hand over Jeru≈øalem to de≈øtroy it,</hi> it is ≈øaid that <hi>the Lord repented him of the evil</hi>; and <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 135.14. the Lord ≈øaith there that <hi>he will repent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf concerning his ≈øervants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I an≈øwer, That this expre≈ø≈øion of <hi>God's repenting</hi> we are to under≈øtand (as many others in Scripture) after the manner of Men, and as ≈øpoken by way of Conde≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Accommodation to our Weakne≈øs and Capacity, and not as ca≈øting any imputation of Mutability and Incon≈øtancy upon God, as if out of levity or for want of fore≈øight, he did alter his Mind; but when God is ≈øaid <hi>to repent that he made Man,</hi> or <hi>that he made Saul King,</hi> the change was not in <hi>him,</hi> but <hi>them</hi>; and it ≈øignifies not that God was ab≈øolutely deceived in his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that things had fallen out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35252:63"/>
to all rea≈øonable Expectation; and therefore the Scripture cloaths God with the Humane Pa≈ø≈øion of <hi>repenting</hi> and <hi>grieving</hi> for what he had done, as Men u≈øe to do when they are greatly di≈øappointed and fall ≈øhort of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
            <p>And as for the other in≈øtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is ≈øaid <hi>to repent him of evils threatned,</hi> the expre≈ø≈øion only ≈øignifies thus much, that God doth not execute that which ≈øeemed to us to have been his peremptory purpo≈øe and re≈øolution, that is, he is plea≈øed to do otherwi≈øe than his threatning ≈øeemed openly to expre≈øs, becau≈øe of ≈øome tacit Condition implyed in it, which he did not think fit to acquaint us with. And this doth not at all derogate from the <hi>con≈øtancy</hi> and <hi>immutability</hi> of God; for when God did threaten, he ≈øpake what he did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purpo≈øe and intend, if ≈øomething did not intervene to prevent the Judgment threatned, upon which he was re≈øolved at that time when he threatned, to be taken off and to ≈øtay his Hand; and in thus doing, God doth not <hi>mutare con≈øilium ≈øed ≈øententiam; He doth not change his inward Coun≈øel and Purpo≈øe, but takes off the ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> which was pa≈øt with <hi>re≈øerved
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35252:63"/>
conditions</hi> and <hi>unknown to us,</hi> on purpo≈øe to urge us the more effectually to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>And that God u≈øually re≈øerves ≈øuch Conditions, not only in his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but ≈øometimes al≈øo in his Promi≈øes, appears from that remarkable Text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>At what in≈øtant I ≈øhall ≈øpeak concerning a nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de≈øtroy it; if that nation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt whom I have pronounced, turn from the evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them: at what in≈øtant I ≈øhall ≈øpeak concerning a nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; if it do evil in my ≈øight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I ≈øaid I would benefit them.</hi> And from this very Con≈øideration the ≈øame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet encourageth the People to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God, and the Lord will repent him of the evil he hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced again≈øt you.</hi> And we have a famous in≈øtance of this in the ca≈øe of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> the de≈øtruction whereof within forty days after, God had openly proclaimed by his Prophet; yet he ≈øtops the Execution
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35252:64"/>
of the Sentence upon their Repentance, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.10. <hi>The Men of Niniveh turned from their evil ways, and the Lord repented of the evil he ≈øaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that now remains is to apply this Doctrine of the <hi>immutability of the Divine Nature</hi> to our ≈øelves; and the Con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it may ≈øerve to ≈øeveral good Purpo≈øes, both in reference to bad and good Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> In regard to ≈øinners and wicked Men.</p>
            <p>And, 1<hi>≈øt. The unchangeablene≈øs of God</hi> is matter of great terrour to wicked Men. Let but the ≈øinner con≈øider what God is, and the con≈øideration of his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable nature</hi> mu≈øt need terrifie him; <hi>He is a holy God, and of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.12. <hi>He is not a God that hath plea≈øure in wickedne≈øs, neither ≈øhall evil dwell with him, the fooli≈øh ≈øhall not ≈øtand in his ≈øight, he hateth all the workers of iniquity,</hi> P≈øal. 5.4, 5. <hi>He is</hi> likewi≈øe <hi>a ju≈øt God, and will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> nor <hi>let ≈øin go unpuni≈øht,</hi> Exod. 34.7. <hi>He is</hi> al≈øo <hi>omnipotent,</hi> and able to execute the vengeance threatned again≈øt Sinners. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger</hi>? P≈øal. 90.11. <hi>Thou even thou art to be feared, and who may ≈øtand in <pb n="113" facs="tcp:35252:64"/>
thy ≈øight when once thou art angry.</hi> P≈øal. 76.7. <hi>Strong is the Lord God who judgeth.</hi> Rev. 18.8. And which gives a ≈øad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to all this, he that is thus holy and ju≈øt and powerful, continues <hi>for ever the ≈øame,</hi> and will never alter or put off any of the≈øe Properties, will never cea≈øe to hate iniquity, and to be an implacable Enemy to all impenitent Sinners; and is it not <hi>a fearful thing to fall into the hands of</hi> this holy and ju≈øt and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent <hi>God who lives for ever,</hi> and can <hi>puni≈øh for ever</hi>? Let all ob≈øtinate Sinners hear this and tremble; you cannot be more ob≈øtinately bent to continue in your wicked ways, than God is perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily re≈øolved to make you mi≈øerable. If you be determined upon a ≈øinful cour≈øe; God is al≈øo determined how he will deal with you, that <hi>he will not ≈øpare,</hi> but <hi>that his anger and jealou≈øie ≈øhall ≈ømoke again≈øt you,</hi> and that <hi>all the cur≈øes that are written in his book ≈øhall light upon you,</hi> and that <hi>he will blot out your name from under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he hath ≈øworn in his wrath, that</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and impenitent Sinners <hi>≈øhall not enter into his re≈øt</hi>; and for the greater a≈ø≈øurance of the thing, and that we may not think, that there is any condition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the≈øe Threatnings, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35252:65"/>
them by <hi>an Oath,</hi> that by this <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> ≈øign, <hi>in which it is impo≈ø≈øible for God to lie,</hi> Sinners might have <hi>≈øtrong terrours,</hi> and not be able <hi>to fly</hi> to any in hopes of <hi>refuge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> The con≈øideration of Gods <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablene≈øs,</hi> ≈øhould likewi≈øe be a very powerful Argument to urge Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Repententance. If they will but leave their ≈øins and turn to him, they will find him ready to receive them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Repentance and Submi≈ø≈øion; for <hi>he is a God gracious and merciful, ≈ølow to anger and ready to forgive,</hi> he is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably good,</hi> and <hi>his mercy endureth for ever</hi>: but if they will not come in, and ≈øubmit to the≈øe Terms, there is nothing before them but Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, nothing then <hi>remains but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation to con≈øume them.</hi> God hath declared to us the terms of our Pardon and Peace, and if we will not come up to them, he is at a point, he cannot change his Nature, nor will he alter the terms of his Covenant; there is a perfect and eternal oppo≈øition between the Holy Nature of God, and an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ≈øinner; and 'tis impo≈ø≈øible ≈øuch an one ≈øhould be Happy, till this oppo≈øition be remov'd; and to do that, there are but <hi>two</hi> ways imaginable, by <hi>changing God</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:35252:65"/>
or by <hi>changing our ≈øelves</hi>; the Nature of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>unalterable</hi>; God cannot recede from his own pure Nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>we</hi> mu≈øt depart from our ≈øinful and corrupt Nature: God cannot quit his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; therefore we mu≈øt leave our Sins: we can have no hope <hi>to change God</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we mu≈øt <hi>change our ≈øelves.</hi> Rectifie Sinner thine own corrupt Nature, and renounce thy lu≈øts, do not venture upon Impo≈ø≈øibilities, rather think of altering <hi>thy ≈øinful nature,</hi> which <hi>may be changed,</hi> than of altering <hi>the Divine Nature,</hi> which is <hi>e≈ø≈øentially immutable, with whom is no variablene≈øs nor ≈øhadow of turning.</hi> God hath once conde≈øcended ≈øo far, as <hi>to take our nature upon him,</hi> to make us capable of Happine≈øs; but if this will not do, he can go no lower, he will not, he cannot <hi>put off his own nature</hi> to make us Happy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In reference to Good Men, the con≈øideration of Gods <hi>unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs</hi> is matter of great Con≈øolation to them, in all the changes and vici≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the World; their main com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and hope is built upon a Rock, <hi>the rock of ages,</hi> as the expre≈ø≈øion is in the Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> 26.4. it relies upon the <hi>unchangeable</hi> goodne≈øs and faithfulne≈øs of God, <hi>all who≈øe promi≈øes are Yea and Amen</hi> truth and certainty. All other Support,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35252:66"/>
and Hopes may fail us: but <hi>God will not ≈øuffer his faithfulne≈øs to fail, his covenant will he not break, nor alter the thing which is gone out of his lips,</hi> as the P≈øalmi≈øt a≈ø≈øures us, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 89.33. Men may break their Word, and be le≈øs than their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes: but <hi>God is faithful, who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to give grace and glory, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold no good thing from them that walk uprightly; he is not as Man, that he ≈øhould lie, or as the Son of Man that he ≈øhould repent; hath he ≈øpoken and ≈øhall he not do it? hath he ≈øaid it, and ≈øhall not he bring it to pa≈øs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any thing that hath the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a change in God, it is u≈øual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the <hi>merciful</hi> ≈øide, as when he ≈øtops the execution of his threatnings upon the repentance of a ≈øinful Nation; as in that remarkable Text which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd before, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8. <hi>At what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant I ≈øhall ≈øpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de≈øtroy it, if that nation again≈øt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them</hi>; and ≈øo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe when his faithful People and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are in great Di≈øtre≈øs, and there is no vi≈øible help and means of relief, in this ca≈øe likewi≈øe God is ≈øaid <hi>to repent</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:35252:66"/>
and to appear for their re≈øcue, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36. <hi>The Lord ≈øhall judge his people, and repent him≈øelf for his ≈øervants, when he ≈øeeth that their power is gone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ≈øhould comfort our ≈øelves in the greate≈øt extremities, with the con≈øideration of the <hi>immutable</hi> goodne≈øs and faithfulne≈øs of God. The things of the World are Mutable, and the Men of the World; even tho≈øe things which ≈øeem mo≈øt con≈øtant, as the Heavens; and to be ≈øetled upon the ≈øure≈øt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, as the Earth; yet the≈øe ≈øhall be changed, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 102.25, 26, 27. <hi>Of old ha≈øt thou laid the foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thy hands, they ≈øhall peri≈øh, but thou ≈øhalt endure, all of them ≈øhall wax old like a garment, as a ve≈øture ≈øhall thou change them, and they ≈øhalt be changed, but thou art the ≈øame, and thy years ≈øhall have no end</hi>; from whence the P≈øalmi≈øt infers this comfort to the Church and People of God, <hi>v.</hi> 28, <hi>The Children of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ≈øhall continue, and their ≈øeed ≈øhall be e≈øtabli≈øht before thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing that is mutable can be a ≈øolid Foundation of Comfort and Confidence. Men are incon≈øtant, and Riches are uncertain, and all other things which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35252:67"/>
Men commonly tru≈øt to, and therefore the Apo≈øtle <hi>chargeth them that are Rich in this World, not to tru≈øt in uncertain Riches, but in the living God.</hi> He only that <hi>lives for ever</hi> is a firm Foundation of Hope and Confidence.</p>
            <p>When God would comfort the <hi>I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> under their great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, he bids <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> only to declare to them his <hi>immutability, Exod.</hi> 3.14. Say unto them, <hi>I am that I am, hath ≈øent me unto you</hi>; and this is the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Chri≈øtians, that <hi>he</hi> who is <hi>the ≈øame Saviour,</hi> and <hi>their hope,</hi> is <hi>the ≈øame ye≈øterday, to day, and for ever; he that was, and that is, and that is to come,</hi> in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>We are continually changing, and are not the ≈øame we were; ≈øome of us were Young and now are Old; once perhaps flouri≈øht in great Pro≈øperity, but now are Poor and Needy; were once Strong and Healthful, but now Sickly and Weak; it ≈øhould comfort us in all the≈øe Changes, that <hi>God is ≈øtill the ≈øame,</hi> and he alone is in≈øtead of all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Supports, when all other things fail, we may <hi>rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of our Salvation.</hi> Youth, and Health, and Riches, and Friends,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35252:67"/>
may for≈øake us; but God hath promi≈øed, that <hi>he will never leave us nor for≈øake us</hi>; that <hi>he will not leave us when we are old, nor for≈øake us when our ≈øtrength faileth,</hi> when <hi>our ≈øtrength fails,</hi> and <hi>our heart fails,</hi> then is he <hi>the ≈øtrength of our hearts,</hi> and <hi>our portion for ever</hi>; and when our great change ≈øhall come, and the terrors of Death ≈øhall take hold of us, we have ≈øtill the ≈øame Comfort, <hi>the Lord liveth, and ble≈ø≈øed be the God of our Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, the Con≈øideration of God's <hi>immutability</hi> ≈øhould keep us fixt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in all the Changes and Accidents of this World, and not apt to be ≈øtartled and ≈øurprized at them, according to that of the P≈øalmi≈øt, <hi>he ≈øhall not be afraid of evil tidings, becau≈øe his heart is fixed, tru≈øting in God.</hi> This ≈øhould make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant to him and his truth, <hi>≈øtedfa≈øt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable and always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as we know, that our labour ≈øhall not be in vain in the Lord</hi>; it ≈øhould make us <hi>hold fa≈øt the profe≈ø≈øion of our faith without wavering,</hi> in full a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that <hi>God will be as good to us as his word,</hi> and in a firm <hi>hope</hi> and per≈øwa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of that Eternal Life, which God that cannot lie hath promi≈øed.</hi>

of the Re≈øpects and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things one to another; of their Harmony and Oppo≈øition; of their fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and unfitne≈øs to ≈øuch and ≈øuch Ends.

               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> For the proof of it, I ≈øhall attempt it <hi>two</hi> ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the Dictates of Natural Light and Rea≈øon.</item>
               <item>2. From Scripture or Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. From the Dictates of Natural Light and Rea≈øon. I begin with this fir≈øt, becau≈øe, unle≈øs this be e≈øtabli≈øh'd, all Divine Revelation falls to the ground; unle≈øs Natural Rea≈øon a≈ø≈øures us, That God is endowed with <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtanding,</hi> it is in vain to enquire after Divine Revelation. For to make any Revelation credible, two things are requi≈øite on the part of the Revealer, <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi>; that he have a perfect <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the thing which he reveals, ≈øo that he cannot be deceived him≈øelf; and ≈øo much Goodne≈øs and Truth that he will not deceive us. Now unle≈øs our Rea≈øon a≈ø≈øure us that God is endowed with <hi>Knowledg and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtanding,</hi> the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Condition is evidently wanting, <hi>viz. Ability,</hi> and con≈øequently the <hi>≈øecond, Integrity</hi>; for there cannot be goodne≈øs and veracity without <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being premi≈øed, I proceed to the proof of it from ≈øuch Arguments as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35252:70"/>
our Natural Rea≈øon ≈øugge≈øts to us. I have formerly told you, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Perfections</hi> are not to be proved by way of <hi>Demon≈øtration,</hi> but by way of <hi>Conviction,</hi> by ≈øhewing the Ab≈øurdities and Inconveniencies of the contrary; for if we deny Knowledge to God, we mu≈øt deny it to be a Perfection; we mu≈øt deny it to be in any of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; we mu≈øt attribute many other Imperfections to God; all which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd to our Natural Rea≈øon; for Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rea≈øon dictates to us, That Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a Perfection, that it is to be found in the Creatures, and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it to God will argue many other Imperfections in the Divine Nature; now the≈øe are ≈øo many Arguments which Natural Rea≈øon offers to us to prove, that <hi>knowledge belongs to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a Perfection, and therefore belongs to God. Natural Rea≈øon tells us, tho' the Scripture had not ≈øaid it, That <hi>Knowledge excells Ignorance, as much as Light doth Darkne≈øs</hi>; now whatever is <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Excellent,</hi> is to be attributed to the Divine Nature, for this is the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Notion we have of God, That He is <hi>a Being ab≈øolutely Perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:35252:70"/>2. Knowledge is to be found in ≈øome of the Creatures, and therefore is much more in God the Creator, becau≈øe it is derived from him. Our very Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandings whereby we know God, or any thing el≈øe, are an Argument that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtanding</hi> are in God. If <hi>he gives wi≈ødom to the wi≈øe, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to them that know <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtanding,</hi> if he communicates this Perfection to the Creatures, he him≈øelf is much more po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øt of it. The Scripture indeed u≈øeth this Argument, but I mention it as that which Natural Rea≈øon doth ≈øugge≈øt to the mo≈øt bruti≈øh and ignorant of Men. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 94.8, 9, 10. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtand ye Bruti≈øh among the People, and ye Fools when will ye be wi≈øe? he that planted the Ear, ≈øhall he not hear? he that formed the Eye, ≈øhall he not ≈øee?</hi>

≈øo God is ≈øaid <hi>to ≈øearch the heart,</hi> to ≈øignifie to us that he knows the hearts of Men, as throughly as we do any thing upon the ≈øtricte≈øt Search and mo≈øt diligent Examination; upon the ≈øame account he is ≈øaid el≈øewhere in Scripture <hi>to weigh the Spirits of Men,</hi> Prov. 16.2. <hi>All the ways of Man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weigheth the Spirits</hi>; that is, he hath as perfect a Knowledge of the ≈øecret Motions and Inclinations of Mens hearts, as Men have of tho≈øe things which they weigh in a Ballance with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt exactne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Now that God hath this perfect Knowledge of Mens hearts, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture frequently declares to us; that he knows the hearts of all Men, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.39. <hi>For thou, even thou knowe≈øt the hearts of all the Children of Men.</hi> 1 Chron. 28.9. <hi>The Lord ≈øearcheth all hearts, and under≈øtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.</hi> How clo≈øe and re≈øerved ≈øoever Men may be, what di≈øgui≈øe ≈øoever they may u≈øe to hide their purpo≈øes from Men, yet God ≈øees them; the things which are mo≈øt dark and ≈øecret are open to his view, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 44.21. <hi>He knoweth the ≈øecrets of the hearts,</hi>

Now the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt place, the mo≈øt inward retirement, the private≈øt Clo≈øet in the whole World, is the Heart of Man, and this God only is privy to; <hi>Deus autor omnium &amp; ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culator omnium, √† quo nihil ≈øecretum e≈ø≈øe pote≈øt, tenebris intere≈øt, intere≈øt &amp; cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus no≈øtris qua≈øi alteris tenebris,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Min. Foelix, God made all things, and ≈øees all things, and therefore nothing can be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from him; he is pre≈øent in Darkne≈øs, and he is pre≈øent to the Thoughts of Men, which are as it were another</hi> and a thicker <hi>Darkne≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Devil indeed pretends to this Knowledge; he would take upon him to know the integrity of <hi>Job</hi>'s Heart better than God him≈øelf, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding the Te≈øtimony which God gave of his Integrity, yet if he were but ≈øoundly tried by Affliction, he would renounce God, and cur≈øe him to his face: but the event proved how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs and malicious this ≈øugge≈øtion was. But there is a far greater difficulty in this matter, from the pa≈ø≈øages of ≈øome Divines concerning the Devil's imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate acce≈øs to the Minds of Men, and <pb n="142" facs="tcp:35252:79"/>
his Power to ca≈øt in Wicked Thoughts into them; which ≈øeems by con≈øequence to grant him ≈øome knowledge of Mens Hearts; for by the ≈øame Rea≈øon that he can imprint Thoughts upon Mens Minds, he may ≈øee tho≈øe that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed there.</p>
            <p>That the Devil is a very ≈øagacious Spirit, and can make very ≈øhrewd Conjectures at the bent and inclinations of Mens Minds, and the probable workings of our Thoughts, from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Knowledge and Ob≈øervation of our Tempers and Pa≈ø≈øions, of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øts and De≈øigns, and from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tenour of our Actions in Publick and Private, and from our Prayers and Confe≈ø≈øions to God (if he permit him at any time to be ≈øo near Good Men) I think there is no doubt: but this is far from a Knowledge of our Hearts; all this is but Conjecture, and ≈øuch as men may make of one another in a lower degree.</p>
            <p>But as to the bu≈øine≈øs of ca≈øting in bla≈øphemous and de≈øpairing Thoughts into the Minds of Men, to this I would ≈øay the≈øe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there are few of the≈øe ca≈øes which may not more probably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35252:79"/>
into the Wickedne≈øs and Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mens Hearts, or into the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Melancholy of our tempers, which are apt to rai≈øe and ≈øugge≈øt ≈øtrange Thoughts to Men, and ≈øuch as we may be apt to think have no ri≈øe from our ≈øelves, not con≈øidering what an odd and ≈øtrange influence the di≈øorder of our bodily Humours may have upon our Minds, as we ≈øee in violent Fevers, and ≈øeveral other Di≈øea≈øes; and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> tho' the workings of it are more ≈øtill and quiet, is as truly a <hi>Di≈øea≈øe</hi> as any other; ≈øo that I chu≈øe rather to a≈øcribe as much of the≈øe to a bodily Di≈øtemper as may be, becau≈øe it is a very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable con≈øideration, to think that the Devil hath ≈øuch an immediate Power upon the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do not ≈øee how by any means it can be granted, without prejudice to this Prerogative of God, which the Scripture plainly gives him, of being <hi>the only Knower of the Heart,</hi> that the Devil can have ≈øo immediate an acce≈øs to our Minds, as to put wicked Thoughts into them; nor can I think, that when it is ≈øaid, 1 Chron. 21.1. That <hi>Satan provoked David to number the people,</hi> and Luke 22.3. That <hi>the devil entred into Judas,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:35252:80"/>
and Acts 5.3. That <hi>Satan had filled the heart of Ananias to lie unto the Holy Gho≈øt,</hi> and Eph. 2.2. That <hi>the devil is the ≈øpirit that worketh in the children of di≈øobedience</hi>; I ≈øay I cannot think that any or all of the≈øe expre≈ø≈øions do amount to ≈øuch an immediate power of putting wicked Thoughts into Mens Minds, but they only ≈øignifie that the Devil hath a greater hand in ≈øome ≈øins than others, and that a Heart wickedly bent and inclined give him a great advantage to tempt Men more powerfully, by pre≈øenting the occa≈øions of ≈øuck wicked Thoughts and Actions to them; for it is u≈øual in Scripture-phra≈øe, as to a≈øcribe all good Motions to God's Spirit, ≈øo all evil Thoughts and Actions to the Devil, not that he is the immediate Cau≈øe of them, but becau≈øe he is always ready to tempt Men to them, and one way or other to promote them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ≈øee no Rea≈øon to grant (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have done) an immediate Power to the Devil over the fancies and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, and that he may know the workings of them, tho' not the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts of Mens Minds; for this ≈øeems to me to be in effect to grant him
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35252:80"/>
the Knowledge of Mens Hearts, and to give him a Key to that Clo≈øet which God hath re≈øerved to him≈øelf: for it is a very nice Di≈øtinction which is here made between the Thoughts of Mens Minds, and the Images of their Fancies; and if the≈øe ≈øhould happen to be but words that ≈øignifie the ≈øame thing, we ≈øhall unawares intrench upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of God. Therefore becau≈øe the Scripture is a ≈øtranger to the≈øe nice and ≈øubtile di≈øtinctions between the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Fancy, and the Thoughts of the Heart, I think it is much ≈øafer to a≈ø≈øert the Prerogative of God in that latitude that the Scripture u≈øeth the word <hi>heart,</hi> for all the inward motions of the Mind, for the Thoughts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Heart, and roundly to affirm that all the inward motions of our Souls are totally exempt from the immediate cognizance of any other Spirit but God's alone; and that neither Angel nor Devil hath any further Knowledge of them, than may be collected and inferr'd in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjecture from the particular Knowledge of Mens Tempers and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and De≈øigns, and the Cour≈øe of their Actions. I proceed to the</p>

            </p>
            <p>I know they did variou≈øly explain this, according to their ≈øeveral Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Contingency,</hi> and their Apprehen≈øions about the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of God.

call them ≈øo, were Fore-known to God. And for this I ≈øhall only cite one Te≈øtimony of <hi>Seneca,</hi> ≈øpeaking of God's Fore-knowledge of the mo≈øt contingent things, the Di≈øpo≈øitions of Men long before they are Born; he adds, <hi>nota e≈øt enim illis operis ≈øui ≈øeries, omni√∫mque illis rerum per manus ≈øuas iturarum ≈øcientia in aperto ≈øemper e≈øt; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ex abdito ≈øubit; &amp; quae repentina pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus, illis provi≈øa veniunt &amp; familiaria</hi>; and how peremptory ≈øoever this Sect is in their di≈øputes about <hi>Fate,</hi> yet when they ≈øpeak of the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I Have con≈øider'd this Perfection of God, in ≈øome of the greate≈øt and mo≈øt difficult in≈øtances of it, his Knowledge of the mo≈øt ≈øecret Things, the hearts of Men, and future Events; again≈øt the la≈øt of which there are ≈øome Objections, which I come now briefly to con≈øider, and pa≈øs on to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> the <hi>Fir≈øt</hi>; The <hi>impo≈ø≈øibility</hi> of the thing. Certainty of all Knowledge depends upon the certainty of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, therefore there cannot be a certain and determinate Knowledge of any thing, but what is certainly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately true; but future Events,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35252:85"/>
which may or may not be, have no certain and determinate Truth, that is, it is not certain either that they will or will not be, becau≈øe they have no certain Cau≈øe, therefore there can be no infallible Knowledge concerning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øwer,</hi> This I confe≈øs is the grand Difficulty; I ≈øhall not be ≈øo ≈øolicitous to take it away, as to give ≈øatisfaction to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I might ≈øay with a very fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that the certainty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth not depend upon the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Cau≈øe,</hi> but of the <hi>Object,</hi> which may be certain, tho' the <hi>Cau≈øe</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent. Which I prove thus, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Event hath actually happened, as becau≈øe now it is pa≈øt, it is certainly true that <hi>it was,</hi> ≈øo becau≈øe it once was, it was certainly true before it was, that <hi>it would be</hi>; as in <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying of Chri≈øt. If it be now true that <hi>he hath denied him,</hi> it was true before, that <hi>he would deny him</hi>; and it being determinately true, God ≈øaw it <hi>as it was</hi>; ≈øo that here is an <hi>Object</hi> of a certain Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho' we could not explain the po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of God's knowing future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, much le≈øs the manner how; yet we are ≈øufficiently a≈ø≈øured that God doth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35252:85"/>
know them. I will give but one in≈øtance for the Proof of this. Nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi>; yet God fore-knew this; how el≈øe was Chri≈øt <hi>decreed before the Foundation of the World?</hi> Chri≈øt was a remedy upon the occa≈øion of ≈øin, now the remedy could not be de≈øigned before the ≈øin was fore≈øeen: and this being certain, <hi>cum con≈øtat de re, fru≈øtra inquiritur de modo, when we are certain of the thing, 'tis not nece≈ø≈øary to know the manner.</hi> We are ≈øatisfied of many things, the manner whereof we do not know; we believe the union of the Soul and Body, tho' no Man can explain how a Spirit can be united to Matter; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the continuity of matter, that is, that the parts of it hang together, of which who≈øoever ≈øaith he can give an account, doth but betray his own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And ≈øo in many other things; that Man doth not know him≈øelf, nor the mea≈øure of his own under≈øtanding, nor the nature and ob≈øcurity of things, that will not confe≈øs him≈øelf po≈øed in many things, that doth not acknowledge that there are many <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, many things the manner whereof is unimagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and of which our be≈øt Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding can give no account.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:35252:86"/>3. 'Tis very unrea≈øonable to expect we ≈øhould know all the ways which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Knowledge hath of knowing things. We have but finite Faculties and Mea≈øures, which bear no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to infinite Powers and Objects. Could we explain the manner how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Knowledge knows things, we ≈øhould be <hi>like God in Knowledge,</hi> our under≈øtandings would be infinite like his; and in this ca≈øe e≈øpecially it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to put on the mode≈øty of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to remember that we are finite and limited. Some arrogant Spirits take it for an affront to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtandings, that any one ≈øhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they ≈øhould believe any thing, tho' they have the highe≈øt a≈ø≈øurance of it, if they cannot explain the particular manner of it; they make nothing to deny God's Knowledge of future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, unle≈øs they may be ≈øatisfied of the particular way how he knows them.</p>
            <p>I know there are tho≈øe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to explain the particular manner.

to all Space, and ≈øo God doth not ≈øo properly <hi>fore-≈øee</hi> and <hi>fore-know,</hi> as <hi>≈øee</hi> and <hi>know</hi> future things by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentiality and coexi≈øtence of all things in Eternity; for they ≈øay that future things are actually pre≈øent and exi≈øting to God, tho' not in <hi>men≈øur√¢ propri√¢,</hi> yet in <hi>men≈øur√¢ alien√¢</hi>; the School-men have much more of this Jargon and canting Language; and I envy no Man the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding the≈øe Phra≈øes, but to me they ≈øeem to ≈øignifie nothing, but to have been words invented by idle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Men, which a great many ever ≈øince, le≈øt they ≈øhould ≈øeem to be ignorant, would ≈øeem to under≈øtand; but I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mo≈øt, that Men, when they have amu≈øed and puzzled them≈øelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with hard Words, ≈øhould call this <hi>explaining</hi> things.</p>
            <p>The ≈øum of the An≈øwer is this; that when we have done all we can, God's fore-knowledge of future Events may ≈øeem contradictious and impo≈ø≈øible to us, much le≈øs do I expect ever to be able to give a particular account of the manner of it: but we have ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent a≈ø≈øurance of the thing, and unle≈øs we had infinite under≈øtandings, it were vanity to pretend to explain all the ways of infinite Knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:35252:87"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is Objected, That if we can admit ≈øuch a Knowledge in God as ≈øeems contradictious and impo≈ø≈øible to our Rea≈øon, why may we not allow and frame ≈øuch Notions of his Goodne≈øs and Ju≈øtice?</p>
            <p>To this I an≈øwer, There is a great difference between tho≈øe Perfections of God which are imitable, and tho≈øe which are not. Knowledge of future Events is a Perfection wherein we are not bound to be like God; and if we are a≈ø≈øured of the thing, that he doth know them, it is not nece≈ø≈øary that we ≈øhould know the manner of it, and di≈ø-intangle it from contradiction and impo≈ø≈øibility; but it is otherwi≈øe in God's Goodne≈øs and Ju≈øtice, which are imitable; he that imitates, endeavours to be like ≈øomething that he knows, and we mu≈øt have a clear Idea and Notion of that which we would bring our ≈øelves to the likene≈øs of; the≈øe Perfections of God we are capable of knowing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Knowledge of the≈øe Perfections is chiefly recommended to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24. By the≈øe God reveals him≈øelf, and declares his Name, and makes him≈øelf known to us, even by tho≈øe Attributes which declare his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:35252:87"/>
Goodne≈øs, and Mercy, and Ju≈øtice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 86.15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.3, 4, 5. When God would give a De≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him≈øelf to <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> he promi≈øes <hi>to cau≈øe his goodne≈øs to pa≈øs before him.</hi> So that it doth not follow, that becau≈øe God's Knowledge of future Events is to be admitted, notwith≈øtanding the ≈øeeming contradiction and impo≈ø≈øibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, therefore we are to admit of any Notion of God's Ju≈øtice or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs that ≈øeems contradictious or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible. The</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third,</hi> Objection is made up of ≈øeveral inconveniencies that would follow from God's Knowledge of future Events.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It would Prejudice the Liberty of the Creature. For if God have an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Knowledge of what we will do, then we cannot but do what he infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fore≈øees we will do; for otherwi≈øe his Knowledge would be fallible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øwer,</hi> God's-Fore-knowledge lays no nece≈ø≈øity upon the Event. In every Event, we may con≈øider the Effect <hi>in it ≈øelf,</hi> or with relation to the <hi>Cau≈øe,</hi> and the manner how it comes to pa≈øs; con≈øider'd <hi>in it ≈øelf,</hi> it is <hi>future,</hi> with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its <hi>Cau≈øes</hi> it is <hi>contingent.</hi> God ≈øees it as <hi>both,</hi> and ≈øo, as that which till it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35252:88"/>
is, may be or not be; and when it comes to pa≈øs, he ≈øees the Man do it freely; and ≈øo before it be done, it hath no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity; but upon ≈øuppo≈øition of fore-≈øight; as <hi>when it is,</hi> it hath upon ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition <hi>that it is,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> excellently explains it. Fore-knowledge is not <hi>the cau≈øe</hi> of the things that are fore-known; but becau≈øe the thing is future and ≈øhall be, this is the Rea≈øon why it is fore-known; for it doth not, becau≈øe it was known, come to pa≈øs; but becau≈øe it was to come to pa≈øs, therefore it was fore-known; and bare Knowledge is no more the Cau≈øe of any Event, which becau≈øe it is known mu≈øt infallibly be, than my ≈øeeing a Man run, is the Cau≈øe of his running, which, becau≈øe I do ≈øee, is infallibly ≈øo.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> If God infallibly fore-knows what Men will do, how can he be ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Exhortations to Repentance, in his Expectation of it, and his griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Impenitency of Men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øwer.</hi> All the≈øe are founded in the liberty of our Actions. God exhorts to Repentance and expects it, becau≈øe by his Grace we may do it; he is ≈øaid to grieve for our Impenitency, becau≈øe we may do otherwi≈øe, and will not. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35252:88"/>
are not vain in them≈øelves, but very proper to their end, tho' through our ob≈øtinacy and hardne≈øs they may be rendred vain to us and without effect. If the weight of the Objection lie upon <hi>≈øerious,</hi> and you ask how God can exhort Men <hi>≈øeriou≈øly</hi> to that which he fore-≈øees that they will not do, tho≈øe whom he fore-knows will be finally impenitent? I an≈øwer, if his Exhortations were not <hi>≈øerious,</hi> he could not fore≈øee the final impenitency of Men. To fore≈øee Mens final impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, is to fore≈øee their willful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods Warnings and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Rejection of his Grace; now Mens willful contempt of his Warnings and Exhortations cannot be fore≈øeen, unle≈øs God fore≈øee that his Exhortations are <hi>≈øerious</hi> and in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt.</p>
            <p>Having an≈øwer'd the Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt God's fore-knowing future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, I proceed to ≈øhew,</p>
            <p n="2">II. That God only knows future Events. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 44.6, 7. <hi>Thus ≈øaith the Lord, the King of I≈ørael, and his Redeemer the Lord of Ho≈øts, I am the fir≈øt, and I am the la≈øt, and be≈øides me there is no God: and who, as I, ≈øhall call, and ≈øhall declare
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35252:89"/>
it, and ≈øet it in order for me, ≈øince I appointed the ancient People, and the things that are coming, and ≈øhall come? let them ≈øhew unto them.</hi> I≈øa. 46.9, 10. <hi>Remember the former things of old, for I am God, and there is none el≈øe. I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, ≈øaying my coun≈øel ≈øhall ≈øtand, and I will do all my plea≈øure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rea≈øon is evident, becau≈øe the Knowledge of future Events is beyond the reach of any finite under≈øtanding; e≈øpecially if we grant it to be beyond our finite under≈øtanding, to explain the po≈ø≈øibility of ≈øuch a Knowledge; for to be ≈øure that is out of the reach of our Knowledge, which we cannot ≈øo much as under≈øtand how it is po≈ø≈øible it ≈øhould be known by any Under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But it may here be Objected; Did not the Oracles among the Heathens fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel ≈øeveral things, which Chri≈øtians are ≈øatisfied came from the Devil? I have no time at pre≈øent to examine the bu≈øine≈øs of Heathen Oracles; I could ea≈øily ≈øhew there was much impo≈øture in them: but grant they were really
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35252:89"/>
delivered and given out by a Spirit; yet the darkne≈øs and ambiguity, the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contrived ambiguity, is ≈øuch as ≈øhews that the Devil was con≈øcious to him≈øelf of the uncertainty of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in tho≈øe matters; and tho≈øe few that came to pa≈øs, and are in any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sen≈øe ≈øaid to be accompli≈øht, were in ≈øuch matters, either wherein prudent Conjecture might go far (and I grant the Devil to be a ≈øagacious Spirit;) or el≈øe in di≈ø-junctive Ca≈øes, as when there are but two ways for a thing to be, it mu≈øt either be ≈øo, or ≈øo, in which a bold gue≈ø≈øing may often hit right: but <hi>gue≈ø≈øing</hi> at future things, is far from <hi>a Knowledge</hi> of them, which only can clearly be made out by punctual and particular Predictions of Things, with Circum≈øtances of Time and Per≈øon, ≈øuch as we find in Scripture in many in≈øtances, to the prediction of which, the greate≈øt ≈øagacity and the utmo≈øt gue≈ø≈øing could do nothing, ≈øuch as tho≈øe Predictions of which I gave in≈øtances out of Scripture.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the <hi>Fir≈øt</hi> general Head, I propos'd to be ≈øpoken to from the≈øe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove that this
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:35252:90"/>
Attribute of <hi>Knowledge</hi> belongs to God. I proceed to the,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> viz. To con≈øider the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Prerogative of the Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to in the≈øe following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's Knowledge is <hi>Pre≈øent</hi> and <hi>Actual,</hi> his Eye is always open, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is in the view of it. The Knowledge of the Creature is more <hi>Power</hi> than <hi>Act</hi>; it is not much that we are capable of knowing, but there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little that we do actually know; 'tis but one thing that we can fix our Thoughts upon at once, and apply our Minds to; we can remove them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Object, but then we mu≈øt take off our Minds from the former, and quit the actual knowledge of it: but the knowledge of God is an actual and ≈øteady Comprehen≈øion of things, he being every where pre≈øent, and all eye, nothing can e≈øcape his ≈øight, but all Objects are at once in the view of the Divine Under≈øtanding. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Neither is there any Creature that is not manife≈øt in his ≈øight: but all things are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:35252:90"/>2. God's Knowledge is an <hi>intimate</hi> and <hi>thorough</hi> Knowledge, whereby he knows the very Nature and E≈ø≈øence of things. The Knowledge which we have of things 'tis but in part, but outward and ≈øuperficial; our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge glides upon the ≈øuperficies of things, but doth not penetrate into the intimate Nature of them, it ≈øeldom reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth further than the skin and outward appearance of things; we do not know things in their realities, but as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and are repre≈øented to us with all their Masks and Di≈øgui≈øes: but God knows things as they are. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. <hi>The Lord ≈øeeth not as Man ≈øeeth; for Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the Heart</hi>; God knows things throughout, all that can be known of them. The quick and piercing Eye of God Penetrates into every thing, the light of the Divine Under≈øtanding lays all things <hi>open and naked,</hi> Heb. 4.13. In which expre≈ø≈øion the Apo≈øtle alludes to the Sacrifices of Bea≈øts, which were flead and cleft down the back bone, that the Prie≈øt might look into them, and ≈øee whether they were without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øh. To the Eye of our under≈øtandings mo≈øt Objects are clo≈øe, and have their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:35252:91"/>
Skins upon them: but to the Eyes of God all things are uncovered and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øected, and he open to his view.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God's Knowledge is <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>di≈øtinct.</hi> Our Under≈øtandings in the Knowledge of things are liable to great confu≈øion; we are often deceived with the near likene≈øs and re≈øemblance of things, and mi≈øtake one thing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; our Knowledge is but a twi-light, which doth not ≈øufficiently ≈øeparate and di≈øtingui≈øh things from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ≈øee things many times together and in a heap, and do but know them in gro≈øs; but there is no confu≈øion in the Divine Under≈øtanding, <hi>that</hi> is a clear Light which ≈øeparates and di≈øtingui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth things of the greate≈øt nearne≈øs and re≈øemblance; God hath a particular Knowledge of the lea≈øt things, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.7. <hi>Even the very hairs of your Head are all numbred</hi>; tho≈øe things which are of the lea≈øt con≈øideration, and have the greate≈øt likene≈øs to one another, <hi>the very hairs of our Head,</hi> are ≈øeverally and di≈øtinctly known to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God's Knowledge is <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infallible.</hi> We are ≈øubject to doubt and error in our under≈øtanding of things, every thing almo≈øt impo≈øeth upon our
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35252:91"/>
Under≈øtandings, and tinctures our Minds, and makes us look on things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe than they are; our Temper and Complexion, our Education and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, our Intere≈øt and Advantage, our Humours and Di≈øtempers, the≈øe all mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repre≈øent things, and darken our Minds, and ≈øeduce our Judgments, and betray us to Error and Mi≈øtake: but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Under≈øtanding is a clear, fixt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant, and undi≈øturbed Light, a pure Mirrour that receives no ≈øtain from Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or Intere≈øt, or any other thing. Men are many times confident and apt to impo≈øe upon others, as if they were infallible: but this is the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of God, the Priviledge of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Under≈øtanding, that it is ≈øecure from all po≈ø≈øibility of Errour; 'tis <hi>God</hi> only <hi>that cannot lie,</hi> Tit. 1.2. becau≈øe he cannot be deceived; the <hi>infallibility</hi> of God is the Foundation of his <hi>veracity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Knowledge of God is <hi>ea≈øie</hi> and <hi>without difficulty.</hi> We mu≈øt dig deep for Knowledge, take a great deal of pains to know a little; we do not attain the Knowledge of things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øearch and ≈øtudy and great intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mind; we ≈øtrive to comprehend ≈øome things, but they are ≈øo va≈øt that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:35252:92"/>
we cannot; other things are at ≈øuch a di≈øtance, that our Under≈øtanding is too weak to di≈øcern them; other things are ≈øo little, and ≈ømall, and nice, that our Under≈øtanding cannot lay hold of them, we cannot contract our Minds to ≈øuch a Point as to fa≈øten upon them: but the Under≈øtanding of God being infinite, there is nothing at a di≈øtance from it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too great and va≈øt for it's compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion, nor is there any thing ≈øo little that it can e≈øcape his Knowledge and animadver≈øion. The great Wi≈ødom of <hi>Solomon</hi> is compared to <hi>the Sand on the Sea ≈øhore</hi>; the ≈øhore is va≈øt, but the Sands are little (≈øaith one) to ≈øignifie that the va≈øt Mind of <hi>Solomon</hi> did comprehend the lea≈øt things. 'Tis much more true of God, his Under≈øtanding is a va≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion of the lea≈øt things, as well as the greate≈øt; and all this God does without difficulty or pain; he knows all things without ≈øtudy, and his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding is in continual exerci≈øe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wearine≈øs. How many things are there which we cannot find out without ≈øearch, without looking narrowly into, and bending our Minds to under≈øtand them? But all things are obvious to God, and lie open to his view.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:35252:92"/>He is ≈øaid indeed in Scripture <hi>to ≈øearch the Heart,</hi> and <hi>to try the Reins,</hi> and <hi>to weigh the Spirits</hi>; but the≈øe Expre≈ø≈øions do not ≈øignifie the <hi>painfulne≈øs,</hi> but the <hi>perfection</hi> of his Knowledge, that he knows tho≈øe things as perfectly, as we can do any thing about which we u≈øe the greate≈øt diligence and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Knowledge of God is <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal,</hi> and extends to <hi>all Objects.</hi> We know but a few things, our Ignorance is greater than our Knowledge, <hi>maxima pars eorum quae ≈øcimus, e≈øt minima pars eorum que ne≈øcimus</hi>: but the Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding is va≈øt and comprehen≈øive, and by an imperious view commands all Objects; <hi>he is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things</hi>; he knows him≈øelf, and the excellency and perfection of his own Nature, and the ≈øecrets of his Will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The Spirit of God ≈øearcheth the deep things of God</hi>; he knows all other things that are not, and all things that are, in all differences of time, their Powers and Qualities. The Knowledge of God is infinite, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 147.5. <hi>His under≈øtanding is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi>; he knows him≈øelf and his own Perfections, and all the po≈ø≈øibilities of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35252:93"/>
things, which are all infinite. Now the Under≈øtanding of God being infinite is incapable of any Addition, or Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Change. Our finite Under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are liable to alterations, they may grow or decline: but the Knowledge of God is a full con≈øtant Light, 'tis always the ≈øame, not liable to any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clip≈øe, nor capable of any exaltation or improvement, but remains for ever the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I come now to draw ≈øome Inferences from the ≈øeveral parts of this Di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. From the Perfection of God's Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perfection of the Divine Knowledge calls for our Veneration. Every Excellency commands Reverence, and rai≈øeth our admiration, and none more than <hi>Knowledge,</hi> there is nothing that we value our ≈øelves or others more by, than this; the highe≈øt Knowledge of Man, the mo≈øt glorious Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, that ever any one of the Sons of Men were endowed with, is, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Knowledge of God, but as a glow-Worm to the Sun. If we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the≈øe <hi>Candles of the Lord,</hi> which ≈øhine ≈øo imperfectly in the dark; if we reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:35252:93"/>
a little Knowledge, compa≈øs'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ignorance; how ≈øhould we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire <hi>the Father of Lights, in whom is no darkne≈øs at all,</hi> that Knowledge which hath nothing of blemi≈øh or imperfection in it!</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may hence learn Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that on this double Account. As we have all our Knowledge from him; <hi>what have we that we have not received</hi>? And as our Knowledge is very imperfect, when compared with the Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding. We are blind and ignorant, 'tis but a few things that we are capable of knowing; and we know but a few of tho≈øe things which our Natures are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of knowing; and of tho≈øe things we do know, our Knowledge is very imperfect, 'tis ≈ølight and ≈øuperficial, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with much difficulty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in the attaining of it, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and confu≈øion in the u≈øe of it; the cleare≈øt Rea≈øon, and the brighte≈øt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding of Man hath many flaws and defects in it; ≈øo that the more we know of God, and of our ≈øelves, the more humble we ≈øhall be. It is <hi>an empty Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and fal≈øely ≈øo call'd,</hi> that <hi>puffs up</hi>; as the empty ears of Corn are pert and rai≈øe up them≈øelves, but tho≈øe which are big and full, droop and hang down
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:35252:94"/>
their Heads; ≈øo 'tis only Ignorance that is proud and lifts Men up, but true Knowledge makes Men humble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is matter of Comfort and Encouragement. He knows our wants and weakne≈øs, and <hi>will lay no more upon us than we are able to bear, for he con≈øiders that we are but Du≈øt</hi>; he knows the rage and malice of our Enemies, and can when he plea≈øes <hi>put a Hook in their No≈øe,</hi> and <hi>his Bridle in their Lips,</hi> as he did to <hi>Senacherib,</hi> 2 Kings 19.28.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From God's knowing our ≈øecret Actions, I infer</p>
            <p n="1">1. If God ≈øees our mo≈øt ≈øecret Actions, this di≈øcovers and confutes the ≈øecret Athei≈øm of many. He that commits the mo≈øt ≈øecret ≈øin denies the Omni≈øcience of God. Thus <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribes the Athei≈øm of ≈øome in his Days; <hi>he hath ≈øaid in his heart, God hath forgot, he hideth his face, he will never ≈øee it; the Lord ≈øhall not ≈øee, neither ≈øhall the God of Jacob regard it</hi>; and is not this, in effect, to deny God's Being? for it is to deny him to be what he is. A Man may as well deny there is a Sun, as deny that it ≈øhines and enlightens the World.</p>
            <p>There are ≈øome Relicks of this even in the be≈øt Men, which do at ≈øometimes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35252:94"/>

            <p n="1">1. From the dictates of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon.

            <p>The Contrary is an Imperfection, and argues many other Imperfections, therefore Wi≈ødom belongs to God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men Folly is look'd upon as the greate≈øt defect; it is accounted a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reproach and Di≈øgrace, than Vice and Wickedne≈øs; it is of ≈øo ill a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in the World, that there are not many but had rather be accounted Knaves than Fools; but in a true E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteem and Value of things, it is, next to Wickedne≈øs, the greate≈øt Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and, on the contrary, Wi≈ødom is the highe≈øt Perfection next to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Goodne≈øs; it is u≈øually more cryed up in the World than any thing el≈øe. Rea≈øon tells us, tho' the Scripture had not ≈øaid it, that <hi>wi≈ødom excells folly as much as light doth darkne≈øs,</hi> Eccl. 2.13. <hi>The wi≈ødom of a man maketh his Face

            </p>
            <p>And the denyal of this Perfection to God would argue many other Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; it would be an univer≈øal Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øh to the Divine Nature, and would darken all his other Perfections. It would weaken the Power of God. How impotent and ineffectual would Power be without Wi≈ødom! what irregular things would it produce! what untow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Combinations of Effects would there be, if Infinite Power ≈øhould act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conduct and Direction of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wi≈ødom! It would eclip≈øe the Providence of God, and put out the <hi>Eyes</hi> that are in the <hi>Wheels,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet repre≈øents God's Providence. There can be no Coun≈øel, no Fore-ca≈øt, no orderly Government of the World without Wi≈ødom. The Goodne≈øs, and Mercy, and Ju≈øtice, and Truth of God, could not ≈øhine with that lu≈øtre, were it not for his Wi≈ødom which doth illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate the≈øe with ≈øo much advantage.</p>

of the World.

But altho' I would not willingly part with any place that may fairly be brought for the proof of the Divinity of Chri≈øt, yet ≈øeeing there are ≈øo many plain Texts in Scripture for the proof of it, we have the le≈øs rea≈øon to ≈øtretch doubtful places; and that this is ≈øo, will appear to any one who con≈øiders that the Title of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> is ≈øeveral times in Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God the Father; be≈øides that in a very Ancient and Authentick Copy, we find the words read ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what otherwi≈øe, and ≈øo as to put this out of all Controver≈øie, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Having premi≈øed thus much for the clearing of the≈øe words, I ≈øhall briefly con≈øider, <hi>fir≈øt</hi> God's <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Maje≈øty,</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:35252:111"/>
and then his <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> God's <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Maje≈øty.</hi> By <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty,</hi> we may under≈øtand the greatne≈øs, or eminent excellency of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which re≈øults from his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and whereby the Divine Nature is ≈øet and placed infinitely above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beings; I ≈øay the eminent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Divine Nature, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øults from his Perfections, more e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from tho≈øe great Perfections, his Goodne≈øs, and Wi≈ødom, and Power, and Holine≈øs.</p>
            <p>And his <hi>Glory</hi> is a manife≈øtation of this Excellency, and a ju≈øt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and due opinion of it. Hence it is, that in Scripture God is ≈øaid to be <hi>glorious in power,</hi> and <hi>glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs,</hi> and his Goodne≈øs is call'd <hi>his glory</hi>; and here in the Text, <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty</hi> are a≈øcribed to him upon the account of his <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi> and <hi>Goodne≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the≈øe belong to God, I ≈øhall prove,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the acknowledgment of Natural Light. The Heathens did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly a≈øcribe Greatne≈øs to God, and that as re≈øulting chiefly from his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, as appears by their frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the≈øe two Attributes, <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:35252:112"/>
and <hi>Greatne≈øs. Opt. Max.</hi> were their mo≈øt familiar Titles of the Deity; to which I will add that known place of <hi>Seneca, primus deorum cultus e≈øt deos crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, dein reddere illis maje≈øtatem ≈øuam, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere bonitatem, ≈øine qu√¢ nulla maje≈øtas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From Scripture. It were endle≈øs to produce all tho≈øe Texts wherein Greatne≈øs and Glory are a≈øcribed to God. I ≈øhall mention two or three. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17. <hi>the Lord is a great God; P≈øal.</hi> 24.10. he's call'd <hi>the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; 104, 1. he is ≈øaid to be <hi>cloathed with maje≈øty and honour. The whole Earth is full of his glory.</hi> Hither belong all tho≈øe Doxologies in the Old and New Te≈øtament, wherein Greatne≈øs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Maje≈øty are a≈øcribed to God.</p>
            <p>From all which we may learn,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is that makes a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon great and glorious, and what is the way to Maje≈øty, <hi>viz. real worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,</hi> and particularly that kind of excellency which Creatures are capable of in a very eminent degree, and that is <hi>goodne≈øs</hi>; this is that which advanceth a Per≈øon, and gives him a pre-eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy above all others; this ca≈øts a lu≈øtre upon a man, and <hi>makes his face to ≈øhine. Ari≈øtotle</hi> tells us, that <hi>Honour</hi> is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:35252:112"/>
nothing el≈øe but the <hi>≈øignification of the e≈øteem which we have of a Per≈øon for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; for,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>to be good,</hi> and <hi>to do good, is the highe≈øt glory.</hi> God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs is his highe≈øt Glory; and there is nothing ≈øo glorious in any Creature, as herein to be like God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us give God the Glory which is due to his Name; <hi>A≈øcribe ye greatne≈øs to our God,</hi> Deut. 32.3. <hi>Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and power,</hi> P≈øal. 29.1. The Glory and Maje≈øty of God calls for our E≈øteem and Honour, our Fear and Reverence of him. Thus we ≈øhould <hi>glorifie God in our Spirits,</hi> by an inward e≈øteem and reverence of his Maje≈øty. The thoughts of Earthly Maje≈øty will compo≈øe us to reverence: how much more ≈øhould the Apprehen≈øions of the Divine Maje≈øty ≈øtrike an awe upon our Spirits in all our Addre≈ø≈øes to him? <hi>his excellency</hi> ≈øhould <hi>make us afraid,</hi> and keep us from all ≈øaucy boldne≈øs and familiarity with him. Reverence is an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the di≈øtance which is between the Maje≈øty of God and our meanne≈øs. And we ≈øhould <hi>glorifie him in our bodies,</hi> with outward Wor≈øhip and Adoration; that is, by all external ≈øignifications of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:35252:113"/>
reverence and re≈øpect; and we ≈øhould glorifie him in our Lives and Actions. The highe≈øt glory a Creature can give to God, is to endeavour to be like him; <hi>≈øatis illos coluit, qui≈øquis imitatus e≈øt,</hi> Sen. hereby we manife≈øt and ≈øhew forth his Excellency to the World, when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be conformed to the Divine Perfections. And in ca≈øe of ≈øin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, we are to give glory to God by repentance, which is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his Holine≈øs, who hates ≈øin; and of his Ju≈øtice, which will puni≈øh it; and of the mercy of God, which is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pardon it; for it <hi>is the glory of God to pa≈øs by a provocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We ≈øhould take heed of robbing God of his Glory, by giving it to any Creature, by a≈øcribing tho≈øe Titles, or that Wor≈øhip to any Creature, which is due to God alone. This is the Rea≈øon which is given of the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>I the Lord am a jealous God</hi>; God is jealous of his Honour, <hi>and will not give his glory to another, nor his Prai≈øe to graven Images,</hi> I≈øa. 42.8. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we find the Apo≈øtle reproves the Idolatry of the Heathens, becau≈øe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they deba≈øed the e≈øteem of God, and did ≈øhew they had unworthy thoughts
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:35252:113"/>
of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 23. <hi>When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but became vain in their imaginations. And changed the glory of the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible God into an image made like to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible man, and to birds and four-footed bea≈øts, and creeping things.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they denyed the glorious Excellency of the Divine Nature; that is, that he is a Spirit, and ≈øo incapable of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented by any material or ≈øen≈øible I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I come now to ≈øpeak of the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> of God. In which I ≈øhall ≈øhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt.</hi> What we are to under≈øtand by the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> of God. By the≈øe we mean the full and ab≈øolute Right and Title and Authority which God hath to, and over all his Creatures, as his Creatures, and made by him. And this Right re≈øults from the Effects of that Goodne≈øs, and Power, and Wi≈ødom whereby all things are and were made; from whence there doth accrew to God a <hi>Soveraign</hi> Right and Title to all his Creatures, and a full and ab≈øolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them; that is ≈øuch a Right and Authority which doth not depend upon any Superior, nor is ≈øubject and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:35252:114"/>
to any for any thing that he does to any of his Creatures. And this is that which is call'd <hi>≈øummum imperium,</hi> becau≈øe there is no power above it to check or control it, and therefore there can be none greater than this. And it is <hi>ab≈øolute,</hi> becau≈øe all the Creatures have what they have from God, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his Goodne≈øs, and therefore they owe all po≈ø≈øible Duty and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Subjection ≈øo long as they continue in Being, becau≈øe it is ≈øolely by his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Goodne≈øs that they continue; and therefore whatever Right or Title any one can pretend to any Per≈øon or Thing, <hi>that</hi> God hath to all things, <hi>in Deo omnes tituli omnia jura concurrunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a full Right and Title and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in all his Creatures, and an ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority over them, to govern them and di≈øpo≈øe of them, and deal with them in any way he plea≈øeth, that is not contrary to his e≈ø≈øential Dignity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or repugnant to the Natural State and Condition of the Creature.</p>
            <p>And for our better under≈øtanding of this, and the preventing of Mi≈øtakes which Men are apt to fall into about the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of God, I will ≈øhew,
<list>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:35252:114"/>
                  <item>I. Wherein it doth not con≈øi≈øt. And,</item>
                  <item>II. Wherein it doth con≈øi≈øt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Wherein it doth not con≈øi≈øt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not in a Right to gratifie and delight him≈øelf in the extreme Mi≈øery of innocent and unde≈øerving Creatures; I ≈øay, not in a <hi>right</hi>; for the <hi>right</hi> that God hath in his Creatures is founded in the Benefits he hath conferred upon them, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation they have to him upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Now there's none, who becau≈øe he hath done a Benefit, can have, by vertue of <hi>that,</hi> a <hi>right</hi> to do a greater Evil than the Good which he hath done amounts to; and I think it next to mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, to doubt whether extreme and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Mi≈øery be not a greater Evil, than ≈øimple Being is a Good. I know they call it <hi>phy≈øical goodne≈øs</hi>; but I do not under≈øtand how any thing is the better for being call'd by a hard Name. For what can there be that is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>de≈øirable</hi> in <hi>Being,</hi> when it only ≈øerves to be a foundation of the greate≈øt and mo≈øt la≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mi≈øery</hi>? and we may ≈øafely ≈øay, that the ju≈øt God will never challenge more than <hi>an equitable right.</hi> God doth not claim any <hi>≈øuch ≈øoveraignty</hi> to him≈øelf, as to cru≈øh and oppre≈øs innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:35252:115"/>
without a cau≈øe, and to make them mi≈øerable without a provocation. And becau≈øe it ≈øeems ≈øome have been very apt to entertain ≈øuch groundle≈øs Jealou≈øies and unworthy Thoughts of God, he hath given us his Oath to a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure us of the contrary. <hi>As I live, ≈øaith the Lord, I have no plea≈øure in the death of a ≈øinner, but rather that he ≈øhould turn and live.</hi> So far is he from taking Plea≈øure in the mi≈øery and ruin of innocent Creatures, that in ca≈øe of ≈øin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, he would be much rather plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, if ≈øinners would, by Repentance, avoid and e≈øcape his Ju≈øtice, than that they ≈øhould fall under it. The good God cannot be glorified or plea≈øed in doing Evil to any, where Ju≈øtice doth not require it; nothing is further from infinite Goodne≈øs than to rejoice in Evil. We account him a Tyrant and a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter of Men, and of a devili≈øh temper, that can do ≈øo; and we cannot do a greater Injury to the good God, than to paint him out after ≈øuch a horrid and deformed manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>≈øoveraignty</hi> of God doth not con≈øi≈øt in impo≈øing Laws upon his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are impo≈ø≈øible either to be under≈øtood or ob≈øerved by them. For
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:35252:115"/>
this would not only be contrary to the dignity of the Divine Nature, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the nature of a rea≈øonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, in rea≈øon, cannot be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by any Power to impo≈ø≈øibilities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>≈øoveraignty</hi> of God doth not con≈øi≈øt in a liberty to tempt Men to Evil, or by any inevitable Decree to nece≈ø≈øitate them to ≈øin, or effectually to procure the ≈øins of Men, and to puni≈øh them for them. For as this would be contrary to the Holine≈øs, and Ju≈øtice, and Goodne≈øs of God; ≈øo to the nature of a rea≈øonable Creature, who cannot be guilty or de≈øerve Puni≈øhment for what it cannot help. And men cannot ea≈øily have a blacker thought of God, than to imagin that he hath, from all Eternity, carried on a ≈øecret De≈øign to circumvent the greate≈øt part of men into de≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and underhand to draw Men into a Plot again≈øt Heaven, that by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy practice he may rai≈øe a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of glory to his Ju≈øtice. There's no generous and good man, but would ≈øpit in that man's Face that ≈øhould charge him with ≈øuch a De≈øign: and if they who are but very drops of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, in compari≈øon of God, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Ocean of Goodne≈øs, would take it
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:35252:116"/>
for ≈øuch a Reproach; ≈øhall we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <hi>that</hi> to the be≈øt Being in the World, which we would dete≈øt and abominate in our ≈øelves?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Wherein the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of God doth con≈øi≈øt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a right to di≈øpo≈øe of, and deal with his Creatures in any way that doth not contradict the E≈ø≈øential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, and the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Creature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In a right to impo≈øe what Laws he plea≈øeth upon his Creatures, whether natural and rea≈øonable; or po≈øitive, of Tryal of Obedience, provided they contradict not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God or of the Creature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In a right to inflict due and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved Puni≈øhment in ca≈øe of provocation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In a right to afflict any of his Creatures, ≈øo the Evil he inflicts be ≈øhort of the Benefits he hath conferred on them; yea, and farther, in a right when he plea≈øeth to annihilate the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and turn it out of Being, if it ≈øhould ≈øo ≈øeem good to him, tho' that Creature have not offended him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe what he gave was his own, and he may without injury take it away again when he plea≈øeth. In the≈øe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:35252:116"/>
the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of God con≈øi≈øts, and if there be any thing el≈øe that can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the e≈ø≈øential Perfections of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Proof and Confirmation of this. This is univer≈øally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by the Heathens, that God is <hi>the Lord and Soveraign of the World, and of all Creatures.</hi> Hence <hi>Plato</hi> calls him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>; and <hi>Tully, omnium rerum Dominum, Lord of all</hi>; and this the Scripture doth every where attribute to him, calling him <hi>Lord of all, King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords</hi>; to which we may refer all tho≈øe Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologies, in which Power, and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Authority are a≈øcribed to God. I will only mention that eminent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> a great King, who, when his Under≈øtanding came to him, was forced to acknowledge that <hi>God was the mo≈øt high,</hi> Dan. 4.34, 35. I infer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Negatively, we cannot, from the <hi>≈øoveraignty</hi> of God, infer a right to do any thing that is un≈øuitable to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature; and con≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we are to re≈øt ≈øatisfied with ≈øuch a Notion of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> in God, as doth not plainly
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:35252:117"/>
and directly contradict all the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that we have of <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs</hi>: nay it would be little le≈øs than a horrid and dreadful Bla≈øphemy, to ≈øay that God can, out of his Soveraign Will and Plea≈øure, do any thing that contradicts the Nature of God, and the e≈ø≈øential Perfections of the Deity; or to imagin that the Plea≈øure and Will of the Holy, and Ju≈øt, and Good God is not always regulated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the e≈ø≈øential and indi≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øable Laws of Goodne≈øs, and Holine≈øs, and Righteou≈øne≈øs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Po≈øitively; we may infer from the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> of God,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we ought to own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God for <hi>our Lord</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> who by creating us, and giving us all that we have, did create to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf a Right in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we owe to him the utmo≈øt po≈ø≈øibility of our Love, <hi>to love him with all our hearts, and ≈øouls, and ≈øtrength</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Souls that we have he gave us; and that we are in a capacity to love him, is his Gift; and when we render the≈øe to him, we do but give him of his own.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:35252:117"/>3.

            <p n="4">4.

            <p>I Am treating of the Attributes and Properties of God, particularly tho≈øe which relate to the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, which I told you are his <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Wi≈ødom.</hi> I have fini≈øht the <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God. The la≈øt Day I ≈øpake concerning the <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi> of God in general; but there are <hi>Three</hi> eminent Arguments, and famous In≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God's <hi>Wi≈ødom,</hi> which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved for a more large and particular handling. The Wi≈ødom of God ≈øhines forth in the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, in the <hi>Government</hi> of it, and in the <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:35252:119"/>
of Mankind by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Of the≈øe <hi>Three</hi> I ≈øhall ≈øpeak ≈øeverally.</p>
            <p>I begin with the <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> the Argument of God's <hi>Wi≈ødom,</hi> which the <hi>Creation</hi> doth furni≈øh us withal. In this vi≈øible frame of the World which we behold with our Eyes, which way ≈øoever we look, we are encountred with ocular demon≈øtrations of the <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi> of God. What the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith of the <hi>Power</hi> of God is true likewi≈øe of his <hi>Wi≈ødom,</hi> Rom. 1.20. <hi>The invi≈øible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ≈øeen, being under≈øtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God-head</hi>: ≈øo the <hi>eternal wi≈ødom</hi> of God is under≈øtood <hi>by the things which are made.</hi> Now the <hi>Creation</hi> is an Argument of the <hi>wi≈ødom</hi> of God, as it is an effect of admirable Coun≈øel and Wi≈ødom. As any curious Work, or rare Engine doth argue the Wit of the Artificer; ≈øo the variety, and order, and regularity, and fitne≈øs of the Works of God, argue the <hi>infinite wi≈ødom</hi> of him who made them; a Work ≈øo beautiful and magnificent, ≈øuch a ≈øtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pile as Heaven and Earth is, ≈øo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ≈øeveral pieces of it, ≈øo harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in all its parts, every part ≈øo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ≈øervice of the whole, and each
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:35252:119"/>
part for the ≈øervice of another; is not this a plain Argument that there was <hi>infinite wi≈ødom</hi> in the contrivance of this Frame?</p>
            <p>Now I ≈øhall endeavour to prove to you that this Frame of Things which we ≈øee with our Eyes, which we call the <hi>World,</hi> or the <hi>Creation,</hi> is contrived af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the be≈øt manner, and hath upon it evident impre≈ø≈øions of Coun≈øel and Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I grant the <hi>wi≈ødom</hi> of God is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and that many of the Ends and De≈øigns of his <hi>wi≈ødom</hi> are <hi>un≈øearchable, and pa≈øt finding out,</hi> both in the Works of Creation and Providence; and that <hi>tho' a Wi≈øe man ≈øeek to find out the work of God from the beginning to the end, he ≈øhall not be able to do it</hi>; and we ≈øhall never be able to exhau≈øt all the various Wi≈ødom and Contrivance which is in the Works of God; tho' the oftner and the nearer we meditate upon them, the more we ≈øhall ≈øee to admire in them; the more we ≈øtudy this Book of the Creation, the more we ≈øhall be a≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh'd at the Wi≈ødom of the Author: but this doth not hinder but that we may di≈øcover ≈øomething of the Wi≈ødom of God, tho' it be Infinite. As the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>Infinite Power</hi> may fall under our
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:35252:120"/>
               <hi>Sen≈øes,</hi> ≈øo the De≈øigns of <hi>Infinite Wi≈ødom</hi> may fall under our <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding</hi>; and when things appear to our be≈øt Rea≈øon, plainly to be order'd for the be≈øt, and the greate≈øt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the World and Mankind, ≈øo far as we are able to judge; and if they had been otherwi≈øe, as they might have been a hundred thou≈øand ways, they would not have been ≈øo well; we ought to conclude, that things are thus, and not otherwi≈øe, is the re≈øult of <hi>Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Wi≈ødom of God in the Creation will appear by con≈øidering the Works of God. Tho≈øe who have ≈øtudied Nature can di≈øcour≈øe the≈øe things more exactly and particularly. It would require perfect skill in <hi>A≈øtronomy,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the motions and order of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodies; and in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> to read Lectures of the rare contrivance of the Bodies of living Creatures. But this, as it is beyond my ability, ≈øo it would probably be above mo≈øt of your Capacities; therefore I ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ≈øelf with ≈øome general and more obvious in≈øtances of the Divine Wi≈ødom, which ≈øhine forth ≈øo clear in his Works, that <hi>he that runs may read it.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:35252:120"/>1. I ≈øhall take a ≈øhort ≈øurvey of the ≈øeveral parts of the World.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:35252:121"/>If we look down to the Earth, we ≈øhall ≈øee <hi>God's a≈øcending and de≈øcending</hi>; I mean clear repre≈øentations of Divine Wi≈ødom in the Trea≈øures that are hid in the Bowels of it, and tho≈øe Fruits that grow upon the ≈øurface of it. What va≈øt Heaps, and what variety of u≈øeful Materials and Minerals are ≈øcatter'd up and down in the Earth, as one would think, with a carele≈øs Hand, but yet ≈øo wi≈øely di≈øper≈øt, as is mo≈øt proper for the Nece≈ø≈øities and U≈øes of ≈øeveral Countries! Look upon the ≈øurface of the Earth, and you ≈øhall find it cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adorned with Plants of a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and admirable Frame, and Beauty, and U≈øefulne≈øs.

            <p>Look again upon the Earth, and in the Air, and Sea, and you ≈øhall find all the≈øe inhabited and furni≈øht with great ≈øtore of living Creatures of ≈øeveral kinds,

But the Creation is a va≈øt Field, in which we may ea≈øily lo≈øe our ≈øelves. I ≈øhall therefore call home our wandring Thoughts; for we need not go out of our ≈øelves for a proof of Divine Wi≈ødom.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:35252:122"/>
and de≈øcended from above. We have looked above us, and beneath us, and about us, upon the ≈øeveral repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentations of God's Wi≈ødom, and the ≈øeveral parts of the Creation; but we have not yet con≈øider'd the be≈øt piece of the vi≈øible World, which we may ≈øpeak of, without flattery of our ≈øelves, and to the prai≈øe of our Maker. God, when he had made the World, <hi>he made man after his own Image.</hi> When he had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed the other part of the Creation, he was plea≈øed to ≈øet up this Picture of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf in it, as a Memorial of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Now we ≈øhall a little more particularly con≈øider this piece of God's Workman≈øhip, being it is better known, and more familiar to us, as it is more excellent than the re≈øt, and con≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a higher in≈øtance of the Divine Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:35252:122"/>
were the Effect and Re≈øult of Divine Wi≈ødom, and the Creature of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel.</p>
            <p>Man may be con≈øider'd either in him≈øelf, and in re≈øpect of the Parts of which he con≈øi≈øts, Soul and Body; or with relation to the Univer≈øe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Creation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Con≈øider him in him≈øelf, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Soul and Body.

partium, of the u≈øefulne≈øs and convenient contrivance of every part of the Body,</hi> are a mo≈øt exact demon≈øtration of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wi≈ødom, which appears in the make of our Body, of which Books, <hi>Ga≈ø≈øendus</hi> ≈øaith, the whole work is writ with a kind of <hi>Enthu≈øia≈øm.</hi> The Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, in the frame of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, very much appears by a curious con≈øideration of the ≈øeveral parts of it; but that requiring a very accurate skill in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> I chu≈øe rather wholly to forbear it, than by my unskilfulne≈øs to be injurious to the Divine Wi≈ødom.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>domicilium corporis, this Hou≈øe of our Body,</hi> tho' it be indeed a curious piece; yet it is nothing to the noble <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant</hi> that dwells in it. This <hi>Cabinet,</hi> tho' it be exqui≈øitely wrought, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich; yet it comes infinitely ≈øhort in value of the <hi>Jewel</hi> that is hid and laid up in it. How does the glorious facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding exalt us above the re≈øt of the Creatures! Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath not made that particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion for Man, which it hath made for other Creatures, becau≈øe it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him in general, in giving him a Mind and Rea≈øon. Man is not born cloathed, nor armed with any

con≈øiderable Weapon for defence; but he hath Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding to provide the≈øe things for him≈øelf; and this alone excells all the advantages of other Creatures; he can keep him≈øelf warmer and ≈øafer, he can fore-≈øee Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and provide again≈øt them; he can provide Weapons that are better than Horns, and Teeth, and Paws, and by the advantage of his Rea≈øon, is too hard for all other Creatures, and can defend him≈øelf again≈øt their Violence.</p>
            <p>If we con≈øider the Mind of Man yet nearer, how many Arguments of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity are there in it! That there ≈øhould be at once in our Under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings di≈øtinct comprehen≈øions of ≈øuch variety of Objects; that it ≈øhould pa≈øs in its Thoughts from Heaven to Earth in a moment, and retain the memory of things pa≈øt, and take a pro≈øpect of the future, and look forward as far as Eternity! Becau≈øe we are familiar to our ≈øelves, we cannot be ≈øtrange and wonderful to our ≈øelves: But the great Miracle of the World is the Mind of Man, and the contrivance of it an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent In≈øtance of God's Wi≈ødom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Con≈øider Man with relation to the Univer≈øe, and you ≈øhall find the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:35252:124"/>
Wi≈ødom of God doth appear, in that all things are made ≈øo u≈øeful for Man, who was de≈øign'd to be the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of this vi≈øible World, the Gue≈øt whom God de≈øign'd principally to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain in this Hou≈øe which he built. Not that we are to think, that God hath ≈øo made all things for Man, that he hath not made them at all for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and po≈ø≈øibly for many other u≈øes than we can imagine; for we much over-value our ≈øelves, if we think them to be only for us; and we dimini≈øh the Wi≈ødom of God in re≈øtraining it to one end: but the chief and principal End of many things is the U≈øe and Service of Man; and in reference to this End, you ≈øhall find that God hath made abundant and wi≈øe Provi≈øion.</p>
            <p>More particularly we will con≈øider Man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his <hi>natural</hi> capacity, as a part of the World. How many things are there in the World for the ≈øervice and plea≈øure, for the u≈øe and delight of Man, which, if Man were not in the World, would be of little u≈øe? Man is by Nature a contemplative Creature, and God has furni≈øh'd him with many Objects to exerci≈øe his Under≈øtanding
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:35252:124"/>
upon, which would be ≈øo far u≈øele≈øs and lo≈øt, if Man were not. Who ≈øhould ob≈øerve the Motions of the Stars, and the Cour≈øes of tho≈øe Heavenly Bodies, and all the Wonders of Nature? Who ≈øhould prie into the ≈øecret Virtues of Plants, and other natural things, if there were not, in the World, a Creature endowed with Rea≈øon and Under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Would the Bea≈øts of the Field ≈øtudy A≈øtronomy, or turn Chymi≈øts, and try Experiments in Nature?</p>
            <p>What variety of beautiful Plants and Flowers is there! which can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd to be of little other u≈øe but for the Plea≈øure of Man. And if Man had not been, they would have lo≈øt their grace, and been trod down by the Bea≈øts of the Field, without pity or ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they would not have made them into Garlands and No≈øe-gays. How many ≈øorts of Fruits are there which grow upon high Trees, out of the reach of Bea≈øts! and indeed they take no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure in them. What would all the va≈øt bodies of Trees have ≈øerved for, if Man had not been to build with them, and make Dwellings of them? Of what u≈øe would all the Mines of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal have been, and of Coal, and the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:35252:125"/>
Quarries of Stone? Would the Mole have admired the fine Gold? Would the Bea≈øts of the Fore≈øt have built them≈øelves Palaces, or would they have made Fires in their Dens?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Con≈øider Man in his <hi>Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Capacity, as I may call it, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Habitation in this or that Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, or Country. The Wi≈ødom of God hath ≈øo order'd Things, that the Nece≈ø≈øities of every Country are ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed one way or other. <hi>Egypt</hi> hath no Rains; but the River <hi>Nilus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows it, and makes it fruitful. Under the Line, where there are exce≈ø≈øive Heats, every day there are con≈øtant gales and breezes of cool Wind, to fan and refre≈øh the ≈øcorched Inhabitants. The hotter Countries are furni≈øht with Materials for Silk, a light Cloathing; we that are cooler here in <hi>England,</hi> with materials for Cloth, a warmer Cloathing; <hi>Ru≈ø≈øia</hi> and <hi>Mu≈øcovy,</hi> which are extreme Cold, are provided with warm Furs, and Skins of Bea≈øts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Con≈øider Man in his capacity of <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Entercour≈øe.</hi> Man is a <hi>≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Creature</hi>; be≈øides the advantages of <hi>Commerce</hi> with remoter Nations, for ≈øupplying every Country with tho≈øe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:35252:125"/>
Conveniences and Commodities which each doth peculiarly afford. And here the Wi≈ødom of God does plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in di≈øpo≈øing the Sea into ≈øeveral parts of the World, for the more ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Commerce and Entercour≈øe of ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations. Now if every Country had brought forth all Commodities; <hi>that</hi> had been needle≈øs and ≈øuperfluous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they might have been had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Commerce; be≈øides that the great encouragement of Entercour≈øe among Nations, which is ≈øo agreeable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, would have been taken away: If every Country had been, as now it is, de≈øtitute of many things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries have, and there had been no Sea to give an opportunity of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick; the World had been very defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive as to the U≈øe of Man. Now here appears the Wi≈ødom of God, that the World, and all things in it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd for the be≈øt.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavour'd to do ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing toward the di≈øplaying of God's Wi≈ødom in the workman≈øhip of the World; altho' I am very ≈øen≈øible how much I have been ma≈øter'd and oppre≈øt by the greatne≈øs and weight of ≈øo noble an Argument.

works of God! and who can ≈øhew forth all his prai≈øe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The U≈øe I ≈øhall make of what has been ≈øaid, ≈øhall be in three Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This confutes the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who impute the World, and this orderly and beautiful Frame of Things to Chance<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Tho≈øe things which are the proper Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Coun≈øel, and bear the plain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions of Wi≈ødom upon them, ought not to be attributed to Chance. What a madne≈øs is it to grant all things to be as well made, as if the wi≈øe≈øt Agent upon Coun≈øel and De≈øign had contriv'd them; and yet to a≈øcribe them to Chance! Now he that denies things to be ≈øo wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed, mu≈øt pick holes in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ≈øhew ≈øome fault and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in the Frame of Things, which no Man ever yet pretended to do. Did ever any <hi>Anatomi≈øt</hi> pretend to ≈øhew how the Body of Man might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contriv'd, and fitter for the U≈øes of a Rea≈øonable Creature than it is; or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>A≈øtronomer</hi> to rectifie the Cour≈øe of the Sun. As for the Extravagant and Bla≈øphemous Speech of <hi>Alphon≈øus, That if he had ≈øtood at God's Elbow when he made the World, he could have told him how to have made it better</hi>; be≈øides his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:35252:126"/>
               <hi>Pride,</hi> it ≈øhews nothing but his <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>; that he built his <hi>A≈øtronomy</hi> upon a fal≈øe Hypothe≈øis, as is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved now by the Learned in that Science; and no wonder he found fault with the World, when he mi≈øtook the Frame of it: But tho≈øe who have been mo≈øt ver≈øt in Nature, and have mo≈øt pried into the ≈øecrets of it, have mo≈øt admired the workman≈øhip both of the great World, and the le≈øs.</p>
            <p>But if we mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe the World to be as well made as Wi≈ødom could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it, which is generally granted; it is a mon≈øtrous folly to impute it to Chance. A man might better ≈øay, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi> did not make any of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines by Skill, but by Chance; and might more ea≈øily maintain that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Richlieu</hi> did not manage Affairs by any Arts or Policies, but they fell out by meer Chance. What pitiful ≈øhifts is <hi>Epicurus</hi> put to, when the be≈øt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he can give of the World, is this; <hi>That Matter always was, and the parts of it in motion, and after a great many Tryals, the parts of Matter at length hamper'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in this fortunate order wherein they now are; that men, at fir≈øt, grew out of the Earth, were nouri≈øht by the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtring,

and when they were ≈øtrong enough, broke loo≈øe and weaned them≈øelves; that the No≈øtrils were made by the Waters making them≈øelves a pa≈ø≈øage out of the Body; and the Stomack and Bowels by the Waters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a pa≈ø≈øage downward; that the Members of the Body were not made for tho≈øe <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øes for which they ≈øerve, but chanced to be ≈øo, and the u≈øes afterwards found out.</hi> Is it worth the while to advance ≈øuch ≈øen≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs Opinions as the≈øe, to deny the Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God? Is it not much ea≈øier, and more rea≈øonable to ≈øay, that the Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God made all the≈øe things, than to trouble our ≈øelves to imagin how all things ≈øhould happen thus convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Chance? Did you ever know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great work, in which there was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of parts, and an orderly di≈øpo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them required, done by Chance, and without the direction of Wi≈ødom and Coun≈øel? How long time might a Man take to jumble a ≈øet of four and twenty Letters together, before they would fall out to be an exact Poem; yea, or make a Book of tolerable Sen≈øe, tho' but in Pro≈øe?

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:35252:127"/>
is a Man ea≈øilier made by Chance, than his Picture? He that tells me that this great and curious frame of the World was made by Chance, I could much more believe him, if he ≈øhould tell me that <hi>Henry</hi> the VII's Chappel, in <hi>We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min≈øter,</hi> was not built by any mortal man, but the Stones did grow in tho≈øe forms into which they ≈øeem to us to be cut and graven; that the Stones; and Timber, and Iron, and Bra≈øs, and all the other Materials, came thither by Chance, and upon a day met all happily together, and put them≈øelves into that delicate order, in which we ≈øee them ≈øo clo≈øe compacted, that it mu≈øt be a great Chance that parts them again. Now is it not much ea≈øier to imagin how a skilful Workman ≈øhould rai≈øe a Building, than how Timber, and Stones, and how that variety of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials which is required to a great and ≈øtately Building, ≈øhould meet together all of a ju≈øt bigne≈øs, and exactly fitted, and by chance take their places, and range them≈øelves into that order.

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. For the nature of the Duty here required. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> ≈øignifies an <hi>anxious care</hi> about Events; a care that is accompanied with trouble and di≈øquiet of Mind about what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us; about the good that we hope for, and de≈øire; or about the Evil which we fear may come upon us. This the Apo≈øtle exhorts us to throw off; and to leave to the Providence of God and his Care, all tho≈øe Events which we are apt to be ≈øo ≈øolicitous and di≈øquieted about. The Expre≈ø≈øion ≈øeems to be taken out of <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 55.22. <hi>ca≈øt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he ≈øhall ≈øu≈øtain thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that we may not mi≈øtake our Duty in this matter, I ≈øhall ≈øhew what is not here meant by <hi>ca≈øting all our care upon God,</hi> and then what is meant by it.</p>
            <p>The Apo≈øtle doth not hereby intend to take Men off from <hi>a provident care and diligence,</hi> about the concernments of this life; this is not only contrary to Rea≈øon, but to many expre≈øs Precepts and Pa≈ø≈øages of Scripture, wherein Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is recommended to us, and the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:35252:131"/>
Ble≈ø≈øing of God, and the good Succe≈øs of our Affairs promi≈øed thereto; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are commanded to provide for tho≈øe of our Family, which cannot be done without ≈øome ≈øort of care; and wherein Sloathfulne≈øs and Negligence are condemned, and threatned with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; ≈øo that this is not <hi>to ca≈øt our care upon God,</hi> to take no care of our ≈øelves, to u≈øe no diligence and endeavour for the obtaining of the Good which we de≈øire, and the prevention of the Evil we fear; this is to tempt the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and to ca≈øt that Burthen upon him, which he expects we ≈øhould bear our ≈øelves.</p>
            <p>But by <hi>ca≈øting our care upon God,</hi> the Apo≈øtle intends the≈øe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That after all prudent Care and Diligence have been u≈øed by us, we ≈øhould not be <hi>farther ≈øolicitous,</hi> nor trouble our ≈øelves about the event of Things, which, when we have done all we can, will be out of our power. And this certainly is our Saviour's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he bids us, <hi>take no care for the morrow.</hi> When we have done what is fit for us for the pre≈øent to do, we ≈øhould not di≈øquiet and torment our ≈øelves about the I≈ø≈øue and Event of Things.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:35252:132"/>2. <hi>Ca≈øting our care upon God,</hi> implies, that we ≈øhould refer the i≈ø≈øue of Things to his Providence, which is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigilant over us, and knows how to di≈øpo≈øe all things to the be≈øt, entirely confiding in his Wi≈ødom and Goodne≈øs, that he will order all things for our good, and in that confidence, re≈øolving to re≈øt ≈øatisfied and contented with the di≈øpo≈øals of his Providence, whatever they be.</p>
            <p>You ≈øee then the nature of the Duty which the Apo≈øtle here exhorts to, <hi>viz.</hi> That after all prudent Care and Diligence have been u≈øed on our parts, we ≈øhould not be di≈øquieted in our Minds about the event of things, but leave them to God, who hath the Care of us and of all our Concernments. Which is the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing I propo≈øed to ≈øpeak to, and which I intend chiefly to in≈øi≈øt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> The Argument which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle here u≈øeth to per≈øwade us to this Duty, of <hi>ca≈øting all our care upon God</hi>; becau≈øe <hi>it is he that careth for us</hi>; and this implies in it the≈øe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general, That the Providence of God governs the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it ≈øelf in the Affairs of Men, and di≈øpo≈øeth of all Events that happen to us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:35252:132"/>2. More particularly, That this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is peculiarly concerned for good Men, and that he takes a ≈øpecial care of them and their Concerns; <hi>He careth for you.</hi> The Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks this to them, not only as <hi>Men,</hi> but as <hi>Chri≈øtians.</hi> And thus the P≈øalmi≈øt, from whom the≈øe words ≈øeem to be taken, does apply and limit this Promi≈øe; <hi>Ca≈øt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he ≈øhall ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtain thee; he ≈øhall never ≈øuffer the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That God taketh care of us, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in general, That the Providence of God governs the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it ≈øelf in the Affairs of Men, and di≈øpo≈øeth of all Events that happen to us. I ≈øhall not now enter upon a large Proof of <hi>the Providence of God</hi>; that is too large and intricate an Argument for a ≈øhort Di≈øcour≈øe, and hath a great deal of nicety and difficulty in it; and tho' it be a fundamental Principle of Religion, and hath been almo≈øt general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained and believed by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and that upon very good Rea≈øon; yet becau≈øe the vindication of many particular appearances of Providence, does in a great mea≈øure depend upon a full view and comprehen≈øion of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:35252:133"/>
whole de≈øign, therefore we mu≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily refer our ≈øelves, for full ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as to ≈øeveral difficulties and Objections, to the other World, when we ≈øhall ≈øee God's works, together with the relation of every part to the whole de≈øign, and then many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Pa≈ø≈øages, which may now ≈øeem odd and crooked, as we look upon them by them≈øelves, will in Relation to the whole, appear to have a great deal of Rea≈øon and Regularity in them.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ≈øhall at pre≈øent only briefly, and in the general, ≈øhew that it is very credible, that there is a wi≈øe Providence, that governs the World, and intere≈øts it ≈øelf in the affairs of Men, and di≈øpo≈øeth of all Events which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us.</p>
            <p>And I de≈øire it may be ob≈øerved in the entrance upon this Argument, that the handling of this Que≈øtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Providence,</hi> doth ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>the Being of God,</hi> and that <hi>he made the World,</hi> as Principles already known and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before we come to di≈øpute of his <hi>Providence</hi>; for it would be in vain, to argue about the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, with tho≈øe who que≈øtion his <hi>Being,</hi> and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:35252:133"/>
whether <hi>the World was made by him:</hi> But ≈øuppo≈øing the≈øe <hi>two</hi> Principles, <hi>that God is,</hi> and <hi>that he made the World,</hi> it is very credible, that he ≈øhould <hi>take care of the Government of it,</hi> and e≈øpecially of one of the noble≈øt Parts of it, the race of <hi>Mankind.</hi> For we cannot believe, that he who employed ≈øo much Power and Wi≈ødom, in the rai≈øing of this great and magnificent Pile, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhing every part of it with ≈øuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Creatures, ≈øo exqui≈øitely and ≈øo wi≈øely fitted for the u≈øe and ≈øervice of one another, ≈øhould ≈øo ≈øoon as he had perfected it, for≈øake his own Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, and take no farther care of it; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially con≈øidering that it is no trouble and di≈øquiet to him, either to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what is done here below, or to interpo≈øe for the regulating of any Di≈øorders that may happen; for Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Knowledge, and Wi≈ødom, and Power can do this with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ea≈øe, knows all things, and can do all things, without any di≈øturbance of its own happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>And this hath always been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apprehen≈øion of Mankind, that God knows all things, and ob≈øerves every thing that is done in the World,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:35252:134"/>
and when he plea≈øeth, interpo≈øes in the affairs of it. 'Tis true indeed the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> did deny that God either made the World, or governs it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wi≈øe Men always doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did indeed believe the Being of God, or not; but being unwilling to incur the danger of ≈øo odious an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, they were content for fa≈øhion ≈øake, to own his Being, provided they might take away the be≈øt and mo≈øt ≈øub≈øtantial Arguments for the proof o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> it. The re≈øt of the Philo≈øophers owned a Providence, at lea≈øt a general Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that took care of great and more important Matters, but did not de≈øcend to a con≈øtant and particular care of every Per≈øon, and every little Event belonging to them. <hi>Interdum cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio≈øus ≈øingulorum,</hi> ≈øays <hi>Tully; now and then, when he plea≈øes, he takes care of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Per≈øons, and their le≈ø≈øer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; but many of them thought, that God did generally neglect the ≈ømaller and more incon≈øiderable affairs of the World, <hi>Dii minora negligunt, neque agello<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> ≈øingulorum &amp; viticulas per≈øequuntur, The Gods overlook ≈ømaller matters, and do not mind every Mans little Field and Vine.</hi> Such imperfect apprehen≈øions had they
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:35252:134"/>
of the Providence of God. And tho' they would ≈øeem hereby to con≈øult the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ea≈øe of the Deity, by exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from the care and trouble of le≈ø≈øer Matters, yet in truth and reality, they ca≈øt a di≈øhonourable reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as if it were a burthen to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Knowledge, and Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, to take care of every thing.</p>
            <p>But now Divine Revelation hath put this matter out of doubt, by a≈ø≈øuring us of God's particular care of all Per≈øons and Events. Our Saviour tells us, that God's Providence extends to the lea≈øt and mo≈øt incon≈øiderable Creatures, <hi>to the gra≈øs of the Field, which to day is, and to morrow is ca≈øt into the Oven,</hi> Mat. 6.30. <hi>To the fowls of the air,</hi> and that to the lea≈øt of them, even to <hi>the Sparrows, two of which are ≈øold for a Farthing, and yet not one of them falleth to the ground without God, Mat.</hi> 10.29. Much more doth the Providence of God extend to <hi>Men,</hi> which are Creatures far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable, and to the very lea≈øt thing that belongs to us, <hi>to the very hairs of our head, which are all numbered,</hi> the lowe≈øt in≈øtance that can be thought on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:35252:135"/>So that the light of Nature owns a more <hi>general Providence</hi>; and Divine Revelation hath rectified tho≈øe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect apprehen≈øions which Men had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and hath ≈øatisfied us, that it extends it ≈øelf to <hi>all particulars,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the lea≈øt things and mo≈øt incon≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. And this is no ways incredible, con≈øidering the Infinite Perfection of the Divine Nature, in re≈øpect of which, God can with as much and greater ea≈øe, take care of every thing, than we can do of any one thing; and the belief of this is the great foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Men therefore pray to God for the good they want, and to be freed from the evils they fear, becau≈øe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he always regards and hears them. Men therefore make Con≈øcience of their Duty, becau≈øe they believe God ob≈øerves them, and will reward and puni≈øh their good and evil Deeds. So that take away the Providence of God, and we pull down one of the main Pillars upon which Religion ≈øtands, we rob our ≈øelves of one of the greate≈øt Comforts and be≈øt Refuges in the Afflictions and Calamities of this life, and of all our hopes of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in the next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:35252:135"/>And tho' there be many di≈øorders in the World, e≈øpecially in the Affairs of Men, the mo≈øt irregular and intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Piece of God's Creation; yet this is far from being a ≈øufficient Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on again≈øt <hi>the Providence of God,</hi> if we con≈øider, that God made Man a free Creature, and capable of abu≈øing his Liberty, and intends this pre≈øent life for a ≈øtate of trial in order to another, where Men ≈øhall receive the ju≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their Actions here: And then if we con≈øider, that many of the evils and di≈øorders, which God permits to happen, are capable of being over-ruled by him to a greater good, and are made many times to ≈øerve wi≈øe and excellent purpo≈øes, and that the Providence of God does ≈øometimes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly and remarkably interpo≈øe, for the prevention and remedy of great Di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Confu≈øions; I ≈øay con≈øidering all this, it is no blemi≈øh to the Divine Providence, to permit many of tho≈øe Irregularities which are in the World, and ≈øuffer the Fates of good and bad Men to be ≈øo cro≈øs and unequal in this life. For ≈øuppo≈øing another life after this, wherein Men ≈øhall come to an Account, and every Man ≈øhall receive
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:35252:136"/>
the ju≈øt recompence of his Actions, there will then be a proper Sea≈øon and full Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, of ≈øeting all things ≈øtreight, and no Man ≈øhall have rea≈øon then, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to glory in his wickedne≈øs, or to complain of his ≈øufferings in this World. This is the <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> that God's Providence governs the World, and intere≈øts it ≈øelf in the affairs of Men, and di≈øpo≈øeth of all Events that happens to them; and this is a very good Rea≈øon, why we ≈øhould <hi>ca≈øt</hi> our particular <hi>cares upon him,</hi> who hath undertaken the Government of the whole.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Providence of God is more peculiarly concerned for good Men, and he takes a more particular and e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial care of them. The Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks this to Chri≈øtians, <hi>ca≈øt all your care on him, for he careth for you.</hi> And this <hi>David</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits in a more peculiar manner to good Men; <hi>ca≈øt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he will ≈øu≈øtain thee, he ≈øhall never ≈øuffer the righteous to be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Providence of God many times pre≈øerves good Men from tho≈øe Evils which happen to others, and by a peculiar and remarkable interpo≈øition, re≈øcues them out of tho≈øe Calamities which it ≈øuffers others to fall into;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:35252:136"/>
and God many times ble≈ø≈øeth good Men, with remarkable pro≈øperity and ≈øucce≈øs in their Affairs. To which purpo≈øe there are innumerable Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Promi≈øes in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ≈øo well known that I ≈øhall not trouble you with the recital of them.</p>
            <p>Notwith≈øtanding which, it cannot de denyed, that good Men fall into many Evils, and are harra≈ø≈øed with great Afflictions in this World: but then the Providence of God u≈øually ordereth it ≈øo, that they are armed with great Patience to bear them, and find great comfort and ≈øupport under them, and make better u≈øe and improvement of them than others; ≈øo that one way or other they turn to their advantage. So the Apo≈øtle a≈ø≈øures us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.</hi> All the Evils and Afflictions, which happen to good men, con≈øpire one way or other to the promoting of their happine≈øs, many times in this World, to be ≈øure they make a great addition to it in the other. So the ≈øame Apo≈øtle tels us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:35252:137"/>
weight of glory, whil≈øt we look not,</hi> &amp;c. And can we ≈øay God's Providence neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects us, when he rewards our temporal Sufferings with eternal Glory; when through <hi>many hard≈øhips and tribulations,</hi> he at la≈øt brings us to <hi>a Kingdom</hi>? Was <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> neglected by God, when, by a great deal of hard u≈øage, and a long impri≈øonment, he was rai≈øed to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt dignity in a great Kingdom? Or rather, was not the Providence of God very remarkable towards him, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king tho≈øe Sufferings ≈øo many Steps to his Glory, and the occa≈øion of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement? And is not God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards good men as kind and as remarkable, in bringing them to an infinitely better and more glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by Tribulations and Sufferings; and making <hi>our light Afflictions which are but for a moment, to work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>?</p>
            <p>Thus you ≈øee what is implyed in God's <hi>care</hi> of us in general; that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the World, and di≈øpo≈øeth all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; and particularly, that he is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly concerned for good Men, and takes a more e≈øpecial care of them. Let us now ≈øee of what force this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:35252:137"/>
is, to per≈øwade to the Duty enjoyned in the Text, <hi>to ca≈øt all our care upon God</hi>; that is, after all prudent Care and Diligence hath been u≈øed on our part, not to be anxious and ≈øolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about the event of things, but to leave that to God. Now this con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that <hi>God cares for us,</hi> ≈øhould be an Argument to us, <hi>to ca≈øt all our care upon him,</hi> upon the≈øe <hi>two</hi> Accounts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Becau≈øe if <hi>God cares for us,</hi> our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments are in the be≈øt and ≈øafe≈øt hands.</item>
               <item>2. Becau≈øe all our Anxiety and Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will do us no good.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Becau≈øe if <hi>God cares for us,</hi> our Concernments are in the be≈øt and ≈øafe≈øt hands, and where we ≈øhould de≈øire to have them; infinitely ≈øafer, than under any Care and Conduct of our own. And this ought to be a great ≈øatisfaction to our Minds, and to free us from all di≈øquieting Thoughts; for if God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes the care of us, then are we ≈øure that nothing ≈øhall happen to us, but by the di≈øpo≈øal or permi≈ø≈øion of Infinite Wi≈ødom and Goodne≈øs. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things indeed, which to us ≈øeem <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Accident</hi>; but in re≈øpect of God, they are <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>De≈øign</hi>;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:35252:138"/>
they may appear to happen by chance, or may proceed from the ill-will and malicious intent of ≈øecond Cau≈øes; but they are all wi≈øely de≈øigned; and as they are appointed or permitted by God, they are the re≈øult of the deepe≈øt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, and the greate≈øt Goodne≈øs. And can we wi≈øh that we and our Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ≈øhould be in better or ≈øafer hands, than of Infinite Power and Wi≈ødom, in conjunction with Infinite Love and Goodne≈øs? And if we be careful to do our Duty, and to demean our ≈øelves towards God as we ought, we may re≈øt a≈ø≈øured of his Love and Care of us; and if we do in good earne≈øt believe the Providence of God, we cannot but think that he hath a peculiar regard to tho≈øe that love and ≈øerve him, and that he will take a peculiar care of their Concernments, and that he can, and will di≈øpo≈øe them better for us, than we could manage them our ≈øelves, if we were left to our ≈øelves, and our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were put into <hi>the hands of our own Coun≈øel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Put the ca≈øe we had the entire or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and di≈øpo≈øal of our ≈øelves, what were rea≈øonable for us to do in this ca≈øe? We would ≈øurely, according to our
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:35252:138"/>
be≈øt wi≈ødom and judgment, do the be≈øt we could for our ≈øelves, and when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on experience of our own manifold ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and weakne≈øs, we had found our weightie≈øt Affairs and De≈øigns fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to mi≈øcarry, for want of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øight, or power, or skill to obviate and prevent the infinite Hazards and Di≈øap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments which humane Affairs are liable to, we ≈øhould then look about us; and if we knew any Per≈øon much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer, and more powerful than our ≈øelves, who we believed did heartily love us, and wi≈øh well to us, we would out of kindne≈øs to our ≈øelves, ask his Coun≈øel in our Affairs, and crave his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance; and if we could prevail with him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the care of our Concernments, we would commit them all to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Government, in confidence of his great Wi≈ødom and Good-will to us.</p>
            <p>Now God is ≈øuch an one, he loves us as well as we do our ≈øelves, and de≈øires our Happine≈øs as much, and knows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better than we do, what means are mo≈øt conducing to it, and will mo≈øt effectually ≈øecure it. And every Man that believes thus of God, (as every Man mu≈øt do, that believes there is a God,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:35252:139"/>
for the≈øe are the natural and e≈ø≈øential Notions which all Men have of the Deity) I ≈øay, every Man that believes thus of God, the fir≈øt thing he would do (if he knew not already that God had voluntarily, and of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, undertaken the care of him and of his Affairs) would be to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to God, and to be≈øeech him with all earne≈øtne≈øs and importunity, that he would permit him to refer his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments to him, and be plea≈øed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the care of them; and he would, without any demur or difficulty, give up him≈øelf wholly to him, to guide and govern him, and to di≈øpo≈øe of him as to him ≈øhould ≈øeem be≈øt.</p>
            <p>Now if God have prevented us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and without our De≈øire taken this care upon him≈øelf, we ought to rejoice in it, as the greate≈øt happine≈øs that could po≈ø≈øibly have befallen us; and we ≈øhould without any farther care and anxiety, u≈øing our own be≈øt diligence, and ≈øtudying to plea≈øe him, chearfully leave our ≈øelves in his Hands, with the greate≈øt confidence and ≈øecurity, that he will do all that for us which is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be≈øt; and with a firm per≈øwa≈øion, that that condition, and tho≈øe circum≈øtances

of Life, which he ≈øhall chu≈øe for us, will be no other but the very ≈øame which we would chu≈øe for our ≈øelves, if we were as wi≈øe as he.</p>
            <p>And it is ≈øo natural for Men to think thus of God, that the very Heathen Poet had the ≈øame Idea of him, and upon that ground, advi≈øeth us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all our Concernments to him.

            </p>
            <p>If therefore we be fully per≈øwaded of God's infinitely Wi≈øe and Good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we ought certainly to refer our ≈øelves to him, and perfectly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie≈øce in his di≈øpo≈øal, and to re≈øt ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in whatever he does, and whatever condition he a≈ø≈øigns to us, we ought to be contented with it: if we be not, we find fault with his Wi≈ødom, and reproach his Goodne≈øs, and wi≈øh the Government of the World in better hands.</p>
            <p>So that a firm belief of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, as it would take away all Anxiety concerning future Events, ≈øo would it likewi≈øe ≈øilence all tho≈øe Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and Di≈øcontents, which are apt to ari≈øe in us, when things fall out cro≈øs to our De≈øires, when Di≈øa≈øters and Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments happen to us, and the Providence of God ca≈øts us into Sickne≈øs, or Poverty, or Di≈øgrace.

Calamities which befell him. <hi>I held my peace</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>and ≈øpake not a word, becau≈øe thou Lord did≈øt it.</hi> And this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe ≈øhould keep us from fretting and vexing at In≈øtruments, and ≈øecond Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes; to con≈øider that the Wi≈øe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God over ruleth and di≈øpo≈øeth the Actions of Men, and that no harm can happen to us without his permi≈ø≈øion.

            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:35252:141"/>We are indeed liable to many things in this World, which have a great deal of evil and affliction in them, to Poverty, and Pain, and Reproach, and Re≈øtraint, and the lo≈øs of our Friends and near Relations, and the≈øe are great Afflictions, and very cro≈øs and di≈øta≈øtful to us, and therefore when we are in Danger of any of the≈øe, and apprehend them to be making towards us, we are apt to be anxious and full of trouble, and when they befal us, we are prone to cen≈øure the Providence of God, and to judge ra≈øhly concerning it, as if all things were not ordered by it for the be≈øt: but we ≈øhould con≈øider, that we are very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ≈øhort ≈øighted Creatures, and ≈øee but a litttle way before us, are not able to penetrate into the De≈øigns of God, and to look to the End of his Providence. We cannot (as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> expre≈ø≈øeth it) <hi>≈øee the work of God from the beginning to the end</hi>; whereas if we ≈øaw the whole de≈øign of Providence together, we ≈øhould ≈øtrangly admire the beauty and proportion of it, and ≈øhould ≈øee it to be very wi≈øe and good.

            </p>
            <p>When Children are under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Parents, or the di≈øcipline of their Teachers, they are apt to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at them, and think it very hard to be denyed ≈øo many things which they de≈øire, and to be con≈øtrained by ≈øeverities to a great many things which are grievous and tedious to them: but the Parent and the Ma≈øter know very well, that it is their Ignorance and Incon≈øideratene≈øs which makes them to think ≈øo, and that when they come to Years, and to under≈øtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:35252:142"/>
better, then they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that all that which gave them ≈øo much di≈øcontent, was really for their good, and that it was their Childi≈øhne≈øs and Folly, which made them to think otherwi≈øe, and that they had in all probability been undone, had they been indulged in their humour, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in every thing to have their own will; they had not Wit and Con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough, to tru≈øt the Di≈øcretion of their Parents and Governours, and to believe that even tho≈øe things which were ≈øo di≈øplea≈øing to them, would at la≈øt tend to their good.</p>
            <p>There is a far greater di≈øtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wi≈ødom of God and Men, and we are infinitely more Ignorant and Childi≈øh in re≈øpect of God, than our Children are in re≈øpect of us; and being per≈øwaded of this, we ought to reckon, that while we are in this World, under God's care and di≈øcipline, it is nece≈ø≈øary for our good, that we be re≈øtrained in many things, which we eagerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire; and ≈øuffer many things that are grievous to us; and that when we come to Heaven, and are grown up to be Men, and <hi>have put away childi≈øh thoughts,</hi> and are come to under≈øtand things,

as they truly are, and not <hi>in a riddle,</hi> and darkne≈øs, as we now do; then <hi>the Judgement of God will break forth as the light, and the righteou≈øne≈øs</hi> of all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>as the noon Day,</hi> then all the Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of Providence will be clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to us, and we ≈øhall ≈øee a plain Rea≈øon for all tho≈øe Di≈øpen≈øations which we were ≈øo much ≈øtumbled at, and acknowledge the great Wi≈ødom and Goodne≈øs of them.</p>
            <p>You ≈øee then what Rea≈øon there is to refer our ≈øelves to the Providence of God, and <hi>to ca≈øt all our care upon him,</hi> to tru≈øt him with the Admini≈øtration and Di≈øpo≈øal of all our Concernments, and firmly to believe, that if we love God, and be careful to plea≈øe him, every thing in the i≈ø≈øue will turn to the be≈øt for us; and therefore we ≈øhould not anxiou≈øly trouble our ≈øelves about the Events of things, but re≈øign up our≈øelves to the good plea≈øure of him, who di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øeth all things <hi>according to the Coun≈øel of his Will,</hi> entirely tru≈øting in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and in his Fatherly care of us, and affection to us, that he will order all things for us, for the be≈øt, referring the ≈øucce≈øs of all our Concernments to him, <hi>in who≈øe hands are all the ways of <pb n="268" facs="tcp:35252:143"/>

            <p>And this is a proper Expre≈ø≈øion of our Confidence in God's Wi≈ødom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, to refer things to him before the Event, and to ≈øay with the Chri≈øtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.14. <hi>The will of the Lord be done,</hi> becau≈øe this ≈øhews that we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded that God will do better for us, than our own Coun≈øel and Choice; and to ≈øubmit to his will after the Event, is likewi≈øe a great in≈øtance of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him, and that we believe that he hath done that which is be≈øt: For when God, by his Providence, declares his Will in any ca≈øe, we ≈øhould look upon it, as the Sentence of a wi≈øe and ju≈øt Judge, in which all Parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ought to acquie≈øce, and re≈øt fully ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p>And this may well be expected from us Chri≈øtians, who have much greater a≈ø≈øurance of the <hi>Particular</hi> Providence of God, than the Heathen had; and yet ≈øome of them, were able to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves from all trouble and anxiety, from murmuring and di≈øcontent.

            <p n="2">2. is, Becau≈øe all our Anxiety and Care will do us no good; on the contrary, it will certainly do us hurt.

Things are governed and di≈øpo≈øed by a higher hand, and placed out of our reach; we may delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and contrive, and u≈øe our be≈øt endeavours, for the effecting of our De≈øigns, but we cannot ≈øecure the Event again≈øt a thou≈øand interpo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Divine Providence, which we can neither fore≈øee nor hinder; but yet notwith≈øtanding, the≈øe our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are rea≈øonable, becau≈øe they are the ordinary Means which God hath appointed, for the procuring of good and prevention of Evil, and tho' they may mi≈øcarry, yet they are all we can do: but after this is done, trouble and anxiety about the Event is the vaine≈øt thing in the World, becau≈øe it is to no purpo≈øe, nor doth at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to what we de≈øire; <hi>we di≈øquiet our ≈øelves in vain,</hi> and we di≈øtru≈øt God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Care of us, and thereby provoke him to defeat and di≈øappoint us.</p>
            <p>Let us then by the≈øe Con≈øiderations be per≈øwaded to this Duty, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice whereof is of continual and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal u≈øe in the whole cour≈øe of our

            <p>We cannot but be convinced, that this is very rea≈øonable, to leave the Management of things to him who made them, and therefore under≈øtands be≈øt how to order them. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World is a very curious and complicated Thing, and not to be tamper'd with by every unskilful Hand; and therefore as an unskilful Man, after he hath tampered a great while with a Watch, thinking to bring it into better order, and is at la≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he can do no good upon it, carries it to him that made it, to mend it and put it into order; ≈øo mu≈øt we do, after all our Care and Anxiety about our own private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, or the publick State of Things, we mu≈øt give over governing the World, as a bu≈øine≈øs pa≈øt our Skill, as a Province too hard, and <hi>a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

too wonderful for us,</hi> and leave it to him, who made the World, to Govern it, and take care of it.</p>
            <p>And if we be not thus Affected and Di≈øpo≈øed, we do not believe the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, whatever profe≈ø≈øion we make of it; if we did, it would have an influence upon our Minds, to free us from Anxious Care and Di≈øcontent.

to con≈øider tho≈øe famous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances and Arguments of the Divine Wi≈ødom, in the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World; the <hi>Government</hi> of it; and the <hi>redemption of mankind by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> The <hi>two</hi> fir≈øt of the≈øe I have ≈øpoken to, namely the Wi≈ødom of God, which appears in the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the World.

            </p>
            <p>The Apo≈øtle in the beginning of this Epi≈øtle, upon occa≈øion of his mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divi≈øions and Parties that were among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where one ≈øaid, <hi>I am of Paul</hi>; another, <hi>I am of Apollos</hi>; asks them, whether <hi>Paul was crucified for them?</hi> or whether <hi>they were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name of Paul?</hi> To convince them that they could not pretend this, that they were Baptized into his Name, he tells them at the 14, and 15<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi> ver≈øes</hi>; that <hi>he had not ≈øo much as baptized any of them, except two or three</hi>; ≈øo far was he from having Baptized them into his own Name; and at the 17<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi> ver≈øe,</hi> he ≈øays, that his work, his principal work, was
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:35252:147"/>
               <hi>to preach the Go≈øpel,</hi> which he had done, not with Humane Eloquence, <hi>not in wi≈ødom of words,</hi> but with great plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and ≈øimplicity, <hi>le≈øt the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt ≈øhould be made of none effect</hi>; le≈øt, if he ≈øhould have u≈øed any Artifice, the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ≈øhould have been le≈øs powerful. And indeed his Preaching was unaffectedly plain, and therefore the Go≈øpel did ≈øeem to very many to be a fooli≈øh and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous thing. The Story which they told of <hi>Chri≈øt Crucified,</hi> was <hi>to the Jews a ≈øtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> who expected another kind of <hi>Me≈ø≈øias,</hi> that ≈øhould come in great Pomp and Glory, to be a mighty Temporal Prince, they were angry at the Story of <hi>a crucified Chri≈øt.</hi> The <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Philo≈øophers, who expected ≈øome curious Theories, adorned with Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and delivered and laid down according to the exact Rules of Art, they derided this plain and ≈øimple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Chri≈øt, and of the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>But tho' this De≈øign of the Go≈øpel appeared ≈øilly and fooli≈øh to ra≈øh and incon≈øiderate and prejudiced Minds, yet <hi>to them that are called,</hi> to them that do believe, <hi>both Jews and Gentiles, Chri≈øt, the power of God, and the Wi≈ødom of God;

            <p>So that the <hi>redemption of Man by Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> is a De≈øign of admirable <hi>Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ≈øhall endeavour to confirm to you.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. By general Te≈øtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And</item>
               <item>II. By a more particular enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of this De≈øign, and the Means how it is accompli≈øh'd.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. By Te≈øtimonies from Scripture. You know I have all along, in my Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes of the Attributes of God, u≈øed this Method of proving them, from the Dictates of Natural Light, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Scripture: But now I mu≈øt for≈øake my wonted Method, for here the Light of Nature leaves me. The Wi≈ødom of <hi>Creation</hi> is manife≈øt in <hi>the things which are made; the heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God's</hi> Wi≈ødom, <hi>and the firmament ≈øhews his handy-work.</hi> The Works of God do preach and ≈øet forth the Wi≈ødom of the Creator; but the Sun, Moon, and Stars, do not preach the <hi>Go≈øpel.</hi> The Wi≈ødom of <hi>redemption</hi> is
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:35252:148"/>
               <hi>Wi≈ødom in a my≈øtery, hidden wi≈ødom, which none of the Princes,</hi> or Philo≈øophers, <hi>of this World knew.</hi> The ≈øharpe≈øt Wits, and the highe≈øt and mo≈øt rai≈øed Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandings among≈øt the Heathens, could ≈øay nothing of this. Here <hi>the Wi≈ødom of the Wi≈øe,</hi> and <hi>the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtanding of the Prudent</hi> is po≈øed, and we may make the Apo≈øtles challenge, <hi>v.</hi> 20. of this Chapter, <hi>Where is the Wi≈øe, where is the Di≈øputer of this World?</hi> There is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light di≈øcovers Chri≈øt; the <hi>Wi≈øe men</hi> cannot find him out, unle≈øs a <hi>≈øtar</hi> be created on purpo≈øe to lead and direct to him. Therefore in this I ≈øhall only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Divine Revelation. 1 Cor. 2.7, 8. the <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> is called <hi>the wi≈ødom of God in a my≈øtery, even the hidden wi≈ødom which God ordained before the world unto our glory; Which none of the Princes of this world knew.</hi> Eph. 1.7, 8. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgivene≈øs of ≈øins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded toward us in all Wi≈ødom and Prudence.</hi> Eph. 3.10, 11. <hi>The manifold wi≈ødom of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eternal purpo≈øe which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed in Chri≈øt Je≈øus our Lord.</hi> This work of <hi>our redemption by Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> is ≈øo various and admirable, that it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

the Angels to know and under≈øtand it. <hi>To the intent, that unto principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known the manifold wi≈ødom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. By inquiring more particularly into the nature of this De≈øign, and the Means how it is accompli≈øht. This is <hi>Wi≈ødom,</hi> to fit Means to Ends; and the more difficult the End, the greater Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is required to find out ≈øuitable and ≈øufficient Means for the accompli≈øhment, of the End. Now <hi>the wi≈ødom of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> will appear, if we con≈øider the ca≈øe of fallen Man; and what fit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ≈øuitable Means, the Wi≈ødom of God hath devi≈øed for our Recovery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us con≈øider the Ca≈øe of fallen Man, which was very ≈øad, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of the Mi≈øery, and the Difficulty of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In re≈øpect of the Mi≈øery of it. Man, who was made Holy and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right by God, having, by his voluntary Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, and wilful Di≈øobedience, fall'n from him, did pre≈øently ≈øink into a corrupt and degenerate, into a mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and cur≈øed Condition, of which Heaven and Earth, and his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience bore him Witne≈øs. Man, being become a Sinner, is not only deprived
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:35252:149"/>
of the Image of God, but is liable to his Ju≈øtice; here was his Mi≈øery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The difficulty of the Ca≈øe was this, Man could not recover him≈øelf and rai≈øe him≈øelf out of his own ruin; no Creature was able to do it; ≈øo that our help is only in God; and indeed he is a merciful God, and doth not de≈øire our Ruin, nor delight in our De≈øtruction: But ≈øuppo≈øe his Mercy never ≈øo willing to ≈øave us, will not his Holine≈øs, and Ju≈øtice, and Truth, check tho≈øe forward Inclinations of his Goodne≈øs, and hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er all the De≈øigns of his Mercy? Is not ≈øin contrary to the Holy Nature of God? hath not he declared his Infinite hatred of it? hath not he threatned it with heavy and dreadful Puni≈øhment? and ≈øaid, that <hi>the ≈øinner ≈øhall die,</hi> that <hi>he will not acquit the guilty,</hi> nor <hi>let ≈øin go unpuni≈øh'd?</hi> Should he now, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ≈øatisfaction to his offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, pardon the Sinner, remit his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment, and receive him to favour? would this be agreeable to his Holine≈øs, and Ju≈øtice, and Truth? would this become the Wi≈øe Governour of the World, who loves Righteou≈øne≈øs and Order; who hates ≈øin, and is obliged

            <p>So that here is a conflict of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Perfections of God. The Mercy of God pities our Mi≈øery, and would recover us, would open <hi>Paradi≈øe</hi> to us; but there is a <hi>flaming Sword</hi> that keeps us out; the incen≈øed Ju≈øtice of God that mu≈øt be ≈øatisfied; and if he take vengeance of us, we are eternally ruin'd; if he ≈øpare us, how ≈øhall <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Ju≈øtice meet together?</hi> how ≈øhall God at once expre≈øs his Love to the Sinner, and his hatred to ≈øin? here is the difficulty of our Ca≈øe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us now enquire what Means the Wi≈ødom of God u≈øeth for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. The Wi≈ødom of God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øed this expedient to accommodate all the≈øe Difficulties, to reconcile the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Ju≈øtice of God. The Son of God ≈øhall undertake this work, and ≈øatisfie the offended Ju≈øtice of God, and repair the ruin'd Nature of Man. He ≈øhall bring God and Man together, make up this Gulph, and renew the Commerce and Corre≈øpondence between God and us, which was broken off by Sin. The work that God de≈øigns is the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man, that is, his recovery from
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:35252:151"/>
a ≈øtate of Sin and Eternal Death, to a ≈øtate of Holine≈øs and Eternal Life. The Son of God is to engage in this De≈øign of our Redemption, to ≈øatisfie the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Ju≈øtice of God toward us, ≈øo as to purcha≈øe our deliverance from the Wrath to come, and ≈øo as to re≈øtore us to the Image and Favour of God, that we may be ≈øanctified, and be made Heirs of Eternal Life.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The fitne≈øs of the Means whereby he was to accompli≈øh it; and the≈øe I ≈øhall refer to <hi>two</hi> Heads, his <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Exaltation.</hi> All the Parts of the≈øe are very ≈øub≈øervient to the De≈øign of our Redemption.</p>

            <p>In general, this made him a fit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, an equal and middle Per≈øon to interpo≈øe in this Difference, and take up this Quarrel between God and Man. Being both God and man, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for both Parties, and intere≈øted both in the Honour of God, and the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:35252:152"/>
Happine≈øs of Man, and engaged to be tender of both; and to procure the one by ≈øuch ways as might be con≈øi≈øtent with the other.</p>
            <p>More particularly, his <hi>Incarnation</hi> did fit him for tho≈øe <hi>two</hi> Offices which he was to perform in his Humiliation, of <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Prie≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Office of <hi>Prophet,</hi> to teach us both by his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and his <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his Doctrine. His being in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of <hi>Man,</hi> this made him more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to us. He was <hi>a Prophet rai≈øed up from among his Brethren,</hi> as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øpeaks, and he makes this an Argument why we ≈øhould hear him. Should God ≈øpeak to us immediately by him≈øelf, we <hi>could not hear him and live.</hi> God conde≈øcends to us, and complies with the weakne≈øs of our Nature, and <hi>rai≈øeth up a Prophet from among our brethren</hi>; We ≈øhould <hi>hear him.</hi> And then his being <hi>God,</hi> did add Credit and Authority to what he ≈øpake; he could confirm the Doctrine which he taught, by Miracles. Of his teaching us by his <hi>Life,</hi> I ≈øhall have occa≈øion to ≈øpeak pre≈øently.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Office of <hi>Prie≈øt.</hi> He was fit to be our <hi>Prie≈øt,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from among Men,</hi> as the Apo≈øtle
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:35252:153"/>
≈øpeaks; fit to ≈øuffer as being, <hi>Man</hi> having <hi>a body prepared,</hi> as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. and fit to <hi>≈øatisfie</hi> by his ≈øufferings for the Sins of all Men, as being <hi>God,</hi> which put an infinite Dignity and Value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the ≈øufferings of an <hi>infinite Per≈øon</hi> being equal to the offences done again≈øt an <hi>Infinite God.</hi> And thus the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God is exalted, without the Diminution of his <hi>Ju≈øtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as his <hi>Incarnation</hi> did qualifie him for ≈øuffering, ≈øo for compa≈ø≈øion, and fellow-≈øuffering with us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-prie≈øt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ≈øins of the people; for in that he him≈øelf hath ≈øuffer'd being tempted, he is able to ≈øuccour them that are tempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>Life</hi> was a means admirably fitted to bring Men to Holine≈øs and Goodne≈øs. I might go through all the parts of it, but becau≈øe I intend to be very ≈øhort upon the≈øe Heads, I ≈øhall only take notice of that Part of his Life, which was ≈øpent in his publick Mini≈øtry; <hi>he went about doing good</hi>; the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that he Preached was Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the de≈øtroying of Sin, and the promoting of Holine≈øs; the great End
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:35252:153"/>
and De≈øign of it was to advance Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs, and Goodne≈øs, and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Patience, and Self-denial; to make us mortifie our ≈øen≈øual De≈øires, and bruti≈øh Pa≈ø≈øions, to contemn and renounce this pre≈øent World; and this being the de≈øign of it, it was a mo≈øt proper Engine to demol≈øh the Works of the Devil: and to make way for the entertainment of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the whole frame of his <hi>Life,</hi> and all the circum≈øtances of it did contribute. His <hi>Life</hi> was the practice of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and a clear comment upon it. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of his Condition in the World, that he had no ≈øhare of the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of it, were a great advantage to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ≈øelf-denial and contempt of the World. <hi>The Captain of our Salvation,</hi> that he might draw off our Affections from the World, and ≈øhew us how little the things of it are to be valued, would him≈øelf have no ≈øhare in it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.20. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have ne≈øts; but the ≈øon of Man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> The mean circum≈øtances of his Condition were very eminently for the advantage of his De≈øign; for had he not been ≈øtript of all worldly Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:35252:154"/>
he could not have been ≈øo free from ≈øu≈øpition of a worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt and De≈øign; nay he could not have been ≈øo Con≈øiderable; he was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>greater</hi> for his Meanne≈øs. The very Heathens did account this true Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, (as we find in <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi>) not to admire the Plea≈øures, and Greatne≈øs, and Pomp of the World. And that his Meanne≈øs might be no Di≈øadvantage to him, tho≈øe Evidences that he gave of his Divinity in the wonderful Things that he did, rendred him con≈øiderable, and gained more Reverence and Authority to his Doctrine, then his Meanne≈øs could bring Contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, the manner of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation was a very great Advantage to him; he was of a very ≈øweet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øable and obliging Temper; and by this Means he did gain upon the People, and was acceptable to them; and thus he did apply him≈øelf to them in the mo≈øt Humane ways, to make way for the Entertainment of his Doctrins. The Miracles that he wrought did confirm his Doctrine beyond all Exception, as being a Divine Te≈øtimony, and ≈øetting the Seal of God to the truth of it; yet
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:35252:154"/>
becau≈øe many were blinded with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and tho' they <hi>did ≈øee,</hi> yet <hi>would not ≈øee,</hi> Chri≈øt <hi>the Wi≈ødom of God</hi> did ≈øo order the bu≈øine≈øs of his Miracles, as to make them Humane ways of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, for they were generally ≈øuch as were beneficial, <hi>he healed all manner of Di≈øea≈øes</hi> and <hi>Maladies</hi> by this Miraculous Power; and ≈øo his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles did not only tend to confirm his Doctrine, as they were <hi>Miracles,</hi> but to make way for entertainment of it, as they were <hi>benefits</hi>; this was a ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demon≈øtration to them that he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> them good, becau≈øe he <hi>did</hi> them good; they would ea≈øily believe, that he who healed their <hi>Bodies,</hi> would not harm their <hi>Souls.</hi> This for his <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. His <hi>Death,</hi> which was the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt ≈øtep of his <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øummation of his ≈øufferings. Now the <hi>Death</hi> of Chri≈øt did eminently contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to this De≈øign of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Death of Chri≈øt did not only expiate the guilt of Sin, and pacifie Con≈øcience, by making plenary Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Divine Ju≈øtice; but did eminently contribute to the killing of Sin in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old Man is crucified with him, that the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:35252:155"/>
body of ≈øin might be de≈øtroyed, that henceforth we might not ≈øerve Sin.</hi> Rom. 8.3. <hi>God ≈øending his own Son in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of ≈øinful fle≈øh, and for ≈øin</hi> (that is by being a ≈øacrifice for Sin) <hi>condemned ≈øin in the fle≈øh.</hi> The <hi>Death</hi> of Chri≈øt convinceth Sin to be a great Evil; and doth <hi>Condemn it,</hi> becau≈øe the impartial Ju≈øtice of God did ≈øo ≈øeverely puni≈øh it in his own Son, when he appeared in the Per≈øon of a Sinner; and this is the mo≈øt powerful Argument to us to crucifie Sin, that it crucified our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. That ≈øo Innocent and Holy a Per≈øon ≈øhould ≈øuffer ≈øo cruel and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious a Death for our Sins, ≈øhould ≈øet us for ever again≈øt it, and make us hate it with a perfect hatred.</p>
            <p>The circum≈øtances of Chri≈øt's ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings are with admirable Wi≈ødom fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the conquering of Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Sin came by the <hi>Woman:</hi> the <hi>≈øeed of the Woman</hi> ≈øuffers for Sin, and by ≈øuffering Conquers it. Sin began in the <hi>Garden</hi>: and there our Saviour began his ≈øufferings for Sin. Sin came by the <hi>Tree:</hi> and Chri≈øt bears the cur≈øe of it <hi>in hanging upon the Tree,</hi> and crucifies it by his Cro≈øs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:35252:155"/>And as he conquer'd ≈øin, ≈øo he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame Satan by his own Arts. The Devil found Chri≈øt in the likne≈øs of a Man, he judged him Mortal, and his great De≈øign was to procure his Death, and get him into his Grave. Chri≈øt permits him to bring about his De≈øign, he lets him enter into <hi>Judas,</hi> he lets the <hi>Jews</hi> crucifie, and put him into his Grave, and roll a great ≈øtone upon it: but here his <hi>Divine Wi≈ødom</hi> appears, in ruining the Devil by his own De≈øign, and <hi>≈ønaring him in the works of his hands</hi>; Heb. 2.14. <hi>By death he de≈øtroys him, that had the power of death, that is the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the ≈øufferings of Chri≈øt were, by the <hi>wi≈øe of the World,</hi> made the great Objection again≈øt the <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi> of this di≈øpen≈øation; the <hi>Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt was to the Greeks fooli≈øhne≈øs</hi>: and yet the <hi>wi≈øe≈øt</hi> of them had determined otherwi≈øe in general, tho' not in this particular Ca≈øe. <hi>Plato</hi> (in the ≈øecond Book of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth) ≈øaith,
<q>That a Man may be a perfect Pattern of Ju≈øtice and Righteou≈øne≈øs, and be approved by God and Men, he mu≈øt be ≈øtript of all the things of this World, he mu≈øt be poor and di≈øgraced, and be
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:35252:156"/>
accounted a wicked and unju≈øt Man, he mu≈øt be whipt, and tormented, and crucified as a Malefactor;</q> which is, as it were, a prophetical De≈øcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour's ≈øufferings.
And <hi>Arrian,</hi> in his <hi>Epict.</hi> de≈øcribing a Man fit to reform the World, whom he calls <q>the Apo≈øtle, the Me≈ø≈øenger, the Preacher and Mini≈øter of God, ≈øaith, he mu≈øt be without Hou≈øe and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and worldly Accommodations; mu≈øt be armed with ≈øuch Patience for the greate≈øt ≈øufferings, as if he were a Stone, and devoid of Sen≈øe; he mu≈øt be a ≈øpectacle of Mi≈øery and Contempt to the World.</q>
So that by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the≈øe <hi>two</hi> wi≈øe Heathens, there was nothing in the ≈øufferings of Chri≈øt that was unbecoming the <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi> of God, and improper to the End and De≈øign of Chri≈øt's coming into the World; be≈øides that they ≈øerved a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, which <hi>they</hi> did not dream of, <hi>the ≈øatisfying of Divine Ju≈øtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> His <hi>Exaltation.</hi> The ≈øeveral parts of which, his <hi>Re≈øurrection,</hi> and <hi>A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen≈øion,</hi> and <hi>≈øitting the right hand of God,</hi> were eminently ≈øub≈øervient to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and carrying on of this De≈øign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:35252:156"/>The <hi>Re≈øurrection</hi> of Chri≈øt is the great confirmation of the truth of all that he deliver'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Declared to be the ≈øon of God with power, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, by the Re≈øurrection from the Dead.</hi> This great Miracle of his <hi>Re≈øurrection</hi> from the Dead did <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi> the Controver≈øie, and put it out of all Doubt and Que≈øtion, that he was <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And then his <hi>A≈øcen≈øion,</hi> and <hi>≈øitting at the right hand of God,</hi> this gives us the a≈ø≈øurance of a Ble≈ø≈øed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and is a demon≈øtration of a life to come, and a pledge of everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory and Happine≈øs. And can any thing tend more to the encouragement of Obedience, and to make us Dead to the Plea≈øures and Enjoyments of this life, than the a≈ø≈øurance of Eternal Life and Happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>And then the Con≈øequents of his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,</hi> they do eminently conduce to our recovery. The ≈øending of the Holy Gho≈øt <hi>to lead us into all truth,</hi> to ≈øancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt us, and to comfort us under the greate≈øt Troubles and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; and the powerful <hi>Interce≈ø≈øion</hi> of Chri≈øt in our behalf; and his <hi>return to Judgment</hi>; the expectation whereof is the great Argument to Repentance
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:35252:157"/>
and Holine≈øs of Life. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30, 31. <hi>And the times of this ignorance God wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, but now commandeth all Men every where to repent: Becau≈øe he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the World in righteou≈øne≈øs, by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given a≈ø≈øurance unto all Men, in that he hath rai≈øed him from the dead.</hi> And thus I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove that the <hi>Redemption of Man by Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> is a De≈øign of <hi>admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wi≈ødom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>u≈øe</hi> I ≈øhall make of it, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the Uunrea≈øonablene≈øs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and the Folly and Madne≈øs of Impenitency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The unrea≈øonablene≈øs of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. The Go≈øpel reveals to us the wi≈øe Coun≈øel and Di≈øpen≈øation of God for our Redemption; and tho≈øe who disbelieve the Go≈øpel, <hi>they reject the coun≈øel of God again≈øt them≈øelves,</hi> as it is ≈øaid of the unbelieving Phari≈øees and Lawyers, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. The Go≈øpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals to us a de≈øign ≈øo rea≈øonable and full of <hi>Wi≈ødom,</hi> that they who can di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe it are de≈øperate Per≈øons, devoted to ruin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The cro≈øs of Chri≈øt is to them that peri≈øh fooli≈øhne≈øs.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <hi>But if our Go≈øpel be hid, it is hid
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:35252:157"/>
to them that are lo≈øt; in whom the God of this World hath blinded the eyes of them that believe not, le≈øt the light of the glorious Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt, who is the image of God, ≈øhould ≈øhine unto them.</hi> The Go≈øpel carries ≈øo much light and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it, that it cannot be hid from any but ≈øuch who≈øe Eyes are blinded by the Devil and their Lu≈øts.</p>
            <p>He that will duly weigh and con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Things, and look narrowly into this <hi>wi≈øe di≈øpen≈øation</hi> of God, ≈øhall find nothing to object again≈øt it; nay ≈øhall di≈øcover in it the greate≈øt motives and inducements to believe. We are apt to believe any thing that is rea≈øonable, e≈øpecially if it be for our Advantage; now this <hi>wi≈øe di≈øpen≈øation</hi> of God is not only rea≈øonable in it ≈øelf, but benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to us; it does at once highly gratifie our Under≈øtandings, and ≈øatisfie our Intere≈øt; why ≈øhould we not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and entertain it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The de≈øign of the Go≈øpel is <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable,</hi> and gratifies our Under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And in this re≈øpect the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath incomparable Advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any other Religion. The end of all Religion is to advance Piety and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and real Goodne≈øs among Men;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:35252:158"/>
and the more any Religion advanceth the≈øe, the more rea≈øonable it is. Now the great Incitements and Arguments to Piety, are the Excellency and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Divine Nature; fear of Puni≈øhment, and hopes of Pardon and Rewards. Now the Go≈øpel repre≈øents all the≈øe to the greate≈øt advantage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It repre≈øents the Perfections of God to the greate≈øt advantage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially tho≈øe which tend mo≈øt to the promotion of Piety, and the love of God in us; his <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) His <hi>Ju≈øtice.</hi> The Go≈øpel repre≈øents it inflexible in its Rights, and inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and that will not in any ca≈øe let Sin go unpuni≈øh'd. The impartiality of the Divine Ju≈øtice appears in this Di≈øpen≈øation, that when God pardons the Sinner, yet he will puni≈øh Sin ≈øo ≈øeverely in his own Son who was the Surety. Now what could more tend to di≈øcountenance Sin, and convince us of the great evil of it?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) His <hi>Mercy.</hi> This Di≈øpen≈øation is a great demon≈øtration of the Mercy, and Goodne≈øs, and Love of God, in ≈øending his Son to die for Sinners, and in ≈øaving <hi>us</hi> by devoting and ≈øacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>him,</hi> John 3.16. <hi>For God ≈øo loved
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:35252:158"/>
the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet Sinners, Chri≈øt died for us.</hi> 1 John 4.9, 10. <hi>In this was manife≈øted the love of God towards us, becau≈øe God ≈øent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ≈øent his Son to be the propitiation for our ≈øins.</hi> Now this repre≈øentation of God's Mercy and Love which the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel makes, is of great force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to melt our Hearts into love to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Argument to Piety is fear of Puni≈øhment. The Go≈øpel hath revealed to us the mi≈øery of tho≈øe who continue in their Sin; it hath made clear and terrible di≈øcoveries of tho≈øe Torments which attend ≈øinners in another World, and hath open'd to us the Trea≈øures of God's Wrath; ≈øo that now under the Go≈øpel, <hi>hell is naked before us, and de≈øtruction hath no covering</hi>; and this is one thing which makes the Go≈øpel ≈øo powerful an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to de≈øtroy ≈øin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 18. <hi>The Go≈øpel is the power of God unto ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for therein is the wrath of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:35252:159"/>
from heaven again≈øt all ungodline≈øs, and unrighteou≈øne≈øs of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Hopes of Pardon and Reward. And this, added to the former, renders the Go≈øpel the mo≈øt powerful In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take men off from ≈øin, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to Holine≈øs, that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. The Means to draw Men from ≈øin, when they are once awaken'd with the fear of Vengeance, is hopes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Mercy; and the way to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Obedience for the future, is hope of Reward. Now as an Argument to us to retreat and draw back from ≈øin, the Go≈øpel promi≈øes pardon and indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to us; and as an incitement to Holine≈øs, the Go≈øpel opens Heaven to us, and ≈øets before us everla≈øting Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Happine≈øs, and gives us the greate≈øt a≈ø≈øurance of it.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The De≈øign of the Go≈øpel is <hi>rea≈øonable,</hi> in that it does e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently and directly ≈øerve the ends of Piety and Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This Di≈øpen≈øation of God is <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi> to us, and ≈øatisfies our Intere≈øt; and this adds to the unrea≈øonablene≈øs of our Unbelief, this De≈øign of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only <hi>rea≈øonable in it ≈øelf,</hi> but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øirable to us,</hi> that it ≈øhould be ≈øo; becau≈øe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:35252:159"/>
of the eminent Advantages that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to us by it. The De≈øign of the Go≈øpel is to deliver from the Guilt and Dominion of Sin, and the Tyranny of Satan; to re≈øtore us to the Image and Favour of God; and by making us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of a Divine Nature, to bring us to Eternal Life. And is there any thing of real Advantage which is not comprehended in this? Is it not de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to every Man, that there ≈øhould be a way whereby our guilty Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may be quieted and appea≈øed; whereby we may be delivered from the fear of Death and Hell? Is it not de≈øirable to be freed from the ≈ølavery of our Lu≈øts, and re≈øcued from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Power of the great De≈øtroyer of Souls? Is it not de≈øirable to be like God, and to be a≈ø≈øured of his Love and Favour, who is the be≈øt Friend, and the mo≈øt dangerous Enemy; and to be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, that when we leave this World, we ≈øhall be un≈øpeakably happy for ever? Now the Go≈øpel conveys the≈øe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to us; and if this be the Ca≈øe of the Go≈øpel, and there be nothing in this De≈øign of our Redemption, but what is Wi≈øe and Rea≈øonable, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly for our Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:35252:163"/>At the 17 <hi>ver≈øe</hi> of this <hi>chapter,</hi> God, by a great and wonderful Conde≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his goodne≈øs, reveals to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his Intention concerning the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi>; upon this, <hi>Abraham</hi> v. 23. interceded with God for the ≈øaving of the Righteous Per≈øons, that were there; and to this end, he Pleads with God his <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> and <hi>Righteou≈øne≈øs,</hi> with which he apprehended it to be in con≈øi≈øtent, <hi>to de≈øtroy the Righteous with the wicked,</hi> which, without a Miracle, could not be avoided in a general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction. <hi>Wilt thou al≈øo de≈øtroy the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, with the Wicked? Peradventure there be fifty Righteous within the City, wilt thou al≈øo de≈øtroy, and not ≈øpare the place for the fifty Righteous that are therein? that be far from thee to do after this manner, to ≈ølay the Righteous with the Wicked, and that the Righteous ≈øhould be as the Wicked, that be far from thee, ≈øhall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> This Negative Interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is equivalent to a vehement affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>≈øhall not the Judge all the Earth do right?</hi> that is, <hi>undoubtedly he will.</hi> This we may take for a certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Principle, that <hi>in the di≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of rewards and puni≈øhments the

Judge of the World will do Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Argument that lies under our Con≈øideration is the <hi>Ju≈øtice of God in the di≈øtribution of Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> for the clearing of which, we will con≈øider it,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> In <hi>Hypothe≈øi,</hi> in regard to the particular Ca≈øe, which is here put by <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In <hi>The≈øi,</hi> we will con≈øider it in General, in <hi>the Di≈øtribution of Rewards and Puni≈øhments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> We will con≈øider it in <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øi,</hi> in regard to the particular Ca≈øe which is here put by <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Text, and the rather, becau≈øe if we look well into it, there is ≈øomething of real Difficulty in it, not ea≈øie to be cleared; for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s rea≈øoning, if it be true, does plainly Conclude, that it would have been <hi>unrighteous</hi> with God in the de≈øtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> not to make a difference between the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the Wicked, but to involve them equally in the ≈øame common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction. <hi>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to ≈ølay the Righteous with the Wicked, and that the Righteous ≈øhould be as the Wicked, that be far from
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:35252:164"/>
thee, ≈øhall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> as if he had ≈øaid, <hi>≈øurely the Judge of all the Earth will never do ≈øo unrighteous a Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet notwith≈øtanding this, we ≈øee it is very u≈øual for the Providence of God to involve good Men in general Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and to make no vi≈øible difference between the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked.</hi> Now the difficulty is, how to reconcile the≈øe appearances of Providence with this rea≈øoning of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Text.</p>
            <p>And for the doing of this, I ≈øee but one po≈ø≈øible way, and that is this, that <hi>Abraham</hi> does not here ≈øpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Judgments of God which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal Men in the ordinary Cour≈øe of his Providence, which many times happen promi≈øcuou≈øly, and involve good and bad Men in the ≈øame ruine; and the rea≈øon hereof is Plain, becau≈øe God in his ordinary Providence does permit the Cau≈øes, which produce the≈øe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to Act according to their own Nature, and they either <hi>cannot</hi> or <hi>will not</hi> make any di≈øtinction; for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which ordinarily happen in the World are produced by two ≈øorts of Cau≈øes either tho≈øe which we call <hi>Natural,</hi> or tho≈øe which are <hi>Voluntary.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:35252:164"/>
Natural</hi> Cau≈øes, ≈øuch as Wind, and Thunder, and Storms, and the infection of the Air, and the like, the≈øe acting by a Nece≈ø≈øity of Nature, without any Knowledge or Choice, <hi>can</hi> make no di≈øtinction between the Good and the Bad. And the <hi>Voluntary</hi> Cau≈øes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, as Men are, they many times <hi>will</hi> make no difference between the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi>; nay many times they are Maliciou≈øly bent again≈øt the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and the effects of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice fall heavie≈øt upon them. Now we ≈øay that things happen in the way of ordinary Providence, when <hi>Natural</hi> Cau≈øes are permitted to Act according to their <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Voluntary</hi> Cau≈øes are left to their <hi>Liberty</hi>; and therefore in the cour≈øe of ordinary Providence, it is not to be expected that ≈øuch a di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ≈øhould be made; it is neither po≈ø≈øible, nor does Ju≈øtice require it; it is not po≈ø≈øible, ≈øuppo≈øing Natural Cau≈øes left to Act according to their Nature, and Voluntary Cau≈øes to be left to their Liberty; nor does Ju≈øtice require it, for every Man is ≈øo much a Sinner, that no evil that befals him in this World, can be ≈øaid to be unju≈øt in re≈øpect of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:35252:165"/>So that <hi>Abraham</hi> is not here to be under≈øtood, as ≈øpeaking of ≈øuch Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as befal Men in the ordinary cour≈øe of God's Providence, in which, if the Good and Bad be involv'd alike, it cannot be expected to be otherwi≈øe, nor is there any inju≈øtice in it; but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> here ≈øpeaks of Miraculous and Extraordinary Judgments, which are immediately inflicted by God for the Puni≈øhment of ≈øome crying Sins, and the example of the World, to deter others from the like. And ≈øuch was this Judgment, which God intended to bring upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and which <hi>Abraham</hi> hath Relation to in this Di≈øcour≈øe of his. In <hi>this</hi> Ca≈øe it may be expected from the <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> of God, that a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ≈øhould be made between the-<hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi>; and that for the≈øe Rea≈øons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becau≈øe this is a Judgment which God him≈øelf executes. It is not an Event of common Providence, which always follows the Nature of its Cau≈øe; but an Act of God, as a <hi>Judge.</hi> Now it is e≈ø≈øential to a Judge to make a Di≈øcrimination between the Good and the Bad, ≈øo as to puni≈øh the one, and ≈øpare the other; and this is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:35252:165"/>
to all <hi>proper Acts of Judgment</hi> in this World, as the other; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other difference between them, but that one is a <hi>Particular</hi> Judgment, and the other the <hi>General</hi> Judgment of the whole World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God goes out of the way of his ordinary Providence in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhing, it may rea≈øonably be expected that he ≈øhould make a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Good and the Bad; for the Rea≈øon, why he does not in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Providence is, becau≈øe he will not break and interrupt the e≈øtabli≈øht order of things, upon every little occa≈øion: But when he does go be≈øides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cour≈øe of Things in puni≈øhing, the Rea≈øon cea≈øeth, which hindred him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from making a Difference; and 'tis rea≈øonable enough to expect, that in the inflicting of a <hi>Miraculous Judgment,</hi> a <hi>Miraculous Difference</hi> ≈øhould be made. Without making this difference, the end of the≈øe Miraculous Judgments would not be attained, which is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably to puni≈øh the crying Sins of Men, and by that example to deter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the like Sins: But if the≈øe Judgments ≈øhould fall promi≈øcuou≈øly upon the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked,</hi> it
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:35252:166"/>
would not be evident, that they were de≈øigned for the Puni≈øhment of ≈øuch Sins, when Men did ≈øee, that they fell likewi≈øe upon tho≈øe who were not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tho≈øe Sins, and con≈øequently the example could not be ≈øo effectual to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Men from Sin.</p>
            <p>Upon all the≈øe accounts you ≈øee that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s rea≈øoning was very Strong and well Grounded, as to tho≈øe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are <hi>Miraculous</hi> and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,</hi> and <hi>immediately inflicted</hi> by God, for the <hi>Puni≈øhment</hi> of great and hainous Sins, which was the Ca≈øe he was ≈øpeaking of. And accordingly we find, that in the≈øe Judgments which have been <hi>Immediately</hi> and <hi>Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øly</hi> inflicted by God, he hath always made this difference between the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked.</hi> In the <hi>Deluge</hi> which he brought upon the old World, the Spirit of God gives this Rea≈øon why the Judgment was ≈øo univer≈øal, becau≈øe <hi>all Fle≈øh had corrupted his way upon the Earth</hi>; and the Rea≈øon, why he ≈øaved <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family was, becau≈øe in this general corruption of Mankind, he alone was Righteous; <hi>thee have I ≈øeen Righteous before me in this Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> So likewi≈øe in that Miraculous
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:35252:166"/>
Judgment of <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, when <hi>God made a new thing, and the Earth opened her mouth to ≈øwallow them up,</hi> none peri≈øhed but <hi>he</hi> and <hi>his complices,</hi> the re≈øt had warning given them by God to <hi>remove from the tents of tho≈øe wicked Men.</hi> Thus you ≈øee that as to the particular Ca≈øe in the Text, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s rea≈øoning concerning the <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> of God is very firm, and concluding. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> Thing, which was that, which I principally intended to Di≈øcour≈øe upon, <hi>viz.</hi> to con≈øider the <hi>Ju≈øtice of God in general, in the di≈øtribution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puni≈øhments.</hi> And here I cannot but grant, that the be≈øt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this is yet wanting. We have clear demon≈øtrations of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wi≈ødom,</hi> and <hi>Goodne≈øs</hi> of God in this va≈øt and admirable frame of Things which we ≈øee: but we mu≈øt ≈øtay till <hi>the Day of Judgment</hi> for a clear and full Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtation of <hi>the Divine Ju≈øtice</hi>; for which Rea≈øon <hi>the Day of Judgment</hi> is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture call'd, <hi>the Day of the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God.</hi> But in the mean time we may receive ≈øufficient a≈ø≈øurance of this, both from <hi>Natural Rea≈øon,</hi> and from <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:35252:167"/>1. From <hi>Natural Rea≈øon,</hi> which tells us, that <hi>God loves Righteou≈øne≈øs</hi> and <hi>hates Iniquity,</hi> and con≈øequently that it mu≈øt be agreable to his Nature to countenance and encourage the <hi>one,</hi> and to di≈øcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the <hi>other</hi>; that is, to give ≈øome publick Te≈øtimony of his liking and Affection to the <hi>one,</hi> and of his Hatred and Di≈ølike of the <hi>other,</hi> which cannot otherwi≈øe be done, but by <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puni≈øhments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however the Heathen rea≈øoned about this matter, whatever premi≈øes they laid, they firmly believed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion, that <hi>God is Ju≈øt.</hi>
               <hi>Plato</hi> lays down this as a certain and undoubted Principle, <q>that God is in no wi≈øe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øt, but as Righteous, as is po≈ø≈øible, and that we cannot re≈øemble God more, than in this quality and di≈øpo≈øition.</q>
So likewi≈øe <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us,
<q>That the Gods are neither capable of receiving an injury, nor of doing any thing that is unju≈øt.</q>
               <hi>Antoninus</hi> the great Emperour and Philo≈øopher, ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubtfully, whether good Men are extingui≈øht by Death, or remain after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<q>If it be ju≈øt, ≈øays he, you may be ≈øure it is ≈øo: if it be not ju≈øt, you may certainly conclude the contrary,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:35252:167"/>
for God is ju≈øt, and being ≈øo, he will do nothing that is unju≈øt or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable.</q>
And indeed the Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers looked upon this as the great ≈øanction of all moral Precepts, that God was the <hi>Witne≈øs</hi> and the <hi>Avenger</hi> of the breach and violation of them, <hi>Qui ≈øecus faxit, deus ip≈øe vindex erit, If any Man do contrary to them, God him≈øelf will puni≈øh it</hi>; which ≈øhews, that there is a <hi>Natural Awe</hi> upon the Minds of Men of the <hi>Divine Ju≈øtice,</hi> which will overtake offenders either in this World or the other.

            </p>
            <p>I ≈øhould next proceed to vindicate <hi>the Ju≈øtice of God in the Di≈øtribution of Rewards and Puni≈øhments</hi> from tho≈øe <hi>Objections,</hi> which ≈øeem to impeach it. But before I enter upon this, it will be convenient to ≈øatisfie one que≈øtion, which hath occa≈øioned great di≈øputes in the World, and that is, how far <hi>Ju≈øtice,</hi> e≈øpecially as to <hi>the Puni≈øhment of Offenders</hi> is <hi>e≈ø≈øential to God</hi>? And for the clearing of this matter I ≈øhall briefly lay down the≈øe Propo≈øitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> I take this for a certain and undoubted Truth, that every <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to God, and cannot be imagined to be ≈øeperated from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, becau≈øe this is the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion which Men have of God, that he is <hi>a Being that hath all Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The actual con≈øtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of tho≈øe Divine Perfections, the effects whereof are <hi>without him≈øelf,</hi> is not <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to God. For in≈øtance, tho' God be <hi>e≈ø≈øentially powerful,</hi> and <hi>good</hi>; yet it is not nece≈ø≈øary, that he ≈øhould <hi>always exerci≈øe</hi> his Power and Goodne≈øs; but at ≈øuch times, and in ≈øuch a manner,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:35252:174"/>
as ≈øeems be≈øt to his <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi>; and this is likewi≈øe true of his <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi> and <hi>Ju≈øtice,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>the≈øe</hi> are Perfections, the effects whereof are terminated upon ≈øomething <hi>without him≈øelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to God to love Goodne≈øs, and hate Sin, wherever he ≈øees them. It is not nece≈ø≈øary there ≈øhould be a World, or rea≈øonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in it: but upon ≈øuppo≈øition that God makes ≈øuch Creatures, it is agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Divine Nature, to give them good and righteous Laws, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in the doing of that which is good, and to di≈øcourage them from doing that which is evil, which cannot be done, but by <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and therefore it is agreable to the Perfection of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>to reward Goodne≈øs,</hi> and <hi>to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As for tho≈øe rewards which the Go≈øpel promi≈øeth, and the Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which it threatens, there is ≈øome difference to be made between the <hi>rewarding</hi> and <hi>puni≈øhing ju≈øtice</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for that abundant <hi>reward</hi> God is plea≈øed to promi≈øe to good Men, the <hi>promi≈øe</hi> of it is founded in his <hi>goodne≈øs,</hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:35252:174"/>
and <hi>the performance</hi> of that promi≈øe in his <hi>ju≈øtice</hi>; for it is <hi>ju≈øtice</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> what he promi≈øes, tho' the <hi>promi≈øe</hi> of ≈øo great and abundant a reward was meer <hi>goodne≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the <hi>puni≈øhing ju≈øtice</hi> of God, about which hath been the great Que≈øtion, whether <hi>that</hi> be <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to God or not, it ≈øeems very plain, that it is not <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> that God ≈øhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict tho≈øe judgments which he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, <hi>becau≈øe</hi> he hath threatned them; for there is not the like obligation upon Per≈øons <hi>to perform their threatnings,</hi> that there is <hi>to perform their promi≈øes</hi>; becau≈øe God by his <hi>promi≈øe</hi> becomes <hi>a Debtour</hi> to tho≈øe, to whom he makes the promi≈øe; but when he <hi>threatens,</hi> he is the <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi> and we are Debtors to his Ju≈øtice; and as <hi>a Creditor,</hi> he may remit the Puni≈øhment which he hath threatned: But then if we con≈øider God as <hi>loving goodne≈øs</hi> and <hi>hating Sin</hi>; if we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as <hi>Governor of the World,</hi> and concerned to pre≈øerve good Order, to encourage Holine≈øs and Righteou≈øne≈øs, and to di≈øcountenance Sin, under this con≈øideration it is <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to him <hi>to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh Sin</hi> at ≈øuch times, and in ≈øuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:35252:175"/>
and circum≈øtances, as ≈øeems be≈øt to his <hi>Wi≈ødom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I am not at all moved by that, which is urged by ≈øome learned Men to the contrary, that if <hi>puni≈øhing ju≈øtice</hi> were <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to God, then he mu≈øt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the Sinner <hi>immediately,</hi> ≈øo ≈øoon as he hath offended, and to the <hi>utmo≈øt</hi> of his Power; becau≈øe whatever Acts <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> Acts <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily,</hi> and to the <hi>utmo≈øt:</hi> for I do not ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>≈øuch a ju≈øtice</hi> e≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to God as Acts <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily,</hi> but <hi>≈øuch a ju≈øtice,</hi> which as to the time, and manner, and circum≈øtances of its Acting is regulated and determined by his <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi>; and there is the ≈øame Rea≈øon likewi≈øe of his <hi>goodne≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the Objections which are taken partly from the di≈øpen≈øations of God in <hi>this</hi> World; and partly from the puni≈øhments of <hi>the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> As to the di≈øpen≈øations of God in <hi>this</hi> World, there are the≈øe <hi>two</hi> things Objected again≈øt the <hi>ju≈øtice</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence.</p>

In this life things happen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øcuou≈øly, <hi>there is one event to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and to the wicked</hi>; if the Wicked ≈øuffer and are afflicted, ≈øo are the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; if the Righteous ≈øometimes flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh, ≈øo do the Wicked; and is not this <hi>unju≈øt,</hi> that tho≈øe who are ≈øo une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual as to their De≈øerts ≈øhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually dealt withal? or if there be any inequality, it is u≈øually the wrong way, the Wicked do many times pro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per more in the World, and the Righteous are frequently more afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This was the great Objection of old again≈øt the Providence of God, which the Heathen Philo≈øophers took ≈øo much pains to an≈øwer, nay it did often ≈øhake the faith of Holy and Good Men in the old Te≈øtament. <hi>Job</hi> 12.6. <hi>The tabernacles of robbers pro≈øper, and they that provoke God are ≈øecure, into who≈øe hand God bringeth abundantly.</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 21.7, 8, 9. he Expo≈øtulates the ≈øame matter again; and <hi>David</hi> ≈øays this was a great ≈øtumbling-Block to him, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 73.2, 3.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:35252:176"/>
and the like we find in the Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection I have el≈øe-where con≈øidered, I ≈øhall now very briefly offer two or three Things, which I hope will be ≈øufficient to break the force of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It mu≈øt be granted, that it is not nece≈ø≈øary to <hi>ju≈øtice</hi> to ≈øhew it ≈øelf <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> and to di≈øpence Rewards and Puni≈øhments ≈øo ≈øoon as there are Objects for them. This is not thought nece≈ø≈øary among Men, much more ought we to leave it to the Wi≈ødom of God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the time and circum≈øtances of the exerci≈øing of his Ju≈øtice; and we are not to conclude that the Providence of God is unju≈øt, if he do not be≈øtow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and inflict Puni≈øhments, ju≈øt when we think he ≈øhould.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If God intended this Life for a State of Tryal, wherein he would prove the obedience of Men, and their free inclination to good or evil, it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable to expect that he ≈øhould follow Men with pre≈øent Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments; for that would lay too great a force upon Men, ≈øo that there would hardly be any oportunity of <hi>trying</hi> them; but on the contrary, there is all the Rea≈øon in the World to pre≈øume that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:35252:176"/>
God ≈øhould exerci≈øe the Graces and Virtues of good Men with afflictions and ≈øufferings, and ≈øuffer bad Men to take their Cour≈øe for a while, and walk in their own ways, without continual Checks by frequent and remarkable Judgments upon them, ≈øo often as they offend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If there be another Life after this, wherein Men ≈øhall be Judged <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works,</hi> then this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vani≈øheth, for that great Day will ≈øet all things ≈øtraight, which ≈øeem now to be ≈øo Crooked and Irregular. The deferring of Rewards and Puni≈øhments to the mo≈øt convenient Sea≈øon, is ≈øo far from being a reflection upon the <hi>ju≈øtice</hi> of God, that it is highly to the commendation of it. What <hi>Claudian</hi> ≈øays of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> a very bad Man, who≈øe long impunity had tempted Men to call in que≈øtion the ju≈øtice of God, is con≈øiderable in this Ca≈øe;
<q>
                  <l>Ab≈øtulit hunc tandem Ruffini poena tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multum,</l>
                  <l>Ab≈øolvitque Deos.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Puni≈øhment which overtook him at la≈øt, did quiet tho≈øe tumultuous
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:35252:177"/>
thoughts, and ab≈øolved the gods from all blame.</q>
When Men look but a little way, and con≈øider only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent ≈øtate of Things, they are ready to quarrel at the Ju≈øtice of them; but if they would look at the end of Things, and have Patience to ≈øtay till the la≈øt, to ≈øee the Conclu≈øion and Winding up of things, they would then acquit God in their thoughts from all tho≈øe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of inju≈øtice, which from the <hi>inequality</hi> of pre≈øent di≈øpen≈øations, ra≈øh and incon≈øiderate Men are apt to charge him withal.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Objection, from the <hi>tran≈ølation</hi> of Puni≈øhments, the puni≈øhing of one Man's Sin upon another, as of <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the Children,</hi> which God threatens in the <hi>≈øecond</hi> Commandment, and did in ≈øome ≈øort fulfil in <hi>Ahab,</hi> in <hi>bringing the evil he had threatned him withal, in his Son's Days,</hi> 1 Kings 21.19. The puni≈øhing the Sin of one Per≈øon upon a People, as that of <hi>Achan</hi> upon the whole Congregation, <hi>Jo≈øh.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Did not Achan the ≈øon of Zerah commit a tre≈øpa≈øs in the accur≈øed thing? and wrath fell on all the congregation of I≈ørael, and that man peri≈øhed not alone in his iniquity.</hi> And the Sin of <hi>David</hi> upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:35252:177"/>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. When <hi>≈øeventy thou≈øand</hi> Dyed of the Plague, for <hi>David</hi>'s Sin in numbring the People. Now how is this agreable to <hi>ju≈øtice?</hi> is it not a known Rule, <hi>Noxa caput ≈øequitur, Mi≈øchief pur≈øues the Sinner?</hi> What can be more rea≈øonable, <hi>Quam ut peccata ≈øuos teneant Authores, Than that Men's faults ≈øhould be charged upon the Authors,</hi> and Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fall upon the guilty?</p>
            <p>For an≈øwer to this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not unrea≈øonable that one Man ≈øhould bear the puni≈øhment of another's Fault, if he be willing and content to bear it, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria, There is no wrong done to tho≈øe, that are willing to undergo it,</hi> tho' they be <hi>innocent,</hi> which was the ca≈øe of our Ble≈ø≈øed Saviour ≈øuffering for us, <hi>the ju≈øt for the unju≈øt,</hi> as the Scripture expre≈ø≈øeth it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where the Per≈øon, upon whom the puni≈øhment is trasfer'd, is likewi≈øe <hi>a ≈øinner,</hi> and obnoxious to God, there can be no <hi>inju≈øtice</hi>; becau≈øe he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved it upon his own account, and God may take what occa≈øion he plea≈øeth to puni≈øh them that de≈øerve to be puni≈øht.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In puni≈øhing the iniquity of <hi>the Father upon the Children,</hi> the guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, that is, <hi>the Father,</hi> is puni≈øht in the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:35252:178"/>
Calamity of <hi>his Children,</hi> for a Man's <hi>Children</hi> are <hi>him≈øelf Multiplyed</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very remarkable that in the <hi>≈øecond</hi> Commandment, God promi≈øeth <hi>to ≈øhew mercy to thou≈øands of Generations of them that love him</hi>; but <hi>he vi≈øits the iniquities of the Fathers upon the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> but <hi>to the third and fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is ≈øo far as a Man may live to ≈øee them puni≈øht, and ≈øuffer in their Puni≈øhment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the Puni≈øhment of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> for the ≈øins of their <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> and <hi>one part</hi> of a community for <hi>another,</hi> ≈øuppo≈øing all of them to be <hi>Sinners,</hi> which is the true ca≈øe, God may lay the puni≈øhment where he plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and there is no more inju≈øtice then when a Man is whipt on the <hi>Back</hi> for the theft which his <hi>hand</hi> committed, a community being <hi>one Body</hi>; be≈øides the <hi>Prince</hi> is puni≈øht in the lo≈øs of his <hi>People,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> con≈øi≈øting in the <hi>Multitude</hi> of his <hi>Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Objection with re≈øpect to the <hi>other</hi> World, the puni≈øhment of <hi>temporal</hi> Evils with <hi>Eternal,</hi> is el≈øe-where an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer'd.</p>
            <p>The u≈øe we ≈øhould make of this whole Di≈øcour≈øe is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:35252:178"/>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> If God be <hi>Ju≈øt</hi> and <hi>Righteous,</hi> let us acknowledge it in all his di≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øations, even in tho≈øe, the Rea≈øon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is mo≈øt hidden and ob≈øcure. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.33. Speaking of the great afflictions that had befal'n God's own People, yet this he lays down as a firm Principle, <hi>howbeit thou art ju≈øt in all that is brought upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is matter of terrour to wicked Men. God doth <hi>now</hi> exerci≈øe his <hi>milder</hi> Attributes towards Sinners, his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Goodne≈øs</hi>; but if we de≈øpi≈øe the≈øe, that <hi>terrible</hi> Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of his <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> will de≈øplay it ≈øelf; and this the Scripture de≈øcribes in a ≈øevere manner, <hi>the Lord revengeth, and is jealous; the Lord will take vengeance on his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaries,</hi> and <hi>re≈øerveth wrath for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is matter of comfort to good Men, that the <hi>Righteous</hi> God <hi>Governs</hi> the World, and will <hi>judge</hi> it. <hi>The Lord reigneth,</hi> let <hi>the earth rejoyce,</hi> P≈øal. 97.1. And he gives the Rea≈øon of it in the next <hi>v. Righteou≈øne≈øs and judgment are the habitation of his Throne.</hi> Tho' he be <hi>omnipotent,</hi> we need not fear; for his <hi>Power</hi> is always under the conduct of <hi>Eternal Righteou≈øne≈øs.</hi>

               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:35252:179"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us imitate this <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs,</hi> let us endeavour <hi>to be righteous as he is righteous</hi>; let us give to God the Love, Reverence, and Obedience which are due to him; and in all our dealings, what is <hi>ju≈øt</hi> and due to Men.

to include not only the <hi>veracity</hi> of God; but his <hi>Faithfulne≈øs.</hi> Hence it is that in Scripture <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulne≈øs</hi> are ≈øo often put together, and frequently put one for another, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels of old are faithfulne≈øs and truth.</hi> Rev. 21.5. <hi>The≈øe words are true and faithful.</hi> And the <hi>Faithfulne≈øs</hi> of God, in <hi>performing his Promi≈øes,</hi> is frequently call'd his <hi>Truth.</hi> And becau≈øe the Scripture u≈øeth them promi≈øcuou≈øly, we need not be very ≈øolicitous to find out di≈øtinct No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them; but if you will, they may be di≈øtingui≈øht thus; the <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>veracity</hi> of God hath place in <hi>every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> of his Mind; the Faithfulne≈øs of God only in his <hi>Promi≈øes.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> From the Dictates of <hi>Natural Light. Natural Light</hi> tells us, that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulne≈øs</hi> are <hi>Perfections,</hi> and con≈øequently belong to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that <hi>Fal≈øe-hood</hi> and <hi>a Lie</hi> are <hi>Imperfections,</hi> and to be removed from God.

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:35252:181"/>
≈øome danger. Hence was that ≈øaying, that <hi>it is the property of a Slave to lie, but of a free Man to ≈øpeak truth:</hi> Now whatever argues ba≈øene≈øs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, our Rea≈øon tells us is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to be ≈øeparated from the mo≈øt Perfect Being. <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil,</hi> the Divine Nature being all-≈øufficient, can have no temptation to be otherwi≈øe than Good and Ju≈øt, and True and Faithful. Men are tempted to Lie by advantage, and out of fear: but the Divine Nature hath the ≈øecurity of its fullne≈øs and all-≈øufficiency, that it cannot hope for any increa≈øe, nor fear any impairment of its E≈øtate.

Dictates and Sugge≈øtions of our Minds, appears clearly from the rea≈øonings of the Heathen in this matter, who were de≈øtitute of Divine Revelation. <hi>Plato de Repub.</hi> l. 2. lays down this as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth,
<q>That lying and Fal≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are imperfections, and odious to God and Men, <gap reason="foreign">

and Concludes,
<q>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is true, and deals plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, both in his Words and Actions, and is neither changed him≈øelf, nor deceives us.</q>
               <hi>Porphyry</hi> in the Life of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> tells us,

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From <hi>Scripture.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth very frequently attribute this to God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.28. <hi>And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and thy words be true</hi>; P≈øal. 25.10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth</hi>; P≈øal. 31.5. <hi>Into thy hand I commit my ≈øpirit: thou ha≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me, O Lord God of truth.</hi> Rev. 3.7. <hi>The≈øe things ≈øaith he, that is holy, he that is true.</hi> Rev. 6.10. <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true?</hi> 15.3. <hi>Ju≈øt and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints.</hi> 16.7. <hi>True and righteous are thy judgments.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may refer tho≈øe Texts which ≈øpeak of the Plenty and Abundance of God's truth, <hi>Ex.</hi> 34.6. <hi>Abundant in goodne≈øs and truth.</hi> P≈øal. 86.15. <hi>Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in mercy and truth</hi>; and tho≈øe which ≈øpeak of the Duration and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 100.5. <hi>And his truth endureth to all generations.</hi> 117.2. <hi>And the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> 146.6. <hi>Who keepeth truth for ever.</hi>

            <p>As the Scripture doth attribute this Perfection to God, ≈øo it removes the contrary from him with the greate≈øt abhorrence and dete≈øtation, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. <hi>God is not a Man that he ≈øhould lie, neither the ≈øon of Man that he ≈øhould repent, hath he ≈øaid, and ≈øhall not he do it? hath he

            </p>
            <p>And the Scripture doth not only in general attribute this Perfection to God, but doth more particularly a≈ø≈øure us of his <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</hi> Of his <hi>≈øincerity</hi>; that he deals plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, and ≈øpeaks what he intends, that his Words are the image of his Thoughts, and a true repre≈øentation of his Mind.

               <hi>Third</hi> Objection, God is not punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in performing his <hi>Threatnings</hi>; as when he threatned <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eate≈øt thereof, thou ≈øhalt ≈øurely die</hi>; which yet was not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øht, for he lived many hundred Years after. God threatned <hi>Ahab to bring evil upon him and his family,</hi> 1 Kings 21.21. But upon his Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he is plea≈øed to re≈øpite it, <hi>v.</hi> 29. So God threatned <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with <hi>Death,</hi> but upon his prayer <hi>adds fifteen Years to his Life.</hi> 2 Kings 20. Thus <hi>Nineveh</hi> was threatned, but upon their Repentance, <hi>God repented of the evil,</hi> Jon. 3.10. Now how is this deferring and turning away of judgment con≈øi≈øtent with the <hi>Truth</hi> of God? doth not this ≈øeem to charge him with <hi>fal≈øe-hood or levity</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø.</hi> This may be ≈øaid in general, that every one that under≈øtands the Nature of God, cannot but be very well a≈ø≈øur'd, that <hi>fal≈øe-hood</hi> and <hi>levity</hi> are very far from God; and tho' he could
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:35252:188"/>
not untie ≈øome particular Knots, and an≈øwer all difficulties, yet he ought to re≈øt ≈øatisfied in this a≈ø≈øurance. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs this Objection is trouble≈øom, and requires a di≈øtinct Con≈øideration. I will not be peremptory in nice matters, but I ≈øhall, with ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, offer the≈øe things in an≈øwer to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for the expre≈ø≈øion of <hi>God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,</hi> we are to under≈øtand it, as many others in Scripture, <hi>after the manner of Men,</hi> and ≈øpoken by way of <hi>conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcention</hi> to our Weakne≈øs, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to our Capacities, and not as ca≈øting any imputation of <hi>fal≈øe hood</hi> or <hi>incon≈øtancy</hi> upon God, as if either he did not intend what he ≈øaith, or out of levity did alter his Mind. When God is ≈øaid <hi>to repent,</hi> the expre≈ø≈øion only ≈øignifies thus much, that God <hi>doth not execute</hi> that which <hi>≈øeemed</hi> to us to have been his purpo≈øe, that he is plea≈øed to do otherwi≈øe than his threatnings <hi>≈øeemed openly to expre≈øs,</hi> becau≈øe of ≈øome <hi>tacit Condition</hi> implyed in them; and this doth not derogate either from the <hi>truth,</hi> or <hi>≈øincerity,</hi> or <hi>con≈øtancy</hi> of God in his Word. Not from his <hi>truth</hi>; for he ≈øpeaks what he intends really, if ≈øomething did nor intervene to prevent the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:35252:189"/>
Judgment threatned, upon which he was re≈øolved, when he threatned, to be taken off and ≈øtop his Judgments: Nor doth it derogate from his <hi>≈øincerity</hi> and <hi>plainne≈øs</hi>; for he hath told us that his threatnings have ≈øuch Conditions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in them: Nor doth it derogate from the <hi>con≈øtancy</hi> and <hi>immutability</hi> of God; becau≈øe God doth not <hi>mutare con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium ≈øed ≈øententiam, he doth not change his coun≈øel and purpo≈øe, but takes off the ≈øentence,</hi> which he had pa≈øt with re≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Conditions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the In≈øtances, that I may give more particular ≈øatisfaction to them, I ≈øhall Con≈øider the threatnings of God with this double re≈øpect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with relation to <hi>Law,</hi> or with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Event</hi>; with relation to <hi>a Law,</hi> as they are the <hi>≈øanction</hi> of it; or with relation to the <hi>Event,</hi> as they are <hi>Predictions</hi> of ≈øomething to come.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Some threatnings have only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>a Law,</hi> as they are the <hi>≈øanction</hi> of it. And thus con≈øider'd, they differ from <hi>Promi≈øes</hi>; for <hi>Promi≈øes</hi> confer a <hi>Right, omne promi≈ø≈øum cadit in debitum</hi>; but a <hi>threatning</hi> doth not convey any <hi>Right,</hi> nor if forborn can the party com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of <hi>Wrong</hi> done to him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:35252:189"/>
in this Ca≈øe it can only ≈øignifie what the offence again≈øt the Law de≈øerves, and what the offender may expect; for the <hi>end</hi> of threatning is not <hi>Puni≈øhment,</hi> but the <hi>avoiding</hi> of it. And this may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> In≈øtance. God gave <hi>Adam a Law</hi>; and by way of <hi>Sanction,</hi> not of <hi>Prediction</hi> of an Event, he threatned the breach of it with Death: Now God did not execute the Puni≈øhment threatned at the time threatned, but deferr'd it, and this without any impeachment of his <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> becau≈øe this threatning was only the <hi>Sanction of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We may con≈øider Threatnings with Relation to <hi>the Event</hi> and as <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi>; and as to the accompli≈øhment of the≈øe, there ≈øeems to be a greater degree of Nece≈ø≈øity, becau≈øe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God's <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> ≈øeem to be concerned in them; for if his Word be not fulfill'd, it mu≈øt either be for want of <hi>Knowledge</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øee Events, or <hi>Power</hi> to bring them to pa≈øs, or <hi>Con≈øtancy</hi> to his Word. Now if we con≈øider Threatnings with re≈øpect to the <hi>Event,</hi> as they are <hi>Predictions</hi> of future <hi>Judgements,</hi> I think all the other In≈øtances may be ≈øatisfied, by laying down this Rule for the under≈øtanding
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:35252:190"/>
of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That all Prophetical Threatnings or Predictions of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to be under≈øtood with this <hi>tacit Condition,</hi> if there do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene the Humiliation, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Prayer of the Per≈øons again≈øt whom the Judgment is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and if ≈øo, God may upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without any impeachment of the honour of his <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> either defer, or abate, or remit the Puni≈øhment.</q>
And that the <hi>Predictions</hi> of Judgments are to be under≈øtood with this Condition, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears clearly from that known Text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8.</p>

               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> If God be <hi>a God of Truth,</hi> then this gives us a≈ø≈øurance that he doth not deceive us, that the Faculties which he hath given us are not fal≈øe, but when they have clear perceptions of Things, they do not err and mi≈øtake. Were it not for the <hi>veracity</hi> of God, we might, for any thing we know, be under a con≈øtant Delu≈øion; and no Man could demon≈øtate the contrary, but that this is our make and temper, and the very
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:35252:190"/>
frame of our Under≈øtandings, to be then mo≈øt of all deceived, when we think our ≈øelves to be mo≈øt certain; I ≈øay no Man could be a≈ø≈øured of the contrary, but from hence, becau≈øe <hi>veracity</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> is <hi>a Divine Perfection</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God cannot be the Author of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Delu≈øion. Therefore we may be a≈ø≈øured, that the frame of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandings is not a Cheat, but that our Faculties are true, and unle≈øs it be our own fault, we need not be deceived in things that are nece≈ø≈øary to our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If God be <hi>a God of Truth,</hi> then there is Rea≈øon why we ≈øhould believe and a≈ø≈øent to whatever we are ≈øatisfied is revealed to us by God. A Divine Revelation is a ≈øufficient ground for the mo≈øt firm a≈ø≈øent; for this very thing, that any thing is revealed by God, is the highe≈øt Evidence, and ought to give us the mo≈øt firm a≈ø≈øurance of the truth of it. Hence it is that the Word of God is call'd <hi>the Word of truth,</hi> yea and <hi>truth it ≈øelf,</hi> John 17.17. <hi>Thy Word is truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore whoever entertains the <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>criptures as the Word of God, and is ≈øatisfied of the Divine Authority of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:35252:191"/>
them, ought in Rea≈øon to believe every thing contained in them, yea tho' there be ≈øome things of which no rea≈øonable account can be given, and which our Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding cannot give us particular ≈øatisfaction in; yet becau≈øe we are ≈øatisfied that they are revealed by <hi>God who cannot lie,</hi> who≈øe Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is infallible, and who≈øe Word is true, we ought upon this higher and ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Rea≈øon to yield a firm a≈ø≈øent to the truth of them: if we do not, we di≈øhonour this Perfection of God, and rob him of this <hi>e≈ø≈øential property,</hi> his <hi>Veracity.</hi> 1 John 5.10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witne≈øs in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becau≈øe he believeh not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that God gave of his Son.</hi> As on the other hand, if we do believe what God hath revealed, we glorifie this Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his, and ≈øet our ≈øeal to his Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So 'tis ≈øaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.20. That <hi>he was ≈øtrong in faith, giving glory to God.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> the Bapti≈øt, ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning our Saviour, ≈øaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.33. <hi>He that hath received his te≈øtimony, hath ≈øet to his ≈øeal, that God is true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:35252:191"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If God be <hi>a God of truth,</hi> and faithful in performing his Promi≈øe, then here is a firm Foundation for our Hope and Tru≈øt. If God have made any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, we may ≈øecurely rely upon it, that it ≈øhall be made good; we may <hi>hold fa≈øt</hi> our hope <hi>without wavering, becau≈øe he is faithful who hath promi≈øed,</hi> Heb. 10.23. Hence it is that the Ble≈ø≈øings of God's Covenant are call'd <hi>≈øure mercies,</hi> I≈øa. 55.3.</p>
            <p>We attribute much to the Word of a faithful Friend, and look upon the Promi≈øe of an hone≈øt Man as very good ≈øecurity; but <hi>Men</hi> may fail us when we rely upon them: but <hi>God is true,</hi> tho' <hi>all Men ≈øhould prove Lyars.</hi> Men are fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle and murable; but the Nature of God is fixt, he cannot fail tho≈øe that tru≈øt in him. When God hath made any Promi≈øe to us, we may plead it with him, and urge him with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs. So we find <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.25. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Only we ≈øhould be careful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>Condition</hi> which is required on our part, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. we ≈øhould <hi>take heed le≈øt a Promi≈øe being left us, any one ≈øhould come ≈øhort of it,</hi> by not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Condition</hi>; for <hi>that</hi> doth relea≈øe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:35252:192"/>
and di≈øcharge him of the Promi≈øe, and <hi>he is faithful,</hi> tho' he doth not perform what he promi≈øed, becau≈øe he did not promi≈øe but upon <hi>Condition</hi>; and this ≈øeem to be the meaning of tho≈øe Words, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny him≈øelf.</hi> He ≈øaid before, that if we perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required, God will be≈øtow the Ble≈ø≈øings promi≈øed, <hi>It is a faithful ≈øaying, for if we be dead with him, we al≈øo ≈øhall live with him; if we ≈øuffer, we al≈øo ≈øhall reign with him; but if we deny him,</hi> the Cur≈øe threatned will then take place, and <hi>he will deny us</hi>; and God is <hi>not unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in doing this, <hi>he does not deny him≈øelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we have ≈øuch a≈ø≈øurance, we may tru≈øt him with our greate≈øt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, and venture our Souls with him, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 31.5. <hi>Into thy hands I commit my ≈øpirit, O Lord God of truth.</hi> We ≈øhould rely upon him, when there are the greate≈øt improbabilities of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhment of his Promi≈øes. Thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.17. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This ≈øhould al≈øo make us <hi>patient in hope</hi>; if a Promi≈øe be not ≈øpeedily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øht, we ≈øhould not be dejected or di≈øquieted. <hi>David</hi> challengeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf upon this account, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 42.11.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:35252:192"/>
               <hi>Why art thou ca≈øt down, O my Soul? and why art thou di≈øquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I ≈øhall yet prai≈øe him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</hi> And ≈øo likewi≈øe in reference to the Rewards of another World, tho' at a di≈øtance, yet we ≈øhould, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle ≈øpeaks, <hi>wait for the ble≈ø≈øed Hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Truth</hi> of God is matter of terrour to the Wicked. All the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of temporal Evils may ju≈øtly be expected, becau≈øe their Sins de≈øerve them, and there is no <hi>Condition</hi> implyed in them, upon which thou can≈øt rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hope for the avoiding or abating of the Evils threatned, but of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the≈øe threatnings thou conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue≈øt in thy Sins, and <hi>ble≈ø≈øe≈øt thy ≈øelf, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ≈øhall have peace, tho' thou walk in the imaginations of thy heart,</hi> by this very thing thou provoke≈øt the <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> of God <hi>not to ≈øpare thee,</hi> and make≈øt <hi>his wrath and his jealou≈øie to ≈ømoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt thee</hi>; and if thou continue≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, however he may defer the execution of <hi>temporal</hi> Evils, his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> is concerned to inflict <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Puni≈øhments upon thee; for <hi>he
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:35252:193"/>
hath ≈øworn in his wrath</hi> that ≈øuch <hi>≈øhall no enter into his re≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let us propound to our ≈øelves the <hi>truth</hi> of God for our pattern and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Would you be like God? be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful. Truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulne≈øs</hi> are <hi>Divine Perfections</hi>; but <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>fal≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> are the Properties of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the predominant qualities of <hi>Hell.</hi> The character of the Devil is, that <hi>he abode not in the truth, and there is no truth in him, when he ≈øpeaketh a lie, 'tis of his own, for he is a lyar and the Father of it.</hi> John 8.44.</p>
            <p>One of the fir≈øt and mo≈øt natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that we have of Religion is, that it is <hi>to imitate God,</hi> and to endeavour to be like him, ≈øo far as we are capable; and to contradict any of the Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Perfections is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Sin, becau≈øe it is again≈øt the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Dictates of our Mind, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to tho≈øe Principles which are mo≈øt deeply rooted in our Nature. No Man can be Cruel and Unmerciful, Fal≈øe and Treacherous, without a very high degree of guilt, becau≈øe the≈øe Sins are contrary to the chiefe≈øt and mo≈øt e≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Perfections of God. <hi>Lying</hi> is a Sin that would fly in the Face of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:35252:193"/>
becau≈øe it directly contradicts tho≈øe Natural Notions which every Man hath of God and Religion; therefore we find that there is hardly any thing that Men are more a≈øham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of than <hi>to be taken in a Lie,</hi> and 'tis e≈øteemed the highe≈øt reproach to be charged with it, it argues ≈øuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrariety to that which is the Rule of Perfection, <hi>the Nature of God,</hi> and con≈øequently ≈øo much imperfection and ba≈øene≈øs. He that tells a Lie out of fear is at once bold towards God, and ba≈øe towards Men.</p>
            <p>Upon the≈øe accounts God expre≈ø≈øeth him≈øelf highly offended with tho≈øe that practi≈øe <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Fal≈øe-hood,</hi> and to have a dete≈øtation of them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> It renders us unlike to him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24, 25. <hi>Put on the new Man, which after God is created in Righteou≈øne≈øs and true Holine≈øs</hi> (or <hi>in the Holine≈øs of truth.)</hi> And from hence he infers, <hi>Wherefore putting away lying, ≈øpeak every Man truth with his Neighbour: for we are members one of another.</hi> Col. 3.9.10. <hi>Lie not one to another, ≈øeeing that ye have put off the old Man with his deeds: And have put
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:35252:194"/>
on the new Man, which is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, after the image of him that created him</hi>; that is, becau≈øe we profe≈øs to be conformed to <hi>the image of God.</hi> More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, we ≈øhould charge our ≈øelves with <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulne≈øs</hi> towards God and Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Towards God,</hi> in our <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Vows,</hi> and <hi>Covenants.</hi> In our Oaths, when we ≈øwear in any Matter, we tell God that what we ≈øpeak is Truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to bear Witne≈øs to it. To fal≈øifie in an <hi>Oath</hi> is one of the mo≈øt ≈øolemn affronts that we can put upon the God of Truth.</p>
            <p>And ≈øo in our <hi>Vows,</hi> which are a ≈øolemn Promi≈øe to God, of ≈øuch things in which we have no precedent Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lying upon us. He that regardeth truth will neither be ra≈øh in making a Vow, nor carele≈øs to perform it. <hi>Eccle≈ø.</hi> 5.4. <hi>When thou vowe≈øt a vow to God, defer not to pay it, for he hath no plea≈øure in Fools.</hi> Not to perform what we have vowed, is an Argument of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; either of ra≈øhne≈øs in the making of it, or of incon≈øtancy in not keeping it.</p>
            <p>So likewi≈øe in all our <hi>Covenants</hi> with God, to ≈øerve him and obey him, and
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:35252:194"/>
keep his Commandments, we ≈øhould ≈øtrictly charge our ≈øelves with perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the≈øe. There is a Natural Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon us to the≈øe Things from the very Law of our Creation, tho' we ≈øhould never ≈øolemnly make any ≈øuch Promi≈øe, nor enter into any ≈øuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, becau≈øe it is a <hi>tacit</hi> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Beings; but the taking of this <hi>Covenant</hi> ≈øolemnly upon us in <hi>Bapti≈øm,</hi> ≈øtrengthens the Obligation, and makes our unfaithfulne≈øs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sin. All our hopes of Happine≈øs are founded in the Faithfulne≈øs of God; and if thou be fal≈øe to him, how can≈øt thou expect he ≈øhould be faithful to thee? 'Tis true indeed, that <hi>he abides faithful, he cannot deny him≈øelf</hi>; but if thou ha≈øt any ingenuity in thee, this ≈øhould be an Argument to thee to be faithful to him; I am ≈øure this can be no Encouragement to thee to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful; for if thou breake≈øt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant thou ha≈øt entred into, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legcte≈øt the Conditions upon which God hath ≈øu≈øpended the performance of his Promi≈øe, thou di≈øcharge≈øt the Obligation on his part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Towards Men</hi>; we ≈øhould charge our ≈øelves with <hi>Truth</hi> in all our <hi>Words,</hi>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:35252:195"/>
and <hi>Faithfulne≈øs</hi> in all our <hi>Promi≈øes.</hi> It becomes us who wor≈øhip <hi>the God of truth,</hi> to ≈øpeak truth; to u≈øe plainne≈øs and ≈øincerity in all our Words, to abhor Fal≈øehood and Di≈ø≈øimulation, and tho≈øe more refined ways of lying by equivocation of Words, and ≈øecret re≈øervations of our Minds on purpo≈øe to deceive. Tho≈øe that plead for the≈øe, 'tis a ≈øign they do not under≈øtand the Nature of God, and of Religion, which is to conform our ≈øelves to the Divine Perfections. We meet with many complaints in the old Te≈øtament, of the want of Truth and Faithfulne≈øs among Men, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 12.1.2. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 59.13, 14, 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.2, 8, 9.2.4, 5, 6. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 4.1. I am afraid there is as much Rea≈øon for this complaint now; for we live in an Age of greater <hi>Light,</hi> which doth <hi>reprove</hi> and <hi>make manife≈øt</hi> this <hi>work of Darkne≈øs</hi>; and methinks there is no ≈øadder ≈øign of the decay of Chri≈øtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of the little power and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the Go≈øpel hath upon us, than that there is ≈øo little regard had by Chri≈øtians to the≈øe <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, which becau≈øe <hi>Moral</hi> (however Men may ≈ølight that Word) are therefore of <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Indi≈øpen≈øable</hi> Obligation,

            <p>To Conclude all, That Man that can di≈øpence with him≈øelf as to <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, that makes no Con≈øcience of <hi>telling a Lie,</hi> or <hi>breaking his Word,</hi> what Badge ≈øoever he may wear, what Title ≈øoever he may call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf by, it is as impo≈ø≈øible that ≈øuch a Man ≈øhould be <hi>a true Chri≈øtian,</hi> as it is to reconcile <hi>the God of Truth,</hi> and <hi>the Father of Lies.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. If <hi>Holine≈øs</hi> be a Perfection of the Divine Nature, and a Property of God, if in the Notion of God, there be included an everla≈øting ≈øeparation and di≈øtance from Moral Imperfection, an eternal repugnance to Sin and Iniquity; from hence we may infer, that there is an <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecal good and evil</hi> in Things, and the Rea≈øons and Re≈øpects of <hi>moral
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:35252:201"/>
good and evil</hi> do not depend upon any mutable, and incon≈øtant, and arbitrary Principle, but are fixt and immutable, eternal and indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øable. Therefore they do not ≈øeem to me to ≈øpeak ≈øo ≈øafely, who make the Divine <hi>Will,</hi> preci≈øely and ab≈øtractedly con≈øider'd, the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Moral good and evil,</hi> as if there were nothing good or evil <hi>in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> antecedently to the <hi>Will</hi> of God, but that all things are therefore good or evil, becau≈øe God <hi>Wills</hi> them to be ≈øo; for if this were ≈øo, Goodne≈øs, and Righteou≈øne≈øs, and Truth, and Faithfulne≈øs would not be e≈ø≈øential, and nece≈ø≈øary, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Properties of the Divine Nature, but accidental, and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and uncertain, and mutable; which is to ≈øuppo≈øe that God, if he plea≈øed, might be otherwi≈øe than good, and ju≈øt, and true. For if the≈øe depend meerly upon the <hi>Will</hi> of God, and be not <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> and <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Divine Nature, then the contrary of the≈øe, Malice, and Envy, and Unrighteou≈øne≈øs, and Fal≈øe-hood do not imply any e≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:35252:201"/>
repugnancy to the Divine Nature; which is plainly contrary to what the Scripture tells us, that <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil,</hi> that <hi>'tis impo≈ø≈øible he ≈øhould lie,</hi> that he <hi>cannot be</hi> unrighteous.</p>
            <p>If any Man ≈øay that God hath now declared him≈øelf to be Ju≈øt, and Good, and Faithful, and now he cannot be otherwi≈øe, becau≈øe <hi>he is a God of Truth, and he changeth not,</hi> this is to grant the thing; for this ≈øuppo≈øeth the <hi>veracity</hi> and <hi>immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of God to be <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> and <hi>nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Perfections of the Divine Nature; and why not <hi>ju≈øtice</hi> and <hi>goodne≈øs</hi> as well? I ≈øay it ≈øuppo≈øeth <hi>veracity</hi> and <hi>immutability</hi> to be <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not to depend upon the <hi>Will</hi> of God, that is, that God cannot <hi>Will</hi> to be otherwi≈øe than true and unchangeable; for if he could, what a≈ø≈øurance can we po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly have, but that when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares him≈øelf to be good and ju≈øt, he is or may be otherwi≈øe.</p>
            <p>But I need not in≈øi≈øt upon this, which ≈øeems to be ≈øo very clear, and to carry its own Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

with it. I will only u≈øe this Argument to prove it, and ≈øo leave it. No Being can <hi>Will</hi> its own <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>e≈ø≈øential Perfections,</hi> that is, chu≈øe whether it will be thus or otherwi≈øe; for that were to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe it to be before it is, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath a Being, to deliberate about its own Nature. Therefore if this be <hi>the Nature</hi> of God, (which I think no body will deny) to be <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>ju≈øt,</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>nece≈ø≈øari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to be what he is; then <hi>goodne≈øs,</hi> and <hi>ju≈øtice,</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> do not depend up-the <hi>Will</hi> of God, but there are ≈øuch Things, ≈øuch Notions antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to any Act of the Divine Will. And this does no ways preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the <hi>Liberty</hi> of God; for this is the highe≈øt Perfection to be <hi>nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> Good, and Ju≈øt, and True; and a Liberty or Po≈ø≈øibility to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe is impotency and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For Liberty no where ≈øpeaks Perfection, but were the Things and Actions about which 'tis conver≈øant are indifferent; in all other things, 'tis the highe≈øt Perfection not to be free and indifferent, but immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

and fixt, and nece≈ø≈øarily bound up by the eternal Laws of Goodne≈øs, and Ju≈øtice, and Truth, ≈øo that it ≈øhall not be po≈ø≈øible to ≈øwerve from them; and this is the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which we call his <hi>Holine≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If <hi>Holine≈øs</hi> be the chief Excellency and Perfection of the Divine Nature, this ≈øhews us what account we are to make of Sin, and Wickedne≈øs, and Vice.

            <p n="1">

≈øo that if we have any ≈øparks of ambition in us, we cannot but a≈øpire after <hi>Holine≈øs,</hi> which is ≈øo great an Excellency and Perfection of God him≈øelf.

If rea≈øonable Creatures could be happy, as brute Bea≈øts are in their degree, by enjoying their depraved Appetites, and following the Dictates of Sen≈øe and Fancy, God would not have bound us up to a <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> but have left us, as he hath done unrea≈øonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ≈øatisfie our Lu≈øts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, without check and control: but Angels and Men, which are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable Creatures, have the Notions of Good and Evil, of Right and Wrong, of Comline≈øs and Filthine≈øs, ≈øo woven and twi≈øted into their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Natures, that they can never be wholly defaced, without the ruine of their Beings; and therefore it is impo≈ø≈øible that ≈øuch Creatures ≈øhould

So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. That even the mo≈øt degenerate Heathens had <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences</hi> which did <hi>accu≈øe or excu≈øe them,</hi> according as they obeyed, or did contrary to the dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light.

di≈øplea≈øure and reluctancy, the con≈øequence of which, in <hi>Moral</hi> Actions, is <hi>Guilt,</hi> which is nothing el≈øe, but the Trouble and Di≈øquiet which ari≈øeth in one's Mind, from con≈øciou≈øne≈øs of having done ≈øome thing that contradicts the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Principle of his Being, that is ≈øomething which did not become him, and which, being what he is, that is <hi>a rea≈øonable Creature,</hi> he ought not to do.</p>
            <p>So that in all <hi>rea≈øonable</hi> Creatures there is a certain kind of <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Di≈øpo≈øition</hi> that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> and <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to <hi>Happine≈øs,</hi> and that is <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs</hi>; which as it is the <hi>Perfection,</hi> ≈øo it is the great <hi>Felicity</hi> of the Divine Nature: And on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is one chief part of the Mi≈øery of tho≈øe wicked and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur≈øed Spirits the Devils, and of unholy Men, that they are of a temper contrary to God, they are Envious, and Malicious, and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, of ≈øuch a temper as is naturally a Torment and Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to it ≈øelf; and here the

foundation of Hell is laid in the evil di≈øpo≈øition of our Spirits, and till <hi>that</hi> be cured, which can only be done by <hi>Holine≈øs,</hi> 'tis as impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible for a wicked Man to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and contented in him≈øelf, as it is for a Sick Man to be at ea≈øe; and the external pre≈øence of God, and a local Heaven would ≈øignifie no more to make a wicked Man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and contented, than heaps of Gold, and Con≈øorts of Mu≈øick, and a well ≈øpread Table, and a rich Bed, would contribute to a Man's ea≈øe in the paroxy≈øms of a Feaver, or in a violent fit of the Stone. If a ≈øen≈øual, or covetous, or ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man were in Heaven, he would be like <hi>the rich Man in Hell,</hi> he would be <hi>tormented</hi> with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Thir≈øt,</hi> and burnt up in the Flames of his own ardent De≈øires, and would not meet with the lea≈øt <hi>drop</hi> of ≈øuitable Plea≈øure and Delight, to <hi>quench</hi> and allay the Heat; the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe ≈øuch a Man hath <hi>that</hi> within him which torments him, and he cannot be at ea≈øe,

till <hi>that</hi> be removed. <hi>Sin</hi> is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and unnatural and unea≈øie State of our Soul, every wicked Man's Spirit is out of order, and till the Man be put into a right Frame by <hi>Holine≈øs,</hi> he will be perpetually di≈øquieted, and can have no re≈øt within him≈øelf. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet fitly de≈øcribes the condition of ≈øuch a Per≈øon, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 57.20, 21. <hi>But the wicked are like the troubled ≈øea when it cannot re≈øt, who≈øe waters ca≈øt forth mire and dirt; there is no peace ≈øaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> So long as a Man is unholy, ≈øo long as filthine≈øs and corruption abound in his Heart, they will be re≈øtle≈øty working, like Wine which is in a perpetual motion and agitation, till it have purged it ≈øelf of its Dregs and Foulne≈øs. Nothing is more turbulent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet than the Spirit of a wicked Man; it is like <hi>the Sea,</hi> when it roars and rages through the ≈øtrengh of contrary Winds; it is the ≈øcene of furious Lu≈øts and wild Pa≈ø≈øions, which as they are contrary to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, ≈øo they maintain perpetual

conte≈øts and fewds among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>
            <p>All Sin ≈øeparates us from God, who is the Foundation of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs. Our limited Nature, and the narrowne≈øs of our Beings, will not permit us to be happy in our ≈øelves; it is peculiar to God to be his own Happine≈øs; but Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he is finite, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øelf-≈øufficient, is carried forth by an innate de≈øire, of Happine≈øs, to ≈øeek his Felicity in God. So that there is in the nature of man a Spring of re≈øtle≈øs Motion, which with great impatience forceth him out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and to≈ø≈øes him to and fro, till he comes to re≈øt in ≈øomething that is ≈øelf-≈øufficient. Our Souls, when they are ≈øeparated from God, like <hi>the unclean Spirit</hi> in the Go≈øpel, when it was <hi>ca≈øt out,</hi> they <hi>wander up and down in dry and de≈øart places, ≈øeeking re≈øt, but finding none.</hi> Were the whole World calm about a Man, and did it not make the lea≈øt attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, were he free from the fears of Divine Vengeance; yet he could
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:35252:212"/>
not be ≈øatisfied with him≈øelf, there is ≈øomething within him that would not let him be at re≈øt, but would tear him from his own Foundation and Con≈øi≈øtency; ≈øo that when we are once broken off from God, the ≈øen≈øe of inward want doth ≈øtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and force us to ≈øeek our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment el≈øe-where. So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Holine≈øs,</hi> which re-unites us to God, and re≈øtores our Souls to their primitive and original ≈øtate, can make us <hi>happy,</hi> and give peace and re≈øt to our Souls. And this is the con≈øtant voice and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Scripture, and the tenour of the Bible. <hi>Acquaint thy ≈øelf with God, that thou maye≈øt be at Peace.</hi> Job 22.21. <hi>Light is ≈øown for the righteous, and gladne≈øs for the upright in heart,</hi> P≈øal. 97.11. <hi>The work of righteou≈øne≈øs is peace, and the effect of righteou≈øne≈øs, quietne≈øs and a≈ø≈øurance for ever,</hi> I≈øa. 32.17.</p>

            <p>It is an Argument of a great, and noble, and generous Mind, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our Thoughts and Cares to the concernments of others, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our intere≈øt, and power, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:35252:216"/>
endeavours for their benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: Whereas a low, and mean, and narrow Spirit, is contracted and ≈øhrivel'd up within it ≈øelf, and cares only for its own things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the good and happine≈øs of others.</p>
            <p>It is the mo≈øt noble work in the World, becau≈øe that inclination of Mind, which prompts us to do good, is the very temper and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of <hi>Happine≈øs. Solomon,</hi> after all his Experience of worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and plea≈øure, at la≈øt pitched upon this, as the great felicity of humane Life, and the only good U≈øe that is to be made of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øperous and plentiful Fortune. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈ø.</hi> 3.12. <hi>I know</hi> (≈øays he, ≈øpeaking of Riches) <hi>that there is no good in them, but for a Man to rejoice and do good in his life.</hi> And certainly the be≈øt way to take joy in an E≈øtate, is to do good with it; and a great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er and wi≈øer than <hi>Solomon</hi> has ≈øaid it, even he <hi>who</hi> is <hi>the Power and Wi≈ødom of God</hi> has ≈øaid it,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:35252:216"/>
that <hi>it is a more ble≈ø≈øed thing to give than to receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Con≈øider farther, That this is one of the great and ≈øub≈øtantial parts of Religion, and next to the love and honour, which we pay to Almighty God, the mo≈øt acceptable Service that we can do to him; it is one Table of the Law, and next the <hi>Fir≈øt and great Commandment,</hi> of <hi>loving the Lord our God,</hi> and very like to it. <hi>And the ≈øecond is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it,</hi> (≈øays our Saviour) <hi>Thou ≈øhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ≈øelf</hi>; like to it, in the excellency of it; and equal to it, in the nece≈ø≈øary obligation of it. For <hi>this Commandment</hi> (≈øays St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epi≈øt. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 21). <hi>we have from him, that he who loveth God, love his Brother al≈øo.</hi> The Fir≈øt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment indeed excels in the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Object, becau≈øe it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins the Love of God; but the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ≈øeems to have the advantage in the reality of its Effects: for the Love of God con≈øi≈øts in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and honour of him; but our <hi>righteou≈øne≈øs and goodne≈øs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:35252:217"/>
not to him</hi>; we can do him no real Benefit and Advantage: But our love to Men is really U≈øeful and Beneficial to them; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, God is contented in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, that the external Honour and Wor≈øhip which he requires of us by his po≈øitive Commands, ≈øhould give way to that Natural Duty of Love and Mercy which we owe to one another. <hi>I will have mercy</hi> (≈øays God in the Prophet <hi>Amos) and not ≈øacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ≈øhew how great a value God puts upon this Duty, he hath made it the very Te≈øtimony of our love to him≈øelf; and for want of it, hath declared that he will reject all our other Profe≈ø≈øions and Te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of love to him, as fal≈øe and in≈øincere. <hi>Who ≈øo hath this worlds good,</hi> (≈øaith St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epi≈øt. 3.17.) <hi>and ≈øeeth his Brother have need, and ≈øhutteth up his bowels of compa≈ø≈øion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> And again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>If any man ≈øay, I love God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his Brother, he is a lyar; for he

that loveth not his Brother, whom he hath ≈øeen, how can he love God, whom he hath not ≈øeen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ≈øee the Duty here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, both in the Extent and in the Excellency of it; <hi>let us do good.</hi> I proceed to con≈øider, in the</p>

them≈øelves as perfectly di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd from all Obligation of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs to the re≈øt of Mankind: And yet it is certain, that they were expre≈øly enjoin'd by their Law, to be kind to Strangers, becau≈øe they them≈øelves had been Strangers in the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath re≈øtored this Law of Love and Charity to its Natural and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal extent; and hath declared every one that is of the ≈øame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with our ≈øelves to be our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and our <hi>Brother</hi>; and that he is to be treated by us accordingly, when ever he ≈øtands in need of our kindne≈øs and help; and to ≈øhew that none are out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈øs of our Charity, he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øly commanded us to extend it to tho≈øe, who of all others can lea≈øt pretend to it, even our <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Per≈øecutors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if the Que≈øtion be about the extent of our Charity in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the≈øe <hi>two</hi> things are plainly enjoined by the Chri≈øtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:35252:218"/>1. Negatively, That we ≈øhould not hate or bear ill-will to any man, or do him any harm or mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. <hi>Love worketh no Evil to his Neighbour,</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. And this negative Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty every Man may exerci≈øe towards all Men, without Exception, and that equally; becau≈øe it does not ≈øignifie any po≈øitive Act, but only that we ab≈øtain from Enmity and Hatred, from Injury and Revenge, which it is in every Man's power, by the Grace of God, and the due care and government of him≈øelf, to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Po≈øitively, The Law of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity requires, that we ≈øhould bear an univer≈øal good-will to all Men, and wi≈øh every Man's happine≈øs, and pray for it, as ≈øincerely as we wi≈øh and pray for our own; and if we be ≈øincere in our Wi≈øhes, and Prayers for the good of others, we ≈øhall be ≈øo in our Endeavours to procure and promote it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:35252:219"/>But the great difficulty is, as to the exerci≈øe of our Charity, and the real Expre≈ø≈øions and Effects of it, in doing good to others; which is the Duty here meant in the Text, and (as I told you before) does more particularly relate to the Relief of tho≈øe who are in Want and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity. And the rea≈øon of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is, becau≈øe no Man can do good to all in this kind, if he would; it not being po≈ø≈øible for any Man to come to the knowledge of every man's Nece≈ø≈øity and Di≈øtre≈øs; and if he could, no man's Ability can po≈ø≈øibly reach to the ≈øupply and the relief of all men's Wants. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this limitation the Text gives to this Duty; <hi>as we have opportunity</hi> (≈øays the Apo≈øtle) <hi>let us do good unto all men</hi>; which either ≈øignifies, as occa≈øion is offered, or as we have Ability of doing, or both; as I ≈øhall ≈øhew afterwards.</p>
            <p>So that it being impo≈ø≈øible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe this Charity to all Men that ≈øtand in need of it, 'tis nece≈ø≈øary
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:35252:219"/>
to make a difference, and to u≈øe Prudence and Di≈øcretion in the Choice of the mo≈øt fit and proper Objects. We do not know the Wants of all men, and therefore the bounds of our Knowledge do of nece≈ø≈øity li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our Charity within a certain compa≈øs; and of tho≈øe whom we do know, we can relieve but a ≈ømall part, for want of Ability; from whence it follows, that tho' a man were never ≈øo Charitably di≈øpo≈øed, yet he mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity ≈øet ≈øome Rules to him≈øelf, for the management of his Charity to the be≈øt advantage. What tho≈øe Rules are, cannot mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely and nicely be determined; when all is done, much mu≈øt be left to every man's prudence and di≈øcretion, upon a full view and con≈øideration of the Ca≈øe before him, and all the Circum≈øtances of it; but yet ≈øuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules may be given, as may ≈øerve for the direction of our Practice in mo≈øt Ca≈øes; and for the re≈øt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man's prudence, as well as it can, mu≈øt determine the matter. And the Rules which I ≈øhall give, ≈øhall be the≈øe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:35252:220"/>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Ca≈øes of Extremity ought to take the fir≈øt place, and do for that time challenge precedence of all other Con≈øiderations. If a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon be in great and pre≈øent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈øs, and his Nece≈ø≈øity ≈øo urgent, that if he be not immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, he mu≈øt peri≈øh; this is ≈øo violent a Ca≈øe, and calls ≈øo loud for pre≈øent help, that there is no re≈øi≈øting of it, whatever the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon be; though a perfect Stranger to us, though mo≈øt unworthy, though the greate≈øt Enemy we have in the World, yet the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of his Di≈øtre≈øs does ≈øo ≈øtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plead for him, as to ≈øilence all Con≈øiderations to the contrary; for after all, he is <hi>a man,</hi> and is of the ≈øame Nature with our ≈øelves, and the con≈øideration of <hi>Humanity</hi> ought, for that time, to prevail over all Objections again≈øt the Man, and to prefer him to our Charity, before the neare≈øt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Friend, who is not in the like Extremity. In other ca≈øes, we not only may, but ought to
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:35252:220"/>
relieve our Friends, and tho≈øe that have de≈øerved well of us in the fir≈øt place: but if our Enemy be in Extremity, then that Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept takes place, <hi>if thine Enemy hunger, feed him; if he thir≈øt, give him to drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the next place, I think, that the Obligation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the nearne≈øs of Relation, does challenge a Preference; for there is all the Rea≈øon in the World, if other things be equal, that we ≈øhould con≈øider and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the nece≈ø≈øity of tho≈øe, who are of our Blood and Kindred, and Members of our Family, before the Nece≈ø≈øities of Strangers, and tho≈øe who have no relation to us. There is a ≈øpecial Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us, and another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation be≈øide that of Charity, to have a particular Care and Regard for them. In this ca≈øe not only Chri≈øtianity, but Nature tyes this Duty upon us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>If any man provide not for his own, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially for his Dome≈øticks,</hi> for them
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:35252:221"/>
that are of his Family, <hi>he hath deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Faith, and is wor≈øe than an Infidel</hi>; that is, he doth not only offend again≈øt the Law of Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but again≈øt the very Dictates of Nature, which prevail even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt the Infidels. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath told us, that when our Parents ≈øtand in need of relief, it is more acceptable to God, to employ our E≈øtates that way, than to devote them to him, and his immediate ≈øervice; and that it is a kind of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege</hi> to Con≈øecrate that to God, whereby our Parents may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, and provided for in their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Obligation of Kindne≈øs and Benefits, lays the next claim to our Charity. If they fall into Want, who have obliged us by their former Kindne≈øs and Charity, both Ju≈øtice and Charity do chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge from us a particular con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Ca≈øe; and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, if we our ≈øelves have been obliged to their Family, or to any that are nearly related to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:35252:221"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Tho≈øe <hi>who are of the hou≈øhold of faith,</hi> and of the ≈øame Religion; and Members of the ≈øame My≈øtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and do partake of the ≈øame Holy My≈øteries, the Body and Blood of our Ble≈ø≈øed Saviour, the ≈øtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Bond of Love and Charity, The≈øe fall under a very particular Con≈øideration in the exerci≈øe of our Charity. And of this the Apo≈øtle puts us in Mind, in the la≈øt words of my Text; <hi>let us do good unto all Men, e≈øpecially unto tho≈øe that are of the hou≈øhold of faith.</hi> God hath a ≈øpecial Love and Regard for ≈øuch; and tho≈øe whom God Loves, ought to be very dear to us.</p>
            <p>And this, perhaps, was a con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the fir≈øt rank in tho≈øe times, when Chri≈øtians liv'd among Heathens, and were expo≈øed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Wants and Sufferings; but it ≈øignifies much le≈øs now, that Chri≈øtianity is the general Profe≈ø≈øion of a Nation, and is too often made u≈øe of to very uncharitable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes;
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:35252:222"/>
to confine Men's Bounty and Benefits to their own Sect and Party, as if they, and none but they, were <hi>the hou≈øhold of Faith</hi>; A Principle, which I know not whether it hath more of <hi>Judai≈øme</hi> or of <hi>Popery</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> After the≈øe, the Merit of the Per≈øons, who are the Objects of our Charity, and all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances belonging to them, are to be valu'd and con≈øider'd, and we are accordingly to proportion our Charity, and the degrees of it. I ≈øhall in≈øtance in ≈øome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, by which a prudent Man may judge of the re≈øt.</p>
            <p>Tho≈øe who labour in an hone≈øt calling, but yet are oppre≈øt with their charge, or di≈øabled for a time by Sickne≈øs, or ≈øome other ca≈øual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the≈øe many a time need as much, and certainly de≈øerve much better than common Beggars; for the≈øe are u≈øeful members of the Common-Wealth; and we cannot
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:35252:222"/>
place our Charity better, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tho≈øe, who do what they can to ≈øupport them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>Tho≈øe likewi≈øe who are fallen from a rich and plentiful Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion, without any fault or Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of their own, meerly by the Providence of God, or ≈øome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Calamity; the≈øe are more e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Objects of our Charity, and liberal Relief.</p>
            <p>And tho≈øe al≈øo, who have been Charitable, and have liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved others, when they were in Condition to do it; or the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or near Relations of tho≈øe, who were eminently Charitable and beneficial to Mankind, do de≈øerve a particular regard in our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Mankind being (as I may ≈øay) bound in Ju≈øtice, and for the honour of God's Providence, to make good his Promi≈øe, to pre≈øerve ≈øuch from extream nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
            <p>And <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> tho≈øe, who≈øe vi≈øible Wants, and great Age and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:35252:223"/>
do plead for more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Pity, and do, at fir≈øt ≈øight, convince every one that ≈øees them, that they do not Beg out of Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, but of nece≈ø≈øity, and becau≈øe they are not able to do any thing towards their own ≈øupport and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtence.</p>
            <p>There are innumerable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances more, which it would be endle≈øs to reckon up; but the≈øe which I have mentioned are ≈øome of the chief, and by proportion to the≈øe, we may direct our ≈øelves in other Ca≈øes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Tho≈øe whom we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know to be true Objects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are to be con≈øider'd by us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho≈øe who are ≈øtrangers to us, and who≈øe Condition we do not know, yea, tho' in common Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we do not di≈ø-believe them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe in Rea≈øon and Prudence we are obliged to prefer tho≈øe, who are certainly known to us, ≈øince we find by experience, that there are many Cheats and counterfit Beggars, who can tell a fair Story, and carry
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:35252:223"/>
about Te≈øtimonials of their own making; and likewi≈øe becau≈øe we run the Hazard of mi≈øplacing our Charity, when there are Objects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be≈øides, where we are ≈øure we ≈øhall place it right; and Charity mi≈øplaced, as it is in Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity no Charity in it's ≈øelf, ≈øo it is hardly any in us, when we ≈øquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ≈øo imprudently as to pa≈øs by a certain and real Object, and give it to tho≈øe of whom we are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that they are true Objects of Charity. In this blind way a Man <hi>may give all his Goods to the Poor,</hi> as he thinks, and yet do no real <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And therefore, unle≈øs we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to relieve <hi>every one that asks,</hi> we mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and u≈øe our be≈øt Prudence in the choice of the mo≈øt proper Objects of our Charity.</p>
            <p>And yet we ought not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve this Rule ≈øo ≈øtrictly, as to ≈øhut out all whom we do not know, without exception; becau≈øe their Ca≈øe, if it be true, may ≈øometimes be much more pitiable, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extremity, than the ca≈øe of many
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:35252:224"/>
whom we do know; and then it would be uncharitable to reject ≈øuch, and to harden our Hearts ≈øo far again≈øt them, as utterly to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe them; becau≈øe it is no fault of theirs, that we do not know them; no, their Wants may be real, notwith≈øtanding that; e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when their Extremity ≈øeems great, we ought not to ≈øtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too rigorous a Proof and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, but ≈øhould accept of a fair probability.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Tho≈øe who ≈øuffer for the Cau≈øe of Religion, and are ≈øtript of all for the ≈øake of it, ought to have a great Precedence in our Charity to mo≈øt other ca≈øes. And this of late hath been, and ≈øtill is, the ca≈øe of many among us, who have fled hither for Refuge, from the Tyranny and Cruelty of their Per≈øecutors, and have been by a mo≈øt extraordinary Charity of the whole Nation, more than once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them, mo≈øt ≈øea≈øonably reliev'd; but e≈øpecially by the Bounty of this great City, who≈øe
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:35252:224"/>
Liberality, upon the≈øe Occa≈øions, hath been beyond all Example, and even all belief. And I have often thought, that this very thing, next to the Mercy and Goodne≈øs of Almighty God, hath had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Influence upon our Pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Deliverance from tho≈øe terrible Calamities, which were ju≈øt ready to break in upon us; and were we not ≈øo ≈øtupidly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen≈øible of this great Deliverance which God hath wrought for us, and ≈øo horribly unthankful to him, and to the happy In≈øtruments of it, might ≈øtill be a means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Favour of God to us. And what cau≈øe have we to thank God, who hath allotted to us this <hi>more ble≈ø≈øed,</hi> and more merciful part, <hi>to give,</hi> and not <hi>to receive</hi>; to be free from Per≈øecution our ≈øelves, that we might give Refuge and Relief to tho≈øe that are per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted!</p>

new Opportunities for the exerci≈øe of our Charity, ≈øpringing up and pre≈øenting them≈øelves to us. Let us never think, that we can do enough in the way of doing good. The be≈øt and the happie≈øt Beings are mo≈øt con≈øtant and unweary'd in this work of doing good. The holy Angels of God are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually employed in <hi>mini≈øtring for</hi> the good of <hi>tho≈øe, who ≈øhall be Heirs of Salvation</hi>: And the Son of God, when he appear'd in our Nature, and <hi>dwelt among us,</hi> that he might be a perfect and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Example to us of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs and Virtue, <hi>he went about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good</hi> to the Bodies and to the Souls of Men. How diligent and unweary'd was he in this work! It was his Employment and his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, his <hi>Meat and Drink,</hi> the Joy and the Life of his Life. And God him≈øelf, tho' he is infinitely and perfectly good in him≈øelf, yet he ≈øtill continues <hi>to do good,</hi> and is never weary of this ble≈ø≈øed work.

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:35252:228"/>
and how can we be weary of that work, which is an Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the highe≈øt Excellency and Perfection, and the very E≈ø≈øence of Happine≈øs.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And la≈øtly, Here is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Encouragement to the chearful di≈øcharge of this Duty, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe in due ≈øea≈øon we ≈øhall reap, if we faint not; therefore as we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, let us do good unto all Men. In due ≈øea≈øon we ≈øhall reap,</hi> that is, ≈øooner or later, in this World, or in the other, we ≈øhall receive the full reward of our well-doing.</p>
            <p>And now I have explain'd this Duty to you, as plainly and briefly as I could, the harde≈øt part of my Task is yet behind, to per≈øwade Men to the practice of it; and to this purpo≈øe I ≈øhall only in≈øi≈øt upon the promi≈øe in the Text, <hi>be not weary in well-doing; for in due ≈øea≈øon ye ≈øhall reap, if ye faint not.</hi> We ≈øhall reap the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure and ≈øatisfaction of it in our own Minds, and all the other mighty Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of it in this World, and
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:35252:229"/>
the va≈øt and un≈øpeakable Reward of it in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> We ≈øhall reap the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure and Satisfaction of it in our own Minds; and there is no ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øual Plea≈øure that is comparable to the delight of Doing good. This <hi>Cato</hi> makes his boa≈øt of, as the great Comfort and Joy of his old Age, <hi>Con≈øcientia bene actae vitae, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torumque benefactorum recordatio ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundi≈ø≈øima.</hi> The remembrance of a well ≈øpent Life, and of many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Kindne≈ø≈øes done by us to others, is one of the mo≈øt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant things in the World. Sen≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Plea≈øures ≈øoon die and vani≈øh; but that is not the wor≈øt of them, they leave a Sting behind them, and when the Plea≈øure is gone, nothing remains but Guilt, and Trouble, and Repentance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Reflection upon any good we have done, is a perpetual Spring of Peace and Plea≈øure to us, and no Trouble and Bitterne≈øs en≈øues upon it; the Thoughts of it lye even and ea≈øy in our Minds, and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:35252:229"/>
≈øo often as it comes to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, it mini≈øters fre≈øh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ≈øhall likewi≈øe reap other mighty Advantages by it in this World. It is the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive a la≈øting Ble≈ø≈øing upon our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates. What we give in Alms and Charity is con≈øecrated to God, and is one of the chiefe≈øt and mo≈øt acceptable Sacrifices in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Religion; ≈øo the Apo≈øtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. <hi>To do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with ≈øuch Sacrifices God is well plea≈øed.</hi> It is like the fir≈øt-Fruits under the Law, which being dedicated and offered up to God, did derive a Ble≈ø≈øing upon their whole Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øt.</p>
            <p>And it procures for us al≈øo the Ble≈ø≈øings and Prayers of tho≈øe, to whom we extend our Charity; their Ble≈ø≈øing, I ≈øay, upon us and ours, and all that we have; and <hi>is it a ≈ømall thing in our eye, to
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:35252:230"/>
have</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ≈øpeaks) <hi>the Ble≈ø≈øing of them, who are ready to peri≈øh, to come upon us? The fervent Prayer</hi> of the poor for us <hi>availeth much,</hi> for God hath a ≈øpecial <hi>regard to the Prayers of the de≈øtitute, and his Ear is open to their cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Few Men have Faith to believe it, but certainly Charity is a great ≈øecurity to us in the times of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and that not only from the ≈øpecial Promi≈øe and Providence of God, which is engaged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve tho≈øe from want, who are ready to relieve the Nece≈ø≈øity of others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.25. <hi>The liberal Soul ≈øhall be made fat; and he that watereth ≈øhall be watered al≈øo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf,</hi> and Prov. 28.27. <hi>He that giveth to the poor ≈øhall not lack; he ≈øhall not be afraid in the evil time, and in the days of Dearth he ≈øhall be ≈øatisfiyed,</hi> ≈øays the P≈øalmi≈øt: But be≈øides the Promi≈øe and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, our Charity and Alms are likewi≈øe a great ≈øecurity to us, from the Nature and Rea≈øon of
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:35252:230"/>
the thing it ≈øelf. Who≈øoever is charitable to others, does wi≈øely be≈øpeak the Charity and Kindne≈øs of others for him≈øelf, again≈øt the day of nece≈ø≈øity; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that makes a Man more, and ≈øurer Friends, than our Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; this will plead for us, and ≈øtand our Friend in our greate≈øt Troubles and Dangers; <hi>For a good Man,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, that is, for one that is ready to oblige others by great Kindne≈ø≈øes and Benefits, <hi>one would even dare to die.</hi> It has ≈øometimes happened, that the Obligation which a man hath laid upon others by a chearful and ≈øea≈øonable Charity, hath in time of Danger and Extremity done him more kindne≈øs, than all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate could do for him. <hi>Alms,</hi> ≈øaith the Wi≈øe Man, <hi>hath delivered from Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in times of publick Di≈øtre≈øs, and when we are be≈øet with cruel and powerful Enemies, who, <hi>if God were not on our ≈øide, would ≈øwallow as
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:35252:231"/>

               </gap> a Nation does many times prove its be≈øt Safeguard and Shield. There is a mo≈øt remarkable Pa≈ø≈øage to this purpo≈øe, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 29.11, 12, 13. <hi>Lay up thy Trea≈øure according to the commandment of the mo≈øt high, and it ≈øhall bring thee more profit, than Gold; ≈øhut up thine alms in thy Store-hou≈øe, and it ≈øhall deliver thee from all affliction, it ≈øhall fight for thee again≈øt thy enemies, more than a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shield and a ≈øtrong Spear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of this I doubt not, but we of this Nation, by the great Mercy and Goodne≈øs of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, have had happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in our late wonderful Deliverance, under the Conduct and Valour, of one of the be≈øt and brave≈øt of Princes, and to whom by too many among us, the mo≈øt unworthy and unthankful Returns have been made, for the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried pains he hath undergone, and for the de≈øperate hazards he hath expos'd him≈øelf to for our ≈øakes,

that ever were made to ≈øo Great and Generous a Benefactour; ≈øo great a Benefactour I ≈øay, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the≈øe Nations, but to all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> in a≈ø≈øerting and vindicating their Liberties again≈øt the in≈øolent Tyranny and Pride of one of the greate≈øt oppre≈ø≈øours of Mankind, of whom I may ≈øay, as <hi>Job</hi> does of the Leviathan, <hi>Job</hi> 41.33, 34. <hi>

            </p>
            <p>And beyond all this, the Ble≈ø≈øing of God does de≈øcend upon the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity of tho≈øe, who are eminently Charitable, and great Benefactours to Mankind. This <hi>David</hi> ob≈øerves in his time; <hi>I have been young</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>and now am old; yet have I not ≈øeen the righteous for≈øaken, nor his ≈øeed begging Bread</hi>; and what he means by <hi>the righteous Man,</hi> he explains in the next Words, <hi>he is ever merciful and lendeth.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:35252:232"/>I ≈øhall only add upon this Head, that the practice of this Virtue will be one of our be≈øt comforts at the hour of Death, and that we ≈øhall then look back upon all the good we have done in our life, with the greate≈øt contentment and joy imaginable. <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which he de≈øign'd for the perfect Idea of a good Prince, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pre≈øents him in the la≈øt minutes of his life, addre≈ø≈øing him≈øelf to God to this purpo≈øe, <hi>Thou knowe≈øt that I have been a lover of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and now that I am leaving this World, I hope to find that mercy from thee, which I have ≈øhewed to others.</hi> The≈øe Words that excellent heathen Hi≈øtorian thought fit to come from the mouth of ≈øo excellent a Prince, as he had de≈øcrib'd him, ju≈øt as he was leaving the World; by which we may ≈øee, what the Light of Nature thought to be the be≈øt comfort of a dying Man.

            <p>And now that I have declar'd this Duty to you, together with the mighty plea≈øure, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and rewards of it, I crave leave to pre≈øent you with ≈øome
