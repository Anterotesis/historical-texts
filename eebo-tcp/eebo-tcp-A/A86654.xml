         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Las, alas, woe is me for thee thou deſolate Nation of <hi>Ireland,</hi> thou art to be pittied, and lamented, becauſe of thy backſlidings, and rebellion againſt the Lord, thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in iniquity, and thy tranſgreſſions cannot be numbred. O thou art a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe habitation, and barren of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and mercy, and true judgement; even from the head to the taile, thou art corrupted, and thy wickedneſſe is marked before the Lord: thy Rulers, and Teachers, and people, are all gone out of the way, and are diſobedient children, having backſlided from the pure wayes of the Lord God, a deceitfull heart is found among them, and a lie is in their hand; even the beſt of men are as a bryar, and the moſt upright among men ſharper then a thorn hedge; a curſed ſeed hath taken root in thee, and fruit of a curſed taſt is abundantly ſprung forth; thou art turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114967:3"/>
vine unto God, and are become abominable in his eye; thy vines brings forth a ſoure grape, and the Lords ſoule hath no delight therein; thou art altogether untilled, and thy flowers gives an ill ſmell; thy inhabitants have ſet themſelves to doe wickedneſſe, they imagine miſchiefe upon their beds and brings it forth in the morning, cruelty is their weapon againſt the innocent, and hard heartedneſſe is their defence againſt the upright.</p>
            <p>Woe is me for thee thou deſolate Nation, who hath rejected the counſell of the Lord, and neglected the day of thy Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein the Lord would have gathered thee, but thou wouldſt not; How often hath the Lord ſpoken unto thee, and thou wilt not hear his call? By judgement hath he ſpoken, and by mercy hath he drawn, but thou refuſeſt to returne, and wilt not be reclaimed, but continues in thy Rebellion againſt the Lord, and forgets the work of his hand, in ages and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations paſt; even ſince the beginning haſt thou been a Land of wickedneſſe, and a people of a curſed ſeed, drinking up ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as an Oxe that drinks up water, and fild up the meaſure of Tranſgreſſion, till the Lord was forced in grievous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to deale with thee, even his wrath in a day broke forth upon thee, and the fire of indignation was kindled in thee, and thy Princes were cut off in fury, and thy inhabitants fell by the plague and ſword in great numbers, and thou was given up to be a prey to thy enemies in thy treaſures, and the cruell hearted took the ſpoyle, thou waſt laid levell in the duſt of deep miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and confuſion, and thy lamentation and ſorrow was heard among the Nations, and the ſtroke of the Lords hand was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon thee, and his judgements was juſt upon thy head, and he gave no reſt unto thee for many years, but thou waſt as a trembling leafe and as a forſaken bough, and thou waſt made deſolate and comfortleſſe, and miſery girded thee about, and then thy ſtout heart was brought down into ſorrow when the Lord contended with thee; but now thou haſt eaſe from thy bitterneſſe, and a day of reſt from thy ſore trouble, yet haſt thou forgotten the day of thy diſtreſſe, and art againe more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly exalted, and thy ſins are much more encreaſed, the pride
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114967:3"/>
of thy heart is become equall with <hi>Sodome,</hi> and thy tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are encreaſed to her number and thy rebellion againſt the Lord is grown more high, and through mercies and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance art thou waxen fat, and now thou kicks againſt the Lord, and in thy heart ſayes, Who is he?</p>
            <p>O when wilt thou conſider, what the Lord hath wrought? when wilt thou call to minde his juſt and righteous dealing? who haſt forgotten the day of thy former viſitation, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more vile in the ſight of the Lord, by thy ſecret hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of deceitfull profeſſion, then thou waſt in thy open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe, when thou layeſt naked in thy open ſins.</p>
            <p>O Deſolate Nation, the Lord once and againe hath ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth his hands unto thee, in pitty for thee, and he ſent his ſervants and witneſſes to warn thee of theſe thy tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to call upon thee to awake thee out of thy careleſneſſe, and he gave thee a glorious day of viſitation, and free tenders of ſalvation, wherein thou mightſt have made thy peace with him, and repent thee of thy ſin; And his ſervants were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in thee, and lamented over thee, and gave themſelves to be ſpent for thee, and gladly ſuffered the reproach of the heathen, and the cruelty of the wicked, that thereby thou mightſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed out of thy Rebellion and wickedneſſe, and they gave their back to the ſmiter, and loved not their life unto death, nor prized not their liberty unto bonds, but diligently in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and labours, and perplexities, called unto thee, and through thy Townes and Cities proclaimed the viſitation and meſſage of the Lord concerning thee, and was accounted as ſheep for the ſlaughter, that they might finiſh their Teſtimony to the gathering of thee, but thou wouldſt not, but haſt to this very day ſtopped thy eare from counſell, and hardned thy heart againſt reproofe, and contemned the day of thy viſitation, and hereby added to thy meaſure of wickedneſſe in dealing cruelly with the Lords ſervants, who rewarded them evill for good, and entreated them ſhamefully, and laid thy hand of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them, and rejected their meſſage of glad tidings, and would not be inſtructed in the way of the Lord unto ſalvation,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114967:4"/>
but gave heed unto the falſe viſions of thy lying Prophets, and took counſel againſt the Lord of thy Inchanters, &amp; perſecuted the faithfull by unjuſt Impriſonments, and dealt wickedly with the Lords choſen, and made unrighteous decrees in thy wrath, and ſealed them in thy cruelty, and made a purpoſe in thy heart to root out the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to lay waſt the Lords Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Ireland,</hi> hereby in the Name of the Lord (thus far) I ſeal my Teſtimony in faithfulneſſe unto thee, and binds up my many burdens, and travells, and reproaches, and Tryalls, and ſufferings in thee, in a few words, which is the word of the Lord concerning thee.</p>
            <p>Yee Heads, and Rulers, that ſits upon the Throne, Repent, and turne to the Lord, from whom you are grievouſly revolted by wofull backſlidings, a grievous ſin have you committed, a groſſe ſum of hainous abomination is recorded againſt you, the righteous God will meet you in his judgements, and once more will appear in the fire of Indignation againſt you, and your mountains of pride, and vaine-glory, and ſelfe-exaltation, ſhall be layed waſt, as your enemies were before you, and as you have thought to doe (to root out the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to ſpoyle the tender grapes of the Lords vintage) even ſo ſhall it be done unto you, and your deſtruction cometh as an armed man, and you cannot eſcape, nor fly to hide your ſelves, from the wrath that cometh, which is kindled already to devoure the pleaſant Palaces of your wicked hearts delight.</p>
            <p>Woe is me for you; you that are exalted upon your moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of eaſe and liberty, having forgotten the rock from whence you are hewn, who were raiſed out of weakneſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the mighty, and gives not glory to the Lord, neither conſiders what he hath done for you, but are become ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and diſobedient children, and of a double heart and tongue, profeſſing liberty of the pure conſcience, but living in corrupt fleſhly bondage, oppreſſing the juſt, and ſlaying the holy One, and neglecting the cry of the innocent, having made your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as heavy as your Fathers loynes; the hand of the Lord is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114967:4"/>
againſt you, and his wrath will break out upon you, who ſtrengthens the hand of evill doers, and gives liberty in your dominions, unto the ſcum of the Nations, to poſſeſſe your Land in peace, and will not give place unto the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but fortifies your ſelves againſt him, and will not ſuffer him to inherit; how full is your Land of murderers, of drunkards, of lyars, and ſwearers, and of prophane perſons, of ſugitives, and vagabonds, and runnagades, who is protected by your Law, to poſſeſſe in peace? but in wrath have you turned your ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the upright, and have made Lawes to limit the Spirit of the Lord, and to uphold deceit.</p>
            <p>Therefore Repent of this your ſin, who hath endeavoured to prevent the Lord; and humble your ſelves ye lofty, for the purpoſe of your hearts are broken, and a ſcattered Seed remains in your Dominions, which the Lord will bleſſe, and which you cannot be able to ſuppreſſe, and as pricks in your eyes will it ſtand a witneſſe againſt you in your hypocriſie, and cruelty, and the more ye lay yokes upon it, the more it will ſpring forth.</p>
            <p>Therefore be wiſe ye Rulers, and Judges, and leave to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine miſchiefe, and lay your hands upon your mouths, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen them not any more, and turne in your minds to the light of Chriſt Jeſus, wherewith you are enlightned, and it will let you ſee what you have done, and will ſet your ſins in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, and will juſtly reprove you, who have not done, as you would be done unto, but have caſt the Law of God behind your backs, and not regarded the call of equity, and if you love the light of Chriſt it will change your mindes, and will bring you to Repentance from ſin unto God, and from the Dominion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

with this light in your conſciences, your ſins are written, and all that ever you have done is recorded; and this light ſhall be the ſwift witneſſe, of the condemnation of the wicked, in the day of the Lord; and by it all your works will be brought to remembrance, and your ſins will be ſet in order before you, to receive judgement by Chriſt Jeſus: And here is the free love and gift of God unto you, who hath given you a light to guide you in his way; if you own it, and wait in it, it will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the judgements of God againſt ſin in you, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſin in your fleſh, and will reveal the righteouſneſſe of God to be your covering; if you dwell in the light, it is your teacher, and way unto life eternall, and if you bring all your deeds to it, it will reprove every evill word and work, and give you diſcerning of things that differ it will manifeſt the ſecreteſt deceit of your hearts, and the windings of the Serpent, and will be judge thereof, till unrighteouſneſſe be taken away, and a birth brought forth from above, and born of another nature and ſeed, which if you be not born againe, you cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the fear of the Lord all conſider, and ſearch your ſelves, in tender love to all your ſoules I write: You muſt be judged in the fleſh, that you may be juſtified in the Spirit, and you muſt be made poor, and emptied of all your knowledge, and wiſdome, that you may be filled and made tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe. So if you believe in Chriſt Jeſus the light, and life, of the world, your hearts will be cleanſed by the word of God, which endures for ever; and the Covenant of peace will be eſtabliſhed with you, where ſin is no more remembred, being condemned, ſo now you have all time, this is to you all a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as I was moved of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Repent, the dreadfull day is at hand, and meet the Lord, by confeſſing and forſaking your ſins, and prepare the way of the Lord, his coming draweth near, leaſt his judgements come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you unawares, and his wrath ſweep you away in fury, and your Nation become more curſed then the reſt: All your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, while your ſelves are ſinners, is to no purpoſe, for no hypocrite can enter into life, nor none

            <p>HEar the word of the Lord oh ye Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> ye Rulers, and Magiſtrates, Governours, Collonels, Captains, and Souldiers, and all ye people of the City, and ye Inhabitants of the Land of <hi>Ireland,</hi> my word is to you all, ſaith the Lord.</p>

               <p>WE who are ſervants of the Lord of Hoſts, who is the Protector of heaven and earth; we who ſtand in his fear, and knows his counſell, are moved of him who lives for ever, who is, I am, and there is none beſides him; to clear our conſciences, and our Lords truth, from the lies and ſlanders which are caſt upon us, and the good way of the Lord, which envious Spirits who are proud and knows nothing, that cannot abide ſound doctrine, doth reproach and ſlander us, and by falſe accuſations lay things to our charge which we never knew; therefore we being innocent and clear cannot but deny and bear witneſſe againſt all thoſe proceedings, which is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of righteouſneſſe and equity, and lay them at your door, whom it nearly concernes.</p>
               <p>Unto thee <hi>Henry Cromwell,</hi> who is Commander in chiefe for the affaires of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to thy Counſell we write. We have ſeen two ſeverall Warrants under your hands, dated at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in them both you ſay you have received information at your board, of great diſorders, and diſturbances of late in the County of <hi>Corke,</hi> and places adjacent, by <hi>Francis Howgill</hi> and <hi>Edward Burrough.</hi> This we ſay unto you, Your Informer hath declared an untruth at your board, and we deſire that you may make it appear wherein we have made any diſturbance, or diſorder, all theſe things in your Warrents we denie, and doe charge you in the name of the God of juſtice to ſend for them that ſo informed you, that have ſo abuſed you, and are ſo bold and impudent, as to declare unto you any ſuch thing, and ſo hath cauſed you to bring guilt upon your ſelves, in ſending out your Warrants to bring the Innocent before your judgement ſeat, and cauſed us to be dragged a hundred miles from place to place, as malefactors, and as though we had done ſome crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall act, and when we have come before you, you had nothing to lay to our charge, but hath endeavoured to give ſentence of

Oh that ever you ſhould thus requite the Lord for his love and mercy, in breaking the yoak of the oppreſſor from off your necks, and now power is given into your hands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Innocent, and to ſet the oppreſſed free, to execute judgement and righteouſneſſe upon the tranſgreſſors, whom the Law is againſt: and this doth God require of you, that his will may be done, and your wills denyed, that ſo the Nation may be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe, and that your latter end may be better then your beginning; but if you goe on in the way you are beginning, and turne juſtice backward, and let equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fall in the ſtreets, and not ſuffer judgement to enter, then miſery will be your end.</p>
               <p>Woe is me, for you have all forgotten the rock from whence you were hewn, and the deliverances of the Lord to you in the time of diſtreſſe, yea you have forgotten, and your hearts are lifted up, and by your policy think to eſtabliſh your own wills, and to limit the holy one a way, and ſet up your ſtandard by his, and truſt in the arme of fleſh; what is become of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tender conſciences you have ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with you to purchaſe? and is it ended in this?

               <p>Ye Shepheards, and Paſtors of the flock, and Teachers of the people, what account will ye render to the Lord in the day of his appearing? Should you not have gathered the flock, and fed them, and taught them in the way of righteouſnes, &amp; preſerved them from ſtraying abroad, but inſtead thereof you have ſcattered them upon the barren mountaines, and have ſtarved them, and have ſtrayed them, and led them into by

paths of idolatry, and made a prey upon them, and have fed your ſelves of them, and the heritage of the Lord hath been waſted by you, and the paſtures of the fold eaten up by Wolves, and devourers, and Lyons whelps, which made the flock afraid, driven them into ſecret corners of darkneſſe, leanneſſe, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, where they are dead for want of food.</p>

               <p>What will you plead for your ſelves?
