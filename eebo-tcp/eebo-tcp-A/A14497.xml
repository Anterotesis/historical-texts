            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

service of Hawkes &amp; Hounds,
and other poorer sports and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
(whose rare and seldome use
is indeed their greatest commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)
Long have these trifles of my

and some of them, above treble the

last I have granted them an <hi>exeatis</hi>
into the world: I will not deny, that
they had long since adventured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
but that I still looked, and as
much desired, that some good able
Poet would have taken this taske
in hand, much wondring, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the other Latin Authours,
both in prose &amp; poetry, had found
so much curtesie amongst sundry
of our ingenious Countrimen, to
bee taught to expresse their mynds
very happily in our <hi>English</hi> tongue,
and that this Author, (so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in all times, as the Prince
and parragon of all Latin poesie,
<pb facs="tcp:19894:5"/>
should yet stand still as a <hi>noli me
tangere,</hi> whom no man, either durst
or would undertake: onely Master
<hi>Spencer</hi> long since translated the
Gnat, (a little fragment of <hi>Virgils</hi>
excellence,) giving the world per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
to conceive, that hee
would at one time or other have
gone through the rest of this Poets
workes: and it is not improbable,
that this very cause was it, that
made every man els very nice to
meddle with any part of the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
which hee had begun, for
feare to come short with disgrace,
of the pattern which hee had set
before them: as none would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
(for the same reason,) to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the pourtraict of <hi>Venus,</hi> which
<hi>Apelles</hi> left behind him unperfect,

at his death: Wherefore I make no
doubt, but this which I doe, wilbee
addomed against mee for a bould,
and a daring deed: but <hi>Epistola non

my hands, I hope they will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learne so much Impudence of
the world, into which they are
crowding, that a little blushing wil
serve their turn: some Readers I
make no doubt they wil meet with
in these dainty mouth'd times, that
will taxe them, for not comming
resolved word for word, and line
for line with the Author: To whom
(if any such chance to bee) I onely
say: That this small Indeavour of
mine beeing at first undertaken
onely for my own private delight,
my homely Muse drest the whole
<pb facs="tcp:19894:6"/>

of a Translator, not tying my selfe
to the tyranny of a Grammaticall
Construction, but breaking the
shell into many peeces, was onely
carefull to preserve the kernell safe
and whole, from the violence of a
wrong, or wrested Interpretation;
for as wee cannot chide him for
an ill tasker, that beates the Corne
clean out of the straw, though yet
hee thresh it not Eare by Eare, or
sheafe by sheafe, in the same order,

they hunt not all the while so close
within the compass of a sheet, nor
hitt every head, or every double in
the very direct track, that the Hare
prickt it out before them: &amp; as wee
doe not condemn that Greyhound
to run fowle, that (with good foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship

strayns bee more or fevver, shorter
or longer then the Deeres, and his

who (working her selfe into a good
Kill-ducks place, &amp; flying jump &amp;

and comes home close to the very

blank water, though yet shee come
not so close, as to ineau, or goe to
plunge together with the Fowle:
no more do I conceive heerein my
course to be faulty, though I do not
affect to follow my Authour so
close, as to tread upon his heeles;
if yet I can keep at a neerer distance
unto him, then <hi>Creusa</hi> to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,

have sent abroad with a Gloss bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd

Gloss, the Garment, or the Imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery,

Taper before the Sunn, or to bring
Farthings (though a currant Coyn)
in payment unto the exchequer:

but amongst those of my own
growth, and last, of knowledge and
understanding, perhaps (formy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
sake) the one may bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and the other welcome, (as a
hand to draw aside the Curtaynes
from delicate Pictures) that so they
may discover the face at least,
though not the whole body of the
Poets meaning. But least I may
draw an imputation of having my
wings broader then my nest, or my
porch larger then my house, with
equall respect to all according to
the rank and quality of every seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Greeke</hi> Poets that
lived in former time,
were held in more
honour, and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongst the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of learning in
that Nation, than the
<hi>Latin</hi> Poets were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Latins,</hi>
insomuch that the most exquisite wits of the
<hi>Greekes</hi> did write diverse Comments vpon
<hi>Homer,</hi> as likewise sundry Philosophers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them; and namely <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (in my
mind, the Prince, and <hi>instar omnium,</hi> of them
all) wherein our Countrimen the <hi>Latins</hi> (I
speake not of those, who lived in the age,
wherein Poetry had not yet begnn to haue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19894:13"/>
any the least acceptance, (men which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had leisure to lay the plough, or the lance
out of their hands) but I meane those in these
latter ages, who haue applied themselves to
Philosophy, and the more graver studies) have
so opposed themselves amongst the gentle
<hi>Muses,</hi> as that they thought it a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
once to touch, or come neere them: as
if but glancing vpon these milder kindes of
studies, had beene the ready way to haue
flung them headlong from that heigth of
wisdome to which they did aspire: certainly
hereby they did defraud themselves of no
meane delight vnto their wits, and a great
refreshing and rejoycing of their mindes and
spirits, in shutting wilfully their eares, against
that delectable sweete harmony of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.
The blame hereof partly the perverse
obstinate natures of those times, and partly
the times themselves, and ill received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
must beare. As for me, (having so war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
an Authour for so weighty a matter,
as <hi>Aristotle</hi>) I will never make nice to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe
these so pleasing and sweete remissions,
and vnbending of the minde, with the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of my more serious studies, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon the merry <hi>Muses,</hi> as now of late
I haue done vpon <hi>Virgils Bucolickes,</hi> out of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19894:14"/>
which I haue picked a deeper sense in many
places, than the vulgar common Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
can conceive. For, did these <hi>Aeglogues</hi>
containe in them no farther hidden matter,
than the very bare barke of the words makes
shew of, I cannot thinke that the Author had
needed to haue taken three yeares time to
haue brought them to perfection, especially
borrowing the greatest part of the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
out of <hi>Theocritus</hi> the Sicilian Poet; Adde
hereunto, that he vndertooke this taske to
present the greatest wits of <hi>Rome</hi> withall,
namely <hi>Cornelius Gallus, Asinius Pollio, Varus,
Tucca,</hi> yea the Prince himselfe <hi>Augustus;</hi> all
which (excellently learned men themselues,
and much conversant and accustomed in the
best and chiefest writers, both in Greeke and
Latin) would doubtlesse never haue beene
so taken, and infinitely delighted, with such
kindes of light matter as Pastoralls, had they
not affoorded some hidden meaning and
sense of a higher nature. Againe, when he
once set himselfe to insinuate into their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and grace by this worke, it is to be
thought that <hi>Virgil,</hi> vnder these sporting pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of pastorall verse, did finely and neatly
as it were, inlay, and couch many things
tending to their praise and commendation,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19894:14"/>
and sundry other matters, befitting them to
take notice of; which being vnderstood
rightly, might affect the Readers mindes,
like the elegant and artificiall Pictures, which
lay secretly hidden vnder the statue of the
<hi>Sileni.</hi> Hereunto may likewise farther be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the matter itselfe and subject of this
worke doth plainly witnesse in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that it is not simply, but figuratively spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
vnder a shadow: which makes me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the more at <hi>Servius Honoratus,</hi> who will
in this booke admit of no <hi>Allegories,</hi> but
onely in that passage of <hi>Virgils</hi> grounds,
which were lost: when as many other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are therein manifestly and meerely alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall
and darke: wherefore I have thought
good, to signifie to the world, that I haue
trimmed vp these Allegories for their vse, and
behoofe, who are delighted with the reading
of <hi>Virgil,</hi> (as who is it that it not?) to the end
that the finest wits might haue a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past,
and delicate foode fitting their taste, and
might be drawne to mount higher than the
simple sense of the very bare letter. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I shall hereby restore the Poet to the true
scope and aime of his meaning, and shew,
that his purpose was not to consume so
much precious time, and exquisite verses in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19894:15"/>
triviall light matters of no moment; and that
those things which <hi>Theocritus</hi> in a ruder bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
age, did sing in a Pastorall plaine sense,
<hi>Virgil</hi> here doth apply to the <hi>Romans,</hi> making
them his owne, vnder a mysticall vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
worthy the cares of the most learned:
notwithstanding I make no doubt but I
have fitted some of his verses with such an
allegory and explication, as the Authour
himselfe never dreamed of; as likewise many
other, I have as aptly applyed, according to
his scope and meaning in the writing: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
yet I know I haue done a thing, neither
vnacceptable, nor vnprofitable to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
Greeke writers haue done the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my time, in expounding of <hi>Homer;</hi> and
<hi>Donatus</hi> in our language, hath attempted and
performed as much in his comment vpon <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
and this Poet, where he vndertakes
by his Glosses, to bewray their sense

            <p>BY <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> he meaneth <hi>Rome,</hi> or else,
<hi>Octavian:</hi> whose praise he set forth in
his pastorall verse, which is meant by his
slender oaten pipe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And God himselfe, &amp;c. Octavian</hi> was not
yet accepted nor worshipped for a God,
when <hi>Virgil</hi> composed these <hi>Aeglogues:</hi> and
therefore he vseth this word <hi>Mihi:</hi> for had
he beene so generally reputed as a God, this
emphaticall pronounce (which the Poet inserts
vpon especiall consideration) had beene su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.
For he intimates thus much, that
howsoever he had behaved himselfe as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
to others, yet he had approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to him, in stead of a God. For as <hi>Pliny</hi>
saith, he by whom a man receiues helpe and
comfort, is a God to him; and therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
<hi>Him as my God</hi>
hath feigned very brute
beasts, (by whose service they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
profit) for Gods: So the Cat, the Dog,
the Oxe, and the Ibis were honoured as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19894:16"/>
gods amongst the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> And so the
<hi>Gracians</hi> set them vp for gods, who had found
out the first vse of things profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for mans life; as namely <hi>Minerva,</hi>
for the invention of oyle: <hi>Bacchus,</hi> for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the making of wine: and <hi>Aesculapius,</hi>
for the vse of medicine and chirurgery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thou liest shaded in security.</hi> Thou art
secure and free from the scortching heare of

I might haue escaped that calamity, if I had
departed; and avoided the contagion of my

in humane affaires it signifie vnluckie,)
yet in those kinde of fites and ceremonies, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19894:16"/>
in divination, among the heathen, <hi>Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum</hi>
is taken in the contrary sense, as <hi>Avis
sinistra,</hi> is as much to say, as good lucke: <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonuit
Laevum,</hi> it thundered on the left hand,
that is, it thundered luckely, or we shall have
good successe: and this word <hi>sinistrum,</hi> is so
named <hi>à sinendo,</hi> from sufferig and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
because the gods doe suffer vs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
in our purposed projects: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cicero, in lib. 1. de Divinatione,</hi> saith, <hi>A
sinistra Cornice, ratum, &amp; firmum Augurium
fieri:</hi> The prophecy of the <hi>Augurs</hi> was rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and confirmed, from the Crow, which
they beheld on their left hand: and in the
law of the twelve Tables, it is said, <hi>Ave fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra,
populi magister esto;</hi> that is, By the bird
on the left hand, it is certaine, that thou art
the man who must rule the people. And from
hence (in the judgement of <hi>Lipsius,</hi> in his
<hi>Lib. 2. Cap. 2. Elect.</hi>) the <hi>Graecians</hi> haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the left hand, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
signifying the best. Now the reason, why
those things that did appeare to the <hi>Augurs,</hi>
in the time of their diving, on the left
hand, were commonly held to be tokens of
good lucke, was for that in the giving of a
benefit, the givers right hand is opposite, and
just against the left hand of the receiver: so
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19894:17"/>
that in this Eglogue, and in the ninth, <hi>Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra
Cornix,</hi> is to be taken for luckie, or fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;

as if they had no more knowledge of <hi>Rome,</hi>

A rusticall speech, and a question well suiting

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19894:18"/>
and home bred people, are woont to stand at

            <p>
               <hi>My freedome &amp;c.</hi> A specious tittle, and a
very reasonable pretext, and such as might
easily pierse the simple mind of a Shepheard;
it being even imprinted in the disposition of
all creatures as well reasonable, as others, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
to affect freedome: which principle
is found most true by daily experience, in such

and being subdued, if never so little
left to themselves, how soone they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
their first estate and freedome, and how
warily they preserve themselves from being
enthralled againe. Againe <hi>Virgil</hi> could not
have devised to haue flattered more artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
than by confessing to have gained liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by his meanes, who was suspected to have
aimed at the destruction and vsurpation of
the generall liberty and immunities of <hi>Rome:</hi>
moreover in acknowledging <hi>Caesars</hi> favour,
for restoring him to his estate, and liberty: he
yet mentions his libertie in the first place, as
the most excellent benefit worthy to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before all other blessings whatsoever,
as the most excellent benefit, worthy to bee
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19894:18"/>
preferred before all other blessings whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as a Iewell of most incomparable value;
which caused another Poet to cry out, (as
being rapt with admiration thereof:) <hi>O bona
libertas, pretio, pretiosior omni:</hi> Deere Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
a gemm beyond all price.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After my beard grew white, &amp;c. VIRGIL</hi>
was but young, when hee wrote his Buco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes
about thirty yeares old; for hee was
borne in that yeare, when <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi>
were Consuls; from which time to the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate,</hi>
were twenty foure yeares: againe,
the Triumvirate lasted ten yeares. Therefore
this speech of <hi>Virgil</hi> is hyperbolicall and vsed
by him, with great affection; intimating
thereby that hee had lived so long without
true liberty, and preferment, in meane estate,
and povertie, that he seemed in his owne
mind to have growne old in living all this
while in this kinde of meane condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I fairely must confesse, &amp;c. At Mantua,</hi> I
could neither enjoy libertie nor wealth;
howsoever I did there giue as much testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of my wit, and learning, no lesse worthy
the acceptance, than I did at <hi>Rome:</hi> but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
had there no respect, nor learning any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation
amongst those <hi>Mantuan</hi> Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads;
who as their minds were not capable of

arts, and true knowledge, so likewise they did

were the Emperesse of the world) in respect
of the favour and esteeme, which <hi>Virgill</hi> was
in, as being sad, and all the whole Citty out
of quiet, if he did but stirr a little from thence;
so gracious was he to all sorts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And all the gods invoke, &amp;c.</hi> I did wonder
much, why <hi>Rome</hi> should invoke and intreate
all the gods (that is, <hi>Caesar,</hi> and all the Nobles)
to shew thee savour, and to be good to thee,
and to suffer thy apples to hang safe on the
tree, vntouched of any: that is, to giue charge
that none should meddle with any of the
goods of <hi>Virgil.</hi>

               <hi>Fountaines and Shrubs, &amp;c.</hi> Thou hadst such

            <p>
               <hi>COrnelius Gallus</hi> was in his time an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Poet, and advanced by <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>

as also in his warrs: This mans favour and
neere acquaintance above all other, <hi>Virgil</hi> intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected, (as may appeare by the verses in his

and the especiall grace wherein he stood with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
who carryed him ever with him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he went) <hi>Virgil</hi> was still disappointed: An
other Rub in his way, may seeme to bee, the small
esteeme which <hi>Gallus</hi> at first did make of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
(which the Poet in some passages doth seeme to
intimate,) himselfe considered, as the great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

This <hi>Thestilis</hi> was the name of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
wench, who (according to the fashion of

History, Omnis medicina aut à contrario, aut

from contraries, or from things of like quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
whence it comes, that extreame heate is
abated, either by cold, which is his direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite,
or by another heate. According to
which Principle the Poet in the last Aeglogue
brings in the Lover, resolving to finde reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to his vehement heate of Love, either

better for mee, to have made choice of some

delighted my mind with his acquaintance,
vnto my owne hearts desire: there being in
this life nothing more sweete, than a paritie
in friendship.</p>

As also, amongst great persons often
friendship is dissolved, when amongst meane
folke it is charily maintained. For who would
willingly affect his acquaintance, which by
reason of his greatnesse he can never conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently

I doe not onely vnderstand, and am skilled
in the human arts, but I make verses like the
auncient Poets, and so neere imitate them,
that there is hardly any difference to bee
found betweene them: for amongst the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

For as a quiet still water, doth receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance

his complexion and face is ruddie, in resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

the Starres; his inferiour members are
rough, and shagged, resembling thereby the
Trees, Shrubbs, and wilde Beasts; hee hath
Goates feete, signifying thereby the solidity
and fast compacture of the earth; hee hath a
pipe of seaven joynts, intimating thereby the
Harmony of the heaven; in which there are
seaven severall sounds, seaven distinct ayres,

               <hi>To taxe men thus.</hi> The woord <hi>Vir,</hi> in the

and is referred to vertue, and strength of the
Minde, or Body. As <hi>Cicero</hi> in his 2 <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pickes.</hi>
That cause (saith hee) requires a <hi>Man,</hi>
that is, a person of wisdome, and vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and therfore <hi>Dametas</hi> termes himselfe by
the title of <hi>Man:</hi> as though that other were so
base, and vilde a Rakeshame, that hee did not
deserve to be reckoned amongst the number
of reasonable Creatures, in respect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19894:34"/>
artificially expressed the manner of seeing,
and looking at him in contempt, and with
disdaigne: namely with the corners of his
Eye, or askew, (as we say:) So as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports,
the Lyon cannot abide to bee looked on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Goates did at thee leere, &amp;c. Pliny</hi> saith)
that the Goat, (beeing a most salacious Beast,
if hee see any other Creature ingendring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
hee is so inrag'd with lust, at the very
sight, that hee runnes at them with all his
force; and from hence the Poet (expressing
heerein (under the nature of the Goate) <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
disposition) may seeme to allude to the
disdaign, which the learned sort held his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in; (that manner of looking askance,
beeing a posture, betokening contempt and
scorne.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In what Chappell, &amp;c.</hi> The Nymphes had
sundry Chappells in the fields, dedicated to
them; where they vsed to frequent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saw I not thee? &amp;c.</hi> Hee accuseth him of
filching from the Greeke and Latin, so pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably,
that other Poets did take him with the
manner, and obrayded, and made (as it were)
hue and cry after him for his theft.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whither runnes hee so fast, &amp;c.</hi> Hee well hath
expressed the rustick manner of speech in

purchased by my Ingeny, and Invention.
Neither would other Poets deny it mee, were
they not hindred by authority of Antiquitie;
which beares so much sway in the opinion of
the vulgar, that they attribute smally to new
writers, (though never so woorthy) estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

hath relation to the excellency of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

hee may not gage his Flock; out hee will

               <hi>If so Palemon, &amp;c. Remnius Palemon,</hi> was
a most excellent Grammarian, and Tutor to
<hi>Fabius Quintilianus:</hi> Such was his pride and
arrogance, that hee would vsually vaunt, that
Learning had her first beeing at his birth;
and at his death all learning would likewise
dye. Hee was woont likewise out of pride
and scorne, to tearme <hi>Marcus Varro,</hi> (that
great learned <hi>Roman) Porcum literatum,</hi> the
learned Hog. Hee was likewise woont to
brag, that it was prophetically (as it might
seeme) done by <hi>Virgil,</hi> to vse his name heere
in his <hi>Bucolickes;</hi> foreseeing that <hi>Palemon,</hi> in
poetry should prove so exquisite, that all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
and Rhetoricians shall honour and admire
him, as their Iudge, and umpire of their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

contentions. Hee further gloryed much
to recount how a sort of theeves did once
spare him, and dismist him untouched and
unrifled, when they once heard his name.
Hee was so luxurious, as hee bathed often in

to overthrow all his adversaries; and with

the <hi>Sybils, Ludovicus Vives</hi> hath spoken

as were privy, and conscious of heavenly

the time of this Prophecy was neere to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment,
because diverse of the <hi>Sybils</hi>

the very time, or the person: as <hi>Cicero</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth

a <hi>Sybils</hi> Prophecy of the last judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christ

All things are given by the Father unto the

               <hi>But yet deere Childe, &amp;c.</hi> Here is described
the course of Christs Church, that is, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
here on earth. For in the Gospell, the
Kingdome of God, amongst other meanings
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19894:43"/>
signfies the Church. In the infancy of
the Church, without ordinary meanes, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
but by the immediate worke of Gods
Spirit, there sprung up, Presents yeelding
most fragrant sweete smell, and acceptable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
unto the nostrills of God, (namely so

            <p>
               <hi>The Goates, &amp;c.</hi> Peradventure by Goates

in many places (as afterward it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
very fruitfull in good workes, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
moreover it may bee hereby meant,
that the Disciples and Teachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
did never goe forth, to teach and preach,
but they returned with great advantage, in
winning of soules unto their Master.</p>
            <p>

where, in all parts of the world, not to the

even to the gathering in of a large harvest, of
corne, wine, and honny. The Iewes shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

for gaine: from hence it grew, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19894:44"/>
men, (not trusting one another, and from
mutuall hatred and grudges,) did devise the
walling in of Townes, and Citties: From
hence greedy mindes bethought themselves
of ploughing and digging the Earth: All
which indeavours of men, and all these things
(howsoever in themselves they bee not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

hath overwhelmed all mankind.) And
here these things may seeme to bee spoken
by a kinde of revolubilitie of all things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the order, and influence of the
starres; and hath relation to the ould storie
of the Sea-voyage, which <hi>Pelias</hi> made to
<hi>Colchos</hi> for the goulden Fleece, which the
Ramme bore, that carried <hi>Phrixus</hi> through
the Sea. The Ship wherein <hi>Pelias</hi> made his
voyage, was called <hi>Argo,</hi> and bare his name,
(as here the Poet calls it:) and the Master of
the ship was named <hi>Typhis:</hi> In all which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
passages, the <hi>Sybil</hi> prophecies of the
troubles, (which should creepe up) by way

that mens mindes should tempt them

By walling in of Townes, shee intimates
warres: by Ploughing she foretells the feare

reade of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that hee did weave Tents;

Neither shall their affections bee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

shall bee in heaven, content with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, (how meane and homely soever,)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19894:45"/>
that may serve their present need: whereby
it shall come to passe, that there shall bee plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all things in every place, every ones
minde beeing so temperately inclined, as to
affect nothing out of curiosity, but onely for
use and necessity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The accordant Parcae, &amp;c.</hi> It may perhaps
seeme somewhat too curious, to say, that by
these <hi>Parcae,</hi> (equall in number to the three

beleeve) agreeing in power, and will of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steny)
the <hi>Sybil</hi> would understand the three
Persons in Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Run out at length, and let such Age bee made.</hi>
Either the Destenies said this, answrable to
what every man wished might bee; or else
they appointed it so to bee: For Christs

               <hi>Deere Childe of God, Ioves infinite increase,
&amp;c.</hi> Nothing can bee more plainly spoken
of Christ, then to say, hee is the begotten of
God, and the increase of his Father. For of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19894:46"/>
what mortall man or created creature can it
bee said that hee is the increase of <hi>Iove;</hi> who

            <p>
               <hi>Come see, the world, &amp;c.</hi> It is now high

The Grammarians make much adoo about

spoken somewhat hereof: But shortly, his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is, that (by God) here in this place must
be meant <hi>Genius,</hi> to whom a Table was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate:
from whence this Proverb did arise,
<hi>Genio indulgere;</hi> when a man was a dainty affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of curious meats, &amp; made it as it were his
whole exercise to eat, he was said to cocker or
flatter his <hi>Genius,</hi> that is his appetite. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Moreover,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19894:47"/>
by goddesse is meant <hi>Iuno,</hi> for
whom a Bed was prepared ready, on which
the Childe new borne was suckled. Hereby is
intimated, that it is a dangerous sign of death
when young Infants are sad, and not apt to
laugh, shewing thereby that the <hi>tutelares Dij,</hi>
(the Gods who have the charge of young
children) doe not favour them: (which so
fell out,) for this young Childe of <hi>Pollio's</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
soone after it was borne; God himselfe
(as it may seeme) not suffering him to live, to
whom the Poet of so great authority in those
times, did apply those precious prayses which
the Prophetesse, (this <hi>Sybil</hi>) had foretould of
the blessed Sonne of God. And <hi>Vives</hi> is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the minde, that <hi>Virgil</hi> did adde these
two last verses of his owne making, after the
Childes death: (a conceit full of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.)</p>

as unfitly and unproperly hee attributes to
<hi>Caius Iulius Caesar.</hi> The Poet here ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

of the true sense and meaning of the
Prophecie, not knowing how to make it fall

who hould, that under the name of <hi>Daphnis</hi>

Brother; but without ground of truth: for

Daphnis, &amp;c.</hi> And after, <hi>Now lovely

and hidden points of Philosophy; heere
needes no Allegory. Onely it teacheth that
such kinde of subject, (conteining learning

            <p>
               <hi>The story of Pyrrha, &amp;c. Servius</hi> heere
moves the question, why the Poet, (leaving
the learned and wise discourse of the worlds
originall, and such like things,) sodainly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to the narration of fables. To which hee
answers, that either it is, because heerein hee
houlds himselfe to the Epicurean manner,
(which sect doth evermore purposely farse
the most serious matters,) with some pretty
pleasant passage, or other; or for that hee did
apply himselfe to the nature and disposition
of youth, whose mynds are wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
and apt to bee made bend, and relent
with fables, which affoord matter of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
for Fables were first invented, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and refresh the hearts of men; Now the
fable heere of was this. <hi>Iupiter</hi> (hating the
Gyants of the Earth for their cruelty, and so
likewise (for their sakes) all their posterity,)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19894:63"/>
drowned all the whole earth, except <hi>Pyrrha</hi>
and <hi>Deucalion,</hi> who escaped the deluge, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the huge mountaine <hi>Athos.</hi> These two
(by <hi>Themis</hi> instruction) by casting stones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynd
them, did thereof repaire mankynd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Some report this fable, and the cause
of the deluge otherwise, and that <hi>Pyrrha</hi> was
daughter to <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> and <hi>Deucalion</hi> sonne
to <hi>Prometheus:</hi> &amp; that on <hi>Parnassus</hi> hill, they
increased mankynd againe. As also that the
meaning of this fiction is, that those few, who
escaped to the topp of this hill, (during the
deluge, hiding them amongst the bushes, and
rubbish of these rocky places,) and arising
from thence afterward, were said to bee made
of the stones, which (upon the forsaking
those strong places) they left behynd them.
Moreover there were two generall deluges,
whereof stories report, one in the reigne of
<hi>Ogiges,</hi> King of the <hi>Thebans;</hi> the other in
the time of <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> and <hi>Deucalion.</hi> And by
these deluges is morally signified the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and mutation of times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fowles of Caucasus.</hi> That is, the Eagle
which fed upon <hi>Prometheus</hi> his heart, upon
the Hill <hi>Cancasus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prometheus theft.</hi> The Poets feigne that
this man made men; (induced thereunto,)
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19894:64"/>
because hee was the first who devised the
making of Images: and they feigne that hee
went to heaven, and stole fire from thence to
inspire his men with life: at which <hi>Iupiter</hi>
beeing sore displeased, bound him to the
hill <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and there set an Eagle to tyre
and gnaw continually upon his heart.</p>
            <p>The meaning of all which, is this: <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi>
(according to the Etymology of the
name) was a very wise man: for <hi>Prometheus</hi>
is derived <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
Hee was the first; who taught the
<hi>Assyrians</hi> the art of Astrology. To which
knowledge hee attained by observing the
starrs on the high Mountain <hi>Caucasus;</hi> where
with great study, and continuall paines, hee
did carefully and diligently frequent. Now
this Mountain in <hi>Assyria</hi> is so high, that it is
said to reach almost unto the stars, so neere,
that upon it hee did observe, and descry the
greater stars, together with the rising and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them all, in their severall seasons and
times.</p>
            <p>And whereas an Eagle is said to eate his
heart, it hath relation to the curious scrutiny,
and deepe contemplation of his studious
mynd, ever busie, in beating his braines, for
the finding out of the motions of the stars,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19894:64"/>
and celestiall Bodies: (the same word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
signifying in Greeke, an Eagle, and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse.)
And because by wisdome, and
wondrous Prudence and understanding, hee
effected this by the help of <hi>Mercury,</hi> who is
the God of wisdome and reason among the
heathen: therefore hee is said to bee bound,
by <hi>Mercury,</hi> to the Rock <hi>Caucasus:</hi> alluding
to the custome of great students, who sit so
close and continually at their bookes, as if
they were even tyed to their seates: Hee
found out also the reason of the Lightning,
and taught it unto men: And thereupon
sprang that part of the fable, which saith, hee
stole fire from heaven. For by a secret art,
which hee taught them, posterity learned
how to draw fire from heaven; which proved
very usefull to man, whilst it was used to a
right end: But after once men abused it, it
turned to their destruction; as wee reade in
<hi>Livy,</hi> of <hi>Tullus Hostilius,</hi> who was consumed
with all his his whole family, by that kynd of
fire: and yet wee reade of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi>
that hee used it with very good successe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
it onely in the sacrifices of the gods.
And this gives occasion to that part of the
story, which saith, that the gods beeing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at the stealing of fire from heaven, sent
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19894:65"/>
downe diseases and Plagues upon the earth,

words following, (<hi>ah hapless Mayd,</hi>) seeme
to bee her owne; in which words shee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
her selfe, about the absence of the Bull,
taxing her owne furious lust; yet in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
person, (which beares more weight, and
seemes to bee more passionate,) the like
manner is that where <hi>Corydon</hi> bewailes his
misfortune in the second person, as more
forceable to expresse his passion. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19894:65"/>
shee pursues her speech in the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in these words, <hi>If this Bulls stragling

chance to come hither and attempt mee, I
pray let mee intreat you to shut up all passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

               </gap>g per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
hee will come, though not purposely,
yet casually, as hee followes some beautifull
Cow or other of the Heard, whom hee hath
undertaken; or seekes after some more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
pasture. Therefore restrain him within
the woods, that the fury of this filthy Love,
may at least by absence bee asswaged, and
not bee farther provoked, or inflamed by
behoulding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Servius</hi> upon this passage glosseth thus:
The Poet (saith hee) may seeme to excuse
her misdeede, as having committed this foule
fault, by inforcement rather of Fortune, and
desteny, then of her owne disposition: and
therefore, (out of his pitty, and tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration
of her,) hee cries out (<hi>Ah hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Mayd</hi>) comforting her herein, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
to the cause, that inforced her to this
action: For so it hapned, that <hi>Venus</hi> beeing
infinitely angry with <hi>Sol,</hi> for bewraying to
the world, her adulderies, with <hi>Anchises,</hi> or
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19894:66"/>
(as some say) with <hi>Mars,</hi> or rather with both:
in revenge possest his daughters mynds with
monstrous desires, to abuse their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with unhonest and unnaturall lusts:
To as did <hi>Cyrce, Medea,</hi> and this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siphae.</hi>
And in this sense hee calls her
unhappy; and that in this kind of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
madnesse; others were lesse unhappy, in
that they thought themselves to bee very
Beasts indeede; whereas shee, though shee
knew her selfe to bee still a woman, yet shee
doated so through extremity of lust and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as (against her reason, which she still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,)
to follow a Bull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What madnesse thee bewitcht, &amp;c.</hi> In these
words hee seemes rather to chide, then to
comfort her: perhaps giving it as a rule, that
the office of a true Comforter, is to mingle
(as hee sees cause) sharp reproofes, and as it
were, vineger with his oyle, (allbeeit to a
mynd that may seeme halfe overtaken with
sorrow.)</p>
            <p>But the Poets ground this fable of <hi>Pasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phae</hi>
upon a true story, as they most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doe in all the fictions which they have left
unto the world. For the truth is, shee was
wife to <hi>Minos,</hi> King of <hi>Crete;</hi> and as <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
saith, falling in love with <hi>Taurus,</hi> Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19894:66"/>
got her with Child of two Twyns, whereof
one was like <hi>Minos,</hi> and the other like <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
And this was the cause that gave first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the Poets to fable, that shee was in
love wich a Bull, and suffered the Bull to have
carnall copulation with her, within a wooden
Cow, made by <hi>Daedalus,</hi> and that shee was
thereupon delivered of a Monster, halfe a
man, and halfe a Bull, which (according to
the shape partaking of both natures,) they
named <hi>Minotaurus;</hi> intimating therein the
foule play which shee used therein with the
Kings Secretary, by allusion to both their
names joyned in one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Praetides, &amp;c.</hi> These were daughters
of King <hi>Praetus,</hi> and the faire <hi>Staenobaea;</hi> or as
<hi>Homer</hi> saith <hi>Antiope;</hi> who for preferring
themselves before <hi>Iune</hi> in beauty, (or as some
hould, beeing her Maydes of honour, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing
to take the gould from her ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and convert it to their owne use,)
were by the Goddess, (beeing heereat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
in censed,) distracted in their mynds;
so that (conceiving the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves to bee Cowes,)
they strayed up and downe, lowing amongst
Fields and Forrests, beeing fearefull to come
neere any mankinde, least they should bee
put to draw in the plough. Now the Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19894:67"/>
of this example with that which
went before is this: That howsoever these
distracted poore Ladies were so deprived of
their reason, as that they did verily beleeve
them to bee Cowes indeede, and in very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and their fancies beeing so destroyed,
as that their behaviour was now in every
thing answerable to that conceit which they
had of themselves, yet none of them in these
their bestiall imaginations, were so transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as to long and to lust after the unkindly
company of the savage Bulls, as <hi>Pasiphae</hi> did:
And therefore her lust was monstrous, and
so much the more monstrous, and foule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
shee still retained both her outward
shape of womankind, and knew her selfe to
bee still a humane creature, injoyed her right
senses, and was in her right mind, all the
time that shee was overtaken with this kind
of lust: so that her madnesse was beyond
expression, and skill of man to conclude, from
what ground it might proceede.</p>

            <p>As for the Reason why Poets are crowned

And the young Brydes, did use to
snatch at them, out of their hands that bare
them: The meaning of which ceremony,
was to shew, that beeing now to marry, shee
did take her husband for her guide and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
intimated by the light of the Torch:
and for her protection, and defence, against
all hazards and injuries, that after this might
happen to her life, or otherwise: all which
was signified by the horne.</p>

Ceremony of flinging Nutts about up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Marriage day was, that all the Boyes
might scramble, that so by their continuall

that might discontent her, or any
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19894:82"/>
businesse to disturbe her Marriage day.</p>
            <p>Some thinke the using of this Ceremony
is, for that this kinde of fruite is very potent
to stirr up lust.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Varro</hi> saith, that the reason of this custome
was, that so <hi>Iupiter</hi> might give a blessing to
the Marriage, and that the Bryde might
proove a Matronlike woman, like <hi>Iuno.</hi> For
Nuts are <hi>loves</hi> fruit, &amp; under his protection:
whence the Latin word <hi>Iuglandes, quasi Iovis
glandes.</hi> Others say, it was the order to fling
the Nuts about, that so by the noyse of the
Boyes scrambling for them, the Bryde might
not bee heard cry out in the lossing her

sometime it is taken for Incantation, (which

aliquid supra naturam moliri:</hi> either
meerely by a set forme of words, (which wee
call a charme,) or some other ceremonious
action, together with the words to assay to
bring something to passe above the common
course of nature: by power whereof they at-tempt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19894:84"/>
the effecting of some ill, or the helping some
ill allready done, or the preventing some ill
to bee done. And <hi>Iulius Firmicus: lib: 1. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes:</hi>
observes, that there are some Persons,
whose <hi>Horoscope</hi> is under the forepart of
<hi>Scorpio,</hi> who naturally prove Inchanters, or
good Witches, (as wee call them;) that with

Now the Poet heere alludes to the old
received opinion of the superstitious <hi>Romans,</hi>
who when they saw the Moon, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse,
thought that shee suffered great pain,
by reason of some mischievous Inchantment
that was upon her, and during the time of
her absence, in her wane, when they could
not see her, as at other times, that some strong
witchcraft had wrested her from her place in
the firmament down to the Earth: and that
by powerfull and skilfull Countercharmes,
shee was releeved, and brought forth of her
darkness, and painfull passion again: at which
ridiculous conceit <hi>Iuvenal</hi> in his sixth Satyre
scoffs notably (deriding their ringing of pots

certaine words digested into meeter, and set

into a deadly transe for the while: the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull
effect of this charme of Musick, may
bee seene daily amongst Nurses, who use to
lull their wayward Infants asleepe, with the
melody of their songs: And that which is
reported of <hi>Alexander Musitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Timotheus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
aboundantly the strength and power
thereof: who playing to the King (new set
to supper,) a Phrigian strayne, (which is a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
warlike melody,) it wrought so upon his
courage, that (forgetting his meate,) hee in
a rage called for his Armes, (as if hee had had
a sodaine alarum from the enemy,) which his
Musitian perceiving, changed his stroke into
the Lidyan or Ionique ayre, and presently his
mind was also changed, and hee sate him
down as still, and peaceably, as if hee had
been at his Councell Table. But (as an <hi>instar
omnium</hi> of all other proofes, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
vertue of Musick, let us imagine wee see
<hi>David</hi> with his melody, charming the evill
spirit that so tormented King <hi>Saul:</hi> and (if
wee beleeve <hi>Bodin,</hi>) hee will tell us, that no
house is haunted with spirits, where much
Musick is used; and hee tells us the Reason,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19894:86"/>
because it presents still to the Divells memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that blessed Place, where hee had once a
happy Interest, where there is Melody and
sweete Harmony beyond expression: so that
Musick ever since torments his sowle worse
then Hell it selfe: And if this fancy be true,
the Invention of ringing of Bells to cleere
the ayre of bad spirits, may seeme to have
some grownd of reason, and probability to
defend it; seeing the Harmony of Bells (I
know) shall have many to maintaine it, for
none of the meanest Musicks in the world.</p>

               <hi>The could Serpent, &amp;c.</hi> Hee is said to bee

            <p>Sometime <hi>Carmen</hi> is a charme, or formall
set of words in nature of a Conjuration; Such
was that which the Auncient <hi>Romans</hi> used
at the besieging of Citties: by which they
did call foorth the Tutelar Gods and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses

might seem to presume to make warr, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
violence also unto them.</p>
            <p>Sometime <hi>Carmen</hi> was by them used in

sorceress, and exquisitely skilfull in that

arrantest Light-skirts of her time: shee poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
her husband, King of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> and
usurped his Kingdome; but was soon spued
out by the people, for her cruelty, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the land: shee loved <hi>Glaucus,</hi> and
transformed <hi>Scilla</hi> (his sweete-heart) into a
Sea-monster, (to possess him wholly to her
selfe:) shee changed <hi>Vlisses</hi> companions into
swine: shee suffered <hi>Vlisses</hi> afterward to get
her with child, and for that curtesie restored
his people to their former shape: shee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Picus</hi> (King of the Latins) into a byrd of
his name, for that hee had praised his wife
<hi>Canens,</hi> before her, for worth and excellence:
By all which fictions the Poets have painted
her out for a noted woman, who may seem to
have been some rare and beautifull creature,
and used her beauty, and excellent skill in
Musick, as baites to intice men, who beeing
even bewitched with her delicacy, had no
power to forsake her, but spent their whole
time in Luxury, and effeminate wantonness
and pleasure with her; (a life suiting better
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19894:87"/>
indeed with swine, then with the divine soul
of a reasonable man:) shee was a prime one
amongst those <hi>Mulieres quinque literarum,</hi>
Women of five letters; who have made the
fifth an unfortunate number, in beeing ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished
with the names of many infamous
and notoriously noted Curtizans, such as
<hi>Medea, Flora, Elena, Lhais, Trine, Thais,</hi>
with <hi>Iulia,</hi> and <hi>Livia,</hi> (the daughter, and
Neece to <hi>Caesar,</hi>) whom hee termed his <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micas,</hi>
his two Impostumes, for the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their lives: beside <hi>Ioane,</hi> (a Queene

Or hee speakes this, because all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Gods, or heavenly matters, are
contained in the ternary number: As the

this direct number of three, yet in an odd
number; as the seven Chordes, seven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
seven dayes dedicate to the names of
the Gods; seven North starrs: and many
such like. The odd number is held to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
because it cannot well bee divided.
The even number is said to bee mortall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may bee divided: though <hi>Varro</hi>

of <hi>Caesar,</hi> under whose protection all

verses hee showes, that hee hath lost his skill
in singing, which hee once had: And by an
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19894:94"/>
Allegory doth demonstrate, that his mind is
opprest with misfortune. Now to shew some
reason for the loss of his voice, hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to an ould received opinion, that if a
wolf spy a man, before the man espy him, the
man presently loseth the use of his speech for
a time: which opinion the naturall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
doe confirm-Whereupon the Proverb,
(<hi>Lupus est in fabula,</hi>) doth arise; &amp; is properly
used, whensoever the party, of whom wee
talke, comes into our company, and doth by
his presence (as it were,) take away our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to speake that, which otherwise, (if hee
were away,) wee would confer of. Now as
there are unlucky to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gued people, so are there
also men of an unlucky Eye: who by looking
earnestly upon any living object, send an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
wound sodainly thereunto, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it to pine and wast away, (like a mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Deere,) ever eating, never thriving till
it consume to death. Such an Eye the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
in the third Eglogue complaines had
looked upon his Lambs: this kind of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
looking hee calls Fascination: <hi>Pliny</hi>
(out of <hi>Cicero,</hi>) reports, that there are some
women born with Eyes, having <hi>duplices pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillas,</hi>

beare about them this kind of Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchcraft,
(as I may terme it.) There are
two sorts of this fascination: the one proper
to men and women, and effected onely by
them: and this is doon <hi>noxio vultu, &amp; fictis
laudationibus,</hi> by a mischievous looke, and
faigned counterfeit praises and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

too curiously, and with too fixed an
Eye, full of envy, with lookes even bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an inward indignation, and malicious
griefe and repining of the heart at the good
which wee see. The other sort is that which
is doon meerely by the eye: such is that of
the Woolfe, spoken of heere by <hi>Virgil,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving
a man by his very sight, of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of speaking for the while.) Such allso is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
which they write of the Basilisk his sodain

and if wee can beleeve that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the bird Icteros, (so called of curing
the yellow Iaundies, onely by beeing loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

            <p>
               <hi>Arethusa,</hi> was a River rising in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi>
and running a long course within the veines
of the earth, (unseen) as farr as <hi>Cicily,</hi> (by
<hi>Virgil</hi> heere called <hi>Cicania:</hi>) where neere to
that part of the City of <hi>Siracusa,</hi> named <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigia,</hi>
it breakes forth into a goodly broad
water: The Poet heere alludeth to the course
that this River houlds quite underneath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Rivers, and by that meanes, never
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19894:99"/>
mingles with the salt and brackish water, by
the ebbing or flowing of the Sea, (which is
heere meant by <hi>Doris.</hi>) Of this River, and
of the cause of the course thereof under the
ground, the Poets have this fiction: <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusa</hi>
was a young dainty Virgin, Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and fellow huntress with <hi>Dyana:</hi> with
this Nymph (they say) the River <hi>Alpheus</hi> fell
in love; and thinking to have forced a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
from her, which hee could not gain by
faire meanes, <hi>Dyana,</hi> (pittying the danger,
and willing to save her,) turn'd her into a
cleere fountain of her owne name: then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethusa,</hi>
(to bee safe from farther violence of
her rude suiter,) stole away closely from him
under the grownd, (like a modest mayde,
shrinking down into the bed, and hiding her
head within the cloathes, at the sight of a
stranger,) and never appearing again, till shee
came at <hi>Siracusa:</hi> which when <hi>Alpheus</hi> knew,
&amp; with much ado finding which way she was
gone, hee follow'd day and night after, in
quest of his sweete heart; at last hee overtakes
and injoyes her.</p>
            <p>Such a River is that of <hi>Gadez</hi> in <hi>Spaine;</hi> of
which a King of <hi>Spaine</hi> once (in a merry dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
