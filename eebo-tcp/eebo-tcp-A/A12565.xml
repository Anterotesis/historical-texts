            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And I doe not doubt, but that the same God, that gaue water out of the flint, &amp; honye out of the hard Rock, can also out of this dry Theame drawe the water of life, far more sweete then the honye, or honye combe. Vpon this presumption of his good grace, &amp; your gracious patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, I proceede to the further vnfolding of this present text, touching the want of a <hi>Smith</hi> throughout all Israel, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof. <hi>Then there was no Smith to be found throughout all Israel,</hi> (theres the want:) <hi>For the Philistims said, least the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes make them swords &amp; speares:</hi> there is the reason; and the reason of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is in the premises of this Chapter, wherto if it please you to cast back your eyes, you shall see how <hi>Saul</hi> seeking by preposterous zeale to salue one fault with another, and by vnsanctified sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to please &amp; appease his angry God, more deepely displeased. <hi>In vitium ducit

(A perilous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis) euen at such a time as hee was cleane disarmed, his Armour taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and his Armourers (the <hi>Smiths)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued out of the land. <hi>Miserima pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio quae omnem tollit ad habitum regres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum.</hi> Which killes the yong ones with the damme, and with one cracke, as it were, takes away all present possession, and future possibilitie. <hi>Spem &amp; re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And such was at this time the state of Israel, for want of a <hi>Smith.</hi> Which is here am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfied, as you see, as by crcumstance of time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; place where, so also the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why.

And thus much in general of the summe &amp; substance of these words. Now if it please you more particulerly, let vs examine them as they lie in order, and first of the circumstance of time as it is heere offered. <hi>Then there was no Smith;</hi> for so as yet we reade it: &amp; though the originall may perhaps other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise bee translated, yet hath it hitherto gone for current, &amp; shall for me (being without the compasle of my commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, passe vncontroled. The rather at this time, for that the notation of the time designed in the first verse of this Chapter, hath wonderfully perplexed,

I will onelye touch some 3. or 4. of the likeliest and so leaue you to your choise. The words are these. <hi>Saul now had bin King <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

One saith, when he had beene King one yeare full, <hi>currente secundo</hi> the second incompleate for so wright Kinges, the first day for a yeare: Yet euen in the stile of Kinges, it cannot be justified, that he that is now in the second yeare of his raigne, hath raigned two yeares. The second yeare
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2576:9"/>
begins as soone as the first is ended, but two yeeres are not to be reckoned, til the third yeere begin. 2. Another, seeing this shift will not serue, reads it thus. When <hi>Saul</hi> had been one yeare King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and then with a parenthesis, (for he raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all two yeres,) that is lawfully (as it were with a tricke of aequiuocation) before he was reiected of God, (as <hi>Chap,</hi> 16.) &amp; yet we know that after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he held the kingdom many yeres, beeing depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by <hi>Samuel</hi> not of the present posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in himselfe, but of future succession in his of-spring. The third would haue it thus, that he had been King <hi>de iure</hi> 2. yeares, but <hi>defacto</hi> one yeare, for so long onely had hee taken the state of a King vpon him: a wonder hee should bee so slowe, where others are so swift before they come at it. But this crosseth the plaine text of the 10. and 11. <hi>Chapters,</hi> and is againe crossed of the fourth opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For that cleane contrarie, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that though he had now been king
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2576:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>defacto</hi> 2. yeeres, yet <hi>deiure</hi> indeed hee had been but one yeere of that account, so soone hee began to degenerat from the nature and office of a King. So that it should seeme soone gotten: soone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, lightly come by, lightly set by. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for his Fathers asses, he stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled on a kingdom before he knew what it meant, &amp; we know the common saying, <hi>Asperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us nihil est humili cum surgir in altum.</hi> A verse in Church and Common-wealth found commonly too true. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God graunt vs alwaies Kinges of this kingly race to sit vpon this Throne of great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> To play the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, it is a thing not easily learn'd by nurture, except it be originally im-bred by nature. But for this point, it should seeme, as <hi>Seneca</hi> sayd of one that was counted an old man of many yeres. <hi>Non ille tam diu vixit, sed ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diu fuit,</hi> as one that had out-liued himself: so they thought of <hi>Saul,</hi> though he had now had a being in the kingdom for the space of two yeres,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2576:10"/>
yet had he liued as King but one yeare. To be a King (say they) is not to eate &amp; drink, disport, &amp; play: But to manage the affairs of the estate with care &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; with an euer waking eye to sway the Scepter. <hi>Sceptru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>oculatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> This should be his meat &amp; drink, his sport and play.</p>
            <p>To whome we answere, though these greater works of the law must specially be obserued, yet may not those lesser vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be neglected. <hi>Na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er haec quoq fieri o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet.</hi> These also are lawful, &amp; necessary recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, though no ordinary or vsuall occupations.

            <p>Surely this was neuer the meaning of our mercifull God and therefore in this poynt I must needs condemne <hi>Lact anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> as a man more stoicall, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Stoiks themselues, for they said all things were made for man, and man for god, and therefore might by gods leaue by man be vsed for his good, and gods glorie.

The first that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cald him father, by birth right of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour, but in the market, of equall price, &amp; therefore not to be sold without some losse.

might not so soone be forgotten, the sixt like to proue a souldier, the seauenth a scholler, &amp; one of these (howsoeuer the world went) were like to be a staffe and stay of their old age. And so of all the rest (if he had neuer so many) he had none to spare.</p>
            <p>Thus or to this effect, Saint <hi>Basil.</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> hath the very like storye of a poore debtor, driuen by the hardnes of his creditors, either to part with one of his Children, as a Bond-slaue, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hower, or to yeald himself to bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds &amp; prison. When he had considered the time expired, hee rather chose to goe himselfe then send any of his Children.

            <p>If this bee fabulous, it hath his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and without all fables, it is most true, that if neither the world were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor the Church reformed, nor the Gods maintained by the <hi>Smith,</hi> yet could none of all these, long haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without the <hi>Smith.</hi> His Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie shewes his necessitie. <hi>Antiquiora sunt necessitatis inuenta quam volupta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> Now we know that as the Logician amongst the Philosophers is counted &amp;

            <p>Howbeit, this hand hath had not the prayse for inuenting it selfe, (if I may so say) and many other Arts and Sciences, out of it selfe. The cunning and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounding musition (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinks, and diuers others) came out of the same Forge. And he that now so shines in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery corner, the Gold-smith, or rather the gilding-smith (for al's not gold that glisters) hee is but the yonger brother, howsoeuer he hath now gotten the start and out-stript his elder.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Certaine it is, that golden age of the Primitiue world, had more golde and lesse gilding. As Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> said of the Church when it had wodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, it had golden Priests. So sure I am, when in the worlde there were fewer Gold-smiths, there was more golden dealing. Then was the Temple full of gold, and all therein of pure gold, which now by a strange kinde of Alchymie is turned to lead, and lead to straw. But it may be <hi>Coruptio vnius est generatio alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> though the Church goe downe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed, and Church-robbers thriue, they are warmed with her fleeces and glister with her gold, And that makes so many golden patrons, leaden Churches, and wodden Priests in so many parts of this Land. And can they meruaile when as there are so many that serue at the Altar, and starue at the Altar? that feede the flock, and are fleeced of the Wolfe:

For when thy Sonne my sweete Sauiour suffered, the Sunne was darkned, the earth trembled, the vaile rent, the graues opened, and the stones claue a sunder; onelye man, the fleshly heart of man, more hard then the stones, shewed neither sense nor simpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. <hi>Solus homo non co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>patitur pro quo so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Christus patitur.</hi> In the first of <hi>Kings</hi> &amp; 13.

            <p>For proofe, I cite no other Text then the threescore &amp; fourteenth Canon of this present Conuocation. In the ende thereof, it is permitted to poore benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced men and Curats, not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide themselues long gownes, to goe in short gowns of the fashion aforesaid, the meaning is plaine, priests-cloaks. I finde no fault with the Canon (it is of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that we cut both coat and cloake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our cloth.) But I note the miscrie of the times wherein we liue. They haue vsed vs as the King of <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> vsed <hi>Dauids</hi> Embassadors 2. <hi>Samuel.</hi> 10. they haue cut our garments off by the hammes, &amp; now that we wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matter; we must distinguish our selues by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our garment, &amp; that which comes short of a long cloak, must be helped on with the name of a short gowne. This hath precising proceeded to circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cising And wheras the Popish priests had th,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2576:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
super fluity of their haire shaued, we haue the substance taken from our beards; we are the right shauclings: wo worth such shauers Let them chuse whether they will, the blessing of <hi>Midas,</hi> or the curse of <hi>Geh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zi</hi> vpon them &amp; theirs. But bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be our gracious <hi>Dauid</hi> and his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that had pittie on our nakednesse, and prouided at length a counterpoise to their mort-maines.</p>
            <p>So are the times altered; <hi>Moses</hi> was faine to cry hoe, &amp; the Kings of former times by statutes of Mortmaine, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide they should giue no more to the Church. And was it not now high time to prouide on the contrary that they should take no more fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church? As that act of Parliament would be written in Letters of gold, to his eternail glory, that of himselfe hath done it. So should the rubrick of that canon be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with blood (the blood of the Church) to serue as a testimonie to God &amp; the world as long as it shal indure, against those sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2576:24"/>
blood-suckers that cut off their impropriations &amp; simoniacal improue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, haue not left so much as to couer our nakednesse, and their shame.</p>
            <p>But I know their answer, some haue too much, &amp; thats the cause that others haue too little. If they may bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vmpeir the matter, they will finde enough for all, by taking from some and adding to others. Thus their fathers haue plaid the theeues, and now come they to compound the matter. Foure men pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing ouer <hi>New-market heath</hi> were set vpon, 2. escaped with 2. hundred pounds apeece in their purse, the other 2. are robbed of all they haue: but see the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie of those robbers; they wish them to goe after their fellowes and take of them an hundred pound a peece, and then al shall be equall. But with what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie? or who made them iudges of this equalitie? You read the Story in <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> how <hi>Cirus</hi> the yong prince was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. His master tooke two coates from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2576:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two men, the greater coate belonged to the lesser man, the lesser to the greater, and willing him to dispose them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to right: <hi>Cyrus</hi> gaue the greater coate to the greater and the lesser to the other. Now though this were a point in the Prince of beseeming equitie, to fit euery one according to his stature, yet was he reproued by his master, who told him in a case of decencie it had not beene amisse, but in a case of iustice, hee must giue euery one his owne, be it little or much. That which we haue we hold as our owne, as we are able to iustifie by all good lawes both of God and man. And if they mistake so much of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish practises, &amp; stand so much indeed, as in shew they will seeme for the law of God, let them indeed renounce all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish impropriatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; allow vs as much and no more, for our part and portion, then wee can euict by Gods owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and appointment to be due vnto vs, and tha'ts the tenth at least.</p>

If they refuse this, (as hitherto they haue done) let them make what shewe and semblance they will of Religion or conscience, in restoring the depriued to their possessions, I shall hardly beleeue them, but that they haue some other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect then outwardly they pretend. It may be, they thinke those yong Cubber wil houle as the old Wolues do: down with the Church, away with Byshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, what vse of Chathedral Churches, so many Prebends, so many Chaunters; but I hope if their Presbyteries were vp, they would desire their yong masters to make restitution. Between the designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lay-puritane &amp; Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puritane there was euer great ods, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they seeme to looke one way, their ayming is not all at one ende. But sure I am, their meaning for the meanes is all alike, the ruine of the Church, the imbasing the ministery, decaying of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and exposing the Ministers to vtter contempt, as by others experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2576:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is too well knowne. And thus much of this.</p>
            <p>The third point follows, the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this want, euen throughout all <hi>Israel. Then there was not a Smith to be found throughout all Israel.</hi> So powre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full were the precepts of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> they commanded and it tooke place, they spake the word and it was done, euen throughout the Land. A good resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though in a bad matter, &amp; fit for gouernours to vse, faire wordes (as he said) and straight Lawes, aduisedly published, and throughly executed; thats the life of the Law, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is but a dead Letter, &amp; a leaden dagger in a painted sheath. Had the <hi>Persians</hi> been as aduised for inuention, as they were peremptorie for executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Lawes; or were <hi>England</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute for executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it is absolute for constitution of all good orders and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces for church and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth; <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> might be endles in

their bounds, &amp; eternall in their fame.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ahab</hi> had long trauelled for <hi>Naboaths</hi> vine yard &amp; could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe it; what saith <hi>Iezabel,</hi> art thou a King? &amp; she said not much amisse for the generall, howsoeuer shee erred in that perticular. Surely where these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, wise Laws, peremptorie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders, and due xecutioners, there is the state like to stand, &amp; the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to flourish, euen from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Bersheba,</hi> as <hi>Corpus homaeomero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie colored coat, without seam or rent: al of one cut, one colour, one God, one King, one religion, one discipline, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of faith &amp; vniformitie of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, with out sect, Schisme, or Heresie.</p>
            <p>In this body of ours, it cannot bee denied but that there haue bin diuers diuisions, &amp; the diuisors haue bin spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially three: the Papist, the Atheist, &amp; the Puritane. The one impugning our doctrine, the other our Manners, the third our Discipline. The first,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2576:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
moste perilous or the State Publike: The second, no lesse pernitious for priuate corruptions: The last, most idlely cutious in pointes of least itmportance, concerning neither life nor learning; doctrine, nor manners; yet so obstinately vrged, as though they had sworne neuer to be satesfied, though neuer so often and fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, by the King himselfe: <hi>(Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum sine exemple)</hi> his Nobles, By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Iudges, Clergie: by writing, printing, conference, and all meanes possible, or likely to giue satisfaction. As no doubt they haue done to diuers howsoeuer the rest (like busie flies oft beaten off) still returne to light in the selfe. same place, seeking to sucke out matter where they finde none. And by importunity to extort what by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument they could neuer evict. Yet hath it beene greatlye meruailed by many of their complyces; that of these three the last, and least enemies, (as is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2576:27"/>
thought euen of many good men) to God and the state, should bee the first that should feele the edge of the lawes vnder this his Maiesties moste milde and easie gouernment: and so many Cannons set out and shot out against them and so few against others? To whome we answere, and that out of the Smithes Forge, it is not good to haue too many yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in fire at once. <hi>Ad duo quitendit non vnum, nec duo pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi> But if but one, why must this bee that one, that is hot enough, and hath more neede of water then fire?</p>
            <p>In the first of <hi>Liuies Decades,</hi> we reed of a Combat appointed to end, and vmpiet a great quarrell between two Nations, vndertaken by three <hi>Horatij</hi> against as many of the <hi>Curiatij.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in fortune of fight, it so fel out (as you know) that of the <hi>Horatij</hi> two were slaine, and then remained but one to three. Three to one he should be conquered. For as we say. <hi>Ne Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2576:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
quidem contra duos.</hi> Hee had neede bee stronger then <hi>Hercules</hi> that should thinke himselfe strong enough for two. And therefore the young Gentleman went to it, <hi>virtute non vi,</hi> rather by fine fraud then plaine force. If there can be any finenes in running away, and not rather <hi>Good lucke,</hi> as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> left written on his Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gette, when hee left the field, and betooke himselfe to his heeles. But so fled <hi>Horatius,</hi> as it shold seeme, that he had <hi>animu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>reuertendi.</hi> He fled for a va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage: for by this meanes, he drew his enemies the combatants to follow the flight. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he espied any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fellows, he suddenly turned &amp; dispatched him, and so singling out these three brethere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one after another, hee easilye conquered each of them, whereas against them, all at once, hee could neuer haue had any hope to preuaile.</p>
            <p>The bauen when the band is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2576:28"/>
sticke by stick is easilye knapt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder. You see the similitude, and the reddition is not obscure. Of our three <hi>Horatij</hi> two are gon not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Curiatij,</hi> (mauger all the might &amp; spight of hel it selfe, of <hi>Rome,</hi> it selfe) bul transported by God from this militant Church to that tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> The third remaines for whome no doubt remaines the victorye on earth, and tryumph in the heauens, which neuer shall haue end. But during the fight if hee seeme to flie, or giue a foote, let him take heed that followes fastest. In the second of <hi>Samuel</hi> and second Chapter, if <hi>Asahel</hi> had not beene so swift of foote, and so eager in pursuite to out-runne his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, he had not run so hastely on his owne death. And so surely, if these men more furious then <hi>Nimshi,</hi> more swift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Asahel</hi> to out-run themselues, their Soueraign &amp; his lawes, could haue bin intreated eyther finally to desist, or a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2576:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
least for a while to haue turned aside to the right hand, or the left, or to haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the heate of their zeale, &amp; edge if their pennes against papist or atheist; as they haue escaped with their liues, so mght they in all likelyhood haue kept their liuings.</p>
            <p>Of the which they are now some few of them most iustly depriued. I dare say with greater griefe to vs all, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther losse to themselues, or hazard to the Church. Howsoeuer it hath bin formerly giuen out, that if they were si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, the Church might soone shutte vp her Shop windowes. There would not bee a <hi>Smith</hi> left in all our Israel that could skill indeede of the right hammering, and handling of the word of God: yet I hope matters will be so handled, that if they all stand out, they shall not bee much missed. God wee knowe, is able of stones to rayse vp those that shall serue his turne, if men should fayle, or vppon euery tryfling
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2576:29"/>
discontentment, so wilfullye aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done that sacred vocation whereunto they are by so manye bondes so strictly obliged. And without any such mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous worke, (if it please him to afford but his wonted graces to the two Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities) I nothing doubt, but from time to time, they shall be able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie more sufficient Ministers, then all their complices will bee content to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe sufficient liuings.</p>
            <p>And now that they are thus dealt with by Law, we all expect that the like order, or rather much more sharpe and strict bee taken, as for the Atheist, so speciallye for the Papist. Else must we needes confesse, <hi>Reduuiam curaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Capiti cum mederi debuissemus.</hi> But I hope they shall, ere it bee long, haue iust occasion to thinke and speake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; when they shall see their Swordes and Speares, and Smithes, their Armour and Armorers, their Priestes and Iesuites and cunning se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2576:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with all their Syren-Songes, their Bookes, Pamphlets and Printers, and all meanes and ministers thereto tending, cleane cut off by the Sworde of Iustice, and the lawes of the land. A moste iust &amp; necessarie weapon-taken to keepe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurting themselues, and others, as children and mad-men.</p>
            <p>That it will be so, I make no doubt that it should be so, I seeke no other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then their owne practise against vs. &amp; <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne proofes in his third booke, <hi>de Laicis,</hi> &amp; 20 chapter for the abolishing of all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical books. For I wil not presse that which followes in the next chapter for the burning of Heretikes. Howbeit wel we know, &amp; they must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (if their case and cause were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual) better kill then be killed. If they will needs threaten, they may perhaps prouoke others to begin. I will inuert the olde saying, <hi>Pereant omnes potius quam pereat vnus;</hi> For is not hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2576:30"/>
worth many thousands, on whom so many thousands po depend?</p>
            <p>Surelye, it is high time to take the peace of them all, and binde them to their good abearing, when as so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and presumptuouslye they shall dare to threaten the disturbance of our peace, and destruction of the chiefe Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and preseruers thereof; whome the Lord in mercy long preserue. But for this point, if wee had no other Schoolemaisters, wee neede no other then these <hi>Philistims</hi> a people in their generation wise enough to set vs to Schoole.</p>
            <p>And so I passe to the fourth and last part, the reason why they remooued the Armourers, (and that was) least againe they should renewe their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. For so they sayde: <hi>Least the Hebrewes make them Swords &amp; speares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The dint of the Sworde, and push of the Pike; two sorts of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons very powrefull, especially in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2576:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those dayes, for offence or defence; <hi>Comminus</hi> or <hi>Eminus,</hi> farre, or neere. But this was (as it should seeme) in the worldes child-hood, the infant-age of hell, and hellish Smiths, but No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices as yet, and Prentises in their Trade: they had not as yet proceeded masters of their craft.</p>
            <p>Anon after, in <hi>Salomon</hi> his time we read of a generation, whose teethe were Swordes, and their iawes as Kniues. Whose off-spring, heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst vs (the cursed off-spring of the <hi>Anakims)</hi> haue bent their tongues like Booes, and shotte out their wordes like arrowes, sharpe, and swift, and full of poyson, euen as high as the heauen, and as farre as from one ende of the world to the other. Sure I am, at one flight from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> haue flown their firey thunder-bolts.</p>
            <p>These men not content with dagger, dagge, and poison for their priuie plots, (which God for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2576:31"/>
so ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath detected &amp; deiected) nor with swords, and speares, Gunnes and Cannons, for open Rebellion, (which God in mercie so many yeres hath stayed in this Land) but as hee speaketh of the Greekish Stratageme, <hi>Instar montis aequum;</hi> they had deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Cannon as big as an huge bigge house, full rammed and charged with a store-house of powder, to the which if all the fire of hell and Purgatorie could haue lent &amp; sent but one spark, we had all beene consumed. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it was not set on fire, with the sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous blast of their hellish breath. Then there was a deale of dead pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (so it pleased God) without fire; since, that a false fire (the Lorde bee thanked) without powder. If the one affrighted vs, &amp; the other amazed vs being both but a fallax, (God graunt they alwayes so deceiue, and wee be neuer worie deceiued) but if they had argued indeed a <hi>Diuisis ad Coniuncta,</hi>
