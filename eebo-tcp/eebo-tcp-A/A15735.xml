            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>it bee giuen him of my Father.</hi> This gift the Lord hath bestowed vpon your Honour, that they which are enemies to him, should be persecutors of you, euen to the death, if it lay in their power, for his quarrell. But the gratious prouidence of God hath manifestly shewed it selfe, in this whole action, on your Lordships behalfe, in that not only you are still preserued, in despight of them, but also that you hold on that noble, and Christian resolution, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the sasctie of Religion, his Maiesties person, and estate, with the hazard of your owne life, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more what your Lordship ought to doe, in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to God, and your Soueraigne, then what you may suffer by men, for so doing. Now on their part, who can say whether their malice, or their follie is the greater? when I consider the height of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, that reacheth euen to the taking away of life, which is in Gods hands; me thinkes I am not able to looke beyond it. But when I remember their despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate resoluing to commit such a murther, so openly, and their extreame indiscretion, in acquainting your Lordship with their intendment, it seemes to me, that the lightnes of their follie exceeds the waight of their malice. So that they giue all men iust occasion to suspect, that God hath giuen them ouer into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate sense, as to destroy their soules by intending such a bloody sinne, so to cast away their liues also by attempting it, with so great follie. But leauing them to the mercie and iustice of God, for repentance, or confusion; giue me leaue (Right Honourable) to put your Lordship in minde of that, which I make no doubt, but you know, and thinke on; <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb facs="tcp:21024:3"/>
the Lord God (hauing taken your person, estate, and honour into his protection, against these and such like conspiracies) looketh for continuance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of zeale, and care in your Lordship, for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, as much as may be in your power, of his holy religion, and his worthie Lieutenant, our gratious Soueraignes person, and dignitie. Now the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of danger being a good helpe to the auoyding of it, The Lord himselfe seemes to haue taken halfe the care alreadie, in discouering those, that haue bin, are, and will be the continuall practisers of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties ruine. I were more than conceited, and foolish, if I could but thinke my selfe either able or fit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise your Lordship in matters of this nature. Yet let me humbly entreate your Honour, to vouchsafe the reading of that, which, in my poore thoughts, I haue apprehended. That the safetie of Princes dependeth vpon the good pleasure of God, it is out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, especially in their account, who aduisedly, and thankfully remember the late wonderfull, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deliuerance, neuer to be forgotten. Neither can it be doubted, but it is Gods good pleasure to preserue them, as long as they haue care to walke in obedience to him; especially in prouiding for his glorie, by maintaining and aduancing the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Iesus Christ. So then, the safetie of religion is the securitie of the Prince; and the decay of Gods true seruice, the forerunner of the Kings destruction. As this is true (in generall) concerning all Kings, and Gouernours; so hath it an especiall euidence of truth, in his Maiesties particular. For it is apparant to euery man, that the Papists quarrell to his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
<pb facs="tcp:21024:4"/>
is not for hatred of his person, but of his religion. And therefore so farre foorth will they plot against the former, as they can see likelihood of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>chieuing the latter. His danger groweth by their hope; and their despaire of bringing in Popish idolatrie, must needs be the securitie of his life and state. Are wee then desirous to rid his Maiestie of this danger, and the whole state of this feare? we see the meanes of accomplishing that desire, to bee no other, than to prouide that true religion may grow and flourish, and Popish idolatrie fade and wither. For neither may wee looke for any blessing from God on the Common-wealth, if he be continually dishonoured amongst vs, by the encrease of Popish heresie; nor reasonably promise our selues any end of treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and bloodie enterprises, as long as Papists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hope of preuailing for Antichrist, by such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. If their number daily encrease, how should their hope lessen? And how is it possible to keepe it from growing, if thousands in this kingdome, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their ignorance, be left as pray to seducing Priests and Iesuits? The conclusion is, that if there be not some religious and wise care taken, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the people in the knowledge of Gods truth, which is the principall: so to ferrit out those lurking Serpents, that breathe Idolatrie and treason into the hearts of his Maiesties people, and to keepe out their like from entring into this Iland, the glorie of God, the safetie of the King, and the prosperitie of this kingdome, are all waining, in the last quarter. For howsoeuer it be very true, that <hi>some Popish errors hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not men from remaining good and faithfull subiects;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21024:4"/>
yet (as his Maiestie most wisely, and truly obserued) <hi>None of those, that trulie know and beleeue the whole grounds and conclusions of their Schoole doctrine, can euer prooue either good Christians, or faithfull subiects.</hi> For the former, I referre my selfe to most of the points handled in this Treatise ensuing: for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let the doctrine and practise of the Romish Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue it selfe giue sentence. How can he possibly be a faithfull subiect, that is to be commanded (in the highest bond of conscience) by forreine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Shall we rest vpon the Popes holinesse: as if he forsooth would not enioyne any thing, that should preiudice any Prince in his estate temporall? Let former examples passe; can any true, or iust dealing be hoped for at his hands, whose vassals daily teach subiects, that it is meritorious to murther Princes. Would not the Pope, if hee had misliked that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, haue checkt it long before this time, either in some generall Councill, or by some definitiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his owne; as your Lordship hath prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserued? And whereas their Arch-priest <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> condemnes all attempting of ought against Princes by any priuate authoritie, doth hee not (which is also your Lordships wise obseruation) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue thereby a tacite lawfulnes thereof, in case it be directed by publike warrant? <hi>So impossible is it for a Papist (that beleeues the Pope cannot erre, and holds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therefore bound in conscience to obey him, in all his commandements) to be a faithfull subiect to any Prince in the world whatsoeuer.</hi> But I haue been carried further in this matter, than I purposed; it remaines, that I humbly craue pardon of your Lordship, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had finished my poore labours in answering, and compared Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Perkins</hi> Treatise, the Papists accusation, and my defence toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I could see no better course for thy vnderstanding of al three, then to set downe all three, euery one in the Authers owne words. Now I came at the last to view them all three together, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the booke driueth me into some feare least that which I intended for thy good in reading of it, should proue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of thy forbearing to read it. Only my hope is, that knowledge of the truth being the end of thy reading, thou wilt not thinke much of a little more paines or cost, which necessity hath laid vpon them, who desire to benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by vnderstanding the difference betwixt the Gospell and Popery. That neither my tediousnesse nor darkenesse might offend or stay thee, I haue laboured for as much plainenes as I could well attaine to, with so much breuitie. The skoffing, reuiling, and slaundering of the Aduersarie, I haue chosen rather to referre to God the reuenger of all such Antichristian dealing, and to thy discreete and Christian consideration, then to answere in the like measure and kind of sinning. But if it please thee in reading of the booke to
<pb facs="tcp:21024:6"/>
compare the testimony he giueth of M. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Reader, with his carriage toward him in the whole course of his answering, thou shalt easily discerne, that either the one or the other, or both, must needs be without iudgement or conscience. For my course of answering I shall need to say nothing, because I spake sufficiently of it in my answere to the twelue Articles. In this present booke thou mayest know where M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> the Aduersarie, and my defence beginneth and endeth, as well by the difference of the print, as by the great or capitall letters set in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; <hi>W. P.</hi> for <hi>William Perkins, D. B. P.</hi> for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie vnknowen, hiding himselfe vnder those three let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>A. W.</hi> for <hi>Antony Wotton.</hi> And this course is obserued throughout the whole booke, saue a few places, where the marginall notes would afford no roome to those letters. I haue further added some short answers in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin here and there, which thou maiest perceiue by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and letter. It remaineth that I humbly and earnestlie intreat thee to examine what we haue written without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice and partiality, and to acknowledge the truth with liking, where it shall please God to make it euident vnto thee: which he will certainly doe according to his promise, if thou call vpon him in humility and faith, for the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his holy Spirit; To whose gratious direction I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee now and euer. </p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y a</hi> Reformed Catholike, <hi>I vnderstand any one that holds the same necessarie heades of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with the Roman Church: yet so, as he pares off and reiects all errours in doctrine whereby the said religion is corrupted. How this may be done, I haue
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21024:25"/>
begun to make some little declaration in this small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: the intent whereof is to shew how neere we may come to the present church of Rome in sundrie points of religion: and wherein we must for euer dissent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My purpose in penning this small discourse is threefold. The first is, to confute all such Politikes as hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that our religion, &amp; that of the Roman Church dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not in substance, and consequently that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled: yet my meaning is not here to condemne any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification that tends to perswade the Roman Church to our religion. The second is, that the Papists which thinke so basely of our religion, may be won to a better liking of it: when they shall see how neere we come vnto them in sundrie points. The third, that the common Protestant might in some part see &amp; conceiue the point of difference betweene vs and the Church of Rome: and know in what manner and how farre forth, we condemne the opinions of the said Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I craue pardon for the order which I vse, in handling the seuer all points. For I haue set them downe one by one, as they came to minde, not respecting the lawes of Method. If any Papist shall say that I haue not alleadged their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aright, I answere, that their bookes be at hand, and I can iustifie what I haue said.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus crauing thine acceptation for this my paines, and wishing vnto thee the increase of knowledge, and loue of pure and sound religion, I take my leaue and make an ende.</hi>

In the sixteenth verse of the same chapter, he foretels her destruction: and in the three first verses of this 18. chapter, he goeth on to propound the sayd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, yet more directly and plainely, withall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging arguments to prooue the same, in all the verses following. Now in this fourth verse is set downe a caueat seruing to forewarne all the people of God, that they may escape the iudgement shall befall the whore: and the wordes containe two parts: a commaundement, and a reason. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: <hi>Come out of her my people,</hi> that is, from Babylon. The reason taken from the euent, <hi>least ye be partakers, &amp;c.</hi> Touching the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, first I will search the right meaning of it, and then set down the vse thereof and doctrine flowing thence. In historie therefore are three Babylons mentioned: one is, Babylon of Assyria standing on the riuer Euphrates, where was the confusion of Languages, and where the Iewes were in captinitie: which Babylon is in Scripture reproched for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and other iniquities. The second Babilon is in Egypt, standing on the riuer Nilus, and is now called Cayr; of that mention is made, 1. Pet. 5. v. 13. (as some thinke) though indeede it is as likely and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought, that there is meant Babylon of Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria. The third Babylon is mystical, whereof Babylon of Assyria was a tipe and figure; and that is Rome, which is without question here to be vnderstood.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21024:27"/>
And the whore of Babylon, as by all circumstances may be gathered, is the state or regiment of a people that are the inhabitants of Rome, and appertaine thereto. This may be prooued by the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Ghost: for in the last verse of the 17. chapter, the woman, that is, the whore of Babylon, is said to be <hi>a citie which raigneth ouer the kings of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">B.</note> 
                  <hi>earth:</hi> now in the daies when S. Iohn penned this booke of Reuelation, there was no citie in the world that ruled ouer the kings of the earth but Rome; it then being the seate where the Emperour put in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xecution his Imperiall authoritie. Againe in the seuenth verse shee is said <hi>to sit on a beast hauing seuen</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">C.</note> 
                  <hi>heads and tenne hornes,</hi> which seuen heads bee <hi>seuen hils,</hi> vers. 9. whereon the woman sitteth, and also they bee <hi>seuen kings.</hi> Therefore by the whore of Babylon is meant a citie standing on seuen hills. Now it is wel known, not onely to learned men in the Church of God, but euen to the heathen themselues, that Rome alone is the citie built on seuen distinct hills, called <hi>Caelius, Auentinus, Exquilinus, Tarpeius</hi> or <hi>Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus, Viminalis, Palatinus, Quirinalis.</hi> Papists to helpe themselues, doe alleadge that old Rome stood on seuen hills, but now is remooued further to the plaine of <hi>Campus Martins.</hi> I answer, that howsoeuer the greatest part of the citie in regard of habitation bee not now on seuen hils, yet in regard of regiment and practise of religion it is: for euen to this day vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these hilles are seated certaine Churches and Monasteries and other like places where the Papall Authoritie is put in execution: and thus Rome being put for a state and regiment, euen at this day,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21024:27"/>
it stands vpon 7. hils. And though it be come to passe that the harlot in regard of her latter dayes eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her seate, yet in respect of her younger times in which she was bred and borne, she sate vpon the 7. hills. Others, because they feare the wounding of their own heads, labour to frame these words to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning, &amp; say, that by the whore, is meant the company of all wicked men in the world whersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the diuell being the head thereof. But this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is flat against the text: for she is opposed to the <note place="margin">Chap. 18. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The proposition is euident, because the state of Rome was neuer but either Heathenish, or Christian. The assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Master <hi>Perkins</hi> proues. But I must be faine to leaue his course, and to follow this reformers steps.</p>
               <p>The state of Rome must be taken, as it is the <note n="d" place="margin">See Fulke, Dovvnam, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, Povvel.</note> seate of Antichrist: but it was not the seate of Antichrist in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> daies; for Antichrist, <note n="e" place="margin">Bellarm. de Romano pon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>if. lib. 3. cap. 2</note> according to your doctrine, is not yet come. Againe, it was no mysterie, for heathenish Rome to be an Idolatrous and bloody persecutor of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. Thirdly, the state that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> calles the harlot, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues till the finall destruction spoken of by him, and S. <hi>Paul:</hi> but the estate of heathenish Rome was decayed long since. Your proofe is insufficient, for you alleage but two of many, that make Rome Babylon: who, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue commendation for discerning so much of the truth, so may they bee excused, if seeing Rome in their time a Christian famous Church, they did not take it to be the seate of Antichrist. But <hi>Hierome</hi> seemes rather to make against
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21024:30"/>
you, because euen then he calles it Babylon, in respect of Antichrist to come.</p>
               <p>Your second and third reasons are of no more force. For S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as I haue shewed, spake not of Rome as it was then, but as it was to be afterward, and now hath been almost one thousand yeeres euen in temporall authoritie, to which one of the Popes swords belongs. Master <hi>Perkins</hi> rightly applies to Rome the words, that fifteene hundred yeeres since were spoken of her, as she is now: the Popes Legates were nothing inferiour, either for authoritie, or exactions, to the Romane Proconsuls. But, as it was foretold in a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, vnder a colour of spirituall gouernment, ouerruling both in Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill matters: he that remembers the bloodie massacre of so many thousands, in a few daies, not many yeeres agoe in France, shall see that the Church of Rome shed blood enough, at that one time, to make her drunke as long as she shal continue: &amp; yet what a small part was it, of that, which from time to time she hath bezeled in?</p>
               <p>This section is nothing to purpose. For who denies, that there were as well Christians as Heathen in Rome, in the Emperours daies? The distinction, Master <hi>Perkins</hi> denies, is, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes of Rome, as it was vnder the Emperours, and not of it, as it hath been, and is vnder the Popes; which the authors, you alleage, meddle not with.</p>

It is true indeed: but wherefore was he an vsurper? He rendreth a reason thereof in the same place: because the Antipope called <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> was chosen by the kings of Almaine, France, England, Scotland, Spaine, Hierusalem, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the whole Clergie and people in these nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the other was not. And thus Bernard hath giuen his verdict, that not only this vsurper, but all the Popes, for this many yeeres, are the beast in the Apocalyps: because now they are onely chosen by the colledge of Cardinals. To this agreeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the second, ann. 1059. that the <note place="margin">C.

               <p>There is a grosse fault, also in the Canon of <hi>Pope Nicolas</hi> as he citeth it, <hi>that the Pope was to be created by the Cardinals, Bishops of Rome.</hi> As though there were some 30. or 40. Bishops at once: but of the matter of election else where.</p>

But to close vp this first combat, a sentence is set downe out of the famous Martyr <hi>Ireneus,</hi> that Antichrist should be <hi>Lateinos,</hi> a <hi>Roman.</hi> Here be as many faults, as words. That learned auncient Doctor discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Antichrist his proper name, out of these words of the Reuel, <hi>the number of the beast is 666.</hi> And obseruing the letters of the Greeke Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet, <note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note> (by which they doe number, as wee doe by ciphers) saith: that among others the word <hi>Lateinos,</hi> doth containe those letters, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount iust to the number of 666. and consequently that Antichrists pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name perhaps might be <hi>Lateinos,</hi> but more likely it is to be <hi>Teitan,</hi> as he saith there, &amp; lastly that it is most vncertaine what his name shall be. See the place (gentle reader) and learne to beware of such deceitefull merchants, as make no conscience, to corrupt the best Authours: and <note place="margin">Whose is the <hi>Index Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorios?</hi> He saith it is very likely.</note> being often warned of it, will neuer learne to amend. <hi>Jreneus</hi> leaueth it most doubtfull what shall be Antichrists name: And among diuers words esteemeth <hi>Lateinos,</hi> to be the vnlikeliest. And yet M. <hi>Perkins</hi> reporteth him to say resolutely that his name shall be <hi>Lateinos:</hi> and then to make vp the matter turneth <hi>Lateinos,</hi> a proper name with S. <hi>Ireneus;</hi> into Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, an appellatiue, which noteth onely his country. Fie vpon that cause, which cannot be vpholden and maintained, but by a number of such paltrie shirtes. Thus come we at length to the end of M. <hi>Perkins</hi> proofes, and reproofes in his prologue, where we finding litle fidelitie in his allegations of the Fathers, badde construction and foule ouersight in the text, of holy Scripture, briefely great malice, but slender force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church of Rome, we are to returne the words of his theame to all good Christians. <hi>Goe out of her my people.</hi> Forsake the enemies of the Romane Church.

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall actions are such as are common to men with beasts, as to eate, drinke, sleepe, heare, see, smell, taste, and to mooue from place to place: in all which we ioyne with the Papists, and hold that man hath free will, and euen since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> by a naturall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the minde doth freely performe any of these actions or the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III.

And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may referre the outward actions of ciuill vertues; as namely, Iustice, temperance, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, liberalitie. And in these also wee ioyne with the Church of Rome, and say (as experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth) that men haue a naturall freedome of will, to put them or not to put them in execution. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Rom. 2. 14. <hi>The Gentiles that haue not the lawe, doe the things of the law</hi> by nature, that is, by naturall strength: and hee saith of himselfe, that before his conuersion touching the righteousnesse of the law, <hi>he was vnblameable.</hi> Phil. 3. 6.

Those that concerne the kingdome of darknesse are sinnes properly: and in these we likewise ioyne with the Papists and teach, that in sinnes or euill actions, man hath freedome of will. Some paraduenture will say, that wee sinne necessarily, because hee that sinneth cannot but sinne: and that free will and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie cannot stand together. Indeed the necessitie of compulsion or coaction, and freewill cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: but there is another kinde of necessitie which may stand with freedome of will: for some things may be done necessarily and also freely. A man that is in close prison, must needs there abide, and cannot possibly get forth and walke where he will: yet can he mooue himselfe freely, and walke within the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: so likewise, though mans will be chained natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the bonds of sinne, and therefore cannot but sinne, and thereupon sinneth necessarily, yet doth it also sinne feely.</p>

                  <hi>V. Conclus.</hi> The second kind of spirituall actions or things, concerne the kingdome of God: as repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,   saith, the conuersion of a sinner, new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and such like: in which we likewise in part ioyne with the Church of Rome and say, that in the first conuersion of a sinner, mans free will concurs with Gods grace, as a fellow or co-worker in some fort. For in the conuersion of a sinner three things are required: the word, Gods spirit, and mans will: for mans will is not passiue in all and euery respect, but hath an action in the first conuersion and change of the soule. When any man is conuerted, this worke of God is not done by compulsion, but he is conuerted willi gly: and at the very time when he is conuerted, by Gods grace he wills his conuersion. To this end said <hi>Augustine, He which made thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21024:40"/>
no man can receiue grace vtterly against his will, considering will constrained is no will. But here we must remember, that howsoeuer in respect of time, the working of grace by Gods spirit, and the willing of it in men goe together: yet in regard of order, grace is first wrought, and mans will must first of all be acted and moued by grace, and then it also acteth, willeth and moueth it selfe. And this is the last point of consent betweene vs and the Romane Church touching Free will; neither may we proceede fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them.</p>

We say, that mans will worketh with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21024:41"/>
grace in the first conuersion, yet not of it selfe, but by grace. Or thus; They say will hath a naturall coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration: we denie it, and say it hath cooperation onely by grace, beeing in it selfe not actiue but pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>; willing well onely as it is mooued by grace, whereby it must first be acted and mooued, before it can act or will. And that wee may the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the difference, I will vse this comparison; The Church of Rome sets forth the estate of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the condition of a prisoner, and so doe wee: marke then the difference. It supposeth the said pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to lie bound hand and foote with chaines and fetters, and withall to bee sicke and weake, yet not wholy dead, but liuing in part: it supposeth also that beeing in this case, he stirreth not himselfe for any helpe, and yet hath ability and power to stirre. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon if the keeper come and take away his bolts and fetters, and hold him by the hand, and helpe him vp, hee can and will of himselfe stand and walke and goe out of prison: euen so (say they) is a sinner bound hand and foote with the chaine of his sinnes: and yet he is not dead but sick, like to the wounded man in the way betweene Iericho and Ierusalem. And therefore doth he not wil and affect that which is good: but if the holy Ghost come and doe but vntie his bands, and reach him his hand of grace, then can he stand of himselfe and will his owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or any thing else that is good. We in like manner graunt, that a prisoner fitly resembleth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, but yet such a prisoner must he be, as is not only sicke &amp; weake but euen starke dead: which cannot stirre though the keeper vntie his bolts and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21024:42"/>
chaines nor heare though he sound a trumpet in his eare: and if the said keeper would haue him to moue and stirre, he must giue him not onely his hand to helpe him, but euen soule and life also: and such a one is euery man by nature; not onely chained and fettered in his sinnes but starke dead therein: as one that lieth rotting in the graue, not hauing any abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or power to moue or stirre: and therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so much as desire or doe any thing that is truelie good of himselfe, but God must first come and put a new soule into him, euen the spirit of grace to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and reuiue him: and then being thus reuiued, the will beginneth to will good things at the very same time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God by his spirit first infuseth grace. And this is the true difference betweene vs and the Church of Rome in this point of free will.</p>

For if I <note place="margin"> As it is very like you vvill doe for your aduantage. Pag. 16. True: but not of the Popish Church.</note>  mistake him not, he agreeth fully in this matter of free will, with the Doctrine of the Catholike Church: For he putting downe the point of difference, saith that it standeth in the cause of the freedome of mans will, in spirituall matters: allowing then freedome of will with vs, in the state of grace, whereof he there treateth; for he seemeth to dissent from vs, only in the cause of that freedome. And as he differeth from <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Caluin,</hi> with other sectaries, in graunting this liberty of will: so in the very cause also he accordeth with Catholikes, as appeareth by his owne words. For (saith he) Papists say mans will concurreth with Gods grace by it selfe, and by it owne naturall power: we say that Mans vvill <note place="margin">He differs not from Luther and Caluin.</note> worketh with grace; yet not of it selfe, but by grace: either he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth not what Catholikes say, or else accuseth them wrongfully: For we say that Mans will then only concurreth with Gods grace, vvhen it is stirred and holpen first by Gods grace. So that Mans vvill by his ovvne naturall action, doth concurre in euery good worke, otherwise it were no action of Man: But we farther say, that this action proceedeth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of grace, whereby the will was made able to produce such actions: for of it selfe it was vtterly vnable to bring forth such spirituall fruit.

The difference stands in the cause of freedome: for it is impossible that a man should beleeue without freedom of will, beleeuing being an action of the will. But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether the will work with Gods grace, by it selfe, by it owne naturall power, or haue this operation from grace, being in it selfe not actiue, but passiue. And this is the very opinion of <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> and generally all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Diuines: who in this point thus dissent from you, that they ascribe the very act of the will, in repenting, beleeuing, &amp;c. to the especiall worke of Gods spirit in their hearts, that repent and beleeue: whereas you contrariwise, hauing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht man with freedome of will, by nature, or I know not what grace, make his assent (for I must speake of faith as you doe) to proceede, not from the spirit of God, inclining
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21024:43"/>
him certainly to beleeue, but from the good vse of his free will, yeelding of it selfe to the good motion of Gods spirit: yet so as that it might for all the motion and operation of Gods spirit forbeare to assent, if it were not led to it by the goodnes of free will. In a word, you ascribe no more to God, but the power that the will hath to will that which is good: wee acknowledge, that the very act of willing well, both before and after grace, is caused by the spirit of God, to, and in euery good desire that wee bring well to passe.</p>
               <p>It is more than Master <hi>Perkins</hi> affirmes, that the will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outwardly moued, and inwardly fortified with the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of grace, is able to effect, and doe any worke appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to saluation.

The first is taken from the nature and <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> measure of mans corruption, which may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into two parts. The first is the want of that originall righteousnes, which was in man by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the second is, a pronenes and inclination to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21024:44"/>
that which is euill, and to nothing that is truly good. This appeareth, <hi>The frame of mans heart</hi> (saith the <note place="margin">Gen. 8. 21.</note> Lord,) <hi>is euill euen from his childhood:</hi> that is, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the vnderstanding, will, affections, with all that the heart of man deuiseth, frameth, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth, is wholly euill. And Paul saith, <hi>The wisdome</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>of the flesh is</hi> enmity <hi>against God.</hi> Which words are very significant: for the word [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] translated <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> signifieth that the best thoughts, the best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, affections, and indeauours that be in any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, euen those that come most neare to true holines, are not only contrary to God, but enmitie it selfe. And hence I gather, that the very hart it selfe, that is the will and mind, from whence these desires and thoughts doe come, are also enmity vnto God. For such as the action is, such is the facultie whence it proceedeth: such as the fruit is, such is the tree: such as the braunches are, such are the rootes. By both these places it is euident, that in man there is not only a want, absence, or depriuation of originall righteousnes, but a pronenes also by nature vnto that which is euill: which pronenes includes in it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination not to some few, but to all and euerie sin: the very sinne against the holy Ghost not excepted. Hence therefore I reason thus.

                  <hi>Reason. II.</hi> 1. Cor. 2. 14. <hi>The naturall man</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <hi>not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto him, neither can know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</hi> In these words S. <hi>Paul</hi> sets downe these points. I. that a naturall man doth not so much as thinke of the things reuealed in the Gospell. II. that a man hearing, and in mind conceiuing them; cannot giue consent vnto them, and by naturall iudgement approue of them: but contrariwise thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to be foolishnesse. III. that no man can giue assent to the things of God, vnlesse he be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by the spirit of God. And hence I reason thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If a man by nature doth not know and perceiue the things of God, and when he shall kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w them, cannot by nature giue assent vnto them: then hath he no power to will them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the first is euidently true.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>For first the mind must approue and giue assent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the will can choose or will: and when the mind hath not power to conceiue or giue assent, there the will hath no power to will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason III.</hi> Thirdly the holy Ghost auoucheth, Eph. 2. 2. Coloss. 2. 13. that all men by nature are <hi>dead in sinnes &amp; trespasses:</hi> not as the Papists say, weak, sicke, or halfe dead. Hence I gather, that man wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth naturall power not to will simplie, but freelie and frankly to wil that which is truely good. A dead man in his graue cannot stirre the least finger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he wants the very power of life, sense, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: no more can he that is dead in sinne, will the least good: nay if he could either will or doe any
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21024:45"/>
good, he could not be dead in sinne. And as a dead man in the graue, cannot rise but by the power of God: no more can he that is dead in sinne rise, but by the power of Gods grace alone, without any power of his owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason IV.</hi> Fourthly in the conuersion and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a sinner, the scripture ascribeth all to God, and nothing to mans free will. Iohn 3. 3. <hi>Except a man be borne againe, he cannot see the kingdome of God.</hi> Ephes. 2. 10. <hi>We are his workemanship</hi> created <hi>in Christ Iesus to good works.</hi> And chap. 4. vers. 24. <hi>The new man is created to the image of God.</hi> Now to be borne again, is a worke of no lesse importance then our first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and therefore wholy to be ascribed to God as our creation is. Indeede <hi>Paul</hi> Phil. 2. 12. 13. biddeth the Philippians <hi>worke out their saluation with feare and trembling:</hi> not meaning to ascribe vnto them a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of doing good by themselues. And therefore in the next verse he addeth, <hi>It is God that worketh both the will and the deede:</hi> directly excluding all naturall free will in things spirituall: and yet withall he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that mans will hath a worke in doing that which is good, not by nature, but by grace. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when God giues man power to will good things, then he can will them: and when he giueth him a power to doe good, then he can doe good, and he doth it. For though there be not in mans conuersion a naturall cooperation of his will with Gods spirit, yet is there a supernaturall cooperation by grace, enabling man when he is to be conuerted, to will his conuersion: according to which S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1. Cor. 15. 10. <hi>I haue laboured in the faith,</hi> but least
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21024:45"/>
any man should imagine, that this was done by any naturall power: therefore he addeth, <hi>yet not I,</hi> that is, not by any thing in me, <hi>but Gods grace in mee,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling my will to doe the good I doe.</p>

                  <hi>Obiect. I.</hi> First they alleadge that man by nature   may doe that which is good, and therefore will that which is good: for none can doe that which hee neither willeth nor thinketh to doe, but first wee must will and then doe. Now (say they) men can doe good by nature, as giue almes, speake the trueth, doe iustice, and practise other duties of ciuill vertue: and therefore will that which is good. I <hi>answer,</hi> that a naturall man may doe good workes for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the outwarde worke: but not in regarde of the goodnesse of the manner: these are two diuers things. A man without supernaturall grace may giue almes, doe iustice, speake the truth, &amp;c. which bee good things considered in themselues as God hath commaunded them; but he cannot doe them well. To thinke good things and to doe good things are naturall workes: but to thinke good things in a good manner, and to doe them well, so as God may accept the action done, are workes of grace. And therefore the good thing done by a naturall man is a sinne, in respect of the doer: because it failes both for his right beginning, which is a pure heart, good conscience, and faith vnfained; as also for his end, which is the glory of God.</p>

In originall sinne are three things; I. the punishment, which is the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death. II. Guiltines, which is the binding vp of the creature vnto punishment. III. the fault or the offending of God, vnder which I comprehend our guiltines in Adams first offence, as also the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the heart: which is, a naturall inclination and pronenes to any thing that is euill, or against the law of God. For the first wee say, that after baptisme in the regenerate, the punishment of originall sin is taken away; <hi>There is no condemnation</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) <hi>to them that be in Christ Iesus.</hi> Rom. 8. 1. For the second, that is, guiltines, we further condescend and say; that is also taken away in them that are borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new: for considering there is no condemnation to them, there is nothing to bind them to punishment. Yet this caueat must be remembred, namely, that the guiltines is remoued from the person regenerate, not from the sinne in the person: but of this more afterward. Thirdly, the guilt in Adams first offence is pardoned. And touching the corruption of the heart, I auouch two things. I. That, that very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or strength whereby it raigneth in man, is taken away in the regenerate. II. That this corruption is abolished (as also the fault of euery actual sinne past) so farre forth as it is the fault and sinne of the man in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21024:53"/>
whom it is. Indeede it remaines till death, and it is sinne considered in it selfe, so long as it remaines, but it is not imputed vnto the person: and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is as though it were not; it being pardoned.</p>

               <p>First, your proposition is false: secondly, your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is either false, or not to the purpose. Your proposition hath two faults: the one, that in stead of saying, <hi>All that is sinne properly is done, &amp;c.</hi> You say, <hi>All that is sinne, is done pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly;</hi> applying <hi>properly</hi> to the committing of sinne, and not to the nature of it. The other fault is, that the matter of your proposition is vntrue. For there is some sinne, namely originall, which is not done by him, in whom it is, but is bred with him. If in your assumption you meane, that the Apostle doth not properly doe the euill which he hates, you are deceiued. For whether it be an inward action of the minde, or an outward of the bodie, it must needes be performed by some nature that hath a true being: but there is no third nature in man, besides the soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and what is done by either of these, is done by the man, of whom they are parts. If you say, it is done by a vicious qualitie in man, that qualitie hauing subsistence in man, as in the subiect of it, is not properly the doer of the action, but the facultie, by which a man is fitted for the doing of it. To your proofe I answere, that <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 7. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>doe I.</hi> And at last he concludes: <hi>I my selfe in my minde serue the law of God, but in my flesh the law of sinne.</hi> Where he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to expound, his doing, or not doing. <hi>I doe not the euill, which I hate,</hi> that is, in my minde, or in respect of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; I doe, that is, in regard of my corruption. <hi>In my minde, I my selfe serue the law of God; in my flesh, I my selfe serue the law of sinne.</hi> I doe both my selfe; but the one in my minde regenerate, the other in my flesh vnregenerate.</p>
               <p>If you will conclude (for that you leaue at large in this reason, it should seeme of purpose, because in the other two you set downe your conclusion expressely) Therefore it is not properly sinne, your conclusion is false: because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21024:57"/>
more than is in the antecedent. If your meaning be, either that originall corruption is not sinne, or that the euill which S. <hi>Paul</hi> hates, is not sinne (as one of these two you must needes meane) your conclusion is from the purpose. For the question is not, whether originall sinne be sinne, which both parts grant, but whether it be properly sinne, or no: neither doe you vndertake to prooue, that the euill which the Apostle did, with hatred of it, is not sinne. So that this first proofe of yours is neither for you, nor against vs.</p>

Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, or the facultie of desiring, is no otherwise affected to sinne, than reason is: but the blindnes of the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the vitiousnes of the will, which the Apostle cals concupiscence, are part of originall sinne. The naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are not the parts, but rather the seate of it, or the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, which in some respect may be said to be the matter. Sure the forme is (as of all sinnes in general) the aberration from, or the contrarines of it to the law of God. The depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation (you should say the absence) of originall iustice, is comprised in the aberration I spake of, and so is that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie auersion from God, and goodnes; besides which, there is also an euill qualitie (I know not how else to call it) whereby we incline to that which is against the law of God. This we call originall sinne, or naturall corruption, because we haue it from <hi>Adam,</hi> the originall of all mankinde, and that from our first being, together with our nature, and in our nature; though by creation it was not in our nature. This is helped by the power of Gods spirit, through the grace of sanctification, both in the principall point, and in the accessories; yet is not the concupiscence wholy taken away, but being deadly wounded, dies by little and little in the children of God, as they are assured it shall by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward baptisme, through the power of Christs death and resurrection. Notwithstanding as long as wee liue in this world, it remaines the same thing it was before baptisme, euen sinne properly; but the hurt it hath is vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerable, and the strength abated.</p>

               <p>The proposition he proues by two <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 6. 23. &amp; 5. 12.</note> places of Scripture: the assumption by shewing, that they haue no actuall sinne; and therefore, since death is not, but where sinne is, originall sinne is cause of bodily death to infants, that dye before they come to any vse of reason or affection. First you deny the assumption, <hi>viz.</hi> that originall sinne is the cause of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death to infants. But the reason of your deniall is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient. For it doth not follow, that originall sinne is not the cause of death to them, because the meanes of their death is distemperature, or externall violence. For then the death of many reprobate men, were no iudgement of God against sinne: and though God, of his absolute power, may take away any mans life, because he gaue it him: yet it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Maiestie to binde himselfe to a course in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that death should be the consequent of sinne. <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 2, 17.</note>

               <p>Then you come to the proofe of the proposition, where you graunt the <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> one place to be rightly alleaged, because death indeede had not found any place of entrie, had it not been for sinne. <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> The other text you say is fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But there it signifies both kinds of death. Here S. <hi>Paul</hi> chiefely puts them in minde of the greater, hauing shewed before, that bodily death came into the world by the meanes of sinne; and although the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle be occasioned to deliuer that speech, by reason of the Romans actuall transgressions; it doth not abate, but shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the edge of his exhortation, to expound the place of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21024:60"/>
all sinne whatsoeuer: for if there be no sinne, no not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but shall haue death for wages, certainely these actuall transgressions shall be punisht with it.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Perkins</hi> in <note n="p" place="margin">In our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</note> the place alleaged speakes of that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which is condemnation, as the very words follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing declare; in which he prooues, that the punishment is taken away, by that of the Apostle: <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, that are in Christ Iesus.</hi> It is true, that bodily death also is chaunged from being a punishment; yet the reason of that death is the dwelling of sinne in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which, by the dissoluing of the bodie through death, must be abolisht.

But the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall guilt, which is an aptnes in sinne, to make a man stand guiltie if he sinne, that is not remooued: and therefore still sinne remaineth sinne.

Now then comes the minister of the word, who standing in the roome of God, and in the stead of Christ himselfe, takes the indefinite promises of the Gospel, and laies them to the harts of euery particular man: and this in effect is as much as if Christ himselfe should say, <hi>Cornelius</hi> beleeue thou, and thou shalt be saued: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> beleeue thou, and thou shalt be saued.</p>

Now that some speciall good men, either by reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, or by long exercise of a vertuous life, haue a great cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their saluation, we willingly confesse: but that certainty doth rather belong to a well grounded hope then to an ordinary faith.</p>

                  <hi>Object.

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere againe, that wee pray for the pardon of our sinnes, not because wee haue no assurance thereof, but because our assurance is weake and smal: wee grow on from grace to grace in Christ, as children doe to mans estate by little and little. The heart of euery beleeuer is like a vessell with a narrow necke, which being cast into the sea, is not filled at the first; but by reason of the straight passage receiueth water droppe by droppe. God giueth vnto vs in Christ euen a sea of mercie, but the same on our parts is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and receiued onely by little and little, as faith groweth from age to age: and this is the cause why men hauing assurance pray for more.</p>

                  <hi>Reason I.</hi> The first reason may bee taken from the nature of faith, on this manner. True faith is both   an vnfallible assurance and a particular assurance of the remission of sinnes and of life euerlasting. And therefore by this faith, a man may bee certainely and particularly assured of the remission of sinnes,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21024:73"/>
and of life euerlasting. And therefore by this faith a man may bee certainly and particularly assured of the remission of sinnes, and life euerlasting. That this reason may bee of force, two things must bee prooued: first, that true faith is a certaine assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods mercie to that partie in whom it is. Secondly, that faith is a particular assurance thereof. For the first, that faith is a certaine assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Christ saith to <hi>Peter,</hi> Matthew 14. 31. <hi>O thou of little faith, wherefore diddest thou doubt?</hi> Where he makes an opposition betweene faith and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: whereby giuing vs directly to vnderstand, that, To be certaine, and to giue assurance, is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith. Rom. 4. 20. 22. Paul saith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he did <hi>not doubt of the promise of God through vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe: but was strengthened in faith, and gaue glorie to God, beeing fully assured, that hee which had promised was able to doe it:</hi> where I obserue first, that doubting is made a fruit of vnbeleefe: and therfore vnfallible certainty and assurance, being contrary to doubting, must needes proceede from true faith: considering that contrary effects come of contrary causes: and contrary causes produce contrarie effects. Secondly I note, that the strength of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith did stand <hi>in fulnes of assurance:</hi> for the text saith, hee was strengthened in the faith, beeing fully assured: and againe, Heb. 11. 1. true sauing faith is said to bee the ground and subsistence of things hoped for: and the euidence or demonstration of things that are not seene: but faith can be no ground or euidence of things, vnles it bee for nature certaintie it selfe: and thus the first point is manifest. The second, that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21024:73"/>
faith is a particular assurance, is proued by this, that the property of faith is to apprehend and applie the promise, and the thing promised, Christ with his benefits. Ioh. 1. 12. <hi>As many,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn, as receiued him, to them he gaue power to be the sonnes of God, namely to them that beleeue in his name.</hi> In these words to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Christ, and to receiue Christ, are put for one and the same thing. Now to receiue Christ, is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and applie him with all his benefits vnto our selues, as he is offered in the promises of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For in the sixt chapter following, first of all he sets forth himselfe not only as a Redeemer general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but also as the bread of life, and the water of life: secondly, he sets forth his best hearers, as eaters of his bodie, and drinkers of his blood: and thirdly, he intends to prooue this conclusion, that to eate his bodie, and to drinke his blood, and to beleeue in him, are all one. Now then if Christ be as foode, and if to eate and drinke the bodie and blood of Christ, be to beleeue in him, then must there be a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene eating and beleeuing. Looke then as there can be no eating without taking or receiuing of meate, so no beleeuing in Christ without a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall receiuing and apprehending of him. And as the bodie hath his hand, mouth, and stomacke whereby it taketh, receiueth, and digesteth meate for the nourishment of euery part: so likewise in the soule there is a faith, which is both hand, mouth and stomacke to apprehend, receiue, and applie Christ and all his merits for the nourishment of the soule. And <hi>Paul</hi> saith yet more plainely, <hi>That through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith we receiue the promise of the spirit,</hi> Gal. 3. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:21024:74"/>
Now as the propertie of apprehending and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of Christ belongeth to faith, so it agreeth not to hope, loue, confidence, or any other gift or grace of God. But first by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith wee must apprehend Christ, and applie him to our selues, before we can haue any hope or confidence in him. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying seemes not to be done by any affection of the will, but by a supernaturall act of the mind, which is to acknowledge, set downe and beleeue that remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, and life euerlasting by the merit of Christ, belong to vs particularly. To this which I haue saide agreeth Augustine, <hi>Why preparest thou</hi>

                     </gap>est holde on him.</hi> And Bernard saith, Homil. in Cant. 76. <hi>Where he is thou canst not come now: yet goe to follow him and seeke him; beleeue and thou hast found him: for</hi> to beleeue is to find. Chrysost. on Mark, homil. 10. <hi>Let vs beleeue, and we see Iesus present before vs.</hi> Ambr. on Luk. lib. 6. cap. 8. <hi>By faith Christ is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, by faith Christ is seene.</hi> Tertul. de resurrect. car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis: <hi>He must be chewed by vnderstanding, and be dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason II.</hi> Whatsoeuer the holy Ghost testifieth vnto vs, that we may, yea that we must certainely by <note place="margin">B.</note> faith beleeue: but the holy Ghost doth particularly testifie vnto vs our adoption, the remission of our sinnes, and the saluation of our soules; and therefore wee may and must particularly and certainely by faith beleeue the same. The first part of this reason is true, and cannot be denied of any. The second
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21024:74"/>
part is prooued thus: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Rom. 8. 15. <hi>We haue not receiued the spirit of bondage to feare: but the spirit of adoption, whereby we crie Abba, father:</hi> adding further, that <hi>the same spirit beareth witnesse with our spirits, that we are the children of God.</hi> Where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle maketh two witnesses of our adoption: the spirit of God, and our spirits, that is, the conscience sanctified by the holy Ghost. The Papists to elude this reason, alleadge that the spirit of God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede witnesse of our adoption, by some comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table feelings of Gods loue and fauour, being such as are weake and oftentimes deceitfull. But by their leaues, the testimonie of the spirit is more then a bare sense or feeling of Gods grace: for it is called the <hi>pledge</hi> and <hi>earnest</hi> of Gods spirit in our hearts, 2. Cor. 1. 21. and therefore it is fit to take away all occasion of doubting of our saluation: as in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the earnest is giuen betweene the parties, to put all out of question. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of the spirite is a most sure testimonie: Epist. 107.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason III.</hi> That which we must pray for by <note place="margin">C.</note> Gods commandement, that we must beleeue: but euery man is to pray for the pardon of his owne sinnes, and for life euerlasting: of this there is no question: therfore he is bound to beleeue the same. The proposition is most of all doubtfull: but it is proued thus. In euery petition there must be two things: a desire of the things we aske, and a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faith whereby we beleeue, that the thing we aske shall be giuen vnto vs. So Christ saith, <hi>Whatsoeuer ye desire when you pray, beleeue that you shall haue it, and it
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21024:75"/>
shall be giuen vnto you.</hi> And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> further noteth out this particular faith, calling it our <hi>assurance that God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Iob. 5. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>will giue vnto vs, whatsoeuer we aske according to his will.</hi> And hence it is, that in euery petition there must be two grounds: a commaundement to warrant vs in making a petition, and a promise to assure vs of the accomplishment thereof. And vpon both these, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes necessarily an application of the things we aske to our selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason IIII.</hi> Whatsoeuer God commandeth in <note place="margin">D.</note> the Gospell, that a man must and can performe: but God in the Gospell commandeth vs to beleeue the pardon of our owne sinnes, and life euerlasting: and therefore we must beleeue thus much, and may be assured thereof. This proposition is plaine by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the commandements of the law, and of the Gospell. The commandements of the law shew vs what we must doe, but minister no power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the thing to be done: but the doctrine and commaundements of the Gospell doe otherwise: and therefore they are called <hi>spirit and life:</hi> God with <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 36.</note> the commaundement giuing grace that the thing prescribed may be done. Now this is a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gospell, to beleeue remission of sinnes: for it was the substance of Christs ministery, <hi>repent and beleeue the Gospell.</hi> And that is not generally to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Christ is a Sauiour, and that the promises made in him are true (for so the diuels beleeue with trembling:) but it is particularly to beleeue that Christ is my Sauiour, and that the promises of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ belong in speciall to me, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith. <hi>This is his commaundement that we beleeue in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21024:75"/>
name of Iesus Christ:</hi> now to beleeue in Christ is to put confidence in him: which none can doe, vnlesse he be first assured of his loue and fauour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in as much, as we are enioyned to put our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Christ, we are also enioyned to beleeue our reconciliation with him, which stands in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of our sins, and our acceptation to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason V.</hi> Whereas the Papists teach, that a man <note place="margin">E.</note> may be assured of his saluation by hope: euen hence it followes, that he may be vnfalliblie assured therof. For the property of true and liuely hope <hi>is neuer to make a man ashamed.</hi> Rom. 5. 5. And true hope fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth faith and euer presupposeth certeintie of faith; neither can any man truly hope for his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnlesse by faith he be certeinly assured thereof in some measure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exception I.</hi> The Popish Doctors take exception to <note place="margin">F.</note> these reasons on this manner. First they say, it cannot be proued y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> a man is as certaine of saluation by faith, as he is of the articles of the creed. <hi>I answere,</hi> First they proue thus much that we ought to be as cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine of the one as of the other. For looke what commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we haue to beleeue the articles of our faith: the like we haue inio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ning vs to beleeue the pardon of our owne sins, as I haue proued. Secondly, these arguments proue it to be the nature or essential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of faith, as certeinly to assure man of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it doth assure him of the articles which he beleeueth. And howsoeuer commonly men do not beleeue their saluation as vnfallible, as they do their articles of faith: yet some speciall men doe: hauing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21024:76"/>
Gods word applied by the spirit as a sure ground of their faith, whereby they beleeue their owne saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they haue it for a ground of the articles of their faith. Thus certeinly was <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> assured of his owne saluation: as also the Prophets and Apostles, and the Martyrs of God in all ages: whereupon without doubting they haue bin content to lay downe their liues for the name of Christ: in whom they were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured to receiue eternall happines. And there is no question, but there be many now, that by long and often experience of Gods mercy, and by the inward certificate of the holy Ghost, haue attained to full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of their saluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Exception.</hi> Howsoeuer a man may be assured of his present estate, yet no man is certeine of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance <note place="margin">G.</note> vnto the end. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is otherwise: for in the sixt petition, <hi>lead vs not into temptation,</hi> we pray that God would not suffer vs to be wholy ouercome of the diuell in any temptation: and to this petition we haue a promise answerable, 1. Cor. 10. <hi>That God with temptation will giue an issue:</hi> and therefore how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the diuell may buffit, molest, and wound the seruants of God, yet shall he neuer be able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. Againe, hee that is once a member of Christ, can neuer be wholy cut off. And if any by sinne were wholy seuered from Christ for a time, in his recouery he is to be baptized the second time: for baptisme is the sacrament of initiation or ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into Christ. By this reason we should as often be baptized as we fall into any sinne, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd. Againe, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, 1. Iohn 2. 19. <hi>They went out from vs, but they were not of vs: for if they had been
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21024:76"/>
of vs, they would haue continued with vs.</hi> Where he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it for graunted, that such as be once in Christ shall neuer wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly bee seuered or fall from him. Though our communion with Christ may be lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet the vnion and the bond of coniunction can neuer be dissolued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Exception.</hi> They say, we are indeede to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <note place="margin">H.</note> our saluation on Gods part: but wee must needes doubt in regard of our selues: because the promises of remission of sinnes are giuen vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of mans faith and repentance. Now we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (say they) be assured that we haue true faith and repentance, because we may lie in secret sinnes; and so want that indeed, which we suppose our selues to haue. <hi>Answ.</hi> I say againe, he that doth truly repent and beleeue, doth by Gods grace know that he doth repent and beleeue: for else <hi>Paul</hi> would neuer haue said, <hi>Prooue your selues whether you be in the faith or not:</hi> and the same Apostle saith, 2. Cor. 12. <hi>We haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things which are giuen of God:</hi> which things are not onely life euerlasting, but iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, sanctification, and such like. And as for secret sinnes they cannot make our repentance void: for he that truly repenteth of his knowne sinnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth also of such as be vnknowne, and receiueth the pardon of them all. God requireth not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse or speciall repentance of vnknowne sinnes: but accepts it as sufficient, if we repent of them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally: as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To conclude, the Papists haue no great cause to dissent from vs in this poynt. For they teach and professe, that they doe by a speciall faith beleeue their owne saluation certainely and vnfallibly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God, that promiseth. Now the thing which hindreth them is their owne indisposition and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21024:77"/>
(as they say) which keepes them from being certaine otherwise then in a likely hope. But this hinderance is easily remoued, if men will iudge indifferently. For first of all, in regard of our selues and our disposition we cannot be certaine at all, but must despaire of saluation euen to the very death. We cannot bee sufficiently disposed so long as wee liue in this world, but must alwaies say with <hi>Iacob, I am lesse then all thy mercies,</hi> Gen. 32. and with <hi>Dauid, Enter not into iudgement with thy seruant, O Lord, for none liuing shall bee iustified in thy sight:</hi> and with the Centurion, <hi>Lord I am not worthie, that thou shouldest come vnder my roofe,</hi> Matth. 8. Secondly God in making promise of saluation respects not mens wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines. For he chose vs to life euerlasting when we were not: hee redeemed vs from death being ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and intitles vs to the promise of saluation, <hi>if we acknowledge our selues to be sinners,</hi> Matth. 9. <hi>If wee labour and trauaile vnder the burden of them.</hi> Matth. 11. <hi>If we hunger and thirst after grace.</hi> Ioh. 7. 37. And these things we may certenly and sensibly perceiue in our selues: and when we finde them in vs, though our vnworthinesse be exceeding great, it should not hinder our assurance. For God makes manifest his power in our weakenesse, 2. Cor. 12. and he will not breake the bruised reede, nor quench the smoking flaxe. Isai, 42. Thirdly, if a man loue God for his mercies sake, and haue a true hope of saluation by Christ, he is in Christ, and hath fellowship with him: and he that is in Christ, hath all his vnworthines and wants laid on Christ, and they are couered and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in his death: and in respect of our selues thus
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21024:78"/>
considered, <hi>as we are in Christ;</hi> wee haue no cause to wauer, but to be certaine of our saluation, and that in regard of our selues.</p>

In which respect the holy Ghost exhorts to it, by reason our faith is not perfect. Secondly, for your assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I say, the faithfull are not simply willed to be afraid that they shall not be saued, but onely are appointed to vse the meanes of securing of themselues by warines: because else it will come to passe, that they shall fall away in their owne sense and feeling. Your example prooues nothing, the measure of faith being so diuers: and further, hee may truly beleeue in God, that in some temptation falles into doubting, for a time, whether there be a God or no: as you must needes know, if you haue any experience of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which sometimes befall the deare children of God.</p>

P.</label> That we may see how farre we are to agree with   them, and where to differ: first I will set downe the doctrine on both parts: and secondly the maine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences wherein we are to stand against them euen to death.</p>
            <p>Our doctrine touching the iustification of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I propound in foure rules.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule I.</hi> That, iustification is an action of God, whereby he absolueth a sinner and accepteth him to life euerlasting for the righteousnesse and merit of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule II.</hi> That iustification stands in two things; first in the remission of sinnes by the merit of Christ his death; secondly in the imputation of Christ his righteousnesse; which is another action of God
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21024:87"/>
whereby he accounteth and esteemeth that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse which is in Christ, as the righteousnesse of that sinner which beleeueth in him. By Christ his righteousnesse we are to vnderstand two things: first his sufferings specially in his death and passion, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly his obedience in fulfilling the law: both which goe together: for Christ in suffering obeyed, and obeying suffered. And the very shedding of his blood to which our saluation is ascribed, must not onely bee considered, as it is passiue, that is, a suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but also as it is actiue, that is, an obedience, in which hee shewed his exceeding loue both to his father and vs, and thus fulfilled the law for vs. This point if some had well thought on, they would not haue placed all iustification in remission of sins as they doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule III.</hi> That, iustification is from Gods meere mercie and grace, procured onely by the merit of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule IV.</hi> That, man is iustified by faith alone: because faith is that <hi>alone</hi> instrument created in the heart by the holy Ghost, whereby a sinner l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieth hold of Christ his righteousnesse, and applieth the same vnto himselfe. There is neither hope, nor loue, nor any other grace of God within man, that can do this but faith alone.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the Romane Church touching the iustification of a sinner is on this manner.</p>
            <p n="1">I. They holde that before iustification there goes a preparation thereunto: which is an action wrought partly by the holy Ghost, and partly by the power of naturall free will, whereby a man
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21024:87"/>
disposeth himselfe to his owne future iustification.</p>
            <p>In the preparation they consider the ground of iustification, and things proceeding from it. The ground is saith, which they define to bee a generall knowledge, whereby wee vnderstand and beleeue that the doctrine of the word of God is true. Things proceeding from this faith, are these; a sight of our sinnes, a feare of hell, hope of saluation, loue of God, repentance and such like: all which when men haue attained, they are then fully disposed (as they say) to their iustification.</p>
            <p>This preparation being made, then comes iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation itselfe: which is an action of God, whereby he maketh a man righteous. It hath two parts: the first, and the second. The first is, when a sinner of an euill man is made a good man. And to effect this, two things are required: first the pardon of sinne, which is one part of the first iustification: secondlie, the infusion of inward righteousnesse whereby the heart is purged and sanctified: and this habit of righteoutnes stands specially in hope and charitie.</p>
            <p>After the first iustification, followeth the second; which is, when a man of a good or iust man is made better and more iust: and this say they, may proceed from works of grace; because he which is righteous by the first iustification, can bring forth good works: by the merit whereof, hee is able to make himselfe more iust and righteous: and yet they graunt that the first iustification commeth only of Gods mercie by the merit of Christ.</p>

And vvhen knowledging themselues to be sinners, through the feare of Gods iudgments, they turne themselues to consider the mercy of God, are lifted vp into hope, trusting that God vvill be mercifull vnto them for Christs sake: and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to loue him as the fountaine of all iustice, are thereby moued vvith ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and detestation of all sinnes. Finally they determine to receiue baptisme, to begin a nevv life, and to keepe all Christs commaundements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this disposition, or preparation, followeth Iustification, and for that euery thing is best knowne by the causes of it, all the causes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification are deliuered by the Councell in the next Chapter, vvhich briefly are these. <hi>The finall cause of the iustification of a sinner, is the glory of God, the glory of Christ, and maas ovvne iustification: the efficient is God, the meritorious, Christ Jesus Passions, the instrumentall, is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptisme, the only formall cause, is inherent iustice, that is, Faith, Hope, and Charitie, vvith the other gifts of the Holy Ghost, povvred into a mans soule, at that instant of iustification.</hi> Of the iustification by faith, and the second iustification shall be spoken in their places.</p>
            <p>So that we agree in this point, that iustification commeth of the free grace of God, through his infinite mercies, and the merits of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Passion, and that all sinnes, vvhen a man is iustified, be pardoned him.</p>

               <p>The first maine difference is in the matter thereof, which shall bee seene by the answere both of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and Papist to this one question: <hi>What is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, that causeth a man to stand righteous before God, and to be accepted to life euerlasting:</hi> wee answer, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the righteousnesse of Christ, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21024:88"/>
partly in his sufferings, and partly in his actiue obedience in fulfilling the rigour of the law. And here let vs consider, how neere the Papists come to this answere, and wherein they dissent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consent I.</hi> They graunt, that in iustification sinne is pardoned by the merits of Christ, and that none can be iustified without remission of sinnes: and that is well.</p>
               <p n="2">II. They graunt, that the righteousnes whereby a man is made righteous before God, commeth from Christ, and from Christ alone.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The most learned among them say, that Christ his satisfaction, and the merit of his death is imputed to euery sinner that doth heleeue, for <note n="*" place="margin">Bellarm. de Iustif. lib. 2. c. 7.</note> his satisfaction before God: and hitherto we agree.</p>
               <p>The very point of difference is this; wee hold that the satisfaction made by Christ in his death, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the law, is imputed to vs, and becomes our righteousnesse. They say, it is our satisfaction, and not our righteousnes, whereby we stand righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God: because it is inherent in the person of Christ as in a subiect. Now the answer of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist to the former question is on this manner; The thing (saith hee) that maketh vs righteous before God, and causeth vs to bee accepted to life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, is remission of sinnes, and the habite of inward righteousnes, or charitie with the fruites thereof. We condesend and graunt that the habite of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, which wee call sanctification, is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gift of God, and hath his reward of God: and is the matter of our iustification before men; because it serueth to declare vs to be reconciled to God, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21024:89"/>
to bee iustified: yet wee denie it to bee the thing, which maketh vs of sinners to become righteous, or iust before God.</p>

For they were all but creatures, and their obedience the obedience of creatures: but Christ his obedience is the obedience or righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God: so tearmed, Rom. 1. 17. 18. 2. Cor. 5. 21. not onely because God accepted of it, but because it was in that person which is very God. When Christ obeyed, God obeyed: and when he suffered, God suffered: not because the God-head suffered or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed anie obedience, but because the person which according to one nature is God, performed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and suffered. And by this means his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is of infinite value, price, merit &amp; efficacy. Hence also it commeth to passe, that this obedience of Christ serueth not only for the iustifying of some one person (<note n="*" place="margin">Namely for himselfe.</note> as <hi>Adams</hi> did) but of all and euery one of the elect: yea it is sufficient to iustifie many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand worlds.

But they vrge the reason further, saying; If Christ his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes be the righteousnesse of euery beleeuer, then euery man should be a Sauiour: which is absurd. <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer as before, and yet more plainely thus: Christ his righteousnesse is imputed to the person of this, or that man, not as it is the price of redemption for all mankind, but as it is the price of redemption for one particular man: as for example, Christ his righteousnes is imputed to <hi>Peter,</hi> not as it is the price of redemption for all, but as it is the price of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for <hi>Peter.</hi> And therefore Christ his righteousnesse, is not applyed to any one sinner in that largenesse and measure, in which it is in the person of Christ: but onely so sarreforth as it serueth to satisfie the lawe for the saide sinner, and to make his person accepted of God as righteous, and no further.</p>

VI.</hi> Iustification is eternall: but the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation   of Christ his righteousnesse is not eternall, for it ceaseth in the ende of this life: therefore it is not that which iustifieth a sinner. <hi>Answ.</hi> The imputation of Christs righteousnesse is euerlasting: for he that is esteemed righteous in this life by Christ his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, is accepted as righteous for euer; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21024:101"/>
of sinnes granted in this life, is for euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. And though sanctification be perfect in the world to come, yet shall it not iustifie: for wee must conceiue it no otherwise after this life, but as a fruit springing from the imputed righteousnes of Christ, without which it could not be. And a good childe will not cast away the first garment, because his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giues a second. And what if inward righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be perfect in the ende of this life, shal we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make it the matter of our iustification? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. For the righteousnesse whereby sinners are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, must be had in the time of this life, before the panges of death.</p>

This agreement is onely in worde, and the difference betweene vs is great in deede. And it may be reduced to these three heads. First, the Papist saying that a man is iustified by faith: vnderstandeth a general or a Catholike faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man beleeueth the articles of religion to bee true. But we hold that the faith which iustifieth, is a particular faith whereby we applie to our selues the promises of righteousnesse and life euerlasting by Christ.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reason I.</hi> The faith whereby we liue, is that faith whereby we are iustified: but the faith whereby we liue spiritually, is a particular faith wherby we apply Christ vnto our selues, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Gal. 2. 20. <hi>I liue,</hi> that is, spiritually, <hi>by the faith of the sonne of God:</hi> which faith he sheweth to be a particular faith in Christ, in the very wordes following, <hi>who hath</hi> loued me, <hi>and giuen himselfe for me,</hi> particularly: and in this manner of beleeuing <hi>Paul</hi> was and is an example to all that are to be saued. 1.

               <p>Master <hi>Perkins</hi> prooues his minor thus:
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>The faith, by which Paul liued, was a particular faith, whereby he applied Christ to himselfe.</item>
                     <item>But the faith, by which we liue, is the faith by which Paul liued.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition Master <hi>Perkins</hi> prooues by the <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles testimonie; where he doth particularly apply Christ to himselfe, as hauing loued him, and died for him. You an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no mention of his apprehending of Christs iustice; no more doth Master <hi>Perkins</hi> in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. But the Apostle mentions such a particular faith, as Master <hi>Perkins</hi> speakes of, <hi>viz.</hi> a perswasion that Christs benefits belong to him in particular, and that Christ hath particularly loued him; which is to apprehend Christ. And this is another manner of matter, than to hold that Christ died for euery particular man; which the diuels no doubt doe acknowledge.</p>
               <p>The assumption is euident of it selfe: for there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21024:103"/>
but that all which are iustified, haue and liue by the same faith. But Master <hi>Perkins</hi> sets out the matter by two places of scripture: in the former whereof, <note n="c" place="margin">1.

In <note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> the latter, hauing shewed that he cast off all confidence in his owne righteousnes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it as dung, resting onely vpon God for his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, by faith in Iesus Christ; he exhorts all men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his example, both in faith and holinesse.</p>

The words you alleage, are aboue thirtie lines after those that he cites, and depend not vpon them; but are spoken concerning the certaintie of saluation. <hi>So therefore</hi> (saith <hi>Bernard) doth this glorie, viz.</hi> the inward glorie and witnes of our conscience, as in the words immediatly before, <hi>dwell here in our earth, if mercie and truth meete together, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes and peace kisse each other.

The Papist saith, we are iustified by faith, because it disposeth a sinner to his iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after this manner: By faith (saith he) the mind of man is inlightened in the knowledge of the law and Gospell: knowledge stirres vp a feare of hell, with a consideration of the promise of happinesse, as also the loue and feare of God, and hope of life eternall. Now when the heart is thus prepared, God infuseth the habite of charitie and other vertues, whereby a sinner is iustified before God. We say otherwise, that faith iustifieth because it is a supernaturall Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment created by God in the heart of man at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, whereby hee apprehendeth and receiueth Christs righteousnesse for his iustification.</p>

I will be as short as he, the matter not being great. The Catholiks reach as you haue heard out of the Councell of Trent, in the beginning of this question, that many actes of faith, feare, hope, and charity do goe before our iustification, preparing our soule to receiue into it from God, through Christ that great grace. <note place="margin">It is your proud Synagogue that doth <hi>magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare.  </hi>

               <p>First there is more in your conclusion, than in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. The question is, whether faith be a supernaturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument created to that purpose or no: your conclusion is, that faith is not that onely supernaturall instrument. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I denie the consequence of your proposition: you may as well say (for that Master <hi>Perkins</hi> sets downe too) that if faith be the onely instrument, then the word is needlesse. The Word and Sacraments applie Christ outwardlie, as meanes on Gods part; faith receiues it in on our part; the holie Ghost inlightening and inclining our hearts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>Little infants (in my poore opinion) haue no act of faith, but are iustified, without any thing done by them; God for Christs sake (according to his euerlasting election) forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

But this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is as much as if wee should say, that dead men onely helped, can prepare themselues to their future resurrection. For we are all by nature dead in sinne, and therefore must not onely bee inlightened in minde, but also renewed in will, before wee can so much as will or desire that which is good. Now we (as I haue said) teach otherwise: that faith iustifieth as it is an instrument to apprehend and applie Christ with his obedience; which is the matter of our iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. This is the truth, I prooue it thus. In the Couenant of grace, two things must be considered: the substance thereof, and the condition. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the couenant is, that <hi>righteousnesse and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting, is giuen to Gods Church and people by Christ.</hi> The condition is, that wee for our parts, are by faith
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21024:110"/>
to receiue the foresaid benefits: and this condition is by grace as well as the substance. Now then, that wee may attaine to saluation by Christ, hee must bee giuen vnto vs really, as hee is propounded in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the foresaid Couenant. And for the giuing of Christ, God hath appointed speciall ordinances, as the preaching of the word, and the administration of the sacraments. The word preached is the power of God to saluation to euery one that beleeues: and the end of the Sacraments is to communicate Christ with all his benefits to them that come to bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers thereof: as is most plainely to bee seene in the supper of the Lord, in which the giuing of bread and wine to the seuerall communicants, is a pledge and signe of Gods particular giuing of Christs bodie and blood with all his merits, vnto them. And this gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on Gods part, cannot bee effectuall without receiuing on our parts: and therfore faith must needs bee an instrument or hand to receiue that which God giueth, that wee may finde comfort by this giuing.</p>

Not so good Sir, but that men spiritually dead being quickned by Gods spirit, may haue many good motions, for as our spirit giueth life vnto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; so the spirit of God by his grace animateth, and giueth life vnto our soules.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">speaker </seg>D. B. P.</label> Obserue first, that Catholikes do not teach that she was pardoned for loue alone, for they vse not (as Protestants do) when they find one cause   of iustification, to exclude all, or any of the rest: But considering that in sundrie places of holy write, iustification is ascribed vnto many seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues, affirme that not faith alone, but diuers other diuine quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concurre vnto iustification, and as mention here made of loue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth not faith, hope, repentance, and such like: so in other places, where faith is only spoken of, there hope, charity, and the rest, must not also be excluded. This sinner had assured beleefe in Christs power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinnes, and great hope in his mercie that hee would forgiue them, great sorrow and detestation of her sinne also she had, that in such an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie did so humblie prostrate her selfe at Christs feete, to wash them with her teares, and to wipe them with the haires of her head. And as she had true repentance of her former life, so no doubt but she had also a firme purpose, to lead a new life. So that in her conuersion, all those vertues meete together, which we hold to concurre to iustification, and among the rest, the preheminence worthelie is giuen to loue, as to the principall disposition. Shee loued our Sauiour as the fountaine of all mercies, and goodnes, and therfore accounted her precious oyntments best bestowed on him; yea, and the humblest seruice, and most affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate she could offer him, to be all too little, and nothing answerable to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21024:111"/>
the inward burning charitie which she bare him. Which noble affection of hers, towards her diuine Redeemer, no question, was most acceptable vnto him, as by his ovvne vvord is most manifest: for he said, <hi>That many sinnes vvere forgiuen her, because she loued much.</hi> But M. <hi>Perkins</hi> saith, that her loue vvas no cause that moued Christ to pardon her, but onely a signe of pardon giuen before: vvhich is so contrary to the text, that a man not past all shame, vvould blush once to affirme it.</p>

For it doth not receiue in, but as it were giue out it selfe in all the duties of the first and second ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards God and man: and this thing faith by it selfe cannot doe: and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that faith worketh by loue. The hand hath a property to reach out it selfe, to lay hold of any thing, and to receiue a gift: but the hand hath no propertie to cut a peece of wood of it selfe without saw or knife, or some like instrument: and yet by helpe of them, it can either deuide or cut. Euen so it is the nature of faith, to goe out of it selfe and to receiue Christ into the heart: as for the duties of the first and second table, faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of it selfe bring them forth; no more then the hand can deuide or cut: yet ioyne loue to faith, and then can it practise duties commanded concerning God and man. And this I take to be the meaning of this text, which speaketh not of iustification by faith, but onely of the practise of common duties, which faith putteth in execution by the helpe of loue.</p>

The similitude is true, and fit. True, because the eye doth see, though as an instrument fitted to that office by God: and thus Philosophers, Poets, Orators, and all kinde of people doe speake. He that would be more curious than wise, might finde fault with you also, and say; that the act of seeing also is mans, and the soule the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument whereby he doth see; as the hand is the instrument with which he reacheth.</p>
               <p>The fitnes of the similitude appeareth thus; It is man that beleeueth, as it is man that seeth. The generall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as I may speake) for both these actions is the soule, though by diuers faculties; the particular for sight is the eye, for beleeuing, faith, outwardly there is none. The eye seuered from the head seeth not; and yet it is the eye that seeth, and not the head: so saith, that is without hope and charitie, iustifieth not; and yet hope and charitie doth not iustifie. You answere that it is not to purpose; because wee require the presence of the whole cause, and not onely of the instrumentall. But you deceiue your selfe: for the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not of the whole cause, or principall efficient, which is God, (for <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 8. 33.</note> it is he onely that iustifieth) but of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if wee may so call it.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:21024:115"/>
you say it is our beleeuing, louing, and hoping; because we teach, that together with faith, by which (on our part) we are iustified, we receiue hope, charitie, and other graces of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which are all present in the heart, when it belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to iustification, but are no way any causes of it.</p>

And whereas wee say that such a faith onely iustifieth, as hath hope and loue for companions, it is not our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that these make saith acceptable, but that hee which beleeueth, and hath not these vertues, idly presumes of faith, when he hath it not; because the spirit of God, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with true faith, powreth these graces also into our soules.

Your reason is nothing worth. For the comparison of equalitie and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is insufficient. For though infants need no more to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; yet men of discretion doe.

Mary M. <hi>Perkins</hi> drawes it in after this fashion. As nothing was required of them who were stung by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, but that they should looke vpon the brasen serpent: So nothing is required of a sinner, to deliuer him from sinne, but that he cast his eyes of faith vpon Christs righteousnes, and applie that to himselfe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. But this application of the similitude is only mans foolish inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without any ground in the text. Similitudes be not in all points a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, neither must be streatched beyond the very point wherein the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude lieth, which in this matter is, that like as the Israelites in the Wildernesse stung with serpents, were cured by looking vpon the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen serpent: so men infected with sinne, haue no other remedie, then to embrace the faith of Christ Iesus: All this we confesse, but to say that nothing else is necessary, that is quite besides the text, and as easily reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by vs, as it is by him obtruded without any authority, or probability.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">speaker </seg>W. P.</label> The third difference about iustification is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning   this point, namely how far forth good workes are required thereto.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of the Church of Rome is, that there be two kinds of iustification: the first and second, as I haue said. The first is, when one of an euill man is made a good man: and in this, workes are wholy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, it being wholy of grace. The second is, when a man of a iust man is made more iust. And this they will haue to proceede from workes of grace: for (say they) as a man when he is once borne can by eating and drinking make himselfe a bigger man, though he could not at the first make himselfe a man: euen so a sinner hauing his first iustification, may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by grace make himselfe more iust. Therefore they hold these two things: I. That good works are meritorious causes of the second iustification, which they tearme Actuall: II. that good workes are meanes to increase first iustification, which they call Habituall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:21024:125"/>
Now let vs see how far forth we must ioyne with them in this point. Our consent therefore stands in three conclusions.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That good workes done by them that are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified doe please God, and are approoued of him, and therefore haue a reward.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Good workes are necessarie to saluation two waies: first, not as causes thereof, either conseruant, adiuvant, or procreant: but onely as consequents of faith: in that they are inseparable companions and fruits of that faith, which is indeede necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Secondly, they are necessarie as markes in a way, and as the way it selfe directing vs vnto eternall life.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Wee hold and beleeue, that the righteous man, is in some sort iustified by works, for so the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost speaketh plainely and truely, Iam. 2. 21. <hi>That Abraham was iustified by workes.</hi>

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:21024:132"/>
to his righteousnesse: and therefore he was iustified thereby. <hi>Answ.</hi> There be two kinds of righteousnes, one of the person, the other of the cause or action. The righteousnesse of a mans person, is, whereby it is accepted into the fauour of God into life eternall. The righteousnes of the action or cause is, when the action or cause is iudged of God to be good and iust. Now <hi>Dauid</hi> in this Psalme, speaketh onely of the righteousnesse of the action, or innocencie of his cause, in that hee was falslie charged to haue sought the kingdome. In like manner it is said of <hi>Phineas,</hi> Psalm. 166. 31. that his fact in killing <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, was imputed to him for righteousnesse:</hi> not because it was a satisfaction to the lawe, the rigour whereof could not be fulfilled in that one worke, but because God accepted of it as a iust worke, and as a token of his righteousnes and zeale for Gods glorie.</p>

                  <hi>Obiect. II.</hi> The Scripture saith in sundrie places, that men are blessed which doe good workes.

Ans.</hi> The man is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that endeauoureth to keepe Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Yet is he not blessed simply, because he doth so; but because he is in Christ, by whom he doth so: and his obedience to the lawe of God is a signe thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Obiect.

Perfection in parts is, when beeing regenerate, and hauing the seedes of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie vertues, we endeauour accordingly to obey God, not in some few, but in all and euery part of the law: as <hi>Iosias</hi> turned vnto God <hi>according to all the law of Moses.</hi> Perfection in degree is, when a man keepeth euery commandement of God, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the very rigor therof, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highest degree. Now then whereas we are commaunded to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and haue examples of the same perfection in Scripture: both commaundements and examples must be vnderstood of perfection in partes, and not of perfection in degrees, which cannot bee attained vnto in this life; though we for our parts, must dailie striue to come as neare vnto it, as possibly we can.</p>

An euill worke is perfectly euill, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth damnation: but there is no good worke of any man that is perfectly good: and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not iustifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect. VIII.</hi> To beleeue in Christ is a worke, and by it we are iustified: and if one worke doe iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, why may we not be iustified by all the workes of the law. <hi>Answ.</hi> Faith must be considered two waies: first, as a worke, qualitie, or vertue: secondly, as an Instrument, or an hand reaching out it selfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Christs merit. And wee are iustified by faith, not as it is a worke, vertue, or qualitie; but as it is an
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:21024:134"/>
instrument to receiue and apply that thing whereby wee are iustified. And therefore it is a figuratiue speech to say, <hi>We are iustified by faith.</hi> Faith conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it selfe maketh no man righteous; neither doth the action of faith, which is to apprehend, iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: but the obiect of faith, which is Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence apprehended.</p>
               <p>These are the principall reasons commonly vsed: which as wee see, are of no moment. To conclude therefore, we hold, that workes concurre to iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that wee are iustified thereby as by signes and effects, not as causes: for both the beginning, middle, and accomplishment of our iustification is onely in Christ: and hereupon <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>If any man</hi> (beeing alreadie iustified) <hi>sinne wee haue an aduocate with the father, Iesus Christ, and he is the propitiation for our sinnes.</hi> And to make our good workes meanes or causes of our iustification, is to make euery man a Sauiour to himselfe.</p>

Our obedience is to be squared according to the commandement of God: neither haue we any warrant from him to excuse our selues by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited reason, and I know not what purport of the law.

                  <hi>The iustice (through vvhich the iust man liueth by faith) because it is giuen to man by the spirit of grace is true iustice: the vvhich although it be vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie called in some men perfect, according to the capacity of this life, yet it is but small in comparison of that greater, vvhich man made equall to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels shall receiue.

But certainely this lesser iustice, or righteousnes, breedeth, and bringeth forth merits, and that greater, is the revvard thereof.

Lastly, that it bringeth forth good workes, such as merit life euerlasting. True it is also, that this iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice although perfect in it self, so farre as mans capacity in this life doth permit: yet being compared vnto the state of iustice which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, it may be called imperfect, not that this is not sufficient to defend vs from all formall transgression of Gods law: but because it keepeth not vs sometimes from veniall sinne: and hath not such a high degree of perfection as that hath.</p>

               <p>It is also called perfect, in some men, not (as you say, without <hi>Austins</hi> authoritie) because it faileth not in any dutie, which we are bound to performe, but in comparison of the imperfection of it in other men, and the vncapablenes that by our corruption, is in euery one of vs.</p>

               <p>It cannot be called imperfect, because it doth not keepe vs from sinning; If it be true, that it is sufficient to keepe vs from all formall transgression of Gods law: else we must say, that <hi>Adams</hi> righteousnes was imperfect; yea, it may well be held; That the Angels now, and we hereafter in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, shall be kept from sinning, not by any strength of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousnes, but by the speciall grace of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vpholding vs. That it may be proper to God, that possiblie he cannot sinne, by reason of goodnesse resting in him (that I may so speake) which cannot be lesse then infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.

he lookes into and considers the heart, whom the secrets of the heart doe not deceiue, it is manifestly shewed, that the heretikes doe not extoll men on high, but derogate from the power of God.

                  <hi>Gregory</hi> is as truly alleaged as <hi>Austin,</hi> and as himselfe was before. For he doth not so much as allude to the Psalm: but onely say (according to that text of <note n="f" place="margin">Iob. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Iob,</hi> which he there expounds) that man, compared to God, cannot be counted righteous.</p>
               <p>That place of <hi>Iob</hi> hath the doctrine, which you would wring out of the Psalme: but where is the proofe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is there, therfore also it is here? But let me also shew, that this which you rest vpon, cannot bee the meaning of <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 142. 3</note> the Psalme. Which I take to be plaine; because if we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it so, it is no reason to moue God not to enter into iudgement. For what though no man bee so righteous as God? If he be so rigeteous, as God requires such a creature should be, it can neuer hurt him, though God enter into iudgement with him a thousand times. So the sentence should be vaine, there being no occasion of it. Now the conclusion wee make out of these and such like places, is, that no man should fancie to himselfe a possibilitie of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Gods Commandements, when the holiest men that euer were, dare not stand before Gods iudgement seate, to giue account of those things they haue done since they were iustified, and (as the Papists say) receiued this grace.</p>

many hypocrites are in the Church, that haue not so much as a perswasion of the truth of the Scripture, and so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly want their mariage garment.

Now, vpon this impossibilitie, it should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, (in your opinion) that we may assure our selues, we can neuer come to saluation by this faith. All the matter lies in this proposition, that the ioyning of these vertues exacts the fulfilling of the law, to applie Christ by, which hath no kind of truth in it: for first, the hauing of charitie doth not bind vs to keepe the law, but enables vs in some measure to that dutie, which we were bound to before. Secondlie, it is not the lincking of these two that doth enable vs, but the hauing of charitie, that is of iustifying grace. Lastlie, though they come and stay together: yet haue they as their seuerall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and effects, so their seuerall ends also; faith seruing to obtaine iustification, charity to cause a holy conuersation.

               <p>The Popish Church placeth merits within man, making two sorts thereof: the merit of the person, and the merit of the worke. The merit of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is a dignity in the person, whereby it is worthy of life euerlasting. And this (as they say) is to be found in Infants dying after baptisme, who though they want good workes, yet are they not voide of this kinde of merite, for which they receiue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. The merit of the worke, is a digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or excellencie in the worke, whereby it is made fitte and inabled to deserue life euerlasting for the doer. And workes (as they teach) are meritorious
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:21024:150"/>
two waies: first, by couenant, because God hath made a promise of reward vnto them: secondly, by their owne dignitie; for Christ hath merited that our workes might merit. And this is the substance of their doctrine. From it we dissent in these points.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Wee renounce all personall merits, that is, all merits within the person of any meere man. II. And we renounce all merit of workes, that is, all merit of any worke done by any meere man whatsoeuer. And the true merit whereby wee looke to attaine the fauour of God, and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, is to bee found in the person of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: who is the storehouse of all our merits: whose prerogatiue it is, to bee the person alone in whom God is well pleased. Gods fauour is of infinite digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and no creature is able to do a worke which may counteruaile the fauour of God, saue Christ alone: who by reason of the dignitie of his person, being not a meere man but God-man, or Man-God, hee can doe such workes as are of endlesse dignitie euery way answerable to the fauour of God: and therefore sufficient to merit the same for vs. And though a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or meritorious worke agree onely to the person of Christ, yet is it made ours by imputation. For as his righteousnesse is made ours, so are his merits depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereon: but his righteousnesse is made ours by imputation, as I haue shewed. Hence ariseth an other point, namely that as Christs righteousnesse is made ours really by imputation to make vs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: so we by the merit of his righteousnesse impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vs, doe merit and deserue life euerlasting. And this is our doctrine. In a word, the Papists maintaine
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21024:151"/>
the merits of their owne workes: but we renounce them all, and rest onelie on the merit of Christ.</p>

               <p>The first shall be taken from the properties and conditions that must be in a worke meritorious, and they are foure. I. A man must doe it of himselfe, and by himselfe: for if it bee done by an other, the merit doth not properly belong to the doer. II. A man must doe it of his owne free-will and pleasure, not of due debt: for when wee doe that which wee are bound to doe, wee doe no more but our dutie. III. The worke must be done to the profit of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who thereupon must bee bound to repay the like. IV. The reward and the worke must be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion equall, for if the reward bee more then the

worke, it is not a reward of desert, but a gift of good will. Hence followes a notable conclusion: <hi>That Christs manhood considered apart from his Godhead, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not merit at Gods hand: though it be more excellent euery way then all men and Angels.</hi> For being thus conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it doth nothing of it selfe, but by grace receiued from the godhead: though it also bee without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Secondly Christs manhood is a creature, and in that regarde bounde to doe whatsoeuer it doth. Thirdly, Christ as man cannot giue any thing to God, but that which hee receiued from God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot the manhood properly by it selfe merit, but onely as it is personally vnited vnto the godhead of the Sonne. And if this be so, then much lesse can any meere man, or any angell merit: yea it is a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to thinke, that either our actions or persons should be capable of any merit whereby wee might attaine to life eternall.</p>

               <p>First, by a sorry short syllogisme containing more then one vvhole <note place="margin">It is said after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly proposed.</note> page.

But inferreth thereon, as though he had proued them inuincibly, that Christs man-hood seperated from the God-head cannot merit: because vvhatsoeuer he doth, he doth it by grace receiued, and should be othervvise due. He might in like manner as truly say, that Christs manhood vnited to the Godhead could not merit neither: for he receiued his Godhead from his Father, and vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he doth is therefore his Fathers by due debte. And so the good man, if he vvere let alone, vvould disappoint vs vvholy of all merits, as vvell the imputed of Christs, as of all ours done by vertue of his grace.</p>

                     <item>Euery worke that merits euerlasting life, must be done of and by the worker himselfe, not of debt, to the profit of God, with proportion to the reward.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Is not this a perilous long syllogisme (trow you) to take vp more than a whole page? If this great scholler, that so often blames Master <hi>Perkins</hi> ignorance, would (for I wil not doubt but he could) haue distinguished the syllogisme from the explication of the proposition, he would not haue been so much offended with it. Sure there was small cause hee should be, if he say truly afterward, that Master <hi>Perkins</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was nakedly proposed; or trie whether himselfe can make it any shorter; or compare it with his owne tedious answer, containing three whole pages in quarto in a smaller letter. But what if there be another syllogisme also implied in this reason? as there is this.
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>If the manhood of Christ, properly by it selfe, could not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then can no man merit:</item>

               </p>
               <p>The consequence of the proposition is prooued: because the manhood of Christ is more excellent euery way, than all both men and Angels.</p>
               <p>The assumption is made manifest; because euery worke of Christs manhood, considered apart from the Godhead, would be defectiue in three points concerning merit.</p>
               <p>To the two former you answer, that <hi>whereas Master Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins saith, Christs manhood could not merit, because he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himselfe, but by grace receiued, and that that he did was due; that he might as truly say, that his manhood could not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vnited to the Godhead.</hi> Your reason is; <hi>for that he receiued his Godhead from his Father, and whatsoeuer he doth, is therefore his Fathers by due debt.</hi> But your reason is false: for <note n="b" place="margin">See 12.

Which is so common a case, and so sensible, that euery man of meane vvitte, may casily reach vnto it: euen so by good manuring the gifts vvhich God freely bestovveth vpon vs, vve may both merit the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of them, and according to his ovvne order and promise, purchase thereby the Kingdome of heauen, vvhich is plainly proued in that para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Of the talents giuen by a King to his seruants;</hi> the vvhich they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> vvell, and multiplying, vvere therefore esteemed vvorthie of far greater, and vvithall to be made partakers of their Lords ioyes.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Perkins</hi> then vvas not a little ouerseene, to put for the first proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of merit, that it must be done by a man, and of a man himselfe.</p>

               <p>What shall I need to answer to your similitude of games, since your selfe denie, that it is truly and properly desert? But to make the matter more plaine, let vs a little consider it in this sort; where there is an agreement (as in these games) though there be not properly any merit: yet there may be somewhat that shal come neere to the nature of merit. That there is no merit you yeeld, in granting, that the reward is more in value than the act of him that winneth. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, if the prize (be it what it will) be propounded to them, that shall not onely passe other men in the race, but also runne home to the goale, in such a space of time, with such, or such a carriage of the bodie, without any kinde of stay or treading a haires breadth out of a path appointed, with other like circumstances: I grant that hee which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues all these conditions exactly, may bee said, in some good sense, to haue deserued the hire that he laboured for, though it were farre greater than such a race could truly and properly merit. But if this man should faile, in many, or any of these circumstances, though he came neerer the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the whole than any other man did, might he in iustice claime the prize, as due to him vpon desert? This is our case in the point of merit. There is no man but he failes very much, and often, in his best workes, some lesse, some more; but euery one more or lesse. So that no man had any cause to accuse God of iniustice, though he should denie all men the reward, due to the keepers of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>What is <note n="p" place="margin">Bernard ser. 68. in Cantic.</note> 
                  <hi>Bernards</hi> owne doctrine? your whole answer, or only the later part of it? let the reader iudge. These are <hi>Bernards</hi> words, <hi>As it is inough to merit, not to presume of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, so to want merits is inough to condemnation.</hi> If he speake of merits properly taken what presumption is it for a man to demand his right? But because our good works, which he (as other auncient writers) calls merits, are imperfit,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:21024:161"/>
therefore our greatest merit is, to know we merit not: for the later part of his sentence, we graunt, that it is inough to damnation, for a man to be without good works. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in <hi>Bernard: No infants regenerate want merits, but haue Christs, whereof notwithstanding they make themselues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, if they had opportunitie to add their owne, and neglected it, which is the danger of riper yeares. Infants</hi> (sayes <hi>Bernard) haue Christs merits, but, if they come to yeares, they must also haue some of their owne.</hi> What? merits to deserue heauen? then were Christs insufficient; but they must haue good works, without which they make themselues vnworthie of any benefit by Christ. Is not this whollie our doctrine? let vs heare his conclusion. <hi>Haue a care</hi> (sayes <hi>Bernard) to haue merits, hauing them, know they were giuen thee, hope for the fruite of them by the mercy of God, and thou hast auoided all danger, of pouertie, vnthankefulnes, and presumption.</hi> We must haue good workes, else wee are poore; we must know they are not of our selues, else we are vnthankfull; we must looke for reward of mercie, not of debt, else we are presumptuous. So that <hi>Bernard</hi> requires good workes, not as the cause, but as the way, betwixt Gods promise, and performance of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euerlasting life to them that are iustified and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:21024:165"/>
said in the word of God, that Christ did merit, that our workes should merit: it is a dotage of their owne deuising. He died not for our good workes to make them able to satisfie Gods anger: but for our sinnes, that they might be pardoned. Thus much saith the Scripture, and no more. And in that Christ did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently merit life eternall for vs, by his owne death: it is a sufficient proofe that hee neuer intended to giue vs power of meriting the same: vnlesse wee suppose that at some time hee giues more then is needefull. Againe, Christ in the office of mediation as he is a King, Priest, and Prophet, admitteth no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie or fellow. For he is a most perfect Mediatour, doing all thinges by himselfe, without the helpe of any. And the Ministers that dispence the word are not his deputies, but reasonable and voluntarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, which he vseth. But if men by workes can merit increase of grace and happinesse for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, then hath Christ partners in the worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: men doing that by him, which hee doth of himselfe, in procuring their saluation. Nay, if this might stand, that Christ did merit, that our workes should merit, then Christ should merit that our stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned righteousnesse beeing for this cause not capable of merit, should neuerthelesse merit. I call it stained; because we are partly flesh, and partly spirit: and therfore in our selues deseruing the curse of the law, though wee bee regenerate. Againe, for one good worke wee doe, wee haue many euill, the offence whereof defaceth the merit of our best deedes, and makes them too light in the ballance of the law.</p>

In the legall couenant life euerlasting is promised to works, for that is the condition of the law; Do these things, and thou shalt liue. But on this manner can no man merit life euerlasting, because none is able to doe all that the law requires; whether we respect the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or the measure of obedience. In the Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call couenant, the promises that are made, are not made to any worke of vertue in man, but to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:21024:168"/>
not for any merit of his owne person or worke, but for the person and merit of Christ. For example, it is a promise of the Gospell, <hi>Be faithfull vnto death, and I will giue thee the crowne of life.</hi> Reuelat. 2. 10. Here the promise is not made to the vertue of fidelitie, but to the faithfull person; whose fidelitie is but a token that he is in Christ: for the merit of whose obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence God promiseth the crowne of life.</p>

               <p>Vpon what doth <note n="c" place="margin">Heb 6. 10. 12</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> inferre that? not vpon that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and much lesse vpon the expositions of it, which then were not hatcht: but vpon the promises of God, made to them which through faith and patience attaine to the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of those promises. And this is that iustice the <note n="d" place="margin">2. Thes. 1. 6.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks of, hauing no ground, but Gods gratious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to accept and reward our workes, though their worth deserue no such recompence. Which <note n="e" place="margin">Chrysost. ad Matth. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> signifieth in his Commentarie vpon the other place, where he saith, <hi>The reward shall be greater than the worke; not onely in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,</hi> whereof also he speaketh, <hi>but in the measure too. He ioynes them</hi> (saith <hi>Chrysostome) in respect of their crownes, with those who haue done farre greater things than they.</hi> So that euerlasting life is not truly and properly deserued by works, but is giuen by promise to them that doe worke. If you will vrge the point of iustice, I answere, the Apostle speaketh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common speech of men, who count it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of iniustice, not to doe well to them that doe well; and ill to them that doe ill. And in this generall respect God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede deales iustly, punishing them that haue behaued themselues lewdly and wickedly, and rewarding them that haue liued righteously and vertuously: So that herein stands
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:21024:169"/>
his iustice, in giuing euery man according to his own works; without the following of which course, there cannot be (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) any iustice. And therefore <note n="f" place="margin">Hieron. cont. Iouin. lib. 2. c. 2</note> 
                  <hi>Ierome</hi> truly saith, <hi>that God doth both punish euill workes, and receiue or accept of good workes:</hi> but not as if there were an equalitie of merit in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of workes, to the punishment or reward he giues; onely, as he saith there, <hi>because he would haue none that are fallen despaire of Gods mercie, he thus amplifies his regard of them;</hi> as though it were an vniust thing for God, as <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> speakes, to contemne and forget them that haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised themselues in workes of charitie.</p>
               <p>You haue brought no place of any expresse couenant, but that which being allegoricall, and (as I said before) not expounded in the Scripture, can hardly affoord any certain proofe: and none at all of the matter, for which you bring it. Whereas if the point were so cleere, as you would make it, being of so great importance, doubtlesse it would haue more direct confirmation in Scripture, than by allegories and exhortations. But it seemes you doe not rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Master <hi>Perkins</hi> distinction; who denies not that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is promised for working, and workes, euen in the new couenant, but makes this difference, that by the couenant of the law the wages is due to him that workes, vpon the value of his worke; but by the couenant of the Gospell the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is giuen, not for the worth of the deede, but because the worke is accepted for the workmans sake, who by faith is the sonne of God.</p>
               <p>Neither of those speeches are any part of the new coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, though they be recorded in the new Testament. And the <note n="g" place="margin">Matth. 19. 17</note> latter was our Sauiours own speech, to beate down the pride of him that would be iustified by the law: but of this before. The parable is often vrged, but nothing prooued out of it. He that will haue euerlasting life, as hire of his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, proclaimeth himselfe to be a hireling, not a sonne.</p>

Whereas if your doctrine of merit and free will were true, a man, hauing grace from God, whereby hee is enabled to worke, might of his owne free will so vse this grace, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting life should be due to him, as wages for his work. But if these good workes proceed from grace, not onely in respect of our abilitie to doe them, but of the particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; what true merit can there bee in them? Immediatly after the words you alleage, it followes <note n="h" place="margin">Aug. lib. 50. Hom. Homil. 14.</note> in <hi>Austin: In the reward thou doest nothing, in the work nothing alone. The crowne is from him, the worke from thy selfe; yet not without his helpe.</hi> Which helpe we must vnderstand to be more than an abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to worke; or else, as I said, our free will shall haue the chiefe commendation in all our good workes. But to the testimonie; we graunt that the reward is due to the worke, which is your conclusion out of <hi>Austin;</hi> but wee denie that it is due vpon desert of the worke. For neither doth the worke, if it were perfectly done, truly and properly deserue the reward, because it is a matter of duty, and but one work,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:21024:174"/>
whereas many thousands are due to make vp true merit by workes; and being imperfect, as all our best workes are, it is so farre from deseruing euerlasting life, that it rather might increase our sinnes, if God should strictly in iustice exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it.</p>

But we adde hereunto, first, that these works did not by their due worth wring this promise from God, as if he had been vniust, vnlesse he had made it. Which must haue been, if they be truly and wholy such merits, that euerlasting life is necessarily due to them as wages. Secondly, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise being made, we say further, that none of our works are so exactly performed, according to the rule of Gods iustice, but that hee might iustly denie vs the reward promised. Thirdly, we affirme, that it is not euerlasting life, or the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen properly taken, which God hath promised and owes to our workes, but onely the measure of glorie in heauen. The kingdome is due to vs, as an inheritance, by the right of sonnes; the diuers measure of glorie is met out to euery one according to his workes, and for his workes; yet not vpon their desert, but vpon Gods gratious promise, and mercifull acceptance, pardoning our sinnes, and rewarding vs aboue our deserts.</p>

               <p>The <note n="b" place="margin">Concil. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rausic. can. 18.</note> Councell of Orenge saith nothing that was not said before in the testimonies of the Fathers, neither needs
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:21024:176"/>
any other answer. The doubt is not, whether reward be due to good works, but by what right it is due, whereof the Councell saith nothing expresly.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of merits, as it was held and taught by the auncient Christians, before the discouerie of your Romish Antichrist, we acknowledge and embrace, howsoeuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some particular men may haue gon a little too farre in their amplifications. But the doctrine that is maintained by your Church, and Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> we disclaime, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, as the principall meanes next to direct Pelagianisme, to puffe vp the pride of mans heart, and to take away true thankfulnes and trust in God, that is to ouerthrow the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, the end whereof is beleeuing in Christ to iustification and saluation. For if, as by your doctrine it must needs be, man do at the first, by the good vse of his freewill, receiue grace, and by the same freewill, though in both cases in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and inspired, merit his saluation truly and wholie as the day labouring man doth his wages, what glory can God haue, or what thanks doth Christ deserue for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mans saluation? he prouided the meanes, you will say that <hi>Peter</hi> (for example) might be saued, if he would. So did he that <hi>Iudas</hi> might be. He offered the meanes to <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Iudas</hi> too. How chance <hi>Peter</hi> receiued this grace and <hi>Iudas</hi> did not? you answer, because <hi>Peter</hi> would, and <hi>Iudas</hi> would not. But how came it to passe that <hi>Peter</hi> would and <hi>Iudas</hi> would not? Here is the first difference, was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God of his loue to <hi>Peter</hi> wrought in his heart by his spirit, so that it could not come to passe but he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and left <hi>Iudas</hi> to himselfe, who so left would neuer beleeue? so we teach according to the truth of the Gospell. But you perswade your people that it was <hi>Peter</hi> that made the difference betwixt himselfe and <hi>Iudas,</hi> not God, who left the matter to the free will of both alike, that either, or nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them might be saued, as pleased them.</p>
               <p>But what? is <hi>Peter</hi> by this beleeuing in Christ, an heire of heauen? no, only he is now in such an estate, as that he may if he will earne euerlasting life, as the hire and wages of his
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:21024:177"/>
works. I appeale now to any Christian soule that hath but the least desire to aduance Gods glory aboue his owne, to giue sentence of this matter out of the truth of his heart: what doth God by the doctrine of popery, but only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that men may come to heauen if they will? And how? forsooth vpon our Sauiour Christs deserts, he is content to giue men grace, whereby they may be able to merit their owne saluation. But he will giue this grace to no man, who shall not first vpon good motions inspired, prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, of his owne free will, by faith, feare, hope, loue, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to the receiuing of it: hauing receiued it, he must now by good works, to which he is enabled, deserue euerlasting life so fully, as that God should be vniust, if he should not giue it him, for the worthines of the worke he hath done. For whereas he made a promise of a reward, it was no more then he was bound to do in true iustice, our works, without his promise, deseruing the reward truly and wholie. This is the doctrine of your Church touching faith, and works, which Master <hi>Perkins</hi> iustly calls a satanicall inuention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it ouerthrowes the glory of Gods mercy, to establish the pride of mans free will. Now whereas we teach, that our works do not by their worth deserue euerlasting life, what hurt is it (if it were false, but only that it were false) to make men thinke themselues wholie bound to God, for their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and glorification? for we vrge necessitie of works, and assurance of reward, as well as you, though not to merit euerlasting glory by them. If any man be so thankeles, or so proude, that he will not worke, vnlesse he may merit by working, he neuer felt himselfe to be a sonne, and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the wages of seruants, the iust hire of his sinnes, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

For (say they) Christs satisfaction is sufficient in it selfe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the iustice of God for all sin and punishment: but it is not sufficient to this or that man till it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: and it must bee applied by our satisfaction made to God for the temporall punishment of our sinnes. But I say againe, that mans satisfaction can bee no meanes to apply the satisfaction of Christ: and I prooue it thus. The meanes of applying Gods blessings and graces vnto man are twofold: some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect God himselfe, and some respect man. Those which respect God, are such whereby God on his part doth offer and conuey his mercies in Christ vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man: of this sort are the preaching of the worde, baptisme, and the Lords supper, and these are as it were the hand of God whereby he reacheth downe and giueth vnto vs Christ with all his benefites. The other meanes of applying on mans part, are those whereby the saide benefits are receiued. Of this sort there is onely one, namely faith, whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Christ with all his benefits belong vnto vs. And this is the hand of man, whereby he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Christ as he is offered, or exhibited by God in the word and sacraments. As for other meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side these, in Scripture we finde none. Foolish ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the answere of the Papists, that make mens sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions meanes to apply the satisfaction of Christ vnto vs: for by humane satisfactions, Christ is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offered on Gods part, nor yet receiued on mans part: let them prooue it if they can.</p>

It stands you vpon to shew vs good euidence out of the record of Scripture, that God agreed with Christ, not to take the full desert of his sufferings and satisfaction, but to leaue man still indebted to him, though in truth the debt were paid. If no such agreement can be shewed, for my part I see not how God in iustice can aske the same debt twice, being once fully satisfied.</p>
               <p>That which you adde is wholy our doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that God, by smart and griefe, would feare vs from sinning, and make vs conformable to his Sonne our Sauiour. But you teach, that he punisheth vs, and so takes satisfaction for sins past, as if he were to be reuenged on vs, at least by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall punishment, for our sinnes committed.</p>
               <p>You repeate your conclusion, but with no dependance vpon your former matter, or proofe from that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: where <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 6. 5.</note> the Apostle tels the Galathians, that they may not be alwaies finding fault with other men, and so grow into a conceit of their owne goodnes, but looke to themselues; because euery man must giue an account to God for his owne sinnes, and not for another mans. If you will needs abuse the Apostle, and applie his words to that he thought not on; why doe you not, by the same reason, lay the eternall punishment vpon vs too? for that was our burthen, as well as the temporall.</p>

                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted confessing, and crauing of pardon to be the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction God lookes for, which is alwayes performed by a sinner, before he can haue any true hope that his sinnes are forgiuen.

                  <hi>Therefore Peter brake out into teares, intreating nothing by voyce. Teares wash sinnes, which it is a shame to confesse. Teares are as it were silent prayers. I finde why Peter hold his peace, least the crauing of pardon so soone might more offend.</hi> Teares are part of repentance, when they come from the true griefe of the heart, but not any part of satisfaction for temporall paine, which we should else indure, as that very sentence of <hi>Ambrose</hi> prooues. <hi>Hee</hi> (saith <hi>Ambrose) that repents, must not only wash away his sinnes with teares, but also couer and hide his former sinnes with better deeds, that sinne be not laid to his charge.</hi> Now where sinne is not imputed, there can no punishment be due; and where

It is not either in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or in <hi>Toby,</hi> or that place thrust into the book of <hi>Toby.</hi> And out of question it was not <hi>Daniels</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> should giue to the poore, so that he should come into want himselfe by giuing; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (I thinke) can you prooue it was our Sauiours mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when he exhorted the Pharisies to almes deedes. But doe you not perceiue that you marre all by this doctrine? Who will giue any thing at his death to your Monasteries, if he may not by giuing make some satisfaction? And what satisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can then be made, when a man giues all of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie, as hauing need of nothing? There must be some helpe thought on for this matter, or all will be naught. That which followes, presumes there must be satisfaction made, and shewes why you thinke those the fittest meanes for to satisfie by. But where the foundation is ouerthrowne, what shall wee neede to thrust at the building. Onely I will adde here in the end of this discourse, a few, of many meanes, for the procuring of pardon by satisfaction. Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. granted seuen hundred yeeres of pardon to euery one, that should kisse three times the measure of our Ladies foote (as <note place="margin">Pardon. 700. yeares.</note> you call her) and should say deuoutly three Auemaries to her blessed honour and worship.

In searching out the true sense of holy Scriptures; we must obserue diligently the nature and proper sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the words; as M. <hi>Perkins</hi> also noteth out of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> in his sixt obiection of this question; which, if the Protestants did here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, they would make no such account of this text: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith only, that all Scripture is <hi>profitable,</hi> not <hi>sufficient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Seed serues well, yea, is also necessary to bring forth corne: but will it suffice of itself, without manuring of the ground, and seasonable weather? And to fit our purpose more properly; good lawes are very profitable: yea, most expedient for the good gouernment of the common-vvealth: But are they sufficient vvithout good customes, good gouernours, and iudges, to see the same law and customes rightly vnderstood and duly executed? Euen so the holy Scriptures (S. <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth) are very profitable; as contayning very good and necessarie matter, both to teach, reproue, and correct: but he saith not they are sufficient, or that they do containe all doctrine needfull for these foure ends: And therefore, to argue out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that they are sufficient for all those purposes; vvhen he saith only, that they are profitable to them, is plainly not to knovv, or not to care vvhat a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> himselfe, who saith, that <hi>the Romans intreated him to set downe in writing those things which the Apostle Peter had taught them by word of mouth, and which he also had heard him deliuer.</hi> The like is to be said of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who was a companion of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> and wrote (as the other did) that which he heard of him, and other of the Apostles. But howsoeuer the things deliuered by them came first to their knowledge, it wants not much of blasphemy, to make traditions the foundation of the Gospels written by them. For either the holy Ghost did not inspire them with the matter and manner of their penning, or else, if it be as you would haue it, the holy ghost built vpon tradition, which is but an vncertaine kinde of knowledge depending vpon mens memories, which may often faile them, especially in carrying away speeches of discourse, and disputation.</p>

And gaine, some of the rest of those blessed and Godly personages, vvould haue reproued it, as they did all other falshoods, if it had not binsuch indeed as it vvas tearmed: Which vvhen they did not, they gaue a secret approbation of it for such; and so that hath the interpretatiue consent at least of the learned of that age, and the follovving for Apostolicall Tradition. <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

it so, because they were taught by our Lord: yet <hi>Pauls</hi> case is proper to himselfe, and altogether extraordinarie.</p>
               <p>The third particular is somewhat more to purpose; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note n="s" place="margin">1.

But first, this hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripture Papist must be put in minde, that whereas he calles these wranglers scripturists, as if they had alleaged scripture for their defence, there is no such thing in the text, nor any one obiection so much as signified by the Apostle. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this custome of the Church is not alleaged because (as he seemes to presume, by his conclusion afterward) he wanted other reason to prooue the point. For as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue obserued, he hath in the former part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, proued it to be against nature, and against scripture too. Thirdly, he reasons not about any matter of doctrine, but about the outward carriage of men and women in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie of Gods seruice. Lastly, it doth no way follow, that because the custome of the Church must ouer-way priuate mens fancies in things indifferent, therefore the Scripture containes not all things necessarie to saluation, but must be supplied therein by traditions. Neither doth the Apostles example warrant his conclusion. The Apostle hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he exhorts to by reason and Scripture, last of all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leages custome, against contentious men, in a thing which they tooke to be indifferent: therefore wee must alleage Scriptures, when they be plaine for vs, and when they are not plaine, tradition, euen in matters of saluation.

                  <hi>Obiect. II.</hi> That <hi>Scripture is Scripture,</hi> is a point to   be beleeued, but that is a tradition vnwritten; and therefore one tradition there is not written, that we are to beleeue. <hi>Answ.</hi> That the bookes of the olde and new Testament are Scripture, it is to bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and beleeued not vpon bare tradition, but from the very bookes themselues, on this manner. Let a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is indued with the spirit of discerning, reade the seuerall bookes, withall let him consider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed authour thereof, which is God himselfe, and the matter therein contained, which is a most diuine and absolute truth full of pietie: the manner and forme of speech, which is full of maiestie in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of words. The end whereat they wholy aime, which is the honor and glory of God alone, &amp;c. and he shal be resolued that scripture is scripture, euen by the Scripture it selfe.

of men whatsoeuer. Thus then Scripture prooues it selfe to be Scripture: and yet wee despise not the vniuersal consent or tradition of the Church in this case: which though it doe not perswade the conscience, yet is it a notable inducement to mooue vs to reuerence, and regard the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles. It will be said, where is it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that Scripture is Scripture? I answere, not in any one particular place or booke of scripture, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie line and page of the whole Bible to him that can read with the spirit of discerning, and can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the voice of the true Pastour, as the sheepe of Christ can doe.</p>

Who more profound, more skilfull to discerne, than that subtile and sharpe Doctor S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and yet the Protestants will not allow him the true spirit of discerning which bookes be Canonicall. For he, in diuers places of his workes, <note n="*" place="margin">De praedest.

                  </gap>t; therefore some points of necessary doctrine contained in them, are not extant in the written Word, and consequently to be learned by Tradition. M. <hi>Perkins</hi> answereth: First supposing some of the bookes to be lost, that all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doctrine, which was in them, is in some of the others preserued. But <note place="margin">This Argument vvas not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to him.</note> why did he not solue the Argument proposed? were then those bookes superfluous?

W.</label> Because you thinke the reason makes for your aduantage,   as you haue framed it your selfe, I will follow your steps, and leaue his argument as you do. That I may answere or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, I deny your assumption: All things necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation are conteined in some certaine bookes of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so that although the rest were wanting, we should haue sufficient to saluation for the matter. To your reason I say farther, that the consequence is naught, if some certaine are sufficient to saluation, the rest are superfluous: for first it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be superfluous to haue any booke of Gods word kept for the vse of the Church, though the matter of it be in
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:21024:225"/>
some other. Secondly, if your consequence be good, it is also superfluous to haue the same psalme or story recorded in two places of the scripture, especially the later. But to say so were to condemne the holy ghost of hauing taken super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous paines to no purpose, which were blasphemie. I prooue it by these particulars; for example <note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 18. 2. Sam. 22.</note> Psal. 18. is in the booke of Psalmes, and in the second booke of <hi>Samuell.</hi> The history of <hi>Ezechiah</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">2 Reg 19. &amp; 20. &amp; Esai. 35. &amp; 37. &amp; 38.</note> is 2. Reg. 29. and so forward, and Isai 36. 37. 38. The like I might bring out of the bookes of Kings and Chronicles. Thirdly, though the matter be all fully and perfectly in certaine bookes, yet euery point is not so plaine in one booke as in another, and therefore it is not superfluous to haue all these bookes, though all matter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to saluation be comprised in some few of them. Fourthly, the purpose of the holy ghost in penning the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, was, not only to teach matters necessarie to saluation, but to set forth the glorie of God in his prouidence, iustice, mercie, wisdome, and such like, to afford vs examples of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kinds of vertues, to exhort vs to faith, and good works, and (in a word) to prouide for Gods glorie by vs heere, as well as for our glorifying by him in heauen, to which there is no booke, nor sentence of scripture, but serues more or lesse, and therefore no booke of it can be thought super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sluous, though the necessarie matters belonging to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be conteined in certaine of them very sufficiently.</p>

For if he had thought, that some bookes of Scripture had beene lost, hee would haue said; whatsoeuer was written and is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, was written for our learning and comfort. For
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:21024:225"/>
bookes that are lost serue neither for learning nor comfort. Againe, to hold that any bookes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should be lost, calls into question Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the fidelitie of the Church, who hath the bookes of God in keeping, and is therfore called the pillar and ground of truth. And touching the bookes before mentioned, I answere thus: The booke of the warres of God, Num. 21. 14. might bee some short bill or narration of thinges done among the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, which in the daies of <hi>Moses</hi> went from hand to hand. For sometime a booke in Scripture, signifieth <hi>a roule</hi> or <hi>Catalogue,</hi> as the first chapter of Matthew, which containeth the genealogie of our Sauiour Christ, is called <hi>the booke of the generation of Iesus Christ.</hi> Againe, the <hi>booke of the iust,</hi> and the books of Chronicles, which are said to be lost, were but as the Chronicles of England are with vs: euen politicke records of the acts and euents of things, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iuda and Israel: out of which the Prophets gathered things necessarie to be knowne, and placed them in holy Scripture. As for the bookes of <hi>Iddo, Ahiah, Semiah; Gad,</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> they are contained in the bookes of the Kinges and Chronicles and in the bookes of <hi>Samuel,</hi> which were not written by him alone, but by sundrie Prophets, 1. Chro. 29. 29. as also was the booke of Iudges. As for the bookes of <hi>Salomon</hi> which are lost, they did not concerne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and matters of saluation, but were concerning matters of Philosophie and such like things.

By these and like helps contained in Scripture, wee may iudge which is the truest meaning of any place.

Scripture it selfe is the text, and the best glosse. And the Scripture is falsly tearmed the matter of strife, it beeing not so of it selfe, but by the abuse of man.</p>
               <p>And thus much for our consent concerning Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, wherein we must not be wauering but stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, because notwithstanding our renouncing of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, yet Popish inclinations and dispositions bee rife among vs. Our common people maruelouslie affect humane traditions; yea mans nature is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more to bee pleased with them, then with the word of God. The feast of the natiuitie of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, is onely a custome and tradition of the Church, and yet men are commonly more carefull to keepe it then the Lords day, the keeping whereof stands by the morall law. Positiue lawes are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to restraine vs from buying and selling on the Sabbath; yet within the twelue daies no man keepes market. Againe, see the truth of this in our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ministerie of the word: let the Preacher al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the people count it but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon stuffe, such as any man can bring: but let men come and alleadge <hi>Ambrose, Austin,</hi> and the rest of the fathers; oh, he is the man, hee is alone for them. Againe, let any man bee in danger any way, and straight hee sendeth to the wise man or wizzard: Gods worde is not sufficient to comfort and direct him. All this argues that Poperie denied with the mouth, abides still in the heart: and therefore wee must learne to reuerence the written word, by ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing vnto it all manner of perfection.</p>

of their owne opinions: and so shall the word of God, ordained only to teach vs the truth, be abused and made an Instrument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme all errors. To auoid which inconuenience, considerate men haue recourse vnto the Traditions and auncient Records of the Primitiue Church, <note n="*" place="margin">Still you begge the question.</note> receiued from the Apostles, and deliuered to the posteritie, as the true copies of Gods word; see the true Exposition and sense of it, and thereby consute and reiect all priuate and new glosses, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not with those ancient and holy Commentaries: So that for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of both difficult and doubtfull texts of Scripture, Traditions are most necessary.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Perkins</hi> his answere is, that there is no such need of them, but in doubtfull places, the Scripture it selfe is the best glosse: If these be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued; first the analogie of faith, which is the summe of religion, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the cleerest places.

Therefore the Scripture containes not all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine necessarie to saluation.</hi> I denie the consequence: This rather prooues the sufficiencie of the Scripture, as being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in it selfe, if it be rightly vnderstood. Secondly, I say there is no such danger as you imagine: For though some may abuse it, to confirme error: yet may their false inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations be confuted, by diligent examination of the text, without resting vpon the authoritie of mans interpretation: as it appeares manifestly by the courses that the ancient writers tooke, for the confuting of all heresies. And if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this it could not haue been done, what should haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the truth, before the writings of men were extant in any number? For it were ridiculous to imagine, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular text was expounded by the Apostles, and so left by tradition to the Church. Thirdly, who shall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine when the time, to count ancientnes by, ended? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since euery mans writings were new when they were written, and cannot grow in truth, as they doe in age by continuance: we acknowledge them for helpes of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, not for warrants.</p>

Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, Yes, No saith <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> M. <hi>Perkins</hi> because that commeth not of Christ, but of themselues.

               <p>The question is not wherefore it is so called, but whether it be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or no truly: That which truly is, may be so called truly: But the Scripture truly is matter of great contention, euery obstinate Heretike vnderstanding them according to his owne fantasie, and therefore may truly be so tearmed, although it be not the cause of contention in it self, but written to take away all contention.</p>

               <p>The auncients that so wrot in this point of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> going to see <hi>Peter,</hi> haue wholie mistaken the Apostle, who denies that of himselfe which they affirme of him. For he saith, <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 1. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>First, that he was not an Apostle of men, nor by man.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he went vp to Ierusalem, not <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 2. 6. 7.</note> to haue confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his doctrine from them who were no way supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to him, but that the Gentiles might know he taught the same things that the other Apostles did. If he had done it for his owne assurance, he <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 26. 19.</note> had not beleeued the vision, and discredited our Sauiours extraordinarie teaching of him, and had taught for a time such things, as he was not sure to be the truth of God. But if this should be his case, he had sinned grieuously in his former preaching, and he had wholie ouerthrowne the authoritie of his ministrie, which in these two Chapters he labors especially to vphold, auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 2. 6. 7. 8. 9.</note> he neither learned any doctrine, nor receiued any allowance of his authoritie from <hi>Iames, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> which were esteemed to be pillers; yea <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 2. 11.</note> he did openly reprooue <hi>Peter,</hi> if not of error in doctrine, yet of misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in his conuersation.</p>
               <p>As for the controuersie of abrogating <hi>Moses</hi> law, it was a case determined by scripture, and no man might refuse to obey any one of the Apostles charge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that point. But that the Brethren might haue the better satisfaction, it pleased the holy ghost that the Apostles should in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell decide the question by <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 15. 6. 23.</note> ioynt consent of themselues, and the brethren there assembled, which any one of them might (of himselfe) haue ended. But because diuers parts of the Church were conuerted by diuers Apostles, and each Church made most account of their owne Apostle, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest and safest way was to conclude of the matter by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consultation: so afterward in all lawfull Councels the written word was held sufficient for the consutation of the heresies that arose from time to time: but for the better

stopping of the heretikes mouths, and satisfying of all men, sometimes the consent of former Diuines, Churches, and Councels was added, in good discretion for mens sake, not for the matter which might be and was abundantlie proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or discouered, as occasion serued, by the scriptures.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">speaker </seg>W. P.</label> Touching vowes this must bee knowne, that wee   do not condemne them altogether, but onely labour to restore the purity of doctrine touching this point: which by the Church of Rome from time to time hath beene corrupted and defaced. We hold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a vow is a promise made to God touching some duties to be performed vnto him: and it is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, generall, or speciall. The generall vow is that which concernes all beleeuers: and it is made in the couenant both of the law, and of the Gospell. I will here onely speake of the vow which is made in the couenant of the Gospell, in which there be two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: one of God, the other of man. God in mercy on his part promiseth to men the remission of sinnes and
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:21024:235"/>
life euerlasting: and man againe for his part promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to beleeue in Christ, and to obey God in all his commaundements. All men euer made this vow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, as the Iewes in circumcision: which also they renewed so often as they receiued the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: and in the newe Testament all that are baptized doe the like. And in baptisme this vow is called the stipulation of a good conscience whereby wee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to renounce our selues, to beleeue in Christ, and to bring forth the fruites of true repentance: and it ought to be renued so oft as wee are partakers of the supper of the Lord. This vowe is necessarie and must bee kept as a part of the true worship of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a promise, wherein wee vowe to performe all duties commaunded of God either in the law or in the Gospell. It may be demaunded, considering wee are bound to obedience, how wee binde our selues in baptisme thereto. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though we be alreadie bound partly by nature and partly by the written word, yet may wee renew the same bond in a vowe, and he that is bound may further binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so it be for this end, to helpe his dulnes for want of zeale, and to make himselfe more forward in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of loue to men and the worship of God: to this end <hi>Dauid</hi> sware to keepe the law of God. Psal. 119. 116. though he were bound vnto it by nature and by the written law it selfe.</p>
            <p>The speciall vowe is that, which doth not reach to the person of al beleeuers, but onely concernes some speciall men vpon some speciall occasions. And this kind of vow is twofold. The first, is the vow of a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial duty in the way of seruice to God: and it was
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:21024:235"/>
in practise in the Church of the Iewes vnder the old Testament: examples hereof are two especially, the first was the vowe of the Nazarites, whereto no kind of men were bound by Gods commaundement, but they bound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: God only prescribing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order of keeping the same with rites pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereto, as abstinence from wine, the not cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their haire, and such like. The second exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is of the Iewes, when of their owne accords, they vowed to giue God house or land, sheepe, or oxen, or any like things for the maintenance of the legall worship: and of this also God prescribeth certaine rules, Leuit. 27. Now these vowes were part of the Iewish pedagogie or ceremoniall law, wherein God trained vp the Iewes in the old testament: and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obserued of them they were parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: but now vnder the Gospell they are not: bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all abolished with the ceremoniall law, to which Christ put an ende at his death vpon the crosse. It is true <hi>Paul</hi> made a vowe, and since kept the same, in in the time of the new Testament. Act. 18. yet not as a part of Gods worship: but as a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent for the time, wherein he only condescended to the weakenes of the Iewes, that by this meanes he might bring them the better vnto Christ. And whereas Christ is called a Nazarite, Matth. 2. 23. we may not thinke he was of that very order, because he did not abstaine from wine: but he was so tearmed because hee was the veritie and accomplishment of this order. For by it was signified that Gods Church was a peculiar people seuered or chosen out of the world: and that Christ in respect of holines was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:21024:236"/>
separated from all sinners. And the words in Saint <hi>Matthew, he shall be called a Nazarite,</hi> are borrowed from the booke of Iudges, cap. 13. where they are properly spoken of <hi>Sampson,</hi> and in type or figure of Christ. For as <hi>Sampson</hi> saued <hi>Israel</hi> by his death, so did Christ saue his Church. And as <hi>Sampson</hi> killed his enemies more by death then by life, so did Christ. It is plaine therefore that this kind of vowe bindeth not vs: for there are no more ceremonies to bee kept vnder the Gospell for partes of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but the outwarde rites of Baptisme and the Lords Supper. Vovves concerning meates, and drinkes, attire, touching, tasting, times, place, daies, were proper to the Iewes.</p>
            <p>The second kinde of speciall vowe is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man promiseth freely to performe some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and bodily exercise, for some good ende: and this vow also (if it be made accordingly) is lawfull, and belongs both to the Church of the olde and new Testament. In the olde wee haue the example of the Rekabites, Ier. 35. who by the appointment of <hi>Ionadab</hi> their father abstained from strong drinke, and wine, from planting vineyardes and orchardes: whereby <hi>Ionadab</hi> intended onely to breake them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, and to acquaint them with their future condition and state, that they should be strangers in a forraine land; that so they might prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to indure hardnes in the time to come. And now in the new testament wee haue warrant in like manner to vowe: as if a man by drinking of wine or strong drinke, finde himselfe prone to drunkennes, he may vowe with himselfe to drinke no more wine
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:21024:236"/>
nor strong drinke for so long time, as hee feeles the drinking thereof will stirre vp his infirmitie, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister occasion of sinning. Of this kind also are the vowes in which we purpose and promise to God, to keepe set times of fasting, to taske our selues in prayer and reading of holy Scriptures, and to giue set almes for special causes knowne to our selues, and to doe sundrie like duties. And that wee be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in making such vowes, certaine rules must be remembred: I. that the vowe be agreeable to Gods will and word: for if it be otherwise, the making as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the keeping thereof is sinne. Vowes must not bee the bondes of iniquitie. II. It must so be made, that it may stand with Christian libertie. For wee may not make such things necessary in conscience, which God hath made free. Now Christian liberty allowes vnto vs the free vse of all thinges indifferent, so it be out of the case of offence. Hence it followes that vowes must be made and keept or not keept, so farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth as in conscience they may stand or not stande with our libertie purchased by Christ. III. The vowe must be made with consent of superiors, if we be vnder gouernment. Thus among the Iewes the vowe of a daughter might not stand vnlesse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Parents came thereunto. IV. It must bee in the power and abilitie of the maker thereof, to do or not to doe. A vowe made of a thing impossible, is no vowe. V. It must be agreeable to the calling of him that maketh it: that is, both to his generall calling as he is a Christian, and to that particular calling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he liueth. If it bee against either one or both, it is vnlawfull. VI. It must be made with deliberation. <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

no better things performed then God by his lawe hath bound vs to, else man could deuise better obedience, or more acceptable seruice to God then he himselfe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. If by better good, you meane be a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of obedience then is commonly performed, I doubt whether any man can do more then the law of God hath required of him, which is the rule of perfect obedience. If you vnderstand the meanes of stirring vp our selues to the doing of our dutie to God, Master <hi>Perkins</hi> acknowledgeth that, and compriseth it in the later part, though he do not expresse it. Secondly, you say, that <hi>it must proceede from our owne free choise and libertie.</hi> The promise doubtlesse must haue our owne will for the ground of it, and so much the word imports, but the good must be a dutie commanded, or at the least allowed by warrant out of the word of God in the scriptures, or out of the light of true reason, and the law of nature, or out of Reuelation before the scriptures.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What, is not your Holy-day seruice (which you call diuine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice) any part of Gods worship in your owne opinions? Can a publike assemblie instituted to honour God by prayer and thankesgiuing vvith externall ceremony of time, place, apparrell, kneeling, standing and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, be no part of Gods worship? In your irreligious Congregations, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together against Christ and his Catholike Church, be it so.

To deny that thankefulnes is vrged, is not to vnderstand the occasion of the Psalme, and the end of the exhortation, which requireth vowes, be they what they may be, but only in that respect. Master <hi>Perkins</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needed not any further proofe, then the text it selfe: but, for the better auowing of his exposition, he brought <note n="e" place="margin">Psalm. 56. 22</note> another place of the Psalmes, where vowes do signifie praise or thanksgiuing. Now whereas he saith, that <hi>Dauid</hi> expounds himselfe, and you refute that by the placing of the Psalmes, your answere is not sufficient. For any man may see, the Psalmes were not set in order, as they were penned in time; and if that 75. Psalme were a prophesie of <hi>Senacheribs</hi> ouerthrow, as I shewed <note n="f" place="margin">Theodoret. ad Psalm. 75.</note> 
                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> thinks, it might well be written before Psalme 56. But Master <hi>Perkins</hi> had no such meaning; onely he expounds the word <hi>Vowes,</hi> vsed in this place by the certaine sense of it in another, which course is agreeable to the rules of interpreting the scripture.</p>
               <p>But in the one you say <hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh of himselfe, in the other he speaketh to other. What then? is it not more then likely that he exhorts others to the duety he practised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? If in his owne person he meane by vowes praise, what else should be vnderstood by exhorting other men to vow, especially vpon the like occasion, that is, as you say af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, vpon hauing their prayers &amp; desires accomplished?</p>
               <p>Your collection, that <hi>Dauid</hi> should proue, that all consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate vowes are praises, and part of Gods worship, hath no likelyhood of truth in it. For the Prophet declares by that speech, that he had vowed to praise God, as the next verse
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:21024:241"/>

Marriage indeed is better in two respects: first, because God hath ordained it to bee a remedie of continencie to all such persons as cannot containe: secondly, because it is the semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:21024:246"/>
both of Church and Common-wealth; and it bringeth forth a <hi>seede of God</hi> for the inlarging of his kingdome. Yet single life in them that haue the gift of continencie, is in some respects to bee preferred. First, because it brings libertie in persequution. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1. Cor. 7. 26. <hi>I suppose it to be good for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent necessitie for a man so to bee.</hi> Secondly, because it frees men from the common cares, molestations, and distractions that bee in the familie, vers. 2. 28. <hi>Such shall haue trouble in the flesh, but I spare you.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because single parties doe commonly with more bodilie ease and libertie worship God: it beeing still presupposed, that they haue the gift of continencie. vers. 34. <hi>The vnmarried woman careth for the things of of the Lord, that shee may be holy both in bodie and spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, though wee mislike the vowe, yet wee hold and teach, that men or women being assured that they haue the gift of continencie, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly resolue and purpose with themselues to liue and lead a single life. 1. Cor. 7. 38. <hi>Hee that standeth firme in his owne heart that hee hath no neede, but hath power of his owne will, and hath so</hi> decreed in his heart <hi>that he will keepe his virginitie, he doth well.</hi> And wee imbrace the saying of <hi>Theodoret</hi> on 1. Tim. cap. 4. <hi>for he doth not</hi> (saith he) <hi>blame single life, or continencie, but he accuseth them that by</hi> law enacted compel <hi>men to follow these.</hi> And men made themselues chast for the kingdome of heauen, Matth. 19. 12. not by vowe, but by a purpose of heart, which is farre lesse then a vow, and may be changed vpon occasion, where as a vow cannot, vnlesse it doe euidently appeare to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>

Thirdly, for such persons as are able to containe, to liue single for the endes before named, indeede we hold it to bee no counsell of perfection; yet doe wee not denie it to bee a counsell of expedience, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I will go further then Master <hi>Perkins</hi> hath done, and not doubt to affirme, that it is simply better then virginitie: my reason is, that it belongs to the perfection of humaine nature, that there should be continuance and multiplying of the kind by propagation: beside, God appointed it as an especiall blessing for <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was in Gods especiall fauour But if that estate be worse then the single life, in which he liued before, God did not blesse, but punish him rather by that change: therefore marriage simply is better.

               <p>Those Christian Fathers dealt vnchristianly with <hi>Ioui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> who ascribed as much to virginitie as our Sauiour Christ, or his Apostles gaue to it in any place of Scripture, according to that conclusion of <note n="s" place="margin">Theodoret.

First I denie your antecedent, neither our Sauiour, nor his mother, nor his Apostles vowed virginitie; prooue it of any of them if you can. Indeede our Sauiour was neuer married, and all men may easily see it was no way fit he should be. His mother was, and therefore questionles neuer made any such vow of single life, though we beleeue that (as it was very fit it should be) she conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a virgin till her death. That some of the Apostles had wiues, it is apparant by scripture; that they kept them after their office vndertaken, it is more then likely, by <note n="u" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor. 9. 5.

And the first of these twaine must be performed in the second: and the second in and with the first. The end of mans life is, not onely to serue God by the duties of the first table, but by seruing of man in the duties of the second table to serue God.

               <p>The proposition is true, that it is displeasing to God for a man to seuer himselfe from all cares of the world, to serue him in contemplation, without respect of any dutie to his brethren.

And if by their Fasting, Watching, and such like afflictions of their bodies, they do partly satisfie for our superfluous pampering of the flesh, and teach vs by their good example to bridle and correct it: doe they not deserue at our hands bodily sustenance? And who better performes all duties of the second Table than they, being most obedient to all their Superiours, and not hurting their neighbour in life, persons, or any manner of their goods? And so in their seuerall callings offend no honest men, and doe much good both vnto the Church and common-wealth.</p>

W.</label> It is no lawfull calling, nor agreeable to the will of God, that any man should liue in the Church without any charge,   or meanes to profit the Church by. Fasting and praying are both lawfull and acceptable; but they are generall duties of all Christians, and may not therefore be made proper callings of certaine men. For callings differ, as other things, by their speciall forme; but their praying and fasting is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers from the same exercise practised by other Christians, onely in quantitie more or lesse. The seruices these men doe beside, are meerely voluntarie, and not lying vpon them by any dutie of their calling: which is onely I know not what stinted deuotion, after the lawes of each seuerall order of Monkes, Friers, Nunnes, and such like.</p>
               <p>They no way deserue their sustenance, since they haue
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:21024:251"/>
vowed to take no course whereby they may prouide for it. Their prayers do no good, no not so much as to themselues, being made with a proud opinion, to merit, by a conceited perfection. A poore husbandman, that labours all the week for his liuing, and vseth the best meanes he can to grow in knowledge and obedience to God, may looke for a greater blessing from God, vpon his bodily and spirituall labours, by his owne poore prayers, and the supplications of the Congregation in which he liueth, than by all the fasting and praying of the holiest Couent, Abbey, or Nunnerie in the countrie.</p>
               <p>As for their satisfactions, they are like a broken reede, which will not onely faile him that trusts to it, but hurt him also. I haue shewed, that we neede no other satisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered by our Sauiour Christs sufferings: and there are few or none, except perhaps the begging Friers, that had not more neede to satisfie for their owne idlenesse and gluttonie, than ordinarily any other kinde of men whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; if wee may beleeue either the reports of trauellers, or the records of your owne histories.</p>
               <p>Can they be said to be obedient to their Superiours, that in the very making of their vow oftentimes, wilfully diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their fathers and mothers? Or may they be thought to hurt none, who liue idle vpon the sweate of other mens browes? and are onely a charge to the state, whereof they are vnprofitable members? But not to hurt, is a kindnes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to be commended in theeues: what due praise it can haue in a state of perfection, for my part I cannot see.

For then the second table giues place to the duties of the first. Mark. 10. 29. II. That, for the time of persecution, men may withdraw themselues (iust occasion offered) and goe apart to wildernesses or like places, Hebr. 11. 37. yet for the time of peace I see no cause of solitarie life.

This ouerthrowes no peece of any argument Master <hi>Perkins</hi> brought before.</p>

blame Master <hi>Perkins</hi> for saying nothing in defence of your Popish partie? For if all you offer to prooue were granted you, all were nothing to the purpose. Say it bee gratefull to God to sell all and giue it to the poore: doth it follow hereupon, that therefore it is lawfull to vow wilfull pouertie, as a state of perfection? I trow not. But that is the question betwixt vs.</p>
               <p>You might haue done well to omit it indeede, being so little to the matter. For what kinde of conclusion call you this? Our Sauiour would not haue any poore cottage of his owne: Therefore pouertie may be vowed as a state of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: or therefore it is greater perfection to haue no house, than to haue one. Our Sauiour being to trauell from place to place, both for the preaching of the Gospell, and his owne safetie, thought it not conuenient to haue any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dwelling place: yet your Monkes, Friers and Nunnes haue, and those the pleasantest and richest for the soile and ayre, that can be found in the whole countries where they are. But what did our Sauiour sell, that he might thereby fall into wilfull pouertie?</p>
               <p>His example helps you not: let vs see his doctrine, <hi>he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth a yong man,</hi> you say, <hi>whom he loued, that if he would be perfect, he should sell all he had and giue it to the poore, and follow him, and then he should haue treasure in heauen.</hi> First for our Sauiours louing him, which yet <note n="n" place="margin">Matth. 19. 21</note> 
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> records not, but <note n="o" place="margin">Marc. 10. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Marke,</hi> who leaues out that clause of being perfect, it is more then plaine, that this cannot be vnderstood of any speciall loue. For neither did the man beleeue in him, as the Messiah, and he was falsely conceited of his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, than which nothing is a greater hinderance to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and therefore nothing lesse beloued by our Sauiour Christ. This loue therefore signifies not an approbation of his vaine brag, or a desire of making him perfit, but either a pittying of his conceit, or some kind gesture vsed towards him: which later signification especially both the <note n="p" place="margin">See <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nius on <hi>Marc.</hi> 10. 21.</note> Greeke and Syriake words will well admit. Secondly I answere, that our Sauiour doth not intend to shew him how he may
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:21024:254"/>
be perfect, but by vrging him to sell that he had, meanes to discouer his want of loue to God, and his neighbour. That he meant not to perswade him to any perfection, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. First, because no man, without true faith, which this Iusticiary wanted, can come any thing neere to perfection. Secondly, for that a man may <note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 13, 2.</note> sell all that he hath, &amp;c. and yet not be perfect. For single life, in your account, is a matter of no small perfection. But our Sauiour would make his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in the opinion of his owne righteousnes, apparant to him and other, as it fell out indeed. For refusing to obey him in that matter, he bewrayed his couetousnes, which he preferd before following our Sauiour, whom he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be a worthie teacher, and before the loue of his brethren. Lastly I say, the chiefe point of perfection here mentioned is not selling of our goods, but following of Christ, which is a dutie <note n="r" place="margin">Luc. 9. 23.</note> belonging to all Christians, so that without it no man is a Christian. <hi>In the following of Christ by the works of charity</hi> (saith your <note n="s" place="margin">Lyra ad Matth. 19. 21.</note> glosse) <hi>perfection consists principally in wilfull pouertie, but as in the beginning, by way of renouncing that which hinders, and disposing of vs, because by it the care of temporall things is taken away, which hinders the soule from the loue of God, and the soule is fitted to free contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of God. To sell all and giue to the poore sufficeth not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> (saith <note n="t" place="margin">Libr. 3. ad Matth. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Ierome) vnlesse after the despising of riches we follow Christ, that is, leauing euill do good.</hi> And after, <hi>Many leaue riches, but not follow our Lord. He followes our Lord who doth imitate him, and treads in his steps.</hi> And againe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Because it sufficeth not to leaue, he addes that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and haue followed me.</hi> So that this is no state of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but rather a remedie against our being drawen away from following Christ, which was as necessary to saluation both before and vnder the law, as it is now in this light of the Gospell: and if without wilfull pouerty it cannot be done, doubtles neither those worthies of the former ages, <hi>Abraham, Moses, Dauid, &amp;c.</hi> could follow Christ in duties of charitie, and we not only may, but must sell all we haue, that we may follow him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="519" facs="tcp:21024:254"/>
It was spoken and intended only to that yong man; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Peter</hi> say that the Apostles had sold all, and giuen it to the poore, which is no where recorded of them in the scriptures, but that they had forsaken all and followed him, that is, had left their ordinarie callings (by which in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood they might haue thriuen) to attend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Sauiour, and to be employed in his seruice. And to the following of Christ either only or specially doth that of <hi>Ierome</hi> belong. <hi>Peter speakes confidently</hi> (saith <note n="u" place="margin">Libr. 3. ad Matth. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Ierome) we haue left all. And because it is not sufficient only to leaue, he addes that, which is perfect, And haue followed thee, we haue done that</hi>

Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that <hi>it was in his choyce before he sold it, whether he would sell it or no, and that after he had sold it, it was in his owne power, viz. to giue all, or halfe of it as he thought good.</hi> The lye he made was to say that he had brought in all the money he sold it for, whereas he kept back part.</p>
               <p>I haue stood the longer vpon this argument, because you bring no more but this, and thinke this vnanswerable. Therefore also beside your custome you draw it into a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme now at the last.

                     <item>That (say you) which is commaunded by our Sauiours owne example and doctrine, and was practised by the Apostles, and most holy Christians, that may be vowed very laudably:</item>

               </p>
               <p>I denie your proposition, because some things haue bin commended and practised by our Sauiour, his Apostles, and other holy Christians, of which a man may not make a vow. For example, both he and they haue commended, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red persecution for the Gospell: yet doth it not follow that therefore a man may wilfully by a vow bring persecution vpon himselfe, as by the vow of pouertie you cast your selues into a state of beggery.</p>
               <p>Your assumption also is false. Neither our Sauiour, his Apostles, nor other holy Christians (I speake of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples you bring out of the Acts) haue practised any such matter, as in my former answers it hath appeared.

For though we should graunt that vowes of selling all and giuing it to the poore may laudably be made (which is false) yet is it not proued, that a man may vow wilfull pouertie, and refuse to possesse any worldly goods.

               <hi>Conclus. I.</hi> We acknowledge the ciuill vse of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges   as freely and truely as the church of Rome doth. By <hi>ciuill vse</hi> I vnderstand, that vse which is made of them in the common societies of men, out of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed places of the solemne worship of God. And this to be lawfull, it appeareth because the artes of painting and grauing are the ordinance of God: and to be skilfull in them is the gift of God, as the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Bozaleel,</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> declare, Exod. 35. 30. This vse of Images may bee in sundrie thinges. I. In the adorning and setting forth of buildings; thus <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
               <pb n="525" facs="tcp:21024:256"/>
beautified his throne with the image of lions. And the Lord commaunded his temple to bee ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the images of palme trees, of pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, of bulles, cherubes, and such like. II. It serues for the distinction of coynes: according to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Emperours and princes of all nations. When Christ was asked, Matth. 22. whether it was lawful to giue tribute to <hi>Cesar</hi> or no? he called for a penny and said, <hi>whose Image or superscription is this?</hi> they said, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars:</hi> he then said, <hi>giue to Cesar the things that are Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars:</hi> not condemning but approuing the stampe or image vpon his coyne. And though the Iewes were forbidden to make images in way of representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or worship of the true God: yet the Sycle of the sanctuarie, which they vsed, specially after the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> was stamped with the image of the Almon tree, and the potte of Manna. III. Images serue to keepe in memorie friendes deceased whom we reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And it is like, that hence came one occasion of the images that are now in vse in the Roman church. For in the daies after the Apostles men vsed priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keepe the pictures of their friendes departed: and this practise after crept into the open congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and at last, superstition getting heade, images began to be worshipped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus. II.</hi> We hold the historicall vse of images to be good and lawfull: and that is, to represent to the eye the actes of histories, whether they bee hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, or diuine: and thus we thinke the histories of the Bible may be painted in priuate places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus. III.</hi> In one case it is lawfull to make an image to testifie the presence or the effects of the
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:21024:257"/>
Maiestie of God, namely when God himselfe giues any speciall commaundement so to doe. In this case <hi>Moses</hi> made and erected a brasen serpent, to bee a type, signe, or image to represent Christ crucified. Ioh. 3. 14. And the Cherubs ouer the mercie seat serued to represent the Maiestie of God, to whom the Angels are subiect. And in the second comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement it is not simply said, Thou shalt not make a grauen image: but with limitation, Thou shalt not make <hi>to thy selfe,</hi> that is, on thine owne head, vpon thine owne will and pleasure.</p>

adding, that it is against the ancient writers; and yet hee might haue said so well enough, for all <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi> For they two are but a few of many, and by their other writings ouerthrow that distinction betwixt Image and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll. To make the case plaine, we must vnderstand, that they call an Image the resemblance of any thing that hath a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in nature. For example, if you carue, graue, paint, or cast the forme of a man, horse, tree, plant, fowle, fish, Sun, Moon, Star, or any such like thing, you make an Image: but if you make a monster, as a man halfe flesh, half fish, like our Mair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides; or a beast compounded of diuers parts of sundrie creatures; for example, the head of a man, the bodie of a horse, the feete of a lion, &amp;c. or in a word, as the common opinion is of Gryphins, which are said to haue the forepart like an Eagle, and the hinder part like a Lion; that is an Idol: because in truth there is no such creature in the world. By this it is manifest, that no shape of a man, by their doctrine, can be an Idoll. For that shape hath some thing like it in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yet <note n="i" place="margin">Origen. lib. 1. in cap. 1. ad Rom.</note> 
                  <hi>Origen</hi> doubts not, with the Apostle, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them of Idolatrie, who worshipped God in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of an Image of a corruptible man, of fowles, foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed beasts, and creeping things.

                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> grounds his interpretation vpon the words of the commandement mistaken, but he meddles not so much as by any signification with that place of the Apostle. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede <hi>Origen</hi> hath it, but not in your sense, as appeareth by your exposition, which agrees not with <hi>Origen</hi> nor <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> about the difference betwixt an Image and an Idoll. For you comming neerer to the <note n="m" place="margin">1.

But they vpon whom you would build your distinction, make an Idoll such a shape as hath no substance answering to it in

nature. And therefore they denie that the image of a man is an Idoll, though it be worshipped, as I shewed before: you make it an Idoll, be it of what shape it will, if it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent such a thing to be God, as is nothing lesse. <hi>He makes an Idoll</hi> (saith <hi>Origen) who (according to the Apostle that saith an Idoll is nothing) makes that which is not.</hi> Marke you what <hi>Origen</hi> saith? <hi>That which is not;</hi> you say, <hi>that which is not God.</hi> But he proceedes. <hi>What is that</hi> (saith he) <hi>which is not? a shape which the eye hath not seene, but the mind faines to it selfe.

               <p>If you speake of that reason, which moued God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire <hi>Moses</hi> for the writing of that storie, we grant that hee might to the same end haue also enioyned the painting or engrauing of it.

For my part (sauing other mens better iudgement) I perswade my selfe, that God, who commanded the Israelites to write the words of the law about their houses, and in other places for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and remembrance, would haue enioyned the painting of his especiall miracles and workes in their fauour, if he had not seene it to bee dangerous, in respect of Idolatrie that might ensue. For questionlesse, a picture or an Image is of great force, chiefly if the word be added for exposition of it; as we see in Emblems and Impresas. But this helpe, in the most wise iudgement of God, was not thought so much worth, that for it the danger of Idolatrie, to which all men are so prone by nature, should be aduentured. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must not be led in this case by the shew of humane reason, but assure our selues it was not for nothing, that God, when he taught the Iewes by signes and shadowes, appointed not the vse of painting diuine histories, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, memorie, or deuotion.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">speaker </seg>A. W.</label> Now to your Enthymem. <hi>In Salomons temple there were Cherubins within the holy of Holyes, and without vpon the walls and dores. Therefore all holy pictures may be placed in Churches.</hi> First concerning your Antecedent, it must be remembred, that those Cherubins were not in the vtter court, where the people vsed to come and pray, but in the holy place where the Altar of Incense stood, and where <note n="n" place="margin">Luke 1. 9. 10 Leuit. 16. 17.</note> none came but the Priests, and in the holie of holies, into <note n="o" place="margin">Exod 30. 20 Leuit. 16. 2. Heb. 9. 7.</note> which the high Priest only might enter, and that but once a yeare, where the Ark was. So that these images were remoued out of the peoples sight, and that by <hi>Salomons</hi> propheticall wisdome. Secondly there was no vse of these images to any purpose of religion, but they serued only for ornament and state, as the other worke of the temple did, except the two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins vpon the mercy seate. Ere I answere to your conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:21024:271"/>
I may not forget to note, that in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent or conclusion you call Images <hi>holy,</hi> as if by I know not what holynes, they had some right to be placed in Churches, as also you speake afterward, <hi>where should holy pictures of holy men be more properly bestowed then in holy places?</hi> Nothing is to be counted holy, but that which either hath a qualitie of holines in it, as all that are sanctified haue, or else is belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the seruice of God. And whatsoeuer is of this later kind is rather hallowed then holy, and hath no holines in it, but by being consecrated to such a vse. Neither is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, as that of the Ceremoniall lawe was, whereby a thing was made indeed holy ceremonially, as nothing with vs can be, the ceremonies being abrogated. So that such things are no longer nor farther holy, then they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that seruice; and therefore the water with which we baptise, and the bread and wine with which we cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Supper of the Lord, after those actions are past, are no more holy then any other matter, bread, or wine. Images therefore can no way be holy more then any other worke in Churches: therfore setting apart this bare title of holines, I denie the consequence of your Enthymem: <hi>Salomon ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the inner parts of the Temple where the people came not with pictures of Cherubins, Therefore it is lawfull to set vp ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Churches where the people ordinarily come.</hi> Who seeth not great difference betweene the Antecedent and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent? To omit that which I answered before on Master <hi>Perkins</hi> behalfe, concerning <hi>Salomons</hi> warrant for his so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his father and himselfe being Prophets.</p>

The first is out of the   Councell of <hi>Eliberis cap.</hi> 36. which commandeth, that nothing should be painted on the walles of the Church, that was adored of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That if the Councell speake of the Image of God (in vvhich sense. M. <hi>Perkins</hi> citeth it, and the word <hi>(adored)</hi> doth insinuate) then
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:21024:273"/>
it may be said, that the Councill inhibiteth that sort of Gods Images, vvhich are made to expresse the diuine nature. If it be extended vnto all sorts of Images: I answere, that they were then forbidden to be drawen vpon the Church vvalles, but not to be set in Tables vpon the Altar, or in any other place. The reason is, because that Councell vvas holden in time of persecution, as appeareth by the twenty fiue Canon of it: and then, if the persecutor had found out the place of their assembly, as they often did: those Pictures must needs either haue been defaced by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or left vnto the derision and despight of the Heathens; And Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures also painted vpon such poore walles as they had then to their Churches, vvould either by the moysture of the vvalles, or other incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, haue bin quickly disfigured: wherefore, to the greater honor of such sacred things, those graue Fathers thought it not meete to haue them dravven vpon the Church vvalles, there being many more meete places for them in the Churches.</p>
               <p>

Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. cap. 36.</note> come backe now to those two allegations, which   should, and might haue been answered as fitly in their due place. Your first answere hath no shew of reason in it. For it is absurd to imagine, that any Christians, to whom onely the Councill speakes, would thinke the diuine nature, which is spirituall and infinite, could be exprest by any picture. But if it be possible for the people to be so blind, yet the Bishops and Ministers, who had the charge of such places, must needs know it to bee vnlawfull, and vnpossible. Besides, if they meant to forbid such Images onely, why doe they not call them Idols after your distinction? why doe not they expresse their meaning more plainly, but speake so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, to make all Images thought vnlawfull?</p>
               <p>As the word <hi>(Adored)</hi> was (in your opinion) a warrant for Master <hi>Perkins</hi> to applie that Canon to the Images of God; so by the same reason is the other word <hi>(worshipped)</hi> which the Councill hath, a sufficient authoritie to stretch the decree to all Images that may bee worshipped. Your coniectures are meere shifts, refuted by the very words of the Councill. <hi>It is decreed</hi> (saith the Councill) <hi>that there may be no Images in the Church:</hi> what will become then of your Images vpon Altars, vnlesse you will remoue your Altars out of the Church? That which followeth, doth not respect the walles, more than any other part of the Church; but names them specially, vpon which Images most commonly were
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:21024:273"/>
painted. But what a toy is it, that you talke of persecutors finding out the place of their assemblie, when they could hold a Councill, and had Churches to repaire to? Could their Churches be vnknowne? Further, if their care had bin to prouide, that the moysture of the walles might not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure the Images, they would haue said plainly, <hi>We will haue no Images on Church walles, least that which is adored and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, come to some disgrace:</hi> and this would also haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the other reason of the persecutors despight. But it is manifest, that the meaning of the decree is this, that they will not suffer any Images in Churches, because that which is worshipped and adored, may not bee resembled by pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. The decree indeede speakes onely of the Images of God, to whom only religious adoration and worship is due, and may lawfully be performed.</p>

Our principall ground is the second commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which containeth two partes: the first, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the making of Images to resemble the true God, the second forbids the worshipping of them,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:21024:275"/>

               <p>M. <hi>Perkins</hi> holds the contrarie: and his principall ground is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commandement; vvhich containes, saith he, tvvo parts. The first, forbids the making of Images to resemble God; the second, the vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of them or God in them, in these vvords: <hi>Thou shalt not bovv dovvne to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If it be only forbidden to make the Image of God, and to adore it: then the making and worshipping of the Image of Christ, or of any other creature, is not there prohibited: And so this second commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more than thrise alleadged, vvill not serue the turne against any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Image but God only. And in plaine reason, according also to Master <hi>Perkins</hi> his ovvne confession, the Commandements of the first Table, touch only our duty tovvards God, that vve giue him all his due honor, and do not giue any part therof vnto any thing else whatsoeuer: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diuine and godly worship is only there spoken of, and not such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as we giue vnto any creature, or to the picture of it: and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is nothing there against the vvorshipping of our holy Images.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">speaker </seg>A. W.</label> It is not onely forbidden to make the Image of God, and   to worship it, but (as Master <hi>Perkins</hi> said before) to make an Image of any thing in the way of Religion, to worship God, much more to worship the creature thereby. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Assumption, that should be added to that proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours, <hi>if it be only forbidden, &amp;c.</hi> namely; <hi>but it is only forbidden to make the image of God, and to adore it,</hi> is false, and so the second Commandement is against all Images for Gods seruice.</p>
               <p>The Commandements of the first table touch onely our dutie to God. True; and it is an especial part of our dutie to him, that we giue no religious honour to any thing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, but to him onely. For as Religion is a dutie of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Creator, and not any bond betwixt creature and creature: so is religious honour due onely to him, to whom religion is appropriated. Therefore the Heathen were neuer so sottish, as to worship any man or thing with religious worship, whereto they did not first ascribe some kinde of
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:21024:275"/>
diuinitie, according to which they proportioned their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thereto.</p>

Another honor by infinit degrees inferiour, yet abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in itself, is ascribed vnto Angels, and men as creatures endued with reason, and made after the likenesse of God; and to exhibitth is to whom it is due, is ciuilitie and not Idolatrie. This honor may be diuided into two parts, because these creatures are like to God, asvvell in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall povvers and qualities, as in their supernaturall: And that honour vvhich is giuen to man or Angell (in respect of any naturall quality, may be called morall or ciuil; But that vvhich is attributed vnto them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their supernaturall gifts may vvell be called religious and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, because it is due vnto them only for their spirituall and religious qualities.</p>
               <p>There is a third kind of worship, yet meaner then the other; which is a kind of dependant and respectiue worship; as vvhen a seruant is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured or cherished, not for his ovvne, but for his masters sake.

And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer <hi>Epicurus</hi> denying the prouidence of God, and his gouerning of the world, thought to auoide some blame in allowing worship to the Gods, as you do, in regard of their excellent and blessed nature; yet neither was that accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:21024:276"/>
sufficient by the statesmen or learned, and in truth it procures generally rather a reuerend opinion, than any true worship. Lastly, I pray you remember, that the worship, which afterward you diuide into ciuill and religious, is here in the generall nature made ciuill, yea euen that to Angels.</p>
               <p>That which the creatures lacke in waight, it seemes you will make vp by number. <hi>They may not haue</hi> (say you) <hi>the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne worship due to God.</hi> But to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amends, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them two kinds of worship: <hi>ciuill, in regard of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall resemblance of God, and religious, in respect of their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall likenesse to him.</hi> Whereas God, hauing nothing in him supernaturall, must haue but one of the two only, and that as it may seeme by proportioning the worship to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not Ciuil, but Religious. For why should God haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious honor for those properties, aboue all degrees, and creatures for the same, haue but ciuill in their degrees? since in your iudgment they are capable of that honor also, which is religious? Besides, is this difference of honor in respect of the gifts, or of the manner of giuing? if the latter, it is God, who must then haue this diuers worship, according to his diuers manner of working, and not man in whom he workes. So shall ciuill honor belong to God for the natural gifts he bestoweth vpon men. If you regard the excellencie of the gifts, why shuld they not be accounted of proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in the Image, which is man, as they are in the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and patterne, which is God? But in him those properties, the resemblance wherof you call naturall in man, are of as great excellencie as the other, which in man you tearme superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; yea, which is more; though in God, his nature and his properties be all one, yet in man the naturall qualities are the more principall, &amp; the other as it were but adiuncts therunto. The natural parts of the soule, that I may so speak, are the vnderstanding and the wil; all gifts and graces what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, are but qualities belonging to these two, which are the verie substance of the soule. Further, there is no reason why any religious worship should be performed to man, by reason of these qualities, because none was due to him
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:21024:276"/>
before his fall, when he had these: else should <hi>Adam</hi> haue bin worshipped by <hi>Eue,</hi> with religious worship, and she by him; For each of them had the Image of God, according to the nature of such creatures, entire and perfect; and if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue your Popish doctrine, they had those qualities by an especiall grace of God aboue nature. Moreouer what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can you giue, why Angels shuld not performe religious worship to the Saints departed, and both they and the same Saints to those men liuing here on the earth, who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued those supernatural qualities from God, for which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship is due to them, on whom they are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Therfore this distinction of religious and ciuill worship, is a meere deuise, without any ground of true reason; and all religious worship is due to God, ciuill worshippe only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to men.</p>
               <p>That respectiue worship is no other but ciuill; as it may easily appeare, because it may be, and must be giuen euen to profane and reprobat men, if any such be imployed by God in gouernment ouer vs. For howsoeuer the outward manner of the honor we giue to Princes, and Magistrates, depends vpon the Lawes and Customes of the Countries, wherin we liue; yet the duty of honoring them, lies vpon vs in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be performed, because they are Gods Lieutenants and Stewards.</p>
               <p>This worship if you accounted it ciuill, you might giue to whom you thought good, and should not be condemned of vs for Idolatry, but for follie, though you gaue it to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Yet such follie, as the Gentiles are not guiltie of, who neuer vsed such reuerence to the statues of any famous men, but where first they had an opinion of some diuine nature.</p>
               <p>I maruell how you could perswade your selfe to write so vntruly, that the honor you giue to Images, is meaner then the former; and that you would craftilie deceiue the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as if taking off your hat, and bowing your knee were al the honor you giue them.

               <p>In your answere, first you graunt, that <note n="g" place="margin">Tho. 3. q. 25. art. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> saith, <hi>We must worship the crosse of Christ with diuine worship.</hi> Therefore you graunt as much as Master <hi>Perkins</hi> affirmes, and thereby prooue that to be false, which before you deliuered, <hi>that the worship you giue to Images, is very small:</hi> for you worship some of them by your owne confession, with diuine worship. It appeareth also by this answere, that your Images are not only to stirre vp deuotion &amp;c. but to be worshipt too. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I would faine know how this doctrine of <hi>Thomas</hi> can agree with that of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who will haue the honor to rest in the Image, and not to be only accidentall, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper? Thirdly, this distinction doth in no sort satisfie vs, who denie that an Image may be worshipped in any respect whatsoeuer. To the proofe out of <note n="h" place="margin">Arist. de memor. &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minise.</note> 
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> I answer more particularly, that <hi>Thomas</hi> presupposeth that which we deny,
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:21024:279"/>
that it is lawfull to haue such an Image to such purposes. Besides, if all he say be graunted him, he doth not prooue that it is lawfull to intend worship to the Image, but that the worship performed to the partie whose Image it is, by occasion of the Image, is also giuen to the Image, though to the one principally, to the other but accidentally. Lastly to the similitude I say, it is not true that he which doth his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the king doth worship his purple garment, because it is no part of him; neither should he that had worshipt Christ hanging on the Crosse at the time of his passion, haue worshipped the Crosse together with Christ, no more then he that worships the king being on horseback, worships the horse on which he rides. Indeede he that worships Christ, worships him God and man (though the worship be done to him only in respect of his Godhead) but the reason is, that Chrst is as well man as God. There is no such coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt the Image, and the partie whose image it is, and therefore for our purpose it sufficeth to know, that how small honor soeuer he or you assigne to the Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, if it be religious it is Idolatrous, if ciuill, ridiculous.</p>
               <p>But what should I spend time in refuting this distinction of <hi>Thomas,</hi> when as one of your owne Schoolemen hath done it <note n="i" place="margin">Anno 1350.</note> long ago: our Countreyman <note n="k" place="margin">Robert.

                  <hi>Holcot</hi> hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the question, whether it be lawfull for Christians to adore any Images, and hauing proued it vnlawfull, as by other reasons, so by the second Commaundement, obiects against himselfe out of <hi>Thomas</hi> in this sort. <hi>To this question</hi> (saith he) <hi>Thomas answereth, That an Image may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two waies, either as it is an Image, and so no honor is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as none is due to wood or stone: otherwise it may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as there is the same motion to the Image, and to that, whose Image it is, and so the same honor is due to the Image, and to him, whose Image it is. But against this answere</hi> (saith <hi>Holcot) I obiect, first thus, Diuine honor is due to God only, But no Image is God, Therefore such honor is due to no Image. Therefore it implies a contradiction, to say, that diuine honor is due to God only, and yet that it is due to the Image of Christ, and to Christ.
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:21024:280"/>
Beside, if the same honour be due to the image of Christ, and to Christ, the same honor is due also to a stone and to Christ, and by consequence, the same honour is due to Christ, and to a creature, which is not to be beleeued. Againe, he that worships any thing with diuine honour, confesseth it to be God. Therefore if any man might lawfully giue diuine honor to the image of Christ, he might lawfully protest, and confesse something that is not God, to be God. Therefore</hi> (saith <hi>Holcot</hi> in his conclusion) <hi>It may otherwise be said. That no adoration is due to an Image, and that it is not lawfull to adore any Image. For true adoration is in spirit and deuotion, and in the highest degree of loue; and this we may not direct to any creature.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">speaker </seg>A. W.</label> Your first reason to prooue the worshipping of Images   is this:
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>If the Arke were to be worshipped, because it represented Gods footstoole; much more may the Image be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.</item>
                     <item>But the Arke was therefore to be worshipped:</item>
                     <item>Therefore much more may the Image be worshipped.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I denie your whole Antecedent: first the consequence of your proposition: For it doth not follow, that we may worship Images deuised by men to represent God, because we may worship the Arke, where God himselfe promised his presence, and which he did appoint as an assurance of his presence. If you can shew vs the like promise to your Images, you say somewhat; else nothing.</p>
               <p>Your Assumption also is false; The Arke was not to be worshipped. To your proofe Master <hi>Perkins</hi> answers truly,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:21024:281"/>
that the Psalme doth not commaund worshipping of the Arke, but worship before the Arke. You replie first, that therefore it is lawfull to kneele before Images. I answere, your consequence is false, because your Images are your owne wicked deuices, and haue no promise of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: therefore it is senselesnes to kneele before them, not madnes to crie out against such follie.</p>
               <p>Your second replie is, that the Hebrew phrase carrieth it, that we must kneele to the Arke, as the skilfull in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage know. First remember, that these are Authors in the ayre, as you answered about that place of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, that they that are skilfull say otherwise.

               <p>I deny your whole Antecedent; and first the consequence of your proposition. Because although we should grant that some place were holy, because of the presence of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; yet would it not follow that therfore Images are holy, where there is no presence of an Angell. For all your conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating and coniuring of Images cannot make any Angel, or Saint to afford his presence in them. Your assumption is false. There is no holines in places, because of the presence of Angels; as may appeare by the Scriptures, where their apparitions are described, no action of reuerence at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed to the places of their presence. In particular to your proofe M. <hi>Perkins</hi> answereth, that this was done, not
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:21024:283"/>
because the place where Angels appeare is holy, but vpon an especiall commandement of God, to strike <hi>Moses</hi> with a reuerence of Gods Maiestie, who was there present.</p>
               <p>You reply, first that God was not present there, but an Angell; I answere that God was there present, as it is plaine, because the Angell was <hi>lehouah.</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Exod 3. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>And lehouah saw that he turned to see. And</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Vers. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>lehouah said.</hi> Yea the whole discourse sheweth, that God himselfe was the Angell, namely the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person in Trinitie, who is called <note n="i" place="margin">Malac. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the Angell of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenant,</hi> because he was sent for the saluation of Gods elect. So <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 7. 31. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Stephen</hi> though he call him an Angell, calleth him asse the Lord. And indeed who but God could say, <hi>I am that I am,</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 3. 14.</note> as the Angell there doth?</p>
               <p>Secondly, you say <hi>the Answere rather confirmes than solues the Argument: Because as that astion strucke Moses with a reuerence of the Angell, so holy Pictures duly reuerenced, strike men with a religious regard of the Saint represented.</hi> What is this but to beg the question? you take it as graunted, that there may be Images, and that religious reuerence may be giuen to them: but these are the verie doubts, we dispute of. Inded if it were true, that there may be such Images, and that religious honour is to be yeelded to creatures, there were somewhat in your Similitude to the purpose: and yet similitudes doe not proue but illustrate. The sorce of your reason is, <hi>that Moses was commanded by god to put off his shoes, that he might be striken thereby with reuerence of God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must worship Images, that we may be striken with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Angels and Saints.</hi> The consequence is naught. Gods particular charge to <hi>Moses</hi> at that time, warranteth not men to enioyne worship to Images, that Angels may be worshipped by them.</p>

First, he saith, that it is vnlawfull to worship God, in, by, or at an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, those are his words in this very place. Secondly, do you only hold those Images more reuerend then other? Do you not giue them diuine honour, euen the same honor that is due to God himselfe, though accidentally, as you hold against <hi>Bellarmine?</hi> Is not <hi>Thomas</hi> his reason for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the Image and Crosse of Christ with diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as strong for the image of God the Father, and of God the holy ghost? But what should I goe about to prooue so plaine a matter. I would your being ashamed to defend so grosse Idolatry, would make you forsake it. Do you not graunt that you worship God in these Images, though, as you say here, not directly? How do you then agree with Master <hi>Perkins,</hi> who deliuers his meaning plainely, that in such images God may not be at all worshipped, no not by them, nor at them? and yet for very shame you would not be thought to speake against so manifest a truth, though without shame you make shew of agreement where there is none, and against all equall dealing accuse Master <hi>Perkins</hi> of seeming to take the matter otherwise then he deliuers it.</p>
               <p>By person you meane one property of God common to all three persons, or else the nature of the Godhead. But I pray you tell me, by what warrant of scripture you paint God the Father like this old man in <hi>Daniell,</hi> if you do it not by the authoritie of this place. If it be the end of this picture to signifie Gods eternitie, surely he that appropriates this image to the Father, makes the Father only eternall. This is that more perfect conceipt of God that you come to by this image, namely, to denie the Eternitie, and so the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost. Further, giue me
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:21024:286"/>
leaue to vnderstand you if I can. What can you possibly know concerning Gods eternitie, by the sight of this graue old man? If you did not beleeue that God is eternall, before you looked vpon that image, it is not possible you should learne it, or giue credit to it, by seeing the picture, especially if it represent not as you speake the person of God. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the gazing on such Idols is more likely to draw men into a conceipt, that God growes old, and so his eternitie is wearing away, then to teach them that he neuer had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and neuer shall haue end. You will replie, that <hi>Daniell</hi> doth so describe him. True, as the scripture euery where doth for our capacitie, applying affections, parts, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men to God. The Lord, who of his infinite wisdome appointed the penning of these things for our instruction, hath promised a blessing to euery part of his word, that it may be read &amp; heard without danger; but Idols are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by him, euen such pictures of old men, because whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the pretence of making them be, they fill ignorant people with error and superstition.</p>
