         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Petition for Peace is preſented to the Parliament by
ſome thouſands of Citizens; the Petition findes a
peaceable anſwer; and that Anſwer (as I ſhall now ſet
forth) is oppoſed by an unpeaceable Reply, but that
time may be the better husbanded, and indifferent
Readers the better ſatisfied, before I undertake the
Replication it ſelfe, I deſire all men to be preadverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of ſome few things.</p>
            <p>Schollars have been very active in this unnaturall warre, both in rayſing
and fomenting it; the tongue hath made ſome wounds as well as the hand;
and the ſword had never bin ſo keene, had it not been whetted by the Pen:
but Schollars are not active on both ſides alike (to ſhew their partiality, &amp;
intereſt in this cauſe) 'tis only on the Kings ſide, where the Pen and the
Launce are both brandiſht in the ſame hand. And it is wiſely ordered, for
the Kngs intereſt wil be the more hopefully purſu'd when Schollars ſecond
it with their Arts, and the Schollars Intereſts will be the eaſier gained, when
the King ſeconds them with his Armes. But of all kindes of Learning Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
is moſt relyed on: and of all kinds of Oratory, that is moſt made uſe
of, which is moſt want only painted and dreſſed, and borrowes moſt from
oſtentatious Art, and is therefore moſt unfit for buſineſſe, either of Law or
State, becauſe it is moſt fit to inveagle, and deceive with its falſe graces and
flouriſhes. The tongue of <hi>Cyneas</hi> was very advantageous to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
Townes and Cities, but 'tis likely more of manly Logick then of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155894:3"/>
Rhetorick flow'd from that tongue of his, or elſe Townes and
Cities in thoſe dayes were governed by very illiterate men. None but the
duller ſort of people are to be catcht by pure <hi>oratory,</hi> the wiſer ſort are wel
enough inſtructed, that when the Fowlers pipe playes moſt melodiouſly,
the ſnare is coucht moſt pernitiouſly. That man is very unworthy to judge
of Papers that cannot diſtiguiſh betweene foundations and ſuperſtructions,
reaſons and Aſſumptions; that cannot diſcerne between prooving of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and purſuing of concluſions: and yet the chiefeſt fraud of the Orator
is to paſſe over that part of the buſineſſe which requires moſt proofe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proofe at all, &amp; that which is moſt darke without light at all, and that
which is moſt important without mention at all. 'Tis enough for the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to blazon the bloudy ſhield of war in general, when 'tis his ſole charge
to diſpute who are the guilty cauſers &amp; promoters of this particular War:
'Tis enough for him to take it for gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, or at moſt upon his own credit to
affirme it, <hi>That the Kings party of Papiſts and Arminian Clergy men and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
were firſt aſſayled by this Parliament, without cauſe or danger;</hi> and
ſo <hi>preſaltum</hi> to proceed to ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>emous invectives, &amp; curſed cenſures againſt the
Parliament: when his main task is to proove either that a Parliament may
in no caſe whatſoever defend it ſelfe, or that this warre in the Parliament
is not defenſive. If wee peruſe all the papers which have come out in the
Kings behalfe, under his name, or otherwiſe; we ſhall find nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be inſiſted on but theſe two points, <hi>That defenſive warre is unlawfull
in Parliaments, or that this warre in the Parliament is not defenſive;</hi> and
yet nothing leſſe hath been inſiſted on; nay though the Fabricke bee vaſt
that is built and raiſed thereupon, yet that which ought to ſupport all the
fabrick is utterly neglected; ſo in this reply (now to be examined) if much
be affirmed, yet little is prooved, and if any proofe be made 'tis of ſequels,
not of premiſſes; 'tis of aſſumptions deduced, not of <hi>Theſes</hi> deducing: and
'tis plaine and obvious to al that the <hi>Replicant</hi> here pleads not as if he ſtood
at the barre, but pronounces ſentence, as if he ſate on the Bench: We may
juſtly therefore ſuſpect that he aymes not at the ſatisfying of wiſe men, but
the dazelling of ſimple men, and that he would not daube with his fucuſſes
every line, &amp; embelliſh with his Careſſing Phraſes every ſentence, if he did
not affect the pompe of Mr <hi>Rhombus</hi> the Pedant, rather then the gravitie of a
Statiſt. The next Art of our <hi>Replicant</hi> is to impoſe thoſe his nude averments
which are moſt falſe and improbable, with moſt boldneſſe and aſſurance,
aſſaling as it were thereby the beliefe of other men with armed violence.
That it may paſſe for currant that <hi>Franham Caſtle was ſurprized contrary
to the faith, and Treaty of Sir William Waller</hi> (with whom no Treaty was
ever entertained nor ſpoken of,) it muſt be further averred, <hi>That our ſide
was falſe at Winchecter, falſe in York ſhire, falſe every where;</hi> but theſe things
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155894:3"/>
               <hi>eadem facilitate negantur, quâ affirmantur.</hi> Another advantage of the
Kings party is by multitude of writings, invective and Satyricall: both the
Univerſities are become mints of defamatory diſgracefull papers, the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Kings Pen-and-Inkhorne men, are more and fuller then of his
ſword-men; and though too many papers are ſcattered of both ſides, yet
thoſe of the Kings are moſt of them ſerious, and done by able men, whereas
thoſe of the Parliaments ſide for the moſt part are ridiculous done by Sots,
or prevaricators to the diſadvantage of the partie. After theſe premonitions
I come to the Replication it ſelfe. The ſubſtance of the Petition was <hi>That
the Parliament would tender ſuch Propoſitions for Accommodation, as
might be accepted with honour to his Maiesty, and ſafety to the Kingdome.</hi>
The ſubſtance of the Anſwer was that the Parliament was truly and heartily
deſirous of a ſafe and honourable Accommodation, and for an inſtance of
that their deſire would ſeeke nothing from the King, but to enjoy the due
eſſentiall Priviledges of his higheſt Court of Law and policie, which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
muſt needs qualifie and fit them rather to judge, then to be judged
by any other inferiour partie. That a totall ſubmiſſion to the King, he being
ſo farre addicted to a faction of <hi>Papists</hi> and haters of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> could
neither be ſafe nor honourable. That to ſubmit to the Kings party were to
ſubmit to the foes of Religion and Libertie: foes irreconcileable, and ſuch
as ever had been dangerous, and were now made more furious by bloud
againſt the Parliament. That if the Petitioners being but a part of <hi>London,</hi>
and that but a part of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould in ſtead of an honourable ſafe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
preſſe the Parliament to a diſhonourable unſafe ſubmiſſion to
the Kings party, it were a breach of publike truſt in the Parliament to yeeld
therein, the Parliament being truſted by the whole Kingdome, that if a juſt
fit Accommodation be intended the King ought to truſt the Parliament in
part, as well as the Parliament ought in part to truſt the King. That both
parties being equally diſarmed, the Proteſtants being leſſe countenanced by
the King, and more obliged in Conſcience by oathes and agreements, would
be more obnoxious to diſadvantages, then that party wherein ſo many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
are predominant. That though the Parliament might ſubmit, yet a
faire Accommodation it could not obtaine, except the King would equally
condeſcend thereunto. That if the Petitioners had found out a more ſafe
and honourable Accommodation then the Parliament had yet diſcovered;
(for that was poſſible) the Parliament would embrace it; That if none ſuch
could be found out, the affections and judgements of the Parliament ought
not to be cenſur'd or diſtruſted. That it behooved the Petitioners to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
themſelves by the like petition to the King, if no want of affection to
peace were apparent in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as certainly none was.</p>
            <p>In contradiction and oppoſition to all the ſeverall poynts in this Analyſis,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155894:4"/>
what the <hi>Replicant</hi> hath ſet forth, wee ſhall now ſee in the ſame order.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>great contrivers of our ſad diviſions, which abuſe the weake rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the people, to keepe up an unfortunate miſunderstanding between King
and Subject</hi> are not named by the <hi>Replicant;</hi> but they are clearely pointed
out <hi>to be the Chiefe Lords and Commons in Parliament:</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>Every
new Vote of late hath been a new affliction:</hi> and <hi>he makes Pennington and the
Citty Lecturers to be but Iourney-men Rebels under them:</hi> and even this
Helliſh ſlander he venteth <hi>under the name of the Petitioners, whom he ſtiles
the moſt conſiderable perſons of the Citty:</hi> and at the ſame time affirmeth, <hi>that
the people generally are of honeſt affections. And the Anſwer to the Petition in
which, the words</hi> (he ſaies) <hi>are ſofter then oyle, though the matter of it be poiſon
of Aspes, he attributes only to ſome Chiefe Engineers of miſchiefe in the Houſe,
though it carry in it the Authority of the whole Houſe.</hi> Here is a wonder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all wonders. A few factious perſons in Parliament over-awe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,
better and wiſer part in Parliament; and by a few factious Inſtruments
in Citty and Countrey abuſe the major, better and wiſer part there alſo into
the moſt miſerable diſtempers and calamities that ever were; and though
the honeſt generality begin to grow wiſer and are inſtructed by the ſence of
their miſeries, and by other advertiſements from loyall Papiſts and Prelates,
and other pious Courtiers and ſouldiers to ſhake off their few Tormentors:
Nay, and though the King himſelf has not onely publiſht the moſt eloquent
and ſubtill Declarations to diſabuſe the people, that ever were (himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt beloved and honoured Prince that ever was for his indulgence
to Liberty and Religion) but ha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h alſo advanced a moſt puiſſant and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Army to releeve theſe undeceived wretches; yet the incantation holds,
no humane force either of Armes or Arts can diſſolve it. The miracles of
<hi>Moſes</hi> had an impreſſion of divine vertue upon them, and did therefore tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over all the Egyptians ſpels: but in this caſe, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pym,</hi> with I know
not what infernall engines diſtors and wreſts all the Orbes of a Kingdome
from their naturall motions; and yet no divine Art can reſiſt him. 'Twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
beleev'd before that any but God could work contrary to nature, but
now it muſt be beleeved. But is it ſo apparent that the Parliament is averſe
from peace? yet ſaies the <hi>Replicant, For withdraw the fuell, and the fire is
ſoon extinguiſht: Let the Parliament not foment the ill humour (by ſupplyes
of men, Armes and Ammunition) and the wound will heale of it ſelfe.</hi> In the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
nothing but an Accommodation, ſafe and honourable was pretended,
but now we ſee a meere ſubmiſſion is intended in this replication.</p>
            <p>Tis not prooved: That the Armes of the Parliament are unjuſt; 'tis not
prooved, that it may be ſafe for the Kingdome to proſtrate, and ſubject Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
to the diſcretion of that faction which now has bereav'd us of the
Kings preſence and favour, yet becauſe the Replicant will take upon him to
condemne Parliaments; we muſt alſo allow of his Judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:155894:4"/>
But 'its further ſay'd by the Replicant, <hi>that even Accommodation it ſelfe
is not pleaſing in Parliament, witneſſe that ſpeech of one, I like not daubing:</hi>
and that of another, <hi>I hate the name of Accommodation.</hi> Hee which hates
the name of an Accommodation as it has been uſed of late to ſignifie a totall
ſubmiſſion, may love a true Accommodation in it ſelfe: and he that likes
not the daubing of thoſe which under the colour of Accommodation ayme

            <p>Can the Parliament expreſſe zeale to peace better then by contracting all
its rights and priviledges into one compendious propoſition, for the ſetling of
union? To purchaſe true peace, the Parliament deſires nothing but to retain
the meere being of a Parliament; that is, to be the ſupreme Court of King
and Kingdome. And if it can ſtand with the eſſence of ſuch a Court to be
arraign'd, tryed and ſentenced by a faction of Papiſts, Prelates, Delinquents,
and Souldiers, the Parliament will ſubmit to that Condition alſo.</p>
            <p>2. When we expreſſe our feares of the Kings party, and therefore deny
ſubmiſſion thereunto as dangerous and diſhonourable, the <hi>Replicant</hi> tels us
further, <hi>we are required not to ſubmit to our fellow ſubiects, but to the King
only:</hi> and he tels us further, <hi>that the Lawes are the beſt ſecurity, and thoſe we
ſhall enioy, and to claime any higher ſecuritie is to aſſume the power of Kings.</hi>
How farre the Lawes of the Land have been ſufficient to preſerve to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the be<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter part of loyall Proteſtant ſubjects their rightfull por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and intereſt in the Kings favour, for theſe 17. yeares laſt paſt, is knowne
to all; The Lawes of <hi>Scotland</hi> could not ſecure the better and greater
part there; The Lawes of <hi>Ireland</hi> have not ſaved the Brittaines and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
from Maſſacres there: and yet certainly both thoſe Kingdomes are
intitled to Lawes of as ample benefit, and vigour as ours now is. But what
ſpeake we of Common Lawes, when even at this inſtant ſuch a free ſubjects
houſe is burnt and plundered by the Kings party, in deriſion and deſpight of
the Kings owne Proclamation and particular <hi>Placard</hi> granted for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of himſelfe and his family? As our Judges preyed upon us heretofore
in matters of State, and Divines oppreſſed us in matters of Religion: ſo our
Martialiſts now have a power of ſpoyling above the generall Law, or any
particular protection. If the King thinke fit to grant ſafety to ſuch a perſon,
or ſuch a Towne, it muſt be provided alwayes that ſuch a Dutch or Scotch
Commander, who conceives himſelfe more skilfull in war then the King give
his approbation withall; for my part I conceive it more honourable for the
King to ſay that he cannot, then that he would not ſave his people from all
thoſe curſed indignities and cruelties which have been multiplyed upon us
during this warre, and before by his adherents. As for Lawes therefore we
muſt take notice that they may be imployed either to the benefit or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155894:5"/>
of any Nation, and that they themſelves do require to be regulated by
further Lawes. No Nation can be free without a three-fold priviledge:
The firſt is in the framing and paſſing of Lawes. The ſecond is in declaring
and interpreting Lawes. And the third is in executing and preſerving Lawes
inforce. Where the King is ſole Law-maker all things are ſubject to his meer
diſcretion, and a greater bondage then this never was nor can be; the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
lie not under ſuch baſe ſervitude, their King claimes but a part in the Leg<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
power: and yet nevertheleſſe of late by diſcontinuing of Writs for
the ſummoning of Parliaments, and by the right of a Negative voyce in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and an untimely diſſolving of Parliaments, the peoples intereſt in
this Legiſlative power has been much abridged and ſuſpended. In the like
manner alſo if the ſole power of declaring Lawes were ſo in the King as that
he might himſelfe give Judgement, or create Judges at his pleaſure without
impoſing Oathes of truſt on them in behalfe of the people, or ſhould deny
redreſſes upon Appeales from them, our Legiſlative power would be vaine
and uneffectuall to us. For my part I hold it an equall thing, whither juſt
men make Lawes and unjuſt interpret them, or unjuſt men make Lawes and
juſt interpret them. When it was juſt in the King of late to impoſe what
taxes hee pleaſed, and as often as he pleaſed upon us for the preparing of
<hi>Armadoes</hi> all over <hi>England.</hi> Our Nation was fallen into a moſt deſperate
thraldome, yet the fault was not then in the Lawes, but in the Judges, and
ſuch as had a power over the Judges, Lawes as they are deafe, and by a ſtrict
inflexibility more righteous then living Judges, ſo they are dumb alſo, and
by their want of Language more imperfect then the breſts of men. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſince the Lawes of God and Nature, though knowne to all, yet do not
utter to all the ſame ſenſe, but remaine in many plaine points ſtrangely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted,
as to their intent and meaning; how can we hope that any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Lawes ſhould ſatisfie all mens underſtanding in abſtruſe points, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome living Key to open them? the vaſt Pandects and digeſts of the
Law ſufficiently teſtifie, that in the cleareſt Law, which mankind could ever
yet diſcover there are dark and endleſſe Labyrinths, wherein the weaker ſort
of lay men are preſently loſt, &amp; the learnedſt advocates are tediouſly perplext.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place alſo if the ſole power of inforcing and executing Lawes
were ſo veſted in the King, as that he might uſe it to the ceſſation or perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of all juſtice, and the people were in ſuch caſe remedileſſe, the intereſt in
making and declaring of Law were invalid, and fruſtrate in the people, and
the King might ſtill inſlave or deſtroy them at his pleaſure. The <hi>Replicant</hi>
ſayes, <hi>That under a Monarchy much muſt be truſted to the King, or elſe it will
be debaſed into Democracie.</hi> Tis confeſſed much muſt, but all muſt not be
truſted: the queſtion then is, how farre this <hi>much</hi> extends in a Monarchy of
ſuch a mixt nature as ours is, in ſuch times as ours now are?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:155894:5"/>
In abſolute Monarchies all is truſted to the King: in abſolute Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
all is veſted in the people: in a mixt Monarchy more is truſted to the
King, then is reſerved to the people; and in a mixt Democracie more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to the people, then is derived to the Prince. In all formes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the people paſſes by way of truſt, all that power which it retaines not,
and the difference of formes is only in degree, and the degrees are almoſt as
various as the ſeverall ſtates of the world are, nay the ſame ſtate admits of
often changes many times, ſometimes the people gaines, and ſometimes
looſes, ſometimes to its prejudice, ſometimes not; and ſometimes injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſometimes not; but the degrees of ordinary power conſiſt in the making,
declaring and inforcing Law, except when forraigne warre is, and then it is
expedient that a greater and more extraordinary truſt be repoſed in one, and
this we ſee in <hi>Holland,</hi> the moſt exact Republicke, and in <hi>England</hi> the moſt
exact Monarchy in the world. But it is a leud conceit of our Royaliſts now
adayes to attribute to our King an abſolute power over the <hi>Militia</hi> of this
Land at all times alike, not diſtinguiſhing between Civill warres, wherein he
may be a party, and ſuſpected; and between a forraigne warre, where he is
neither a party nor ſuſpected: for if our Kings will plead ſuch a truſt to our
diſadvantage, 'tis juſt that they produce ſome proofe for it, and relye not
upon meere Common uſe, 'tis true in caſe of Forraigne invaſion, 'tis expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that the King be farre truſted, and yet even ſo, if the King ſhould conſpire
with forraigne forces, or neglect to protect us againſt them, contrary to the
intent of his truſt, we might reſume the common native <hi>Poſſe,</hi> or <hi>Militia</hi> of
the Land, for our owne defence without his conſent. And much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
is it in time of Peace, or Civill warre, if the King will deny his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
or withdraw his preſence, to obſtruct Law, or will by his Negative
voyce, or by force ſeeke to diſable his higheſt Courts and Councels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all to arbitrary government: more reaſonable is it, that the people ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to themſelves the Law, their chiefeſt portion and beſt patrimony. For
as the King cannot by Law deny to the people their undoubted intereſt in
paſſing of Lawes; ſo neither can he defeat the ſame intereſt, or deſtroy the
benefit thereof by miſinterpretations, or by miſ-executions of the ſame
Lawes. No Nation can injoy any freedome but by the right and ſhare
which it has in the Lawes, and if that right and ſhare doe not extend to the
preſervation of Lawes in their true vigour and meaning, as well as to the
Creation of them, 'tis emptie and defeaſible at the Kings meere pleaſure,
<hi>Much is to be truſted to the King:</hi> true, but all is not (we ſee) truſted, ſome
power we ſee is of Neceſſity to be reſerved in free Nations, ſuch as the King
allowes us to be, and there is a difference alſo in the word <hi>Truſt:</hi> for there is
an arbitrary, and there is a neceſſary <hi>Truſt,</hi> and the one may be reſumed; the
other not upon meere pleaſure. Without all queſtion, the wiſer and juſter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155894:6"/>
Princes are eſteemed, the more the people ever truſt them, but this makes no
difference in the Legall and fundamentall <hi>Truſt</hi> of the Kingdome, nor can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
credulous, and eaſie Princes pretend alwayes to the ſame degree of
power as their Anceſtors have held, unleſſe they can preſcribe to their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
alſo. Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might with ſafety and expedience be truſted
further then King <hi>Iames,</hi> even in thoſe things where the Law did not truſt
her: but this is the miſery of ſubjects, all goes from them, but nothing muſt
returne: The Court of a Prince is like the Lions den in the Fable, all the
beaſts leave prints and ſteps <hi>advorſum</hi> but none <hi>retrorſum.</hi> But the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant</hi>
further aſſures us, <hi>That tis very eaſie to aſſigne the bounds of theſe
ſeverall trusts: for the Lawes and Customes of the Land determine both: nor
will his Maiestie</hi> (he ſies) <hi>require any new truſt to himſelfe, or deny any old
trust to us.</hi> Our great Divines were to bee admired for their profound
knowledge in the myſteries of Law were they not Courtiers: but now the
King is preſum'd to comprehend <hi>omnia jura in ſcrinio Pectoris:</hi> and ſo
they by their reſidence at Court diſcerne all the ſecrets of Law and State
<hi>in ſpeculo Imperii,</hi> juſt as our heavenly Saints doe read all things elſe <hi>in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
Trinitatis.</hi> Our graveſt Sages of the Law are much divided in points of
leſſe moment and intricacie, and as for the preciſe metes and bounds, where
Soveraignty and Liberty are ſever'd, and the direct degrees of publike truſt
in all caſes, and at all times, they looke upon them as grand difficulties, ſcarce
fit to be debated but in the ſacred Court of Parliament; and yet Clergie-men
think them but the firſt rudiments of all knowledge, obvious to very A. B. C.
<hi>Darians.</hi> They alwayes boaſt of the knowne Lawes of the Kingdome, in all
diſputes they referre us to the knowne Lawes and Cuſtomes of the Land, as
if Judges were things utterly needleſſe, and the ſtudy of Law meerely ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.
The Treſhault Court of Parliament, of whoſe determination our
learnedſt Judges will not thinke diſhonourably, cannot pierce into thefe
known obvious Lawes, and yet every Sophiſter can: the Fountaines of
Juſtice are now exhauſted, and yet the Ciſternes remaine full. But ſaies the
Replicant, <hi>If you ſeeke further ſecurity then the knowne Lawes, the people will
ſee, that under the name of free ſubiects, you take upon you the power of Kings.</hi>
Sir, we deſire to have our Lawes themſelves ſecured to us, which you may
turne like our owne Canons againſt our ſelves, if righteous and prudent
Iudges be not granted us, and all over-awing violence ſo prevented, as that
the fruit of their Iudgements be clearely and intirely conveyed to us. And
ſuch ſecurance is not incompatible with Monarchy; for it is no more impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Monarchy, that the people ſhould injoy then make lawes; that they
ſhould be ſharers in the power of declaring and executing, then in the power
of paſſing &amp; framing lawes: but it is on the contrary an evident impeachment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:155894:6"/>
to liberty, if an equality of theſe three Priviledges be not at leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the people.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>As for the diametricall oppoſition in Religion and State betwixt
us and our irreconcilable enemies of the Kings party. The Replicant
maintaines divers things: and of the Papiſts and Delinquents he ſayes,</hi>
That we have nothing againſt them, but State Calumnies: That the
ſame juſtice may governe both, if wee will ſubmit to Law. He beſeeches
us to tell what Religion we would have: if that which the Martyrs ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with their blood, our Adverſaries practiſe it, and deſire ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
upon all ſuch as tranſgreſſe it: he imputes to us a new Creed:
he ſayes th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> King is to look upon friends or enemies in a Law notion only,
that Subjects muſt not give Lawes to Princes courteſies: That our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
if they be Traytors, are to be tried at the Kings Bench, the houſe
of Commons having no right of Judicature.</p>
            <p>The major part of our enemies are certainly either Papiſts, or elſe
ſuch as are either over-awed or outwitted by Papiſts. Tis true, ſome
part of our enemies knowes the truth of the Proteſtant Religion, and
the deſperate antipathy of Papiſtry; yet having in them the true pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of no Religion, but ſerving Mammon only, for their worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
ſake, (with which ſeverity of Parliaments will not ſquare)
they adhere to Papiſts, little regarding what Religion ſtands, or what
falls. Another part out of meere ignorance is carried away with the
name King, and the Profeſſions of the King, not at all looking into
reaſon of State, nor being able to judge of the ſame: but the laſt ſort
of men are not ſo conſiderable, either for their number, or power, or
malice; and therefore I ſhall not inſiſt upon them.</p>
            <p>The maine Engineers in this Civill Warre are Papiſts, the moſt
poyſonous, ſerpentine, Ieſuited Papiſts of the world. All the Papiſts
in <hi>Europe</hi> either pray for the proſperity of this deſigne, or have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
ſome other influence and aſſiſtance to it. This warre was not
the production of theſe two laſt yeares; nor was <hi>England</hi> alone the
field wherein the Dragons teeth were ſowd. <hi>Scotland</hi> was firſt attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but the Proteſtant party there was too ſtrong for the Papiſts, and
ſuch of the Engliſh as joyned with them. The conſpiracies next broke
out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Popiſh party being too ſtrong for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
the Tragedy has been beſeeming Papiſts, it had proved beyond
all paralell bloody; and if ſhipping were not wanting, they might ſpare
ſome aids for their fellow Conſpirators here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> is now in its agony, bleeding and ſweating under the ſad
conflict of two parties, equally almoſt poized in force and courage.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:155894:7"/>
The Papiſts themſelves in <hi>England</hi> amount not to the twentieth arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall
part of Proteſtants, and yet one papiſt in geometricall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may ſtand againſt twenty Proteſtants, conſidering the papiſts with
together with their adherents, and conſidering alſo what they are that
act over them, and who they are that act under them. What power the
Romiſh Vice-god has in the Queen is known, &amp; what power the Queen
has in the King, and what power the King and Queen have in the prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Clergy, and the Clergy in them reciprocally, and what power the
King, Queen and Clergy have on a great number of irreligious or luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm
proteſtants (now made Delinquents and ſo further engaged) as
alſo upon all papiſts, &amp; how all theſe have intereſts divided &amp; intwined &amp;
how reſtleſly active they al are in purſuing their intereſts is not unknown.</p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>Ireland</hi> is a weakneſs, &amp; <hi>Scotland</hi> is no ſtrength to us: all popiſh
countries <hi>France,</hi> &amp; <hi>Spain</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are likely to annoy us, and the proteſtants
in <hi>Denmark, Holland</hi> &amp;c. have not power to reſtrain their Princes from
combining further againſt us. In this deplorable condition we have no
friends to complain to, and yet this Replicant tels us, <hi>we have no enemies
to complain of;</hi> our very condoling againſt papiſts and delinquents, he
tearms <hi>State calumnies, and ſlanders that have loſt their credit by time,
and are confuted by experience.</hi> O thou black mouth, more black then
thy coat, haſt thou no more remorſe for all that proteſtant blood, which
delinquent have enabled papiſts to ſhed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
blood which armies of papiſts and delinquents are now ready to
ſhed in <hi>England?</hi> if all this blood finde no pity in thee, yet is it an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to thee, that it extorts teares and lamentations from us? O thou
unbowelled ſanguinary wretch, if God be the God of proteſtants, he
will judge theſe cruelties of papiſts, and their abettors: and if he be the
God of papiſts, we know our ſlanders and calumnies cannot deceive
him; wee ſubmit our ſelves and our cauſe to his revenging hand. But
thou wilt ſay, <hi>the Kings party in this warre are good Proteſtants, and
we are Anabaptiſts, &amp;c.</hi> The tyranny and ſuperſtition of Biſhops
has driven ſome of our tender and ſtrictor proteſtants into utter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of Ceremonies, and that pompous, or rather ſuperſtitious forme of
Church diſcipline which has beene hitherto uſed in <hi>England.</hi> Some of
us deſire an alteration of ſome things in our Lyturgy, by advice of a
learned and uncorrupt Synod: others perhaps ſcruple Church muſick,
and any ſet forme of divine ſervice, to be impoſed of neceſſity, liking
better the ſingle order of <hi>Scotland.</hi> What new Creed is there in all
this, or what change of Religion were this, if there were any great
numbers of men ſo opinionated? But it is well enough knowne to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:155894:7"/>
our Adverſaries, that there is not one man of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
that is violent againſt all publick ſet formes of prayer, or
that forme which is now in uſe, or that deſires any alteration of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in Eſſentialls, nay nor of Diſcipline, except in things very few
and inconſiderable. And it is well knowne that the Parliament, as it
would looſen the rigour of Law in ſome ſcruples for the eaſe of tender
conſciences, ſo it abhors utterly all licentious government in the
Church, and all by-wayes of confuſion. In the City the King has
inſtanced in <hi>Pennington, Ven, Foulk,</hi> and <hi>Mannering,</hi> as notoriouſly
guilty of Schiſme, and doubtleſſe they were named for want of worſe:
try theſe men now by the old Creed, or by the nine and thirty Articles;
nay, examine them concerning the Common prayer Book, and it will
ſoon appeare how farre they are ſtrayed into Browniſme, or any other
Schiſme: it will appeare how they are wounded in ſchiſmatick, and all
proteſtants in them, and the true Religion in us all: it may be they have
not put pluralities, or the Parliamentary Votes of Biſhops into their
Creed; it may be they have reſerved no implicite faith for Convocation
acts, and Canons, which the Replicant may perhaps judge very irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;
but they hope this never had any anathema pronounced againſt
it in the old Church by any Councell before Antichriſts dayes. Let not
railing pulſe for impleading and condemning, and we will all be tried in
the ſame manner, and if any new Creed be found amongſt us, differing in
ſubſtance from the old, let our adverſaries themſelves give and execute
ſentence upon us. If Browniſts could be as well diſtinguiſht and nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in our Army, as papiſts are in the Kings, or were really as many
and as far countenanced, we would diſtruſt our cauſe; whereas we now
beg no otherwiſe the bleſſing of God upon our Armies, then as we are
enemies both to Popery and Browniſm. Dares our Replicant make ſuch
a prayer? no, ſomtimes <hi>he owns Papiſts,</hi> and ſomtimes he ſeemingly <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owns
them:</hi> ſpeaking of the Kings party, once he ſaies, <hi>As for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht
religion we will become ſuiters to you, that you will ſeverely puniſh all
perſons whatſoever that tranſgreſs againſt it.</hi> Papiſts certainly have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt
againſt our religion; if the rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> be a tranſgreſſion,
or if the inſtant taking up of arms here againſt the parliament be a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion;
yet ſee at the ſame time, when they call us to puniſh the papiſts,
they themſelves arm &amp; enable papiſts to puniſh, nay to deſtroy us, is this
all the ingenuity we ſhall expect? well, to our law notion: it is argued
in the next place, <hi>that a Papiſt fighting for the King, though in a notion
of Theology, he may be accounted an enemy</hi> quatenus <hi>a Papiſt, yet in
underſtanding of Law, hee was accounted the Kings friend, as to his
fighting:</hi> Prieſt ſquires Doctrine juſt, <hi>hee that fights for the King,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:155894:8"/>
or rather at the Kings command, let the cauſe be what it will, he is the
Kings friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Saul</hi> gave a furious command to fall upon the Prieſts of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah;</hi>
amongſt all his ſervants, he had no entire loving friend but <hi>Doeg:</hi>
ſo when his unnaturall rage incited him to take away the life of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
the whole Army that defended <hi>Ionathan</hi> were his foes, and if it had
proceeded to parties (as it had, if <hi>Saul</hi> had had as many <hi>Idumeans</hi> in his
ſervice as King <hi>Charles</hi> now has) thoſe onely which had been the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
inſtruments of the Kings Tyranny, had been the Kings friends,
and had fought for their King: ſo thoſe ſix hundred men which adhered
to <hi>David,</hi> out of a pious intent, to preſerve his innocent ſoule from the
bloudy hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his three thouſand impious murderers; and
the <hi>Keilites</hi> alſo, if they had been faithfull to <hi>David</hi> (as they ought to
have been) were guilty of Treaſon and drew their ſwords againſt their
maſter. But I expect now that the Replicant inſiſt upon the Iuſtice of
the Kings cauſe, <hi>as not taking armes to maſter the Parliament, but to
defend themſelves againſt the Parliament:</hi> this if it could be proved,
would over-rule all, but it being in queſtion, and as reſolutely denied
by one ſide, as affirmed by the other; the Replicant muſt evince by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
all that he expects to gaine from us. 'Tis not ſo probable that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſhould invade a King, as a King a Parliament: 'Tis not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that a Parliament ſhould be miſled, and have ends to enrich it
ſelfe by oppreſſion as a King. 'Tis not ſo probable, that that Army which
conſiſts all of Proteſtants, ſhould be ſo adverſe to the reformed Religion,
as that which admits and favours all Papiſts and Delinquents: 'Tis
not ſo probable, that that Army which is raiſed and payed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that is by the flower of all the Engliſh Nobility and Gentry,
ſhould fight for Arbitrary government, and againſt propriety, liberty
and priviledge of Parliament; as that which hath nothing conſiderable,
but rapine and pillage to maintaine it. If many evidences of facts, many
pregnant proofs, and many lively circumſtances of time and place, did
not abſolve the Parliament of trayterous conſpiring againſt the Kings
Crowne, Dignity, and perſon; and convince <hi>Digby, Percy, Iermin,</hi> and
divers of the Kings and Queens party, of conſpiring againſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament, and the lives of many of our nobleſt Parliament
men. If all other arguments did faile, the very invitation of Papiſts to
the Kings Standard, &amp; the riſing of the Papiſts with ſuch generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
now, that all <hi>Ireland</hi> is almoſt loſt to the papiſts, and ſome hopes
were elſe to recover it, would ſufficiently aſſure me, that religion and
liberty ſtand in more danger of the Kings party, than of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:155894:8"/>
I could not with more cleare and cheerfull confidence die for the
truth of the proteſtant Religion, then for the Iuſtice of the parliaments
cauſe in this warre, <hi>noſcitur ex Comite, &amp;c.</hi> Let the papiſt plead for
the Delinquent, and the Delinquent for the papiſt, thoſe ends which
have ſo cloſely cemented, and kindly incorporated both together, make
a ſufficient diſcovery to me, as well what the papiſt, as what the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentis.
And this age muſt prove monſtrouſly unnaturall, in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a wonder never heard of in all former ages, If Iuſtice doe now
reſt in the Kings ſide; For ſurely, no King ever till now, having a iuſt
cauſe, was oppoſed therein by the maior and better part of his ſubiects;
much leſſe was it ever ſeene or heard of, that any King in a iuſt cauſe was
deſerted by the maiority of his Orthodox ſubiects, and ſupported by
the unanimous aid of ſuch, as hated his true proteſted Religion. God
ſend the King to lay theſe things ſeriouſly and penſively to heart, for
ſince none of his wiſe and worthy Anceſtors ever yet had cauſe to wage
war either with the Collective or Repreſentative Body of the People:
ſo none at all ever in any warre ſided with a falſe Religion, or againſt the
true, till this unhappy day; in the King <hi>Charles</hi> is the firſt, and I hope
will be the laſt, and therefore this is worthy to make a ſad impreſſion
upon his ſoule. But our Replicant will tell us, <hi>That the Kings Iuſtice
may yet govern and awe both parties by the ſame Law, whatſoever their
antipathy be.</hi> The King has Law, and power by the Law to protect the
better partie, and to provide for the peace of both parties: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that Law and that power the poore Britiſh Proteſtants in
<hi>Ireland</hi> have beene left unprotected, and lamentably expoſed to a
generall Aſſaſſination: And had they not beene betrayed by their
vaine confidence in the Law, and in the Kings protection, they perhaps
might have found other meanes to defend themſelves; therefore it is no
refuge or comfort to them now, to hear the name of Law proclaimed &amp;
reiterated, when as things hapned there, it has been the very ſhelfe and
rock whereon the Proteſtants have been miſerably bulyed and wricked;
then pardon pray, if the ſame name of Iuſtice alſo ſound but harſhly at
this time in our eares: when papiſts which have deſtroyed our religion
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> are rayſed to preſerve it in <hi>England;</hi> and proteſtants which
were ſending ſuccours and ſupplyes into <hi>Ireland,</hi> are in the inſtant inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
here in <hi>England</hi> for the better ſuppreſſion of Popery both here and
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> Tis a ſtrange kinde of aſſurance or ioy to us, to ſee the names
of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Liberty, and parliamentary priviledge, ſtamped upon our
coyne, or interwoven in our Standard, when at the ſame time, we ſee
the ſame Coyne impreſted for the entertainment of a Popiſh Army:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:155894:9"/>
and the ſame ſtandard marching againſt the repreſentative body of our
Nation, and the ſupreame Court of Iuſtice in our State. Nay, and
the ſtrange time that is taken for the righting of Religion, Law and
Liberty amongſt us, makes our aſſurance, and joy the leſſe triumphant,
for we plainely ſee, that as the ſeaſon now is, no one Proteſtant
falls here by the Kings ſword; but by the ſame ſtroak three Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
at leaſt are cut off in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And laſtly, the manner of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Law and Liberty, is moſt ſtrange of all, for open warre
is not now ſufficiently deſtructive, though it be ſpread all over the face
of the Kingdom; ſubterranean plots are brooded further in the dark,
and by privie intelligence, the whole City of <hi>London</hi> is to be engaged
in a tragicall conſpiracy, to murder it ſelfe in one night: What the
benefit: therefore is of Law and Power, and Iuſtice for the diſabling of
Papiſt and Delinquents, and for the ſafe guarding of loyall Proteſtants
we all know: But when papiſts and delinquents finde countenance,
and the true religion is abandoned, and left obnoxious to miſchiefe by
the perverſion of Law, Power and Iuſtice; the names alone will not
availe us, but our Replicant further ſaith, <hi>Subjects muſt not give Lawes
to Princes courteſies.</hi> In matters of a private nature Princes are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
but not ſo in publike affaires, where the publike ſafety or liberty is
touched. In their own pallaces Princes may diſpoſe of Offices, but
in the State if they make Patents prejudiciall to their revenues, to their
prerogatives, or to the peoples intereſt; the Iudges ſhall pronounce
them deceived in their grants, and make the deeds void and null in Law:
Princes cannot alien any parcells of their Crownes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Hull</hi> may not bee
transferred to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> nor <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> nor <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
to <hi>Spaine,</hi> for Kings have no ſole propriety in ſuch things, and the
ſame reaſon is in the ſuper intending Offices of Royalty it ſelfe; they are
not transferible at pleaſure: Some Princes (to uſe the words of <hi>Tacitus)</hi>
are ſo infirme and credulous, that they remaine <hi>juſſis alienis obnoxii,</hi> and
<hi>non modo Imperii ſed libertatis etiam indigent,</hi> they are ſo enſlaved
ſometimes to their baſeſt flatterers, that their very Diadems are as it
were aliend and made proſtitute to ſeducers, and theſe their flatterers
and ſeducers (in the expreſſions of the ſame <hi>Tacitus) Minore metu &amp;
majore praemio peccant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The unhappy Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> were of late undone by the vaſte
power which was put into the hands of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and all the
Eccleſiaſticall, if not Civill diſturbances and diſtractions which have of
late infeſted theſe three Kingdoms, were in great part cauſed by exceſſe
of power over the Church, delegated to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:155894:9"/>
Without doubt when the foundation of Popery was firſt to be laid, it
did not proſper and advance ſo much in ſixſcore yeers under the firſt
Popes, as it did in ſix yeeres here under <hi>Canterbury:</hi> And <hi>Nero</hi>
himſelfe in his firſt three yeeres did not attaine to ſo much inſolence
and tyranny as <hi>Strafford</hi> did in one yeare.</p>
            <p>The Kings freedom therefore in favours will never juſtifie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of ſuch men, to an unqueſtionable command, nor the ſubjecting
the lives, liberties, and ſoules of ſo many millions of Religious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
to their corrupted diſaffected wills: Nevertheleſſe, for ought
I can ſee we have ſince but changed one <hi>Strafford</hi> for another, and
one <hi>Canterbury</hi> for another: Only to ſtop our complaints: This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant
tell us, <hi>That the courteſies of Princes are not to be queſtioned
by ſubjects.</hi> The Queen has now attained to a great heigth of
power as formidable as ſhe is to us, in regard of her ſex, in regard of
her Nation, in regard of her diſpoſition, in regard of her family, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of her Religion, and laſtly, in regard of her ingagments in theſe
preſent troubles; ſome think ſhee has an abſolute unlimitable power
over the Kings ſword and Scepter; which if it bee ſo, no end of our
feares and calamities can be, no propoſitions can profit us, no Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
can ſecure us. If the King himſelfe were a Papiſt, he would
yet look upon us as his naturall ſubjects, but when his regall power is
ſecondarily in the hands of a Papiſt, to that Papiſt we appeare but as
meere hereticks without any other relation of ſubjects: By ſecondary
power alſo, a ſtroak is given with more ſecreſie and ſecurity; ſo that
there is the leſſe feare in the party ſtriking to break and retard its
violence: It iſſues like a bullet, whoſe line is not direct, but with ſome
elevation in the ayre, or with ſome windings in the barrell of the gun,
whereby it doth more execution at a further diſtance. Therefore our
Kings many and dreadfull Oaths and Vowes of ſincerity in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion are not ſatisfying, if in the mean time any of his Kingly
prerogative bee ſhared with ſuch as are not ſincere in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion; it were farre ſafer for us that hee would ſweare
for his party, then for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But our Replicant will never have done with the Law, hee
ſtill tells us,</hi> That every man is to bee tryde by his Peeres the
Lords in the Lords Houſe, and the Commons at the Kings Bench,
and though the Houſe of Commons have no right of Iudicature,
yet there is another tryall for Treaſons, and our maine point in
difference at this time is concerning Treaſon.</p>

The Parliament is nothing elſe but the whole Nation of <hi>England</hi> by
its owne free choice, and by vertue of repreſentation united in a more
narrow roome, and better regulated and qualified for conſultation then
the collective body without this art and order could be. The Lords
and Commons make but one entire Court, and this Court is vertually
the whole Nation: and we may truly ſay of it, that by it conſent Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
it ſelfe was firſt founded, and for its ends Royalty it ſelfe was ſo
qualified and tempered, as it is; and from its ſupreame reaſon, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that qualification and temperature ought only to be ſtill learnd,
and the determination thereof ſought. For who can better expound what
Kings and lawes are, and for what end they were both created, then that
unqueſtionable power, which for its own advantage meerly gave crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them both? If Kings and nationall lawes had any humane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
if they be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Scripture ſayes they are, they
had not their being from themſelves: and from nations collectively ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
they could not have their being; for nations ſo are not congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
nor conſultable, nor redeemable from confuſion (pardon the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of words) and therefore it muſt follow, that both Kings and laws
were firſt formed and created by ſuch bodyes of men, as our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
now are; that is, ſuch Councells as had in them the force of
whole Nations by conſent and deputation, and the Maieſty of whole
Nations by right and repreſentation.</p>
            <p>The enemies of Parliaments ſeeing this not to be gain-ſaid, and
ſeeing that it muſt needs follow, that that cauſe which firſt gave the
being, and preſcribed the end of that being, muſt needs have moſt right
and skill to limit, and direct the manner of that being: they ſeek to
divide the coactive from the repreſentative body of the people: they
ſeek to divide between the two houſes of Parliament: and theſe ſeek to
divide between the head and the body of the Parliament. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the multitude, that they have entruſted the Parliament only
with their purſes to give away ſubſidies, and repleniſh the Kings cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers;
but not to ſettle their rights and franchiſes, and to make knowne
the bounds of Prerogative, and reſtraine the unnaturall encroachments
or erruptions of the ſame. If the community have beene agrieved, to
complaine, or almoſt accuſe, is a ſufficient priviledge of the houſe of
Commons, and this, but to avoid further repining, ſhall not be granted
them. Tis pity that our Doctors doe not ſtudy the Law further; for
with a little more induſtry, they might perhaps finde out, that every
private man as well as the houſe of Commons, or the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
out of Parliament, as well as our Knights, and Burgeſſes in it, may
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:155894:11"/>
give the King money, and if occaſion be, preferre an accuſation againſt
ſuch a tyrrannicall Lord or favourite; well, if ſuch Rabbies, and
expounders can ſatisfie any of the unworthy vulgar, and ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and Lords who have ſpirits below the Yeomanry of <hi>England</hi>
(for ſuch I have ſeene too many ſince. 3. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1640, they ſhall be no
further diſabus'd by me. In the next place, <hi>They attempt to work a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
between the Houſes, the Lords ſhall have a power of Judicature
over their Members ſo they will exclude the Commons from any part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and upon condition that they will ſo farre diſclaime them, as to leave
them obnoxious for tryalls at the Kings bench;</hi> This ſitting of the Lords
and Commons in ſeverall Houſes, does not prove them ſeverall Courts,
nor does the obſervance of particular Priviledges in either Houſe, and
not laying all things common between both, prove any independance
of either: doubtleſſe they are like the twines of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> they both
muſt live and die together. In former ages judgement was ſo given
upon the greateſt Delinquents, at that the Commons were parties in
the judgement: And ſure, whilſt they were Judges over Lords, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were not ſubjected to inferiour Courts: the Lords then knew
they could not indure any indignity to fall upon the Commons being
but diſtinct parts of the ſame Court, but it would reflect upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and the Commons knew that the honour of the Lords was an
addition to themſelves, whilſt the <hi>Curiatii</hi> ſtand cloſe together, their
three adverſe Combatants are too weake for them; but when they
are divided by unwarineſſe in the encounter, they prove all three too
weake for one of their enemies, I will not make any compariſons, or
ſay whither the Lords or Commons deſerted by the other ſuffer more; I
will only ſay, that nothing but fatall want of policy, can divide or
diminiſh their mutuall love and correſpondence.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, <hi>diviſion alſo is raiſed betwixt the King and Parliament;</hi>
there is a generation of men which ſeeke not the good of King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
nor could proſper if the King and Parliament were united as
they ought to be. Theſe men becauſe their ſuggeſtions cannot prevaile
to alienate the Parliament from the King, apply all their indevours to
alienate the King from the Parliament: their perpetuall ſuggeſtion are,
<hi>That the greatneſſe of Kings is eclipſed by Parliaments, That there is in
Lawes themſelves a kind of enmity, and ſomething that is inconſiſtant with
royalty, That Kings are bound to ſeek nothing but themſelves. That Kings
can ſeeke nothing in themſelves, ſo nobly as the ſatisfying of their wills, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:155894:12"/>
when their wills are fixt upon things difficult and forbidden.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
there is nothing but falſety in all theſe ſuggeſtions. For Princes
are the Creatures, and naturall productions of Parliaments, and ſo are
their Prerogatives as has been ſet forth, and every rationall and naturall
thing loveth its own off-ſpring, and that love is rather <hi>aſcending</hi> then <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending,</hi>
it is liker the ſap of the root, then of the branch, viz. <hi>The people
are more inclinable to love Princes, then Princes to love the People;</hi> There
is likewiſe a neare conſanguinity, and reflexive benevolence of aſpects
between Lawes and Princes, they are both of the ſame deſcent, and tend
to the ſame end, and both are inviolable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilſt they are aſſiſtant each
to other; the enemy of both has no hope to prevaile, <hi>Si attribuat Rex legi,
quod lex attribuit ei.</hi> Tis retrograde alſo to nature, that Princes whom
God has ſet to feed his people, and not without the creation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſhould think themſelves more valuable then that people; or that
they ſhould confine their thoughts to themſelves as Gods, deſpiſing
the univerſality, when God has called particular ſubjects <hi>their brethren,
and forbidden them to lift up their hearts above any of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, that Princes which have as other men, ſinfull affections, and
are ſubject more then other men to ſinfull temptations, and are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God therefore, in a higher degree then other men, ſhould think
it inglorious to deny their own irregular wills, and to ſubmit to Lawes,
Parliaments, and the Publike prayers and advice of their ſubjects, 'tis
a thing ſcarce credible. The moſt expert Navigator preferres the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his Needle before his own conceit; the moſt tried Engineer
wholly relies upon the certainty of his rule. All Artiſts how rare ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
apply themſelves to their Inſtruments, abſolutely renouncing their
skill and experience in compariſon of Mechanick directions. Only
Princes chuſe rather to erre with their own fancies and fancy feeding
flatterers, then to go right with publick advice, and no miſchiefe, which
can happen to themſelves, and millions of others by their error, ſeems ſo
unkingly to be ſuffered, as a retractation from error. But our Replicant
has more particular objections againſt Parliaments, <hi>As firſt, That
they have no cognizance of matters of State: ſecondly, That in matters of
grace and pardon they have no power or right: the King in thoſe, has an
Arbitary ſole authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lawes ayme at <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> Reaſon of ſtate aimes at <hi>ſafety;</hi> Law ſecures one
ſubject from another, Law protects ſubjects from inſolence of Princes,
and Princes from ſedition of Subjects, ſo far as certaine rules may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:155894:12"/>
and written; but reaſon of State goes beyond all particular formes
and pacts, and looks rather to the being, then well-being of a State,
and ſeeks to prevent miſchiefe forraign as well as Domeſtick, by emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Counſels, and unwritten reſolutions. Reaſon of State is ſomething
more ſublime and imperiall then Law: it may be rightly ſaid, that the
Stateſman begins where the Lawyer ceaſeth: for when warre has ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Law, as it often does; Policy is to bee obſerved as the only true
Law, a kind of a dictatorian power is to be allowed to her; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
has any right to defend it ſelfe in time of danger is to reſort to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
in ſtead of Law, and it is the ſame thing in the Replicant, <hi>To deny
to Parliaments recourſe to reaſon of State in theſe miſerable times of warre
and danger, as to deny them ſelf-defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many men, eſpecially Lawyers, would fain have Law alone take place
in all times, but for my part I think it equally deſtructive to renounce
reaſon of State, and adhere to Law in times of great extremity, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Law, &amp; adhere to Policy in times of tranquillity. Nothing has
done us more harme of late, then this opinion of adhering to Law only
for our preſervation: &amp; the King and his party though they are too wiſe
themſelves to obſerve Law at all, yet have wrought much upon the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler
ſort of our ſide by objecting againſt us neglect of Law. Certainly
as our dangers now are, it would bee good for us to adde more power
to the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (if he be thought the worthieſt man of Truſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, as he has deſerved no leſſe eſtimation) for till I ſee him lookt
upon, and ſerved as a temporary Dictator, and the bounds of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to bee only this; <hi>ne quid detrimenti capiat Reſpublica cavere:</hi>
I ſhall never think the Parliaments ſafety ſufficiently provided for.</p>
            <p>To frame any Arguments, or reaſons, or to offer proofes, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative
body of the Kingdome is a Counſell of State, rather then a
Court of Juſtice, would ſhew me as fooliſh as the Replicant: 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
any man ſhould doubt of it, that does think the being is to bee
preferred before the well being; or that whole Nations have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
either in their owne being or well being. Let our Adverſaries
triumph in their owne conceits, and when in the ſame caſe there is both
matter of Law and State (as in the caſe of <hi>Hull,</hi> where the King had an
intereſt rather in State then Law) let them upbraid us for declining of
Law: I ſhall like that beſt which they diſlike moſt in us: I wiſh we
had not obſerved Law too farre, for they would never ſo farre recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:155894:13"/>
it to us, did they not know it might be ſometimes unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for acts of grace and pardon.</hi> I ſhall not much quarrel thereabout,
the Parliament can beſt adviſe the King how far it is fit to paſſe a Law
of oblivion in theſe generall times of confuſion: And the Anſwerer of
the <hi>London</hi> Petition affirmed nothing, but that their adviſe therein was
likely to be moſt wholſome, which can hardly be contradicted.</p>
            <p>And the Law is cleare enough that though the execution of Law be
farre intruſted to the King, and there is a diſpenſing power in Him, ſo
farre as he is ſuppoſed to be damnified or to be intereſted in the penalty;
yet where crimes have been committed againſt the whole State, the
King ought not, and where particular men have been injured, the King
cannot ſuffocate, fruſtrate, or deny Juſtice. 'Tis againſt his Oath, 'tis
againſt publike Liberty to deny ſatisfaction by ſtopping execution.</p>
            <p>4. But London is the moſt conſiderable part of the Kingdome and the
Petitioners the beſt part of London; and the moſt to bee valued in other
parts, are inclined to the ſame requeſt for peace, therefore the Parliament
ought to yeeld.</p>
            <p>When our Adverſaries pleaſe, they can alledge numbers for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as if the Major part of the people were cordially on the Kings
ſide: when they pleaſe they can give you reaſons why the major part
of the people are inchanted, and therfore cannot be on the Kings ſide;
yet we all know the major part cannot be both for and againſt the
King at the ſame time in the ſame caſe. Beſides divide <hi>England</hi> into 3.
parts, and we doe not allow <hi>London</hi> to be the major of thoſe three, and
divide <hi>London</hi> into 3. parts, and the Petitioners cannot make it appear,
that they are full one third part; this muſt be attributed to our Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
boldneſſe meerly. That which is manifeſt, is, that moſt of the
faulty, and decayed Nobility, and Gentry, are of the Kings party, and ſo
are the Lees of the people; but almoſt all of the Yeomenry (which is the
moſt conſiderable ranke of any Nation) and a very choyſe part both of
Nobility and Gentry at this time ſide againſt the King and the Papiſts:
And it is impoſſible for any rationall man to imagine, that the King
has not infinite advantages againſt the Parliament, if his cauſe be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
apprehended, as the more juſt: But ſenſe teaches us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that no King in the unjuſteſt cauſe that ever was, had a weaker
party then this King, conſidering what courſes he has taken. The
King has an Army, and ſuch an Army as is able to force and overawe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:155894:13"/>
all places where they lye, with ſwords drawne over the Peſants: but
curſed be that man for my part, that next after God, would not referre
the arbitration of this difference to the publike vote of the people. And
yet we know that there is a great deal of ſervilty in the people, and that
for the moſt part, they looke no further then to preſent grievances; like
<hi>Eſau</hi> in his Pottage bargain, chuſing rather to dy for ever of a Lethargy
then to ſweat for a time under a Feaver.</p>
            <p>5. All Controverſies are determined either by the Dye of Force, and
chance of War (for ſo Nations have ever cenſur'd that kind of tryall)
or elſe they are concluded by Lawes juſtly interpreted, or elſe there is
a middle way (which we call Accommodation) and that is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when to avoid the miſchiefe of the Sword, and the uncertaine intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
of Judgement, both parties by mutuall agreement condiſcend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
to depart from the rigor of their demands on either ſide, and ſo
comply, accommodate, and meet together upon termes as equall as may
be. Wherſoever then the word <hi>Accommodation</hi> is preſſed, (as it is now
with us in the <hi>London</hi> Petition, for the word Submiſſion is not at all
uſed) 'tis moſt abſurd and contradictory to exclude a yeelding and
compliance of both ſides. See then the manifeſt unjuſtice of our Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
who when the matter of <hi>Accommodation</hi> onely is in Treaty, <hi>yet
urges us to a meere ſubmiſsion,</hi> and taking it for granted that he is Judge,
and that he has determined the matter for the King; <hi>therfore the King
ought not to condiſcend, or comply at all, or leave any thing to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
truſt, but muſt wholly be truſted in every point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The King requires to have preſerved to him for the future that
compaſſe of Royall power which his Progenitors have been inveſted
with, and without which he cannot give protection to his Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Parliament deſires to have preſerved to the Subject, peace, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and all thoſe priviledges which their Anceſtors have enjoyed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they cannot be a Nation, much leſſe a free Nation. Now
the Militia and Poſſe of the Kingdome muſt be ſo placed, and concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited,
and that the King may be as equally aſſured of it, as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or elſe without all Accommodation the King muſt be left to the
Fidelity and duty of Parliament, or elſe the Parliament muſt be wholly
left to the Kings diſcretion, or rather to the Kings party. In this caſe
what ſhall be done, the Parliament pleads that the King has reſigned
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:155894:14"/>
himſelfe too far into the hands of Papiſts and Malignants, from whom
nothing can be expected but perfidie and cruelty; The King objects
that the Parliament is beſotted with Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, Familiſts,
and Impoſtors, from whom nothing can be expected but diſloyalty
and confuſion. If the King here will grant any ſecurity againſt Papiſts
and Malignants, the queſtion is what ſecurity he will give; and if hee
will give none, the queſtion is how he can be ſaid to ſeeke an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation;
ſo on the contrary, if the Parliament will undertake to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the King, as that is granted, then what muſt that ſecurance be. I
will now take it for granted, that the King ought to abjure for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the giving of countenance to Papiſts, or being counſelled or led by
them in State matters; as alſo to disband his Forces, and that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
will doe the like, and abjure all dangerous Schiſmaticks and
Hereticks. But for a further tye to ſtrengthen this abjuration, and for a
ſecurance againſt Malignants, who are not yet ſo perfectly diſtinguiſht
on either ſide, what ſhall be the reciprocall caution or ingagement?
Shall the King have all Forts, Ships, Armes, and Offices in his diſpoſe?
Shall the King aſſigne to what Judges he pleaſes, the diviſion of our
quarrels? or ſhall he truſt his Parliament in the choiſe and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of perſons intruſted? I will not diſpute this, I will onely ſay, that
the nature of an <hi>Accommodation</hi> requires ſome condeſcending on both
ſides, and it is manifeſt injuſtice in the Replicant to prejudge the ſame,
as unbeſeeming the King more then the Parliament, and in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
the Parliament is likely to condiſcend upon more diſadvantageous
termes then the King; and is leſſe lyable to be miſſed, and leſſe apt to
break a truſt, then any one man.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>To ſhew that the Parliament is disaffected to an Accommodation, and
the King not, &amp; that therefore a Petition to the Parliament is more proper &amp;
ſeaſonable then to the King.</hi> The Replicant <hi>bitterly reviles the Parliament
as having puniſhed ſome for ſeeking peace, and as having rejected the Kings
gracious offers of peace with termes of incivility below the reſpect due to a
King.</hi> What more damnable crimes can any man load the Parliament
with, then with rebelling againſt the King firſt, &amp; after rejecting officers
of peace with foule and ſcandalous language? <hi>Yet this the Replicant free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grants to himſelfe,</hi> and as if hee were placed in ſome tribunall above
the Parliament, where all allegations and proofes were utterly ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<hi>he proceeds to ſentence very imperiouſly.</hi> For ought I know I am as
venerable and unqueſtionable a judge in this caſe as hee is, yet I dare
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:155894:14"/>
condemn nothing, but raſh and preſumptuous condemning of authority
without proofes; and for that I have Scripture it ſelfe for my proofe.
As for the Kings comming to <hi>Brainford</hi> in a miſt, and during a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and there ſurpriſing men unprepared, and retiring againe upon the
drawing up of our forces, that theſe are inſtances of ſeeking peace, and
ſhewing favour to the city is not ſo cleare to my underſtanding as to the
Replicants.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>But ſayes the Replicant,</hi> you grant that the people may perhaps find
out a better way of Accommodation <hi>then you have</hi> done, and you allow them
to petition when you faile of your duty: And this muſt needs overthrow the
ſtrongeſt and moſt popular argument of your innocence, and authority.</p>
            <p>The Parliament did never aſſume to have an abſolute freedome from
all failes or Errors, nor does detract from other mens knowledge, it
vindicates nothing more then to bee leſſe obnoxious to deceit and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe
then other Courts, and that the rather becauſe it diſdaines not
any adviſe or reaſon from any parties whatſoever.</p>
            <p>9. The Anſwerer demanded from the Petitioners a modell of
an <hi>Accommodation</hi> to bee framed by them, for the better help and
inſtruction of the Parliament. The Replicant ſatisfies that Demand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Hee makes two propoſitions thus; 1 <hi>That the Parliament ſhall as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſent to the Kings Rights as the King conſents to theirs. 2. That the
Reigne of Queen</hi> Elizabeth: <hi>may be the meaſure to determine thoſe rights.</hi>
In this the Replicant is very reaſonable; for we freely ſubmit to both his
propoſitions: but he is not ſo Politick as he thinks; for a ſubmiſſion to
theſe generall propoſitions, will not determine any one of our Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
debates. Let us be ſafe, as wee were in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, and
let us be ſecured of our ſafety by the ſame meanes, as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
ſecured us; That is, by ſhewing no countenance to Papiſts (much leſſe
admitting them as Counſellors, leaſt of all as Governors in her higheſt
Councells) let wiſe men generally loved and revered ſit at the Councell
Table, and let the Publick adviſe of Parliament ſway above all private;
let our Lawes be in the Cuſtody of learned, and uncorrupt Iudges, and
let our <hi>Militia</hi> be under the Command of ſuch renowned Patriots, as
ſhee preferred in her dayes; and our <hi>Accommodation</hi> is more ample,
and beneficiall, then any we have yet deſired. But our Replicant will
ſuggeſt, <hi>Be you ſuch Subjects as Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>ruled,</hi> and <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:155894:15"/>
Charles <hi>will treat you, as Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>did her Subjects: doe you right
firſt to the King and the King will not faile to doe right to you.</hi> Here is now
the maine Queſtion indeed, which rightly ſolved, would ſolve all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe deplorable miſeries, which have of late vexed and grieved our
three Nations, have rather hapned from the Change of the People, or
from the Change of the Prince.</p>
            <p>And moſt certaine it is future Ages will conceive no great doubt, or
difficulty to be in this Queſtion: but now it is mortall to diſpute it: it
is ſcarce lawfull to ſuppoſe any thing herein, Though <hi>ſupponere</hi> be not
<hi>ponere</hi> but by way of ſuppoſition, I will only plead thus: if the three
Nations have by I know not what fatall poſture, and Congreſſe of ſtars,
or ſuperior Cauſes, declined from their allegiance, and degenerated into
unnaturall obſtinacy, and turned recreant, and contrary to the ſweet <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
which was ever in their Anceſtors, they are bound to ſubmit to
the King &amp; to put in him as full and abſolute a Truſt, as our Parents did
in Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> but on the contrary, if miſcarriages in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the pernicious Counſells whereby our Princes have been
guided, have overwhelmed us in theſe inundations of blood, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes;
the Alteration, and Reformation, ought to begin firſt in the
King, and He cannot expect that we ſhould truſt him ſo farre as we
did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> untill we are aſſured as fully of his protection as
we were of Queen <hi>Elizabeths;</hi> but ſuppoſe there have been faults on
both ſides, can nothing but the ſword rectifie our faults? I never yet
heard that any Prince was forced to a warre with any conſiderable
part of his own Subjects, but that he had an unjuſt cauſe, or might have
determined the ſtrife without bloud by ſome Politick Complyance if
he pleaſed. It is not ſo common or probable in nature, for Nations cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
to rebell, as for Princes wickedly to oppreſſe: and when armes are
taken up on both ſides, it is not ſo ſafe for Subjects to yeeld, as for Kings;
nor can Subjects ſo eaſily reduce Kings to a peaceable agreement, and
ceſſation of Armes, as Kings may Subjects for the ſparing of blood.
Kings can make no compoſition almoſt diſhonourable, or diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;
but Subjects being falne into the indignation of revengfull Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are neceſſitated commonly to this choyce, either to come forth
with halters about their necks, or to fight upon great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as Rebellious as the Subjects of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> were, a kind,
nay, a Civill Anſwer might have retayned them in their allegiance,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:155894:15"/>
and yet if their termes had been full of inſolence, and their Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
more unreaſonable, yet <hi>Salomon's</hi> Councellors would have
perſwaded <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to yield to neceſſity, and to maſter that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
by ſome fineneſſe of wit, which he could not Tame for the
preſent by violence; And certainly he ſhewed not himſelf the Son
of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that would not purchaſe an hereditary Empire over a
gallant Nation by being a Servant for one day, that would quit
his own policy, becauſe the multitude had quitted their civilitie,
that thought that Complyance which ſhould gaine a ſcepter more
diſhonourable, than that Conteſtation which ſhould abſolutly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
one. How eaſy had it been for the great, the wiſe, the terrible
<hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to have prevented the totall defection of ſo many
goodly Provinces in the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> and if it could not have been
done without ſomething which is ordinarily accounted below, a K.
would not that have been more honourably done by him, then the
caſting away of ſo brave a Dominion, and the caſting after that ſo
much blood &amp; treaſure? That King of <hi>France</hi> was far wiſer, and ſped
better, which ſatisfied himſelfe in his ſtrugling through many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
with this Maxime, That a Prince can looſe no honour
by any Treaty, which addes to his Dominion. Infinite inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
might here bee alleadged, but they are needleſſe. God ſend
our King truly to repreſent theſe things to himſelfe, and
rather to truſt plain, then pleaſing advice. God open his eyes, that
he may ſee how honorably, and eaſily he might heve preuented theſe
calamities, and may yet ſtanch our bleeding wounds; and how much

<hi>Hen.</hi> the 4. was as wiſe, as valiant, and as juſt a Prince as ever was
Crowned in <hi>England,</hi> and no Prince ever had by experience a more

               </gap>g of the Engliſh Genius: yet he in his death
bed (where diſſimulation uſes to be laid aſide) in his laſt advice to
his own ſon and heire (whom it was not likely he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deceive) deciphered the Engliſh Nation to be generally obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of their Princes, and whilſt they were well treated, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in Peace and plenty, moſt incomparable for their perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
loyalty, but of all nations the moſt unquiet under ſuch a
harſh rule, which ſhould render them ſervile, poore and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</p>
            <p>This he had abundantly prooved, and found true by the wofull
depoſition of his unpolitick Kinſman and predeceſſor <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:155894:16"/>
and his own proſperous, and glorious Raigne, and many ſtrange
traverſes of Fortune, which throughout his whole Raigne. He
was forced to encounter withall. His ſcope therefore was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to his ſons charge this Nation both as dutifull, and as
generous, of whoſe loyalty he needs not to doubt, ſo long
as his Iuſtice was not to be douhted. O that this moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Prince could bee againe ſummoned from his peacefull
Monument to repeate the ſame advertiſſements in our Soveraignes
eares, and to juſtle out of his preſence theſe bloud thirſty Papiſts
and Malignants, which uſe all poſſible art to ſtaine the peoples loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and to candy over all his actions, intending thereby not to
reconcile the people by procuring grace from the King, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
both King and people, by foſtering enmity between both?
I will only adde this by ſuch inſtigations, as our Replicant and his
fellow Courtiers uſe, the King cannot be happy, but by the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of war, that is by making his ſubjects miſerable: but
ſuch Traytors as I am, if our adviſe bee entertained, propoſe
to the King a more certaine way to happineſſe by Peace
that is by making his ſubjects yet more happy; but our Replicant
ſaith, <hi>the King is willing to condeſcend to any thing, but you will admit of
no reconciliation, except the King will remove thoſe ſervants, whom he
had found moſt honeſt and faithfull in his afflictions, and prefer you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving
in their place.</hi> Here is the grand knot indeed, we oppoſe
ſuch as have been the Counſellors or inſtruments of ſuch and ſuch
deſignes: <hi>the King, ſaith, they are his friends, and he cannot abandon
his friends:</hi> 'tis confeſt, the King ought not to abandon his friends,
but the King may erre in the knowledge of friends: and as he ought
to protect his friends, in whom he cannot err; ſo he is not bound
to protect ſuch as he meerly thinks his friends, and in whom if he
will beleeve the voyce of the people, he is very much deceived. We
have as much intereſt in the Kings friends and Counſellors as we
have in our Laws, Liberties, lifes, any thing, for we know we can
enjoy nothing if the King ſhall owne thoſe for his friends, whom
we know to be our enemies, and account of theſe as good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeils,
which we know to be treaſons againſt the State, that Prince
that will be arbitrary and rely upon his owne meer opinion, and
diſcretion in the imployment of Counſellors and Miniſters of State,
having no regard to publique approbation therein, is as injurions
altogether as he that will admit of no other Law, judge, nor rule
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:155894:16"/>
in the propriety and liberty of his ſubjects, but his owne breſt
only.</p>
            <p>It will be replyed, not fancy, but ſenſe teaches this, that he that
obeyes the Kings commands, and fights under the Kings Standart
is more a friend than he that diſobeyes, and fight againſt the King:
this is demonſtration, no error can be in it.</p>
            <p>I anſwer no, 'tis moſt falſe, Scripture and reaſon manifeſt it to be
moſt falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doeg</hi> did obey <hi>Saul,</hi> when all his other ſervants denyed obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
yet even in that obedience he made himſelfe culpable, and
his maſter abominable, whereas the other ſervants of <hi>Saul</hi> were du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
in withholding an unlawfull duty.</p>
            <p>So thoſe 3000 Souldiers which marched out after <hi>Saul</hi> to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the life of juſt and uncondemned <hi>David,</hi> they were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in a baſe diſſervice to <hi>Saul,</hi> they are not to be juſtified for this
ſervice; whereas thoſe 600 valiant men which accompanied <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
in his dangers and afflictions and were ready with their ſword
drawn to guard that innocence, which <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf ſhould have
guarded are not to be accounted falſe to <hi>Saul</hi> but true to <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the meere preſence of <hi>Saul</hi> on the one ſide, did not make the
cauſe injuſt on the other ſide, nor if himſelf had fallen by ruſhing
oftentimes, upon defenſive weapons, could that horrid guilt of his
death, have been imputed to any but to himſelf. Curſed therefore,
yea thrice curſed be theſe miſcreants, which ingage the King in this
war againſt the Parliam not without hazard of his ſacred Perſon, if
they be private perſons and have not ſufficiency to decide this great
controverſie betwixt the King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>For my part I dare not pronounce ſentence, neither for nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Parliament, as the Replicant without all ſcruples doth in
all places; but I may ſafely ſay, that if the King does, though in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
unjuſtly wage war againſt the Parliament; the E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and
his Army may far more lawfully fight in defence of that ſupreame
Court, than <hi>David</hi> and his followers did for the protection of one
innocent private man.</p>
            <p>And taking the controverſie as undecided, 'tis not apparent who
fight for or againſt the King, and the King may himſelf as lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
claime to be ſole ſupreme judge over all ſingle and univerſal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and over all Laws and Courts, and in all caſes whatſoever, as
to claime any man a Traitor for ſerving the Parliament in this war;
and this if he claimes, what Priviledge remaines to Parliament, what
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:155894:17"/>
limits remaine to the Prince: what liberty remain is to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?</p>
            <p>'Tis not only then trayterous, but ridiculous in the Replicant
to aſſume that ſupremacy to himſelf which is denyed to the King
by condemning the Parliament and juſtifying the Kings party in
all paſſages of this War, we when we except againſt the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
aſperſe not at all the Kings perſon, and the Law it ſelf makes
ever a diſtinction betwixt the King and his agents: though our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant
will not allow any ſuch feverance: but betwixt the Parl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>am.
and its inſtruments no ſuch feverance is except for the worſe, for
there <hi>pejor eſt author quam actor,</hi> but ſayes the Replicant. <hi>'Tis the
unhappineſſe of the King that he hath a par<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, 'tis the fault of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

and many other of the Queens devoted Creatures are prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Kings favour before the Parliament. And 'tis the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
fault, that <hi>Rivers, King.</hi> and the Titular Court of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi>
with ſome other Iriſh Papiſts latly come over have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Court, command of the Camp, and ſpoyle of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to reward them, whilſt <hi>Mancheſter, Hambden, Hellis, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>im,
Strod, Haſelrig,</hi> are deſigned for the block, and that upon ſuch
charges, as ſhall intangle almoſt all the moſt eminent Gentry and
Nobility, as well as them, <hi>That this is the Kings unhappineſſe is ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,</hi>
but that this is the Parliaments fault is not proved by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant,
and we are not bound alwayes to abate him proofes in
matters of this conſequence. Doubtleſſe we are likely to expect great
performances from Parliaments hereafter if it ſhall be guilt in them
that they are rejected, and if they ſhall be rejected only becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more favoring Courtiers pretend better affection to the Kings
private advantage.</p>
            <p>The actions of Popiſh and Malignant Courtyers, cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them more friendly to the K. than the Parliaments. No honour
or proſperity has followed hitherto therupon all their difference is
that their ſingle profeſſions of Love are more credited, than ſuch as
are credited by the Votes of the Generality, and atteſtations of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>Howſoever though many men do think, private adviſe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
to be more valuable, and fit for Princes to hearken too,
then publick, I never till now heard, that it was a fault or blame in
Parliaments to be leſſe valued or accepted then private perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:155894:17"/>
To what purpoſe is it ſaid? <hi>that the King ought to have the whole:</hi>
it is our complaint that the King will not accept of the whole: and
it is the Replicants complaint, that the King is not ſuffered to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the whole. This ſhall reconcile all: let the whole be received as
the whole; and every part as it is Major, or Minor be entertained
in grace and equipage proportionably, and this difference is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>10 <hi>But ſayes the Replicant,</hi> the Kings party is the more juſt, and
therefore to be preferred, and this is to be judged of by rule; as thus; the
Parliament intrenches upon our Liberty by impriſoning without cauſe,
according to pleaſure and claimes to be unquestionable therein: The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
intrenches upon Religion by committing our beſt Profeſſors, and
planting Sectaries in their ſtead, the Parliament proceeds according to
reaſon of State, not Law: and this places an arbitrary power in them,
and makes ordinances equall to acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Heare in a breif ſumme all that ever has been ſpoken, or can be
ſpoken againſt the Parliament; and all this is grounded upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granted
propoſition, that the Parliament has no right to defend it
ſelf: For if it be lawfull for both Houſes of Parliament to defend
themſelves, it muſt of neceſſity follow, that they may and muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon,
levye moneyes, ſuppreſſe ſeditious preachers, and make uſe
of an arbitrary power according to reaſon of State, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
themſelves to meere expedients of Law. Enough has been ſaid
of this, 'tis impoſſible that any wiſe man ſhould be oppoſite herein,
and the Kings party have more recourſe to reaſon of State, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rary
power by far than we have.</p>
            <p>But if it be ſaid, <hi>that the Houſes</hi> abuſe arbitrary power in impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
levying moneyes &amp;c. cauſeleſly; this is a falſe calumny, and not
to be granted without particular and pregnant proofes, of which
the Replicant produces none at all, were it not for this great noiſe
and boaſt of Arbitrary power, our Academians would want matter
to ſtuffe their in numerable pamphlets withall: and the ſillyer ſort
of Malignants would want fuell to feed their enmity.</p>
            <p>And yet we know, Arbitrary power is only dangerous in one
man or in a few men, and cannot be ſo in Parliaments at any time;
much leſſe in times of publick diſtreſſe: for then it is not only harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
but neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons without the other States hath had an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
power at all times, to diſpoſe of the treaſure of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and where they give away one ſubſidy, they may give 20,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:155894:18"/>
and where they give 50000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> at one ſubſidy they may give fifty
times ſo much, and all this whether war or peace be.</p>
            <p>Yet when did either King or Subject complaine of this arbitrary
power? Nay if any parts of the Kingdom have repined at the abuſe
of this arbitrary power, and refuſed to pay ſubſidys aſſeſſed by the
houſe of Commons, what Kings would ſuffer it? when was it not
held a good ground of War? ſo both Houſes have an arbitrary
power to abridge the freedom of the Subject, and to inlarge the
Kings prerogative, beyond a meaſure; they may repeale our great
Charter, the Charter of Forreſts, and the petition of right if they
pleaſe, they may if they pleaſe ſubject the whole Kingdom for ever
to the ſame arbitrary rule as <hi>France</hi> grones under, nay, &amp; they have
often been with force and all manner of ſollicitations almoſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented
into it: and yet notwithſtanding all this, we are neither ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed
nor indangered at all by this arbitrary power in both houſes.</p>
            <p>To have then an arbitrary power placed in the Peers and Comm.
is naturall and expedient at all times, but the very uſe of this arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
power, according to reaſon of State, and warlick policy in
times of generall dangers and diſtreſſe is abſolutely neceſſary and
inevitable: but 'tis a great offence, <hi>that both Houſes ſhould make ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
generally binding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They, which would take from us all meanes of defence; if they
could diſpute us out of the power of making temporary Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
had their wils upon us, for defence without ſome obliging
power to preſerve order, and to regulate the method of defence,
would be vaine and abſurd; but this is but one branch of arbitrary
power and reaſon of State, and to waſt time in proving it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in times of extremity, if defence be granted lawfull, were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the Replicant, ſo far as he hath ſpoken to
the matter, I ſhall now come to his emergent, ſtrange, calumnious
ſpeeches, againſt the perſons of ſuch and ſuch men, but this were
<hi>Caninos rodere dentes.</hi> I forbeare it, only rehearſing ſome raylings,
which need no anſwer but themſelves.</p>
            <p>The two houſes are generally railed at, <hi>as guilty of Rebellion againſt
the King.</hi> All adherents to Parliament are railed at, <hi>as Anabaptiſts,
Separatists, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord Major is railed at, for preventing bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in the City, when the Petitioners under the pretence of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Peace, had many of them plotted diſſention, and this his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is <hi>ſtiled the ſtiffling of peace in the womb.</hi>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:155894:18"/>
               <hi>The City Preachers are railed at, for ſatisfying our Conſciences in
the juſtifiableneſſe of a defenſive war, for this they are charged to</hi>
fight againſt the King in the feare of God, and to turn the spirituall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
into weapons of the fleſh. <hi>The framer of the Anſwer is rayled at
for giving the Petitioners juſt ſatisfaction in peaceable language.</hi>
Though his words be confeſſed to be ſofter than oyle, <hi>yet 'ts ſaid,</hi> that the
poyſon of Aspes is under his lips; <hi>he is called a</hi> Cataline, the firebrand of
his Countrey, whoſe ſophistry and eloquence was fit to diſturbe a State,
but unable to compoſe or ſetle it.</p>
            <p>The judgment of all theſe things is now ſubmitted to the world,
what the intent of the Petition was, in ſome maſter-plotters and
contrivers of it, will appeare by the arguments of this fell Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.
Whereby it is now ſeconded. That the name of an Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
was pretended to force the two Houſes under colour therof,
to caſt themſelves upon a meer ſubmiſſion, or to be made odious, and
lookt upon as foes to peace, which was a <hi>Scilla</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis</hi>
(on the other) is here manifeſted. Whether the Anſwer to the
Petition ſavour of ſo much malice and enmity to peace, as this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
does, let indifferent men cenſure,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, whether the ſoule of that man which thirſts for a firme
Peace, may not diſlike theſe practiſes of pretending to it; and the
ſoule of that man which hates peace, may not make advantage of the
name of peace, let all wiſe men proved and examine.</p>
