            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Poem, whereof Mr. <hi>TOLAND</hi> is the Author, was handed about a good while in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript before I could get a sight of it; tho, by reason of the differing Characters and Iudgments it underwent, I left no stone unturn'd to procure it. And I must confess that after a Friend had at last oblig'd me with it, I could discover none of those monstrous, pernicious, most terrible, and intolerable things which some weak-sighted or envious people reported. But there's something so new and singular in the management of it that highly pleas'd me; and I verily believe that one or two of my acquaintance were frighted, not so much at the Contents, as at the Writer's poetical Liberty in his ranting and <hi>AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANZOR</hi>-like strain, as if they thought he would in good earnest buckle on his Armor, or fasten Wings to his shoulders, and go about to perform in person what he would gladly leave others the honour of atchieving at his persuasion, contenting himself with such a moderate part of the Action as might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably fall to one man's share. But taking my leave of these Gentlemen, I think my self bound rather to offer my excuses to him for making this publication without his consent. I know Poetry is not his Business, how much soever it may be his Diversion; and that particularly this <hi>Scheme of his Studies</hi> was never intended to be communicated to the World. I am wholly ignorant what induc'd him first to write it, or why he did it in Verse, which is a Talent on which he was never heard to value himself beyond a Song or such slight performances. But this I learnt, that having given Copies of it to a few private Friends, and these (as it commonly happens) to their Friends,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:99874:3"/>
it came at last into the hands of more persons than were friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, honest, or judicious, as I need not tell those who heard the strange representations that were made of it; tho I cannot see how it should be displeasing to any, but such as are angry at bottom that Liberty and Religion are prefer'd to Slavery and Superstition. At least there's nothing of it inconsistent with our own establish'd Government and Church, of both which we may without vanity affirm that they are the most excellent of their kinds: no National Religion being less interested, or more rational; and no other Commonwealth being now so free, or having so good a Foundation and Disposition to attain all the perfections of Government. Therefore, after I had fully assur'd my self that the Poem was of his composition, I knew no better way of doing him the office of a true Friend, than by letting every body see how little ground there was for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of his peevish Accusers. By <hi>CLITO</hi> is meant a certain eminent Man, who is no more suppos'd to have held this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, or to be of all these Opinions, than the principal persons in <hi>PLATO</hi>'s or <hi>CICERO</hi>'s Dialogues to have said what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we read of 'em there, tho introduc'd for the dignity of the Subject, and as a mark of the Author's esteem. Mr. <hi>TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND</hi> himself is understood by <hi>ADEISIDAEMON,</hi> which signifies <hi>Unsuperstitious,</hi> and is a Name these same Lines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to be very proper. Whether <hi>VICTORINA</hi> be only a Fiction, or the designation of a real Mistriss, good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will not let us too curiously enquire: but be this as it will, such a Character was absolutely necessary to assuage that Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which (as the Poets speak) inspir'd him with so much fury before. All the rest is plain enough, and consequently there needs no longer Preface to so short a Book.</p>
