            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Delenda Carthago. OR, The True Interest of <hi>England,</hi> in Relation to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS the Happiness of our Scituation secures us from the Invasion of any, who are not our Masters at Sea: The same Reason makes it altogether against the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> to seek to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large her Dominions by Conquest, upon the Continent: For the Charge of Transporting, besides the Accidents of the Sea, is such Odds, as she can never wage an equal War.</p>
            <p>The Truth of this will appear to any who shall read the Wars of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the vast Expence of Blood and Treasure, the many Hinderances and Disappointments in sending our Reliefs by Sea; and, after the most prosperous Successes, the little Effect and Final Loss of all.</p>
            <p>Which indeed prov'd our greatest Benefit, by sending us to live at Home. And I think it very plain that the loss of <hi>Callice,</hi> and ridding our Hands of all the Seeds of War, the <hi>Garrisons</hi> we had in <hi>France,</hi> was exceedingly for the Advantage of <hi>England:</hi> We call'd them <hi>Bridles</hi> upon <hi>France,</hi> but they prov'd <hi>Sponges</hi> to us, and drain'd more Money from us (and sometimes Men) than, if em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd upon the <hi>Fleet,</hi> would have enabled us to bridle <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Seas,</hi> and to have extended the Privilege of the <hi>Flag</hi> to both Worlds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fleet</hi> are the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> To Command at <hi>Sea,</hi> not to make Conquests by <hi>Land,</hi> is the true Interest of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same Reason makes it the Interest of <hi>France,</hi> not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with us. He can extend his Conquests with fifty times less Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Hazard upon the Continent. Nor does he desire more of <hi>England</hi> than not to hurt him.</p>
            <p>Accordingly we find that <hi>France</hi> has always endeavoured to live well with <hi>England</hi>; and indeed they have courted us, and always shewed a more particular Kindness to the <hi>English Gentry,</hi> than to any other Nations, who travelled thither for their Education.</p>
            <p>And when we were lately obliged to declare War against them (for we began with them) yet it was not for any Injury they had done to us, nor had we one to instance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61883:2"/>
And by the Issue of all the Wars that <hi>England</hi> ever yet had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>France,</hi> it plainly appears to be the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to have no War with <hi>France</hi>; at least never to carry our Arms into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For suppose the best, the utmost you can propose, even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>France,</hi> as we did once before: How shall we keep it; What Armies of <hi>English</hi> must we always have there to prevent their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling? Would transplanting of all <hi>England</hi> serve the Turn? Sure such a Conquest would drain and ruine <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Indies</hi> have <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But suppose we had it and could keep it: Our King would make his Residence in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> would become a <hi>Province</hi> like <hi>Flanders,</hi> when their <hi>Earls</hi> came to be <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>; Or as <hi>Scotland</hi> is now to <hi>England,</hi> which was wisely foreseen by <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. when he, for that very Reason, married his <hi>Eldest</hi> Daughter to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and his <hi>Younger</hi> to <hi>France</hi>; thinking it much more the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>England</hi> to have the Accession to <hi>Scotland</hi> than of <hi>France</hi>; the <hi>Greater</hi> always swallowing up the <hi>Less,</hi> as <hi>Rivers</hi> are lost in the <hi>Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then is the Interest of <hi>England</hi> as to <hi>France</hi>? Surely, to grow great at <hi>Sea,</hi> and command the <hi>Trade,</hi> which is our <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; but, by all means, to let alone their <hi>Continent</hi>; where a <hi>Conquest</hi> would prove our own <hi>Destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now look how our Interest stands as to <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Interest that governs Kingdoms. Nations do not fall in Love with one another, as particular Persons do for their Beauty. The Publick still moves by <hi>Interest,</hi> and that will never lye.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> all the World knows is <hi>Trade.</hi> It is <hi>Advantageous</hi> to others; but it is <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ry</hi> to them. Their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent</hi> cannot make them live: Therefore whoever rivals their <hi>Trade</hi> must be irreconcilable to them; nor can they ever be true and hearty to such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> has been their only mighty <hi>Rival</hi> for the <hi>Trade</hi> of the VVorld: VVhence that wise <hi>Chanc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> in his Speech to the Parliament, 5. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1672. lays it down as a Maxim never to be forgot in <hi>England. Let this be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred</hi> (saith he) <hi>The States of</hi> Holland <hi>are</hi> England's <hi>eternal Enemy, both by Interest and Inclination</hi>: And he gives the Reason, because
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61883:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we are <hi>their only Competitor for</hi> Trade <hi>and</hi> Power <hi>at</hi> Sea, <hi>and who only stand in their Way to an</hi> universal Empire, <hi>as great as</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>Then he shews how true they have been to their <hi>Interests,</hi> in working all the Miscief they could to <hi>England,</hi> not only by <hi>violent,</hi> but <hi>false</hi> and <hi>treacherous</hi> Ways: And he instances in their <hi>Breach</hi> of <hi>Treaties,</hi> both in the <hi>Surinam</hi> and <hi>East-India</hi> Business; and their <hi>heighth of Insolence,</hi> to deny us the <hi>Honour and Right</hi> of the <hi>Flag</hi>; and that, though it had been owned by them in the Treaty of <hi>Breda, yet they disputed the King's Title to it in all the Courts of</hi> Christendom, <hi>and made great Offers to the</hi> French <hi>King, if he would stand by them against us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, He compares <hi>them</hi> to <hi>Carthage</hi>; and <hi>us</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, that it was impossible both should stand upon a Ballance; that if we do not master their <hi>Trade,</hi> they will ours. <hi>They</hi> or <hi>We</hi> must <hi>truckle.</hi> One must and will give the Law to the other.

            </p>
            <p>No Treaties, no Alliances will, or ever did bind them to us, longer than till they could make an Advantage by us. After a firm Treaty in 1619, ensued the Murder of the <hi>Engl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <q>
               <p>Since K. <hi>James</hi> the First (says he) reigned in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> they have neither kept any League in reference to <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce:</hi> That rich Trade we had into the <hi>East Indies,</hi> at <hi>Japan, Amboyna, Banda</hi> and the <hi>Moluccoes,</hi> is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ruined: Our Islands of <hi>Poleran, Palaway, Lantere</hi> unjustly seiz'd into their hands; and the Damages we suffered there are computed in 1653, at 1656233<hi>l.</hi> 15<hi>s.</hi> and we are now totally excluded those <hi>Seas</hi> by these <hi>Hollanders</hi>—Their Usurpations there have been accompanied with Barbarities and Outrages—Besides the Cruelties of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> they exercised innumerable others, as appears by the Depositions from 1616 to 1620: Printed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don A.

               <p>The <hi>English</hi> Ships being taken and their Goods confiscated, the Captains, Souldiers, Factors and Mariners were made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, clogg'd with Irons, kept in Stocks, bound Hand and Foot,

The <hi>Tower</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly viewed, and its Surprise ordered by Boats over the Moat, and from thence to scale the Wall; one <hi>Alexander,</hi> who is not yet taken, had likewise distributed Sums of Money to these Conspirators, and for the carrying on of the Design more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, they were told of a Council of the Great ones, that far frequently in <hi>London,</hi> from whom issued all Orders; which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil received their Directions from another in <hi>Holland,</hi> who fate with the <hi>States</hi>; and that the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>September</hi> was pitched on for the Attempt, as being found by <hi>Lilly's</hi> Almanack, and a Scheme erected for that purpose, to be a Lucky Day, a Planet then rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Prognosticated the downfal of <hi>Monarchy.</hi> The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against these Persons was very full and clear, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly found guilty of High Treason.</q> These are the Words of that <hi>Gazette</hi>; and let me only mind the Reader, That the City was fired the very Day which was there mentioned; that is, the Fire began about 12 at Night, the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 66, or early on the 3<hi>d,</hi> which was the first Day of the Fire</p>
            <p>This makes it a Demonstration, that the <hi>DutSh</hi> Plot, mentioned in that <hi>Gazette,</hi> could be no Contrivance of the Government, in Odium to the <hi>Dutch</hi>; if that could be so much as suggested, or so base an Imputation laid, not only upon the <hi>Court</hi> but the <hi>City it self,</hi> which, in her Sessions, should take away the Lives of Men for any such <hi>Sham Plot:</hi> I say nothing of this can be possible, unless you will suppose, that the <hi>Government</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> both designed the burning of the City upon that Day (and if so they would not have told it); or otherwise that they had the Spirit of <hi>Prophesy,</hi> to foretel the burning of the City five Months before it came to pass.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61883:4"/>
But these Conspirators had laid their Design, and would not slip that Lucky Day, the 3d of <hi>September,</hi> on which <hi>Oliver</hi> conquered first <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the Battle of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and after the Loyal Party in <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Worcester</hi> Fight; both which happened to be upon the 3d of <hi>September,</hi> which <hi>Oliver</hi> reckoned to be his <hi>Lucky Day</hi>; and it held so to him to the end: For on that day he brought the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Blessing to <hi>England</hi> that ever Subject did: On that day only he verified what he had so often promised, to relieve <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and to open the way to a <hi>Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> all this he performed, for on that day, on his own Lucky Day, he died, or, as his <hi>Enthusiast Banditi</hi> boasted, was carried, like <hi>Elijah,</hi> to Heaven in a <hi>Whirlwind</hi>; whither that carried him, or whence it was sent, we will not examin; only we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, That he who raised <hi>Rebellion</hi> to cure <hi>Superstition,</hi> observ'd his <hi>Lucky Days</hi>; and these Conspirators of whom we are speaking, were some of his Godly Army. These gain'd with <hi>Dutch Reformers,</hi> not only <hi>observe Days,</hi> but cast <hi>Schemes</hi> and go to <hi>Fortune-Tellers,</hi> any thing—go to the <hi>Devil</hi> himself, for the <hi>Good Old Cause</hi>! The End sanctifies the Means.</p>
            <p>How far the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Chain may reach, I cannot tell. But if there be such a thing as <hi>Spells,</hi> to cause Men <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hate</hi>; most certainly the <hi>Dutch</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ve made us drunk with it: Not only to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Dote</hi> upon them, who, at this very Day, use all our Men like Doggs, who go over thither to fight for their Countrey (which they will not do themselves) and Clip our Money publickly, which, when they have done, they pay to the <hi>English</hi> only (for no other Nation will take it from them) by the <hi>Coyn,</hi> and will receive it from <hi>them</hi> only by the <hi>Weight</hi>; which is proclaiming us for <hi>Fools</hi> to our Faces: And as such, they have begg'd us. To fall in Love with these <hi>Dutch,</hi> who use us ten times worse, when we fight for them, and take less care of our Sick and Wounded, than the <hi>French</hi> against whom we fight! And yet to hate and abhor the <hi>French,</hi> the more they court us! As if it were the <hi>Nature</hi> as it is the <hi>Character</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where given of an <hi>Englishman,</hi> to be <hi>won</hi> by <hi>Injuries,</hi> and <hi>provok'd</hi> by <hi>Civilities,</hi> comparing them to their own Countrey <hi>Mastiffs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is it else can make us have such an <hi>unaccountable</hi> Hatred to the <hi>French,</hi> for which we can give no Reason, they having never done us any hurt, but when we began, and forc'd them to it, as at

present? And yet, to <hi>doat,</hi> as <hi>unaccountably,</hi> upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who never yet did us any Good, or neglected doing us all the Mischief they could, when it was in their Power?</p>
            <p>If the like Evidence could be produc'd against the <hi>French</hi> for the Burning of <hi>London,</hi> as what is here brought against the <hi>Dutch</hi>?—</p>
            <p>But whether it were <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch, London</hi> is now fill'd with them both, and there have been more <hi>Fires</hi> of late in <hi>London</hi> than usually has been known. There were no less than five Fires in it upon <hi>Sunday</hi> 18 <hi>Feb</hi> 94. And if there be False Play, it must be <hi>English, French,</hi> or <hi>Dutch.</hi> But the <hi>Dutch</hi> will never do us Hurt, as surely as they never did; we must not suspect them: There is some <hi>Witch-Craft</hi> in this!</p>
            <p>Is it for their <hi>Religion</hi> that we love the <hi>Dutch</hi>? I wish <hi>Religion,</hi> of any sort had so much Power in <hi>England</hi>! But can <hi>they</hi> be true to <hi>Religion,</hi> who are content, as in <hi>Japan,</hi> to renounce their <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> to promote their <hi>Trade</hi>! Or, which is near the same, to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense</hi> all <hi>Religions,</hi> for the same Reason, as in <hi>Holland</hi>! To give <hi>Mammon</hi> the upper Hand of <hi>God</hi>!</p>
            <p>It is their <hi>Mammon,</hi> their <hi>Interest</hi> (and they have ever been true to it) to ruine <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is neither the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France</hi> to Invade or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer one another; and they are not the <hi>Aggressors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet we are <hi>irreconcileable</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>unalterable</hi> from <hi>Holland</hi>! As Men blind to their <hi>Interest,</hi> and bent upon their <hi>Ruine!</hi> Like the <hi>Jews</hi> against the <hi>Romans, obstinate,</hi> though <hi>un-equal</hi> to the War! It prov'd <hi>Their</hi> Destruction; and, if we will not open our Eyes, it must, without a Miracle, be <hi>Ours</hi> too.</p>
            <p>We are trying the Experiment how many Losses will Ruine us. And extol the super-abundance of our <hi>Riches,</hi> but not of our <hi>Wisdom,</hi> in bearing up against a continued Series of Ill-Success, without any other Rational Prospect, but of its growing worse and worse, 'till there be no Remedy.</p>
            <p>I think I have been a <hi>True Reasoner</hi>: I wish, in this, I may be a <hi>False Prophet,</hi>
