            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For this containeth onely the intreating of the Sphere: that is, of a perfect and very round body, containing diuers Circles, which the learned doo also call a Materiall Sphere: of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall appearances that it describeth in the Instrument, named of them the Materiall Sphere.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:4323:5"/>Now this teacheth fiue definitions of the same: twoe of the Sphere, one of the Center, one of the Exe trée, and one of the Poles of the World.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>VCLIDE</hi> in his eleuenth Booke, thus defineth a Sphere. A Sphere (which in Latine is a Globe) saith he, is a sound Figure, made by the turning of a halfe Circle, the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of which halfe Circle conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing so long steddy, vntill it bée brought again vnto the place, wher that Figure began to be drawne. Or thus: A Sphere is such a round and sounde body, which is described by the drawing about of the halfe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodosius</hi> teacheth another definition of the same: That the Sphere is a certaine massy Body, or sound Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, inclosed with an vpper face or platforme, in whose middle is a Pricke, from which all lines drawn from the Circumference or platforme are equally distant one from the other: and this Pricke, of him named the Center of the Sphere; and like of the Globe.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:4323:5"/>The halfe Sphere is contained in the halfe of the Globe, and greatest Circle of the Sphere.</p>
               <p>The Exe-trée of the Sphere is a right line, about which the Sphere fixed, doth the halfe Circle drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout describe.</p>
               <p>There are also two maner of Orbes, as the Solyde Orbe, and hollow Orbe: the Solyde is named the Globe or Sphere, which only containeth one round vpper face, and the same imbossed hollow outward: but the hollow Orbe differeth, in that the same hath two vpper faces, the one imbossed outward, and the other hollow within. Also the Orbes of all the fixed starres, and Planets, are like hollow, and not Solyde.</p>
               <p>A materiall Sphere, is that which is made of ringes, or Circles, in such a manner framed, deuided, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<figure/>
that the same in some maner may expresse and shew foorth to the eie, both the standing and motion of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the first moouer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:4323:6"/>To the Sphere belong these differences, A Pricke, a Line, Dyametre, Parallels, an vpper face, a Center, Exe-trée, and Poles.</p>
               <p>A Pricke or note is of no bignesse, but the beginning of Magnitudes, which in the order of nature goeth before them, and not made as a part: in that a Line is not made of Prickes, nor Prickes are the partes of a Line. For if an infinite number of Prickes were heaped and ioyned togither, yet woulde those neuer make a Line: so that a Line is caused, through the drawing of a Pricke into length.</p>
               <p>A Line, is a length without bredth and déepnesse, and ended with two prickes, which cannot be comprehended, but by Imagination.</p>
               <p>A Dyametre, is any right line drawne by the Center of a Circle, and middle of a Figure: whether the same be plaine, Solyde, round, or cornered: whose endes reache and come from side to side of the Circle about, and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Circle into two equall partes or iust halfes.</p>
               <p>The Parallels are two right Lines equally drawne, which extended on any Platforme vnto an infinit length, doo alwaies kéepe one like distance, and neither draw nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, nor touch togither.</p>
               <p>An vpper face, is a length and breadth without déepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, made by the drawing of a Line into breadth: Of which, the plaine vpper face is that, which is expressed with those straight Lines which it hath: that neither the middle riseth vppe, or is raised at the endes, nor the same falleth within. The Sphericall vpper face is distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, into an imbossed and hollow vpper face. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bossed, is the outward compasse about of the Sphere, or bodies round: but the hollow vpper face, is the inwarde compasse about in the hollow Orbe, or the bodies hollow.</p>
               <p>A Center, is the middle Prick in a Circle, from which all right Lines drawne vnto the compasse about the same,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4323:6"/>
are equall betwéene the one and the other. Also a Centre of the Sphere, is a middle Pricke in the Sphere, from which all right lines drawn vnto the imbossed vpper face, we agrée in length.</p>

               <p>If any will know the Pole of the world or Pole starre, let him turne his face towarde the North, the sky then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleare; leauing the East on the right side, and west on the left side, and he shal see in the little Beare seauen stars, placed like to the forme of the starres of the great Beare, which are brighter.

So that beeing no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off by this declination from 90 degrees, the distance of it from the very Pole shall remaine and bee 4. degrées, and 7. minutes: and this starre also in processe of time shall be ioyned with the Pole.</p>
               <p>The other Pole, which through the swelling of the earth, is continually hid to vs of the North, is named the Meridionall or South Pole, right against as it were the North Pole. Beeing euermore so lowe depressed, as the

               <p>The Poles of the Zodiacke, are continually so farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Poles of the world, as is the greatest decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sun, which in our time is founde and noted by obseruations to be of 23. degrées, 28. minutes, and 30. seconds. But the Borcall or North Pole of the Zodiacke, distant from the two dimme starres, in the tryangle of the Dragon (being stars of the sixt bignesse) which a right line by imagination drawne from the third starre in the tayle of the little Beare, vnto that constellation named <hi>Lyra,</hi> expresseth the same, that it is but a little further distance then two degrées.</p>
               <p>The Poles of the Horizont, are the twoe extreame pointes or ends of the right lyne, drawne out of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earth, by the top ouer our head, vnto the opposit places of the Dyametre of the Merydyan: of which the one, directly ouer our heade, named the verticall poynte, and of the <hi>Arabians</hi> Zenith, the other right against, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them <hi>Nadir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Poles of each of the greater Cyrcles, doe differ from their Circles 90. degrées, or a quarter of an other greate Circle of the Sphere. For by the 23. proposition of <hi>Theodosius</hi> of the Sphere, a right lyne drawne from the Pole of his Circle vnto the circumference, is equall to ech of the foure quarter sides, descrybed within the same Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which foure quarter sides, doe deuide the Circle into foure quarters.</p>
               <p>Yet are each greater Circles of a Sphere, equall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the one and the other. But seeing the equall right lynes, doe take away the equall compasses of the equall Circles, therefore should a lyne drawn from the Pole vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the circumference of his Circle, take away of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Circle, one quarter of the other Circle drawne by the Pole, euen like as the sides of a quarter described within

                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth two definitions of the world: the one, that it is an apt frame wrought, consisting both of heauen and earth, and of the celestiall and inferiour bodies aptly distributed, and of other naturall thinges in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned.</p>
               <p>The other definition is, that the world is a perfit body, and most perfit rounde forme, contayning the ordinance and distribution of bodies, created by God to tend vnto a purpose, which by God, and through God is preserued.</p>
               <p>The parts or Regions of the worlde, are two: as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereall, and Elementary.</p>
               <p>The Etheriall region is the higher and vpper parte of the world, which encloseth the Elementary region, being wholy cleare and the light perfitte, and contayning the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4323:8"/>
Orbes of all the fixed starres and Planets, distinguished by a certaine order, frée of all mixture and all strange qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, nor harmed by any alterations. In which the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall bodies are drawne about by certaine and continuall orders and times of the motions, that they may so cause the diuersities of times, dayes, yeares, and moneths: and as well in the Elementary nature, by his motion and light, ingender, mixe, and temper togither the first quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and prepare also other effects.</p>
               <p>The Elementary region, is the nether part of the world, which is contayned within the hollowe vpper face of the Moones Orbe and Sphere, in which are all corruptible bodies, and thinges harmed by diuerse alterations, except the minde of man: the causes of which, are the contrary actions of the first qualities. Also the foure Elements are simple bodies, which into parts of diuers forms cannot be deuided: yet through the mutuall commixion of these, are diuerse kinds of bodies caused. Therefore, whatsoeuer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are in the Elementary region, bee either simple, myxt, or compound bodies: In that the mixt bodies, are all those which may be deuided into parts of diuerse kinds.</p>
               <p>To these of the foure Elements, the next ioyning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the hollow vpper face of the Moones Orbe, is the most thinne Ayre (being the lightest of the Elements) kindled, through the dayly moouing about of the celestiall circles: which for this congruency with the fire (named the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental fire) that is dayly drawn about by the Orbs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing it, which may appeare by the Comettes, and other fiery kindes, ingendred in the same Element of a hot and dry vapoure, that are likewise caried about.</p>
               <p>The next within that doth the ayre runne, being a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier Element then the fire, yet lighter then the water: which also is drawne about by a like motion, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the clouds, and other like impressions ingendred in the same, but to the nether region of the same, consist the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4323:9"/>
laterall motions, as wée dayly sée by the blowing of the windes. Farther, <hi>Vitellio</hi> in his tenth booke and 60. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affirmeth, that the cloudes are distant from the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth 25000. paces, or 13. Germayne myles. But acording to same writers, they are vnequally distant from the earth: as somewhiles further off, and somewhiles néerer to the earth. For when the cloudes are furthest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the earth, they are but 772000. paces, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearest the earth, are 288000. paces distant. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this Elemente compasseth and encloseth, both the earth and water by his largenesse.</p>
               <p>The nexte Element to the Ayre which mooueth, is the water, for the same is mooued by a motion of flowing and ebbing which it maketh after the motion of the moone; in that it floweth sixe houres, and ebbeth so many, vntill the moone by the motion of the first moouer, hath passed about all the quarters of heauen. Also the water hath a motion, and that downward into the earth, so that these two ioynt ly annexed make as it were one body. Yet the earth bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heauiest Elemente, hath a motion attributed as it were simply downwarde vnto the middle: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding agréed of all men, that the same is immouable, and the Centre of the world.</p>
               <p>These foure: that is, the fire, ayre, water, and earth, are named to be the foure Elements, and both the simple, and Original matters, of which all mixt bodies are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and made.</p>
               <p>The proofe that there is onely fowre Elements, is this: that to each Element the two first qualities agrée, and the Combynations the like of the foure qualities: as of heate and dryeth, which consist in the fire: of moysture and heat, which rest in the ayre: of coldnesse and moysture, which be in the water: of drynesse &amp; coldnesse, which is found in the earth.</p>
               <p>By these it is euident, that there are but foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4323:9"/>
of which heate excéedeth in the fire, moysture in the ayre, coldnesse in the water, and drynesse in the earth. To conclude, it appeareth, that heat with colde, and moysture with dryeth, cannot aptly be ioyned.</p>

               <p>But the Stars seeing with a borrowed light they shine, which is far weaker then the sunnes, therefore with that strange light which they take properly of the sun doe they shine, although vnlike to the sun.</p>
               <p>For into all the starres, which by nature are rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thynne, and penetrable, is the sunnes light equally shed and pearceth, and so filleth all, that they are subiect to no times of encreasing and decreasing of light.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:4323:10"/>But the Moone, séeing it is an vnperfit body, and that it hath the partes some where thynne, &amp; somewhere thicker and better compact: therfore doth it not equally, nor round about receiue the sunnes light. So that the thynner parts take more of the sunnes light, and of the same doe clearer shine. But the lesser shadowed parts which also are seene, appeare darker, as the spots in the moone do shew.</p>
               <p>That the bodies of the starres are round, doe the round formes in the Eclipses of the sun and moone shew: yea in what parts of the world those Eclipses happen, doe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies also of the starres at that time appeare perfit round: Although the bodies of the starres be knowne (by sundry reasons) to be round as a bowl, yet by their great distance from the earth, appeare to vs as playne or flat.</p>
               <p>Nor the Starres are not moued by their owne proper motions, but by the Accydentary, as vnto the motion of the Orbs, to which they hang, as partes vnto the motion of the whole. For to euery round body doe two proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions onely belong, as a moning to and fro, and turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Therefore the Starres (séeing they be round) are by some proper and principall motion caried round.

Therefore, not by a proper and chiefe motion are they caried about, but by an accidentary drawing about of their Orbes, which what the same is, shall after appeare.</p>

The one is of the first mouer, which <hi>Ptholomy</hi> attributeth to the ninth Sphere, that is onely drawn about by an equall swiftnesse, from the East into the west, and from thence againe into the East, vppon the Poles of the worlde or Equatour, in the space of a naturall day or 24. houres. And this first mouer draweth with it al the other Orbs, much like a ship, which being at full saile, doth drawe and cary al her men, &amp; other liuing things which are in the Shippe. So that by this motion of the first moouer, the neather Orbes, which the first mouer compasseth, are drawn once euery naturall day, or in the space of a day and night, about the earth. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so this first mouer, doeth not onely describe and measure a naturall day, but causeth times, and diuersities of dayes and nights, with the proper motion of the sun; and it day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bringeth vp stars to be séene, and carieth vp to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and after hideth them againe, vnder our Horizont in the west. Besides it is the common measure of al the other motions.</p>
               <p>The other motion is proper to the eight Sphere, and to the Orbs of the seauen Planets, in the which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily caried to the first mouer, as from the west into the east, in mouing vnder the Zodiacke, and about the Poles of the same: and not in Parallels from the Equatour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually seperated; but are drawne much slower, yea and vnlike.

Also in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of their courses (as it were) each doe often stacke or bee slow, and often times stay as vnmoueable, and sometimes are retrograde, after againe quicken their course, and by their swiftnes recouer that lost of the former tariance. So that they neuer kéepe one manner of way, but one whiles from the middle iourney of the Zodiacke doe wander into the North, and another whiles into the South.

But <hi>Copernicus</hi> being of later yeares (as about the yeare of Christ 1525.) that examined the obseruations of the auncient men, and compared them vnto those noted of him, founde that not so many as a hundreth yeares, but in seauentie and two yeares, that the fixed had gone one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée: and that in euery Egiptian yeare (which containeth 360. dayes) the fixed to haue moued 50. seconds, and in a day 8. thirdes, and tenne fourths.

               <p>Of these knowne and numbred of the ancient men, are 1022. which they haue deuided into sixe differences of magnitudes; and to these haue added certaine obscure, and certaine cloudy stars.</p>

               <p>The fixed stars do differ in brightnesse, standing, color, twinckling, and especially in the configuration. Many of the fixed stars also with the effects both in the bignesse and brightnesse, being notable and néere together, the ancient men that deuided them by a certaine reason, haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, digested, and fashioned them, into forty and eight ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or similitudes. And vnto them through the congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and similitude of the noted formes or figures, they gaue apt names: and for the same cause especially, that they might the easier and sooner be discerned, knowne, and noted by their peculiar names. Also they deuided the stars, by the standing into the North and South, and the signes of the Zodiacke. The Northerly stars that decline from the Ecclipticke into the North, are twenty and one in

               <p>That the stars about the quarters of the East or West, appeare sometimes greater, is not caused by reason of the shorter distance, but for that their beams in the vapours, which often times consist in the ayre betwéene the starres and our eie, are then broken; which breaking of them, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the body of the star séene, to appeare much greater in the eie, then in déed it is.</p>

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:4323:19"/>That heauen is drawne circularly, is thus knowne; in that wée alwaies sée all the Stars, from the East into the West, to be drawne vpward, and that the hemisphere in our sight, is carried continually in distant cyrcles equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distant, neuer changing the standing or distance, one from another, neither in bignesse, as far as the iudgement of the eie can descerne, neither any whit lessoned. For they being drawue from the neather place (as from the earth) are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by little and little. And after they be thus come vnto the highest of their iourney (as vnto the noon-stéede) they decline again by little and little, till they be brought down vnto the west quarter, and there set and hidden, vnder the earth: and these places and times, both of the risings and settings doe they repeate in certaine order. Therefore by these it appeareth, that they are drawne and carried by round.</p>
               <p>By the second it is euident, that the Starres, which be néere the Pole Articke, are neuer hidden out of our sight, but are continually and vniformally drawn round about the Pole as the Centre: in such sort, that the stars neare to it make the lesser compasses, and the stars further off, doe define greater compasses. So that the starres fastened to their proper Orbs (as aforewritten) are cyrcularly caried. By which two motions of the stars, as well tending vnto the West, as otherwise; it plainly appeareth that heauen is drawn about and caried round.</p>

But doe much sooner appeare and shine to them dwelling vnto the East, and within a whiles after they shewe to them dwelling in the West.</p>
               <p>By the second appeareth, that one and the like Eclipse
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4323:20"/>
of the moone in diuers houres, is séen both in the East and West. For that which appeareth in the first houre of the night to them in the West, is séene to them in the East parte, in the second, thirde, or fourth houre, euen as they come nearer vnto the East: which would not be caused, if the night to both places should happen and bée at one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor sooner woulde they appeare to them in the East part.</p>
               <p>Againe, there bée certaine stars, which in their rising, doe appeare sooner to them in the East parts, then to them in the West, as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth of <hi>Arbelis</hi> (being a towne in <hi>Asiria</hi>) where an Eclipse of the Moone was séene in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond houre of the night, which in <hi>Sicily,</hi> was séene in the first houre of the night. For the <hi>Assirians</hi> are more Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly then the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and therefore doeth the sun set soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with them, then with the <hi>Siciliaus.</hi> And when it was also the second houre of the night in <hi>Assiria,</hi> the Sun first set in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> about the first houre of the night. Moreouer the Pole of the world (acording to the diuersitie of places) is eleuated and depressed. So that the cause of the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of this appearance, is onely the swelling of the earth.</p>
               <p>To be briefe, the beginnings and spaces of the dayes and nights, and that in diuers places of the earth do vary, and yet following in a maner, one order. But this varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could not happen, if the earth were not Sphericall, and all about equally rounde, herein excluding both vallies, and the toppes of hilles, which applied (vnto the body of the earth) cause no inequalitie or diuersity at all. For the swelling of the earth causeth, that the stars be not séene to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in all countries, but drawne about by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, by a certaine succession and order, that they so appeare sooner to them in the East part, then to them in the West, through the swelling as yet not aboue caried, which swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling being high betwéene both, is a let and cause of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appearing of them to the west: and by that meanes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4323:20"/>
kéepeth and hideth the stars the longer from their sight. So that by these it euidently appeareth, that the onely cause, is the swelling of the earth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>If the earth were fashioned with a déepe hollownesse, and compassed round about with a light inclosure, then should the stars risen, be soonest séene to them in the West partes, and much later appeare to them in the East. For that the higher inclosure to the hollownesse, as a wal built about, should be a let and hinderance to the sight of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders; in such sort, that those starres arising, it shoulde hinder their sight.</p>
               <p>If the earth were formed with places standing in sharp piller forme, or in right line vp; then should the stars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4323:21"/>
set, and be hidden alike to those places, and no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of dayes should be caused, but that they shoulde haue one like day, and the sun also appearing to that fide, which they shewed: so that whiles the Sun runneth and compasseth about the backe parts, they should be without light of the sun, and should remaine al the time in shadow and darknesse. And if it should haue a Cubicke for me, then should they sée the sun sixe houres, and loose or be without light and sight of the sun, other eightéene houres.</p>
               <p>If in round piller-wise, as if the howndes were playne vnto both the Poles, and the hollow partes should decline vnto the East and West, then should no stars continually appeare to them dwelling in the hollow: but that certaine stars should arise vp and set in the West, and other certain stars néere to both the Poles, should alwaies be hid.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if the whole earth were framed with an equal playnesse throughout, then should the stars appeare at one moment to all countries; and setting againe, should hide the like out of sight: and by that meanes shoulde the dayes begin and end alike, and no differences shoulde bée obserued. To all such arguments, seing experience onely doth repugne or contrary them: It is therefore manifest, that the earth from the West towarde the East, riseth vp into an equall swelling.</p>
               <p>If the earth also were plaine from the East vnto the West, then shoulde the starres arise so soone to them in the West, as to those of the East, which is a manifest error. Also, if the earth wéere playne, from the North vnto the South; and like from the South vnto the North: then the starres which were to some of a continuall appearance, should alwaies séene the fame and like, which way or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what quarter soeuer a man goeth, which also is vntrue. But the cause which maketh the earth séene plaine, is through the ouer great quantity, which causeth it so to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to euery mans sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:4323:21"/>But that the earth is round (according to latitude) the diuers eleuations of the Pole and stars (eyther alwaies in sight, or continually hidden) doth euidently declare.</p>
               <p>For from the Equatour, in going forth easilie towardes the North, and that the Pole Articke be higher raysed, and the stars néere to the Pole raysed vp; then are the Stares right against like depressed, and as they were out of sight, and so much the more as they go further from the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure: nor the Northerly stars neuer set, but continually drawne about (in sight) with heauen. But the contrarie happeneth, by going from the saide Cyrcle or Equatoure, vnto the contrary part. So that there is no greater cause of this diuersitie, than the swelling of the earth, which if the same shoulde bee plaine, the starres opposite or right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst (according to latitude about the Poles) shoulde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and appeare togither to all countries, which the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the earth hindreth to be séene.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His by two reasons is prooued, the first is most certaine, by a mark or marks standing on the sea banke, like as a tower, stéeple, or such like erected of purpose, so that a shippe sayling into the déepe, and carried so far off, that no more of the sides or bottom can be descerned, sauing the top of the mast, which only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4323:22"/>
to the sight. Or thus, that a marke stoode on the sea banke, and a ship passing forth of the hauen, sayling so far into the sea, that the eie of the beholder being néere the foote of the mast cannot decerne the marke (the ship in the meane time staying or standing still) so that his eie being in the top of the mast, shall perfectly sée that marke: but the others eie being néere the foote of the mast, shoulde ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better sée the marke, than he which is in the top of the mast, as may more euidently appeare, by lynes drawne from either place vnto the mark: so that the manifest cause of this, appeareth to bee none other, then the swelling of the water. But here are all other impediments excluded that may otherwise hinder; as mists, foggs, and such like vapours ascending. Also a like reason of the impediments of this aboue written, is, for that the water ariseth into a swelling, which hindreth the sight of the bottom or sides of the ship (that being in a high place doeth not hinder the sight of the same) as the top of the mast, which either excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or is equall with the swelling of the water. For men sayling on the mayne sea, sée nothing round about but the Sky and the Sea: but comming nearer the banks, do by litle and litle descry and sée, either high hilles or cliffes, as if they were rising forth of the water. Also to those that dwell on a high ground, the sun first ariseth, and last set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. And to this agréeth, that out of the higher places, both more and further may bée séene into the sea, then in vallies or lower places. By all these therefore it is euident that the vpper face of the water swelleth, as by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple following more plainly shall appeare: but an other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the same shall bée here rehearsed, by a similitude of one part as the whole. The similitude of which matter conceiue by this example, that experience dayly teacheth vs of the drops of water, which although they bée small, yet powred on drie wollen cloth, run into a round or bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forme; which without doubt shoulde not be caused,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4323:23"/>
if the part folowed not the nature of the whole of his kind. Now the example aboue promised doeth here appeare, in which by the letter <hi>A.</hi> is the shippe ment to come vnto the marke <hi>C.</hi> In which being in the poynte <hi>A.</hi> that is in the bothom of the shippe, cannot sée the marke standing in <hi>C.</hi> through the swelling of the water. But he which is in the top of the mast, as in the poynt <hi>B.</hi> without all impediment may sée the sayde marke. That the selfe same or like to it, may be on land, as from the point <hi>D.</hi> none excepte hée bée foolish or starcke mad will affirme the like.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>By the second it is manifest that the water by nature is caried and runneth downewarde, and stideth or falleth from higher vnto lower places, so long, vntill it hath filled and bee euen with the earth, through the staying of high heapes of earth, hilles or such like mighty and high banks inclosing it about that it run no further, nor make no hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownes in the middle of the earth, as a Center of the earth. Which therfore gathereth betwéene the empty places, so long, vntill it hath filled and be euen with the earth; and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4323:23"/>
that the whole togither, through the hollownesse thus made equall, doeth fashion and kéepe a round forme.</p>
               <p>So that the earth, with the sea, and waters running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, do make one round body, and fill all the whole vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per face: the earth also gaping and open somewhere, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth water into those hollow places, but a parte of the earth appearing somewhere aboue it, staying and inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this is true, shall bée prooued by other two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The first, by sundry perygrinations, in which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and most large parts of the earth are found toward all the quarters of the worlde, which euidently witnesseth, that the earth is not as <hi>Plinie</hi> and others writeth; which imagined that the earth is compassed about with water, and appearing so out of the water, like an Aple or Ball swimming aboue the water, whose one halfe sheweth out of the water, and the other halfe hid in the water. Which reason <hi>Ptholomie</hi> doeth not allowe, but simply affirmeth, that the earth with the sea and waters, make one round body, by filling of the empty places, and both to haue one vpper face. Also <hi>Vitruuius</hi> in his ninth booke writeth, that the earth is placed in the middle of the world, and is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ioyned together with the sea in the place of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But what the forme of the earth is, aboue the waters, is yet not throughly knowne, by reason of the sea which runneth betwéene it in diuers partes, and breaketh it into sundry parts, like to gobbets or péeces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ptholomie</hi> affirmeth the earth to bée knowne, vnto the longitude of the halfe Cyrcle, that is 190. degrees, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any running betwéene of the sea in that space; for that the earth is wholy ioyning together. But into latitude, he affirmeth the space to be much lesser, as 79. degrées, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4323:24"/>
of this opinion, is both <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the second it appeareth, that the water with the earth, doeth equally make one hollow vpper face, and the same to be perfect round; but whether is bigger, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be doubted: although the learned <hi>Nouius,</hi> and sundry other late writers, doe affirme the face of the earth to bee bigger then the water.</p>
               <p>By the third (which is the Ecclipses) In that of nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity the earth must haue such a forme with the waters run<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning in it, as the shadowe of the earth frameth and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiteth in the Moones Ecclipses; in that the shadowe sheweth and expresseth the forme of the bodie shadowed. But the shadow of the earth to be included round aboute with a round vpper face, the wise both sée &amp; know. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Globe, compounded of the earth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is comprehended with a round vpper face. For it is manifest, that the moone before and after the full, is séene horned, and the part shadowed of the whole cyrcle, is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be descerned from that bright circumference. So that the moone entring into shadow, or going out of the same, is likewise in the same maner horned: and the part dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is alwaies descerned from the cleare circumference of the whole Cyrcle imbossed. Therefore of necessity must the beginning of the shadow, which seperateth the parte lighted, from the shadowed, not bée fully straite, nor vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, nor vallied or winding, but round: and for that cause appeareth the vpper face of the shadowe not to bée plaine, but round.</p>
               <p>By these is also manifest, as by the first, that there is no difference betwéene the Centre of the earth, and Centre of the water: but that the one, is the Centre of both the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ioyning togither into one round body, and tending vnto the one and the same Centre of the earth. For the earth (séeing it is the heauier) is opened, and receiueth the waters falling into those places.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:4323:24"/>By the second it is euidente, that the place of the water, which ought to run ouer and couer the whole earth, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise chaunged and appoynted by the <hi>Diuine</hi> will, for the benefit of all liuing creatures.</p>
               <p>By the thirde appeareth, that the opinion of certaine <hi>Peripateticans</hi> is false; which affirmeth the water to bee ten times greater then the earth; and that to one parte of the earth, is ten portions of the water increased. But sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times greater then the earth it cannot be, vnlesse the earth rounde about were wasted and impayred, by the Centre of the grauity (as it were setling and resting vpon) should yéelde, and giue place to the waters, as the heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Seeing the Spheres are togither in a triple reason of their measures, then if the earth were an eight part, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen parts of the water, the diameter of it could not be the greater; as from the Centre of the waters vnto the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of them: that is, by double so much vnto the diameter of the water, as by this figure here vnder drawn appeareth: where this letter A. is the Center both of the earth and water, <hi>B.</hi> the Centre both of the magnitude and earth, <hi>G. A. D.</hi> the diametre of the waters, <hi>A. B. D.</hi> the diameter of the earth. If the waters are seuen times big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the earth, the diameter of them must néedes bée double so much vnto the diameter of the earth, as héere from <hi>G. D.</hi> vnto <hi>A. D.</hi> By which example thus drawne, the whole earth receiueth the Center of the waight, gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing place to the waters, and all couered with waters; to which generall experience gainsayth and denieth, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse therefore can it be greater ten times. By which is to be concluded, that the water is but litle in quantity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the earth, although it may séeme very bigge, being vp to the edges of the vpper face of the earth. And if the waters had béene more bigger then the earth, they had drowned or couered the whole earth, euen of late yeares.</p>

               <p>That the stars haue alwaies one bignes, in what place soeuer any shall beholde them: therefore are they in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall distance from the earth.</p>
               <p>The roundnesse of the earthly globe, hath a proportion vnto the roundnesse of heauen; that is, the certaine and proportionall parts in the earthly Globe, doe answere to certaine proportionall partes of heauen: therefore is the earth the Center of the world.</p>
               <p>In that siftéene Germaine miles on earth, doe answere to a degrée of the Meridian: and that in euery houre doe fiftéene degrées arise of the Equinoctiall; which coulde not be, if the earth were not in the middle of the world. For the vnequall Arks, should otherwise appeare in the equal times: and the equall partes of the Meridian, shoulde the vnequall spaces on earth answere: which experience day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witnesseth vnto the contrary. And hereof it ensueth, that the earth stands in the middle of the world.</p>
               <p>In euery Artificiall day, doe sixe signes appeare, and sixe like set vnder the earth: therefore is the earth in the middle of the worlde, and is also as a pricke, to which the halfe doth regularly moue dayly. The like is in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Sunne and Moone, when either light is in the Horizont: which could not be, if the earth should approch or come néerer vnto one part, then vnto the other.</p>
               <p>If it were néerer to eyther of the Poles, then could not the vniuersall Equinoctials bee: for that the one Arke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies (either in the day and night time) should be greater then the other. The Eccclipses also coulde not bée in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4323:26"/>
changes and full moones: For that there shoulde then bée vneuen spaces from the South vnto the North, and from the East vnto the West.</p>
               <p>If the earth were not as the Center of the worlde, then of necessity shoulde these ensue, that the earth shoulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, either néerer to the East, or West, or South part: and when any of the starres (aswell the fixed as Planets) shall come vnto that part, they shall appeare nearer to vs, then being in any other part of heauen: and by that aboue saide, they shall also appeare greater: which is altogether vntrue, and we also sée the contrary in that (as aboue wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) they alwaies appeare of one greatnesse, eyther being in the East, or in the West. Also one halfe of heauen is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies aboue the earth, and the other halfe vnder the earth: and this is not onely found and knowne in one quarter of the earth, but the like in euery place (as the Equinoctials do witnes) then which there can be no more euident tryal.</p>
               <p>A third reason may bée alleadged, if any imagined the earth vpon the Center, to be parted into two equal halfes, and that the eie is placed in the Center: then shall the eie sée no more then the halfe of heauen. By which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the swelling of the earth, from the Center vnto his compasse about, in making a comparison vnto heauen is as in a maner nothing.</p>
               <p>And it is knowne to the learned in <hi>Astronomie,</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the fixed starres, is by many times greater then the earth: which if any behold them, they appeare as poynts in heauen. Now how much lesser would the earth appear, if a man should behold it from his place.</p>
               <p>Here learne by this demonstration following, that the earth standing without the Center, in the poynt <hi>B.</hi> being to the Meridiane, as is the poynte <hi>A.</hi> nearer; and when a star shall come vnto that poynte, then shall it bée nearer to the earth, and in the opposite poynt, as is <hi>I.</hi> shall bee from the same much further, than in any other place, and shall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4323:26"/>
euen there lesser appeare, which by experience, is quite contrary. Further graunt that <hi>C. D.</hi> be the thwart Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizont, yet the contrary, for the second reason, <hi>E.

               <figure/>
               <p>Therefore when the sun, by his proper motion, carried from the East into the West, shall come vnto the crossings of the Equatour and Zodiacke, and that the greater part of these Cyrcles shall be vnder the earth, it cannot be that the Equinoctium or a like day and night, can bee through out the earth, no not vnder the right Sphere, much lesse can it be vnder the thwart Sphere.</p>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F this be vnpossible, it shall be also as vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that sixe signes may alwaies bee aboue the earth, and the other sixe vnder the earth; but rather that more of the signes shall be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth, and more of them aboue: euen

as the earth is imagined to be deuided from the Horrizont aforesaid, into two equall parts; like as when it shall bée in the Center of the whole, and that from each Center of the greater Cyrcles, the earth is deuided into two partes. As all these (to any beholding the materiall Sphere) are forthwith knowne at the first sight: so by a third reason is to bee noted, that when any imagineth, by the lyne <hi>E.

               <p>In euery Climate, the playne of the Horrizont shoulde cut heauen into two vnequall halfes, except those places hauing the right Sphere: yea, and the Zodiacke shoulde be deuided into two vnequall Arks, so that there should be somewhere more, and somewhere lesse then sixe signes of the Zodiacke séene aboue the Horrizont, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all experience.</p>

               <head>The Phisicke reasons are these.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat of one simple body, is onely one simple motion. That the earth is a simple bodie: therefore therevnto agréeth but one simple motion.</p>
               <p>But of the simple motions, I haue before taught, that the one is in right maner, and the other in Cyrculare forme. That the right motion sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth downwards vnto the myddle, whether being caried, they settle and rest. Therefore is the motion of the earth not cyrculare about.</p>
               <p>By the second appeareth, that euerie graue or heauie matter by nature, is thrugh his waight caried after a most straite lyne vnto the Center, and both fetleth, stayeth, and resteth at the same; where it neither falleth, or is caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further. So that all graue matters, as the parts of the earth, and those which consist of the earth, are sent or cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a most straight leading vnto the earth, and at his vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per face shall stay and rest. And weare it not that they are staied through the fastnesse of the earth, they should so long be caried downwardes, vntill they came vnto the Center. Also the earth through his fastnesse, receyueth and beareth all thinges falling on it. Therefore doeth the earth much more (beeing within the Center) stay and rest fixed and vnmoueable, bearing all other heauie things falling on it, séeing the earth is heauiest of all others.</p>
               <p>By the third it is euident, that if the earth shoulde bee moued or caried, it should of necessity be either drawne in right, or cyrculare motion. If it should be caried in a right maner (séeing it is the heauiest of all others) it shoulde by his swiftnes moue and goe before all other heauie things, and shoulde leaue behinde the liuing creatures, and other things fastned to it, and shoulde also leaue them hanging
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4323:29"/>
behinde in the Ayre.</p>
               <p>If the earth should be drawne about by a cyrculare mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; should in a daies turne (at the least) be caried about the Exe-trée, from the West into the East, as either alone or with the first Orbe: then euery day, should many most disordred things, and contrary to experience happen. For it shoulde bée a most spéedy motion, and swiftnesse insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which should draw cyrcularly all the whole earthly body rounde about in 24. houres. And therefore that the earth is caried with so swifte motion, shoulde not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe buildinges, but high hilles, and greatly shake and harme all thinges fastned and growing on the earth: yea all liuing beasts, and other creatures dwelling on the face of the earth, shoulde bee likewise shaken and harmed. Also the cloudes, foules, and whatsoeuer liueth and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in the Ayre, should bée caried and lefte behinde at the setting in the West. For by the swift turning about of the earth should all things be ouer turned, and left behind by a greate and long space; if by such a swiftnesse, the earth should be turned about the Exe-trée of the world. Or if by the motion of the earth, the ayre, and all things hanging in the ayre, should be drawne with a like swiftnesse; then should they appeare to stay, or not to be moued at all. And further, if a stone or any waighty thing cast vpward shuld not light againe downe right on the same place: as may be séene in a shippe, at sayling. So that to all these, doeth euident experience deny, that by no motion, the earth is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing moued, dut continually stayeth and abideth.</p>
               <p>By the fourth it is manifest, that in the motion and tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning about of the Cyrcle, the Center abideth vnmoueable: which is the earth, placed in the myddle of the world, and is as the Center of the worlde. Therefore is the Earth knowne to be vnmoueable.</p>

               <p>The earth also is a very small thing, in respect of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: yea so litle in comparison, as a pepper corne, or seede of Colliander, vnto a Cyrcle of a thowsande paces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe.</p>
               <p>For if the earth compared to the firmament, were of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sensible greatnesse, a man shoulde not sée the halfe of heauen, nor the halfe Cyrcle of the Equinoctiall or Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke.

               <p>Besides these, if the earth should be imagined to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in any of the Orbes of heauen, it woulde appeare but small in respect of them: for being imagined in the Moones Orb; the earth should appeare thrice as great as the moon is decerned from thence, and somewhat bigger.

               <p>And here an ignorant man, might greatly wonder, that so small a body, yea rather a pricke (as it is accounted of the learned) should containe in it so many Realmes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, Citties, Towns, Flouds, Mountaines, Woods, Ualleyes, Seas, Riuers, Lakes, and many other greate matters, ouer long to be written.</p>
               <p>That the earth also is as a Pricke, is declared by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reasons following.</p>
               <p>By the first, that round about the earth, the magnituds and distances of the stars, in their times, are decerned and séene euery where equall and alike.</p>
               <p>By the second, that the <hi>Gnomons</hi> or dyall shadowes, and the Centers of the Sphericall borderes or Cyrcles, placed in any part of the earth, do somuch auaile, and kéep the considerations and guydings about of shadowes, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, and agréeing to the rule and matter, as if those (in very déede) shoulde bee placed in the myddle poynte of the earth.</p>
               <p>By the third, that the Horizont doeth euery where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the whole heauen into two equall halues. For that in euery moment, doe sixe signes of the Zodiacke appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Horizont, and in the night time being a fayre sky are they to bée séene with the eye, and so many (at that in. stant) hid within the Horizont: so that by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall draw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing about of heauen doe sixe signes appeare, and as many right against those sixe, set vnder the earth. If the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the earth shoulde bée of any light portion vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then so much of the Center (the vpper face drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute) shoulde parte or deuide heauen into equall halfe Spheres.</p>

               <p>The other Spheres reatching from any part of the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per face, shoulde deuide the same into vnequall portions.

               <p>By the fourth, the Equinoctiall shadowes, both of the rising and setting of the sun, doe make a right line, euen as if they should be streached out and lie on the plaine, caried by the Center of the earth.

               <p>That is called the right Sphere, in which either Pole resteth and standeth on the plaine of the Horizont and the Equatoure, which there doeth exactly possesse the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle place betwéene the Poles, and doeth with the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizont make a right sphericall angle: of which it is so named a right Sphere.

               <p>And to cut at right Angles, is none other, than so to cut a Cyrcle into a Cyrcle, that the Angles which are cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The thwart, declined, or bending Sphere, is that, in which either of the Poles of the world eleuated, is séene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Horizont, and the other iust somuch set and hidde beneath the Horizont: and also that the Equatoure fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and maketh with the Horizont thwart and vnequall angles.

               <head>That the Circles of the Sphere, be some greater, some lesser, and the number of the Circles.</head>
               <p>HEre it is not to be omitted, that one Cyrcle is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then another, by foure meanes. First, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the magnitude of the celestiall body in which it is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4323:35"/>
imagined to be. And of this is the Equinoctiall Cyrcle of the first mouer, greater then the Equinoctial Cyrcle of the eight spher, in that the first mouer is greatest of all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And although the Equinoctiall of the eight Sphere, doth deuide it into two equall halfes, yet of the first mouer it is named the greater, for that the same includeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodies.</p>
               <p>By the second, it is euident that the Equinoctiall Cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is greater, by reason of the appearaunce, in that the whole is séene aboue the Horizont. And by the same reason the Northerly Cyrcle (which is named the Arcticke Cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) is the greater, for that it alwaies appeareth to vs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Horizont.</p>
               <p>By the thirde, the Equinoctiall is accompted greater then the other, in regarde of the influxiue vertue: and for this cause also is the Zodiacke called greater then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, through his greater working into these inferior bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For that vnder it, the sun and all other Planets are drawne. And <hi>Happarchus</hi> writeth, that this Cyrcle is the life of all thinges which are in the world, &amp;c. In that by the ascending of the sun to vs, generation is caused, and by his falling or going from vs, diminishing, that is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion getteth the vpper hand.</p>
               <p>By the fourth, is a Cyrcle called greater then the other, insomuch as it is one Sphere, and thus the equinoctiall, is greatest of all the Parallel Cyrcles, in the first moouer: which is euidently demonstrated, by the diameter of the Cyrcle. Therefore by the definitions and reasons aboue shewed, the equinoctial is the greater Cyrcle, described in the vpper face of the first mouer, according to each part, or the whole of it, beeing equally distant from either Pole of the worlde.</p>
               <p>And it is further to bee considered, that all the Cyrcles of the Materiall Sphere, are imagined to bee in the first mouer, which also a materiall Sphere doeth especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4323:36"/>
So that these Cyrcles, may also bee imagined in the other Spheres, aswell as in the eight Sphere, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And although a man may enter into conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene these Cyrcles and the diameter, yet he shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confesse that they be on such wise vnto the sphere, as the Cyrcle is vnto the diameter. So that as the diameter deuideth the Cyrcle into two equall partes (in that it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by the Center of the same) euen so doeth euery of the greatest Cyrcles deuide the Sphere into two equal parts, because the playne vpper face of it passeth by the Center. And by this it may easily bee perceyued, that those which are named the lesser Cyrcles (of which is a farre greater number than is here set down) haue diuers Centers from the Center of the Sphere; and yet the playne vpper face of them passeth not by the Center of the same Sphere. Of which ensueth, that they cannot deuide the sphere into two equall halfes: no more then the lyne drawne without the Center, into a Cyrcle; can deuide the same into two equal halfes. And both the greater and lesser of these is mente, according to the distance of his Center, from the Center of the sphere.</p>
               <p>The inward Cyrcles that be mouable, are those, which are descrybed in the first moouer, and are drawne with it about: as is the equinoctiall, the Zodiacke, the Colures, the Tropickes, the Polare Cyrcles, and others descrybed from the poyntes of the first moouer. But the outwarde Cyrcles, are they that are as immoueable, and not drawn about with the first mouer, but abide steady. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which are these: the Meridiane, the Horizont, the houre Cyrcles, the verticiall Cyrcles, and Cyrcles of the progressions.</p>
               <p>Further it is to bee noted, that many are the Celestiall Cyrcles (as is aboue declared) whose vse partely vnto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy, and partly vnto Astrologie, is necessary. As the verticiall Cyrcles, the Cyrcles of the altitudes, the Cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4323:36"/>
of the celestiall houses. The Cyrcles with the which the materiall sphere is descrybed: and to bee briefe, there are so many celestiall Cyrcles, as there may bée poynts y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined in the first mouer.</p>
               <p>Yet are there but onely ten Cyrcles, which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto this sphericall treatise; whose names are the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall, the Zodiacke, the two Colures, the Meridian, the Horizont, the twoe Tropickes, and the twoe Polare Cyrcles.</p>
               <p>The greater Cyrcles are those, which haue the same or a like Center with the earth, whose playn vpper face doth passe by the Center of the earth, so that they deuide the sphere, into two equall parts (and especially the equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) which for that it is a greater Cyrcle, doth cut the spher into two equall halfes; so that his playne vpper face pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by the Center of the earth, according to the definition of the greater Cyrcles. And by this consequent, when the Sun is in the equinoctiall, he falleth into the Center of the earth; that is, hée is in the vpper face which passeth by the Center of the earth. And the sun is neuer in such an vpper face, but when he is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two equinoctial poynts for other wise, he runneth without that vpper face. For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cyrcles are a like vnto the Sphere, as the diameters vnto the Cyrcle: in that as the diameter cutteth the Cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in two equall halfes (for that it doeth passe by the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the same) euen so doth the greater Cyrcle deuide the Sphere into twoe equall halfes, in that the playne vpper face of the same, doth passe by the Center of the sphere.</p>
               <p>But the lesser Cyrcles are those, which haue diuerse Centers, from the Center of the sphere, so that the playne vpper face of them doeth not passe by the Center of the sphere. For how much nearer the Center of the same is to the Center of the sphere, and somuch the greater is that Cyrcle, as the Tropicke. But the further it is from the Center, euen so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of the foure greater cyrcles, afore written, they both are moueable, and are continually drawne about with the first mouer and neuer changed.

               <p>The Astronomers deuide, both the greater and lesser cyrcles, into 360. degrées, which they so named through

the suns passage or iourney in the Zodiacke, measuring and defining by his dayly course such like partes and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And of these partes or degrées of the greater cyrcles, it is found and known, that each degrée contayneth in the vpper face of the earth, either 62500. paces, or 500. fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, or 15.

But each parte of the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser cyrcles, doe comprehend a lesser space by somuch, as by howe much more from the magnitude of the Parallell, which is the middle and greatest, by reason of the distance they lacke or differ.</p>
               <p>And each of the thrée hundreth thréescore degrées, are also parted or deuided into thrée score minutes: and each minute, into thrée score seconds: and each second into thrée score thirds: and so forth from thirds vnto fourthes: and so vnto tenths, they distribute them.</p>

               <p>2 It is by the same reason na med the Equatoure; for that it maketh equall the night, to the day.</p>
               <p>3 It is named the gyrdle of the first mouer (not vnproperly) for that as a gyrdle doeth gyrde or deuide our body into two equall halues; euen so this cyrcle deuideth the sphere or first mouer, by the middle.</p>
               <p>4 It is named the line of the equality of the day, or the line of the equation of the Orbe of the day, or the iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of the day and night.</p>
               <p>5 Of <hi>Plinie</hi> it is named the Center of the earth, and that not incongruently; séeing all the Parallell cyrcles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed from the Center of the sun by the motion of the first mouer, haue their Centers from the Center of the earth: and that the Equatour onely, which when the sun shall be in the Equinoctiall poynt, is then imagined to be drawne aboute with the motion of the first moouer, that hath the same Center with the earth at that time, by which the playne of the Equatoure, is then noted to passe. So that this is the cause why <hi>Plinie</hi> giueth that name to it: séeing a like day and night is caused, the sun then running vnder the Equatoure throughout the earth, as no man of skill maketh doubt of.</p>
               <p>It is named the cyrcle of the high solstice; but this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, by reason of those which dwell vnder the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall,

So that their winters are not perfectly and simply named winters, as with vs which are cold seasons in déede; bnt rather with them is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall summer: yet for that the causes of heate with them, are not vnformally, and in a like maner alwaies, for that the sun doth not approch equally the Zenith of that parte, as the same is known to many: whereof the heat to them is not vnifourme and a like in burning.

               <p>1 It measureth the motion of the first and vppermost Orbe, and sheweth the same to bée drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by a continuall and equall swiftnesse. For that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery equall houre, doe fiftéene of the thrée hundereth and thrée score degrées of the same arise, and so many degrées right against, set and are hidden vnder the Horizont: and that all the thrée hundreth and thrée score degrées, in 24. houres, are turned about in the appoynted times, and in their periods continually agréeing. And as the Equatour from the Poles of the worlde (about which the first mouer is drawne, and is of either side distant by equall spaces) nor the Angle, which is comprehended &amp; fashioneth with the Horizont doth neuer change: euen so (by the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and like motion) doeth the first heauen or moouer eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently shew it selfe to be caried about. For the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all measureth and determineth the motion of the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, in declaring his reuolution and yeare: which yeare of the first moouer, is the time of 24. houres equall. But by what meanes the auncient astronomers first found, that the Equinoctiall is drawne about in so many houres: and it is supposed they came to the knowledge thereof, by the office of some starre, either in the Equinoctiall, or placed neare it, they perceiued the same: as that the Equinoctial from some note marked of them, did returne to it in such a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4323:41"/>
certaine space, as afore shewed.</p>
               <p>2 The diuers motions of the Zodiack (which hapneth to it through the twart standing or lying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) as a cannon or rule, doth dyrect and point out the beginnings, boundes, and time, with the which each parts or degrées of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacke arise, or doe set: and with which they touch these or those quarters of the worlde. For all the arckes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatoure, are drawne by a certaine and agréeable motion continually. The parts of the Zodiacke drawne thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Equatoure doeth not varie or is distant by like spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Poles of the world, nor turned about his, but the same Poles of the worlde, which doe differ by a long space from his, and drawn about by a most vnlike motion and nothing at all agréeing in it selfe: For that some parts or degrées are caried vp sooner or quicker, and others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare slower and later. So that these vseth a more space of time in the rising slower, and those other passe vp by a shorter and quicker space. But séeing that in the Zodiack the wandring stars or Planets, doe wander continually hither and thither, and from one side of it to another: and that vnto the middle cyrcle of it or ecclipticke line, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all the fixed stars are referred and applied: therefore cannot the times of the rising or setting of the starres, bée knowne and noted, except they shoulde be guessed and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by the next arks of the equinoctiall. It also decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the equinoctialles, which are caused in those proper dayes, in which the sun hapneth to come into the equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall cyrcle. For these are caused the sun being in the first degrées of <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> in that the Zodiacke and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall doe crosse each other in those places; whereof <hi>Manilius</hi> thus writeth.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>That these signes <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra</hi> cause a right,</l>
                  <l>Throughout the earth, a like day and night.</l>
               </q>
               <p>3. It defineth and measureth the spaces, both of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and artificiall dayes. And although the sun (which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4323:41"/>
drawne about with the motion of the first moouer, and in the proper motion, caried forth in the meane time by force into the contrary, when as hee causeth the times of the daies and nightes, so wel as the differences of the natural daies) mooued, and runneth in the Zodiacke; yet of his motion, the day and night spaces cannot bee gatherrd, through the diuersity and vnlikenesse of the ascending or arising of diuers parts or degrées of the Zodiacke. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same motion is of all the partes of the Equatoure; therefore are the ascentions of the arcks of the Zodiacke, caried vp with the ascending of the nighest parts of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatour, like arising. So that both the dayes and houres, by the equall motion of these, are not founde and disting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished by the vnlike and vnequall motion of them, in that these ascentions can be, of these two cyrcles.</p>
               <p>The Greekes by no meanes like of the same, in that by a stedfast order, they do mark the day and night times; therefore they parte and deuide them into equall houres, which they named times, that from the degrées of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacke they might distinguish them. For euerie fiftéene parts or degrées of the Equatour in his motion and rising aboue the Horizont, doe make an houre, and euery degrée foure minutes of an equall houre: so that the quarters or fiftéene minutes of each degrée, doe produce and cause one minute of an houre. Also they obserued the ascentions and descentions of the signes in this cyrcle, for that in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or countrie, a man may knowe the length of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall day and night, by hauing a sphericall instrument, and the sun placed in the East Horizont, let the note of the Equinoctiall be moued, and after the sun being turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the West Horizont, let the note againe of the Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall be moued into the East Horizont. So that the degrées of the Equinoctiall numbred, marked with these notes, do cause an artificiall day, counting alwaies fiftéene degrées of the Equinoctiall, for an equall houre. To conclude the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4323:42"/>
length of the artificial day, known by subtracting the same from 24. houres, the quantity of the night remayning shall appeare howe much it is. Last the sun being entred into this cyrcle, doth rise in the iust East point, and setteth full West: but in the highest of summer being come to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cer,</hi> he riseth Northeast, and setteth Northwest: at what time the noone-tide is highest. But in the shortest time of winter when the sun is come to <hi>Capricorne,</hi> hée contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise riseth Southeast, and is in the noonetide lowest.</p>
               <p>4 It distinguisheth the Equinoctials and crosseth the Zodiacke thwartly wrethed and bended to it, in two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite points, which when the sun commeth and is in it, he causeth like spaces of the day and night: and of the same, those entraunces of the sunne, are named the Equinoctiall points.</p>
               <p>And there are two Equinoctials caused in euery yeare: as the one, the sun entring the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> or the spring poynt of the crossing of the Zodiacke and Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, in the beginning of the spring, which the Latines name the equinoctiall spring, and the Gréekes, <hi>Isemerian earinén.</hi> And the celestiall point of the same equinoctial, the Gréeks name the point of our equinoctiall spring. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther equinoctiall is caused, when the sun hath his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Libra,</hi> in the entrance of haruest, called the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall haruest. And the celestiall point in which the sun happeneth, they name the pointe of our Equinoctiall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest.</p>
               <p>These points remaine not fixed in one place of heauen, but in the going before doe procéede or moue forwarde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the eight Orbe, and turne before the places of the fixed stars. For the point of the equinoctiall spring, that in the first yeare of <hi>Olimpias</hi> folowed the first star of <hi>Aries</hi> of the eight Sphere, 4. degrées, and 52. minutes. And in the yeare of the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> one degrée, and 58. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.</p>
               <p>The same after the beginning of the yéeres of <hi>Iulius, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:4323:42"/>
followed 4. degrées, and 50, minutes. And in the yeare of Christes byrth, 5. degrées and 16. minutes. In <hi>Ptholomies</hi> time, 6. degrées, and 40. minutes, it went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same star: and in these yeares it went before that star, 27. degrées, and 35. minutes.</p>
               <p>So that the yearely times of the Equinoctials are come backe, from the auncient time, and moue before the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked dayes by a long space: For that the Equinoctial spring which about the beginning of the yeares of <hi>Olimpias,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the first or second of <hi>Aprill.</hi> In the beginning of the yeares of <hi>Cesar,</hi> in the 25. day of March. In the time of Christ our Sauiors byrth, in the 23. or 24. day of March. In <hi>Ptholomies</hi> time, in the 22. or 23. day of March. But in our time it hapneth, in the 11. or 12. day of March, and in this yeare 1570. it happeneth in the 11. day of March, and in the 11. howre before noone, on Saturday.</p>
               <p>The Autumnall or haruest Equinoctiall, which hapned in Christ our Sauiours time, in the 23. or 24. day of sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, is brought backe and come in this our time, vnto the 13. or 14. day of September, and in this yeare 1570. shall happen in the 13. day, and in the 10. houre, and 21. minutes after noone, on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>And through this variation of the fixed stars, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noctials, is caused, that the later practitioners haue found an other quantity of the yeare, contrary to the auncients. For <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and <hi>Ptholomie,</hi> haue stablished in their time the quantity of the Tropicke yeare, to bee of 365. dayes, 5. houres, 55. minutes, and 12. seconds. The <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsines,</hi> of 365. dayes, 5. houres, 55. minutes, and 12. seconds, <hi>Albategnius,</hi> 365. daies, 5. houres, 46. minutes and 56. seconds. <hi>Cardanus,</hi> of 365. daies, 5. houres, 48. minutes, 41. seconds, and 47. thirds. And <hi>Thebitius</hi> hath stablished the starrie yeare to be of 365. dayes 6, houres, 9. minutes, and 32. seconds, which is the space of time, in which the sun returneth vnto the same fixed star. But the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4323:43"/>
Tropicke yeare, is the suns returne, after his measuring of the whole Zodiacke, vnto the Equinoctiall or soisticiall point. So that by the saide pointes changed, either in the increasing or comming sooner, as hitherto hath béene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, is the quantity of the yeare, found to be in diuerse and sundry wise of the practisioners.</p>
               <p>By it also is learned and knowne which stars and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges celestial, are toward the North or South from it. And by it is the starrieskie deuided into two equall halfes, of which the one halfe is toward the North, and the other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the South. So that the denomination, so well of the Planets, as fixed stars, are there by learned; whether they bee Southerly, or the Northerly. An other authour writeth thus of it; that it deuideth heauen into two parts, of which the one is named Northerly, of the seauen stars in the great Beare; the other Southerly, in that the sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the South, séemeth alwaies to abide with vs in that quarter. And if the same may be knowne, which stars are named Northerly, and which Southerly: and when the Planets are named Northerly, and when Southerly.

               <p>The long <hi>Ship</hi> (named <hi>Argo</hi>) not the whole forme of it is described or seene among the stars (in that it is deuided from the fore part vnto the mast) that may signifie to men litle to dispayre, although the Shippe happen to breake. <hi>Aratus</hi> writeth, that the fore halfe of <hi>Argo,</hi> is turned about right with the taile of the great Dogge. But in a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry order mooued, in that the fore halfe is séene, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther halfe hid; much like a ship rising with the swelling of the Sea, whose fore halfe is séene, and the other halfe hid, through that hinder parte darkned or hidde, and without stars. To the ship <hi>Argo</hi> doth <hi>Ptholomie</hi> ascribe 45. stars of the 1. 2. 3. 4. and 5. magnituds. The greater of these in order 44. of the first bignesse, is that star (named of the <hi>Arabians Rubail,</hi> of the Latines <hi>Canopus</hi>) which standeth at the end of the Rother stéerer of the shippe, that in <hi>Ptho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomies</hi> time was in the 17. degrée, and 10. minutes of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> hauing the Southerly latitude 75. degrées, and the declination Southerly 51. degrées, and 41. minutes.

               <p>The image named <hi>Ingula,</hi> and also <hi>Orion,</hi> lieth thwart vnder to the section of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and hath starres standing and shining before the féete of <hi>Tautus;</hi> named <hi>Orion</hi> of the

worde <hi>Vrina:</hi> that is, of the floude of waters. For in the winter time (when this image or constellation ariseth) he troubleth both the Sea and Land, with showers of raine, and tempests. The Romanes also name him <hi>Ingula,</hi> for that he appeareth armed, as girded with a sword, whose shape is terrible and most cleare to be séen in the shining of the stars. For if it shineth bright and cleare, then doth it portend fayre weather to follow, if it appeare dimme, then doth it threaten a tempest to ensue. The head of this signe is drawn by thrée stars, of which the two cleare stars, are called the shoulders, betwéene which stars the necke is i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined to be, ane thereof named <hi>Ingular. Plinie</hi> doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten make mention of <hi>Orion,</hi> as of his rising and setting whole, and in some places of part, as his gyrdle, or sword. Also he doth number <hi>Orion</hi> among the fearefull stars, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing tempests. To this <hi>Orion</hi> doth <hi>Ptholomie</hi> assigne 31. stars, which whiles hee liued, were all in <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> of the 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. and 6. magnitude, and one clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The second star is of the first bignesse, and the thirde is, of the sedond bignesse, in the order of the stars of <hi>Orion,</hi> which are in the shoulders, and haue the quality of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mercurie.</hi> The constellation named the Zone or gyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>Orion,</hi> hath thrée stars shining very bright, of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond greatnesse, in the order of the stars of <hi>Orion,</hi> beeing the 26. 27. and 28. That figure named his sworde hath 6. stars of the third and fourth bignesse, decked in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. and 34. The figure named the <hi>Clubbe</hi> that <hi>Orion</hi> bare in his right hand, when he fought with the dreadfull Bull, that possesseth foure stars, of the fifte and sixt bignesse. In the order 9. 10. 11. and 12. of these the 9. and 10. are in the right hand. Further the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stars, either of the first or second bignesse, as the 26, 27. and 28. bee of the nature of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturne.</hi> But the other stars which are in the 3. 4. 5. and 6. and the clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy star, do imitate the quality of <hi>Saturne,</hi> the 35. which is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4323:50"/>
on his left foote, is of the <hi>Arabians</hi> named <hi>Rigel,</hi> of the first bignesse, and referred to the nature of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto the quality of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The auncient astronomers placed two Dogges in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as they were following the Hare running: of which the one they named <hi>Procion,</hi> and the other the Dag. The image named <hi>Proceon</hi> (in English the fore-Dogge) hath no other name with the Romanes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Caniculer:</hi> that is, the lesser Dog<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And of <hi>Tully (<hi>in fragmentis Arati)</hi>
                  </hi> hée is named the fore-Dog. But the other doeth <hi>Aratus</hi> place vnder the hinder féete of the fore-Dog. To this fore-Dog doth <hi>Ptholomie</hi> attribute onely two stars, others do num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thrée, that in <hi>Ptholomies</hi> time were in <hi>Gemini,</hi> and in our time are in <hi>Cancer.</hi> Of which the fore star which is in the addition of the same, doth possesse the magnitude. The scond star, which standeth on the legge shining bright, is <hi>Procion;</hi> of the first bignesse, al are of the nature of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> and a litle of <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Dogge being the greater, is named of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians Alhabor,</hi> which properly is named the greater dog. And this vnderstand, that the same starre is brightest shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which standeth on the mouth or tung of the Dogge, being of the first bignesse, and named by authors the dog, in the name of the whole image. The star named <hi>Syrius</hi> or the Dog, is placed in the middle Center of heauen, vnto which when the sun shall come, the heate is then doubled, and mens bodies affected with faintnesse. Also they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that star to be called <hi>Syrius,</hi> though the brightnesse of his fiery shining. The Latins name him, the <hi>Caniculer</hi> or Dog-star. Of which the <hi>Caniculer</hi> or Dog daies were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: in that whiles the sun runneth in that part, it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and this through the quality of the season then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that disposeth the time to health or sicknesses. And hercos it is, that whiles for a time it ariseth, the season is not alwaies contagious. <hi>Ptholomie</hi> nameth that Starre
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4323:51"/>
which is on the mouth of the Dog; and assigneth him to be of the first bignesse, most cleare and bright in shining. And to that star which standeth or is placed on the head, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a small quantity: that is, to be a star of the fift bignes. <hi>Auicen</hi> thus writing of the Dog-daies, willeth men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and learne the time in which the greater Dog ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and the season in which the snow lieth stil on the high hilles or mountaines, and the frosty or sharpe colde time, for then is no apt time of ministring medicine. But a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine may safely bee druncke, or otherwise giuen, in the spring and haruest time. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> beeing of the same minde, affirmeth that in the Dog-daies, and before them no purgation may safely be ministred. The beginning of the Dog-daies varieth, according to the diuersity of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Climates, and Latitudes. In our time the Dogge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes begin at the suns entrance into the 10. 11. and 12. degrée of <hi>Leo.</hi> That which aboue was said, that the star <hi>Syrius</hi> is in the middle Center of heauen, is ment that the star is in a celestiall cyrcle, as the Solsticiall colure, whose Center is the Center of heauen, in which that cyrcle is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. This vnderstand, that the sunne is then ioyned with the star <hi>Syrius,</hi> when they both arise together in the Horizont aboue the earth, and setteth <hi>Heliace</hi> West with the sun, though it cannot be séene rise in the morning, for the bright beames of the sun: but after the suns dayly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from it, the star beginneth to arise and be seene in the morning before the sun. To a man of knowledge this is not strange, that the Dog-star ariseth once euery naturall day: yet the words of Auicen are thus ment, that in what time the Dog-star ascendeth with the sun, and this at the Horizontall méeting and ioyning together of them in the morning: which pestilent <hi>Caniculare</hi> time do the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians determine to be of 40. daies long. But the malice of that season is many times ouercome &amp; changed through the strong beames of the Planets hapning in this time: as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4323:51"/>
of <hi>Iupiter, Venus,</hi> and sometimes of <hi>Saturne. Ptholomie</hi> doth assigne to this constellation named the Dog-star, 18. stars, of the first, 3. 4. and 5. magnitude, that in his time were all in <hi>Gemini,</hi> and in our time in <hi>Cancer</hi> (except the 17. star) which is in the end of <hi>Gemini.</hi> And that which is brightest shining in the Dogs mouth, is named <hi>Alhabor,</hi> hauing the quality of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and a litle of <hi>Mars,</hi> and al the others applied to <hi>Venus.</hi>

                  <hi>Hyginus</hi> writing of this image, named the Southerly Crown (which of many is named <hi>Vraniscus</hi>) as if the same appeared fashioned hollow from heauen. The same doth he thus describe, that before the fore féete of <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> are a fewe stars, fashioned into a roundnesse, which forme his Crowne, that many haue imagined as cast from him in bondage maner. And many meane by this Greeke word <hi>Ouraniseos,</hi> the Palat, in that this crowne appeareth fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned like to the Palate, which is a hollownesse aboue the toung. To this celestiall Crowne, fashioned like a litle Palate, doth <hi>Ptholomie</hi> assigne 13. starres, of the fourth, fift, and sixt magnitude, that in his time were all in <hi>Sagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius,</hi> and in our time are in <hi>Sagitarius</hi> and <hi>Capricornus,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Saturne and Mars.</hi>

               <p>This image do some name the monstrous Fish, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fish, the monstrous sea beast, and sea Lion or Beare. This huge fish named the celestiall Whale, is placed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Aries,</hi> and both the fishes, lying a litle aboue the star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Riuer in the Region of heauen. <hi>Ptholomie</hi> doth assigne to this celestiall Whale 22. stars, of the third, fourth, and fift bignesse, that in his time were all placed in <hi>Pisces</hi> and <hi>Aries,</hi> and at this day are in <hi>Pisces, Aries,</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi> and most of them are of the nature of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and some onely of <hi>Saturne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Meridiane</hi> fish (named the Southern or Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fish) and greate, whose <hi>Aliances</hi> are the fishes named, which are placed in the cyrcle of the Zodiacke. This signe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4323:52"/>
or image is placed in the South parte, and séemeth (as it were) with the mouth to drincke of the water comming from the signe <hi>Aquarius. Ptholomie</hi> doth number and giue to this Southerly fish, 11. stars, being of the first, fourth, and fift magnitude, that in his time were all in <hi>Capricor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and in our time are all in <hi>Aquarius.</hi> The brghter starre in his mouth, hath the quality of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercurie.</hi> But those stars placed on the body of the same, are agréeable and a like to the nature of <hi>Saturne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These hitherto for the images placed on the North and South side of the Equatoure.</p>
               <p>5 By the fift, is the declination of the parts of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipticke from the Equatoure, as at the bound from which it is knowne, and both the declinations of the stars, and the latitudes of places learned. The declinations of the stars are called the distances of them from the Equatour, toward either of the Poles of the worlde. The latitudes of places, the spaces from the Equatoure vnto the highest of them raised in the <hi>Meridiane,</hi> as by the toppes gathered and learned, in the standing right ouer. Also by the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure doe we learne the declinations of the Planets, aswel Northerly, as Southerly moued, as more euidently doth appeare, in the solyde Sphere or Globe. So that by the declination of the stars knowne, a man may easily place them in proper instrumentes, by which greate vtility ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. And it is the measure of time, in that the length of the naturall day is knowne thereby.</p>
               <p>6 By the sixt is learned, that in the same Cyrcle (as by the subiect) is both the length of the whole earth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places standing in diuers parts of the earth, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and measured. For according to the exact doctrine of the sphericall tryangles, the longitude or length of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the difference of longitudes is alwaies the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall Arke, and not any Parallell. By it also the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of any degrée of the Zodiacke is knowne, which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4323:52"/>
being had in any day at noone (the sun then shining cleare forth) the Northerly latitude or eleuation of the Pole of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towne, may artificially be knowne. It is besides the measure of time, in that a naturall day is perfourmed by one whole returne of the Equinoctiall, with an adition or inerease to that parte of the Ecclipticke, which the sun in the meane whiles accomplisheth by his proper motion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the motion of the first mouer.</p>
               <p>7 By the seuenth, it much auaileth and helpeth the doctrine of astrology, in that by the guide and leading of the same, are the beginnings of the twelue houses of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen found, when astrologiall figures are erected and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to prognosticate or iudge by: which can neuer so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly be searched and found without the Equatoure, and this through the vnlike motion and ascention of the parts or signes of the Zodiacke. By it also are all Townes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their longitude and latitude, easily placed and found in the earthly Globe: so that by it a man may readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know which Townes are Northerly, and which Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly. It hath besides a most great vse in <hi>Geography,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to finding the distances of places, and vnto placing of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the earthly globe, in hauing the true longitude and latitude of them.</p>
               <p>8 The eight instruction, that by it a man may attaine the knowledge of all the celestiall Parallell cyrcles, and the earthly Zones lying vnder them. As by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Parallel streached along by Rodes, cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be knowne, but by his distance from the Equinoctial as by his principall &amp; fore noted Parallell: which a man may learne and know to bée from the Equatoure, toward the North 36. degrées. The same knowledge may aptly be had, of all the other Parallell cyrcles rightly knowne, so that none (otherwise) can bee prompt and saillfull in Geographicall matters. <hi>Cleonedes</hi> affirmeth <hi>(prima Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor)</hi> that it afterwards behoueth to know how to discribe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4323:53"/>

               <p>This cyrcle also doe the Latines name thwart, through the thwart standing of it: for the Equatour doth compasse the sphere of the worlde, by the iust middle space betwéen either Pole: but the Zodiacke is thwartly drawn both to the sphere of the worlde, and to the Equatoure: so that in some partes it is nearer to the Poles of the same, and in some parts further distance from it. It is crossed also of the Equatoure into two eqnall halfe cyrcles; of which the one is called the Boreall or Northerly halfe cyrcle, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Meridionall or Southerly halfe cyrcle: therefore

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>What is the cause of the thwartnesse of the Zodiacke.</head>
               <p>1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two causes, why the Zodiacke is thwart: the one is, that the neather Spheres vpon the other Exe-trée, and Poles, may bee caried contrary to the motion of the first mouer.</p>
               <p>2 The other is, that there may be diuersities of times, and varieties of qualities and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4323:55"/>
that the sun also may wander and goe about diuers partes of the earth, running in the thwart cyrcle; wherof <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth, that it is necessary, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion in the Zodiacke is vnlike to the motion of the first mouer, that it may therby cause the variety of cresent or growing things. For if there were onely one motion, there should no varietie of growing things be caused.</p>
               <p>3 A like reason to this, that of the same, one parte of it doeth drawe nigh to the top and highest ouer our heades, and the other, that it is remoued and distant from vs, doth cause most commonly the diuersitie in effectes, which vnto the life of things is requisite. As for example, when the sun is in the Northerly halfe of this cyrcle, and neare the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith and highest ouer our heades, hee doeth cause a strong and mighty heat on all things of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by tryall we finde and sée in the summer. If therefore the Zodiacke were not thwart, but shoulde equally approach or drawe nigh according to all the parts of it, then should the sun be alwaies a like neare vs. And when in a short time of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he should cause such a heat, that his heat vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly should be so mighty, that nothing shoulde growe or bee increased, but that those thinges already growne vp and dryed shoulde bee consumed and burnt vp: wherefore the Zodiack is thwartly placed, that the sun mouing into the further halfe, his heat may thereby bee slaked and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in which he being caried departeth from our Zenith, and cold then taken place, as apeareth in the winter. And if the sun should continually run in the South parte of the Zodiack, then through extremity of cold should all things be destroyed in the North part. And as neither heate nor cold is continuall, but successiuely, as those which bée en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred and caused by heate, and consumed by colde. So that the sun procureth (by comming nigh, and going from vs) in the Zodiacke, that it behoueth the Zodiacke to bée thwart. Also a diuersity of the Planets in the Zodiacke.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4323:55"/>
To conclude, we sée that by the comming of the sun to vs, generation is caused, &amp; by his departure from vs, thinges wither and dry.</p>
               <p>This cyrcle called the Zodiack (acording to longitude) is deuided into twelue parts or signes, and neither more nor fewer. And according to latitude or breadth, into 12. degrées. This cyrcle deuided into twelue signes, in that of the auncients it hath béene noted, that in euery reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sun, the moon is twelue time changed and new, and so many times hath hee full light. And that so many changes and full moones doe happen within the compasse of one yeare: by which it pleased them to deuide the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke into so many parts, according to length. But the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of the breadth, hath another cause; that is, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Planets, (except the sun) diuersly wandring from the same cyrcle. To be briefe, this whole cyrcle is deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 360. degrées, for the commodity of this number; in that the dayes of the yeare exceede this number by certayne partes: for the common yeare hath 365. dayes, and 6. houres.</p>
               <p>There is a latitude atributed to the Zodiack, by which it differeth from the other cyrcles, in that they are descry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with one simple compasse, that it might by the larger space, containe the wandring of the Planettes, on either side the Ecclipticke line, least they should excéed the bonds. Yet the sun kéepeth one maner of way and iourney conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in the middle of the Zodiacke, and neuer declineth from it, neither vnto the right nor lefte side, but still kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his proper places immoueable; both in the rising and setting in either quarter, and is all alike in the winter and summer seasons. The declinations also of the sun, do shew and appeare to be equal, being on either side the Equator. So these doe witnesse, that the sun continually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his yéer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motion, describeth and kéepeth vnder that line named the Ecclipticke. But the other Planets doe neither kéepe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4323:56"/>
continually the suns way, nor is drawne in a right path like him, but digressing on either side the suns way, doe wander the Zodiacke by a crooked or bending course; as one whiles moued into the North, and an otherwhiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the South: and from thence returning vnto the sunnes way, as the like knowledge may be had and descerned by the eie.</p>
               <p>For this cause, the learned practisioners described the suns course in the middle place of the Zodiacke, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined from it a latitude to bée attributed to the Zodiacke, which the auncient astronomers determined to bee of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side 6. degrées. But the late writers haue encreased the same, by adding twoe degrées to either side, through the digressions of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> from the sunnes way; which hath béene obserued and noted to digresse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline litle lesse then eight degrées. So that the latitude of the whole Zodiacke (in our time) is concluded and agréed to bee of 16. degrées, and the latitude is reached on either side, from the middle space of the suns cyrcle towarde the Poles of the Zodiacke, eight degrées.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the longitude of the Zodiacke (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the compasse of the circle, neither the beginning nor end can be assigned) which bendeth or is drawne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly round into it selfe; and both closeth and containeth it selfe: yet the practisioners haue assigned by the principall and most auncient doctrine of the godly fathers,, to bee in the poiut of the Equinoctiall spring, which is by the suns comming vnto the Equinoctiall poynte: or truer by the change of the moone that followeth nexte the Equinoctiall spring, is not to be doubted that the yeare then begun. So that they began to recken the Zodiacke from that pointe, where the motions and workings of the sun (the authour and shewer of the yearely space ensued) which after the day and night being alike, the day encreaseth, and hée as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to vs ward, doth after abate the cold on the earth,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4323:56"/>
and both slaketh and melteth the frostes and yce, and the hidden vertues againe of the earth, hee then beginneth to loose, open, chearish, and stirre vp by his liuely heate, and both looseth and sheadeth forth the dew moysture inclosed; and draweth vppe and procureth young plants to spring, through his comfortable warmth dayly shewed vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>They deuided the whole Zodiacke according to length into twelue equall partes (which they named signes) through the moone as guide and ruler of the same: which passing yearely by the Zodiack 13. times, to the suns slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer going twelue times; &amp; conioyned with him in twelue places of heauen. Those signes the ancient Gréeks name <hi>zòdia,</hi> either by the figures of creatures, (which the fixed stars in their standing shewe and expresse) or by some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall agréement, they so assigned names to them. Or els they appointed the names of beasts to the signes, through the congruent nature betwixt Starres and beastes. Also through the effects which the sun hath in those places. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these, the auncient astronomers described the other starres without the Zodiacke by images, that placed into images, they might be the commodiouser taught and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in heauen to the vnderstanding of yong students, and that their rising and setting might also bee the more readily demonstrated. <hi>Ptholomie</hi> named those <hi>Dodekate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mòria,</hi> that is, the twelue parts. The Latines called them signes, and constellations. Also they named those partes signes, for that in those twelue parts, all the seasons of the yeare are noted. Again they named the parts of the signes degrées, of the dayly iourney of the sun in the Zodiack, for that in iourneying by litle and litle, he passeth through the whole Zodiacke.</p>
               <p>They also deuided each signe into 30. parts or degrées, through the suns dayly iourneys gained of the first mouer, which in thirty dayes they declare by experience, to haue
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4323:57"/>
measured and gone almost a twelfe part of the Zodiacke. Or for that the space from one coniunction vnto an other is of 30. dayes, which space (of all writers) is named a moneth. Or else in that the sunne by the same number of daies, hath measured almost this Arke or space of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacke. Whereof they named the selfe same, the thirty part of a signe, through the suns motion euery 24. houres, which the later Latines call degrées, and the Gréeks <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rè,</hi> that the ancient call parts. But the tenne partes or degrées of euery signe, the Gréekes name <hi>Dekatas,</hi> and the Latines Faces; of which each signe doth conteyne thrée.</p>
               <p>The names and characters of the signes of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke, are these <hi>♈ Aries, ♉ Taurus, ♊ Gemini, ♋ Cancer, ♌ Leo, ♍ Virgo.</hi> These in that they make the halfe cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Zodiacke, declining into the North from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatoure, therefore doe they name them, the Boreall and Northerly signes.</p>
               <p>The names and Characters of the other signes of the Zodiacke, are these. <hi>Libra ♎, Scorpio ♏, Sagitarius ♐, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricornus ♑, Aquarius ♒, Pisces ♓.</hi> These in that they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the opposite place, and the halfe cyrcle reaching into the South of the Zodiacke: therefore do they name them, the Meridionall and Southerly signes.</p>
               <p>The sunne also iourneyeth by these signes (as from the West into the East) by a contrary order to the first moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as this figure plainly demonstrateth: beginning ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse at <hi>Aries,</hi> and from <hi>Aries,</hi> passing into <hi>Taurus,</hi> and from <hi>Taurus</hi> into <hi>Gemini,</hi> and so to the ende of the signes.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>They deuided each signe, into 30. degrées of length, in that the whole Zodiacke (like as the other greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser cyrcle) containeth 363. parts, or degrées. And as the Zodiacke hath in length 12. signes, euen so it is requisite the same should be so many degrées broad (as <hi>Capella</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. And as a degrée is in the signe the thirtieth parte or length, the compasse of the whole Zodiacke should be the like in breadth. Although <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> do sometimes digresse from those bonds, yet that excesse is litle, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seldome: and there can bee no other reason of the same, then that such a latitude is permitted or assigned to the Zodiacke.</p>
               <p>To this demaund, why there are onely twelue signes, and no more, doeth <hi>Albumaser</hi> answere: affirming, that the first obseruers of the stars, noted 48. images in the 8. heauen, placed and decked with the stars, that represent sundry formes, and called by them, for the form, standing, or nature of the stars, of which they appointed 12. for the sunnes way: and therefore so many, are the signes of the Zodiacke. But here may bée demanded, where the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Zodiacke is, to which is thus answered
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4323:58"/>
that all the circumferences of the cyrcles imagined are in that hollow of the first heauen, and likewise the signes are conceiued there to bee. And where the signes with the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the eight sphere are moueable, and the starres in them seperated after a time. Yet the number and names, both of the signes and images remaine. So that it is not materiall, if that the starrie <hi>Aries</hi> seperate from the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the zodiacke, and the other signes the like from one another, by a most slowe course are caried, and sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The auncient men deuided the partes or degrées of the signes into lesser portions, for the better attaining the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise point in the suns place. So that they appointed to ech degrée 60. minutes, to each minute 60. seconds, to each se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, 60. thirdes, &amp;c. For the infinite commodity of the numbers in calculating, by reason of multiplication and diuision.</p>
               <p>They also deuided the signes after two condicions, as in the standing, and qualities. In the standing, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished them into principall, fixed, and common signes.</p>
               <p>The principall and moueable signes, are those which nighest succeede the foure principal points of the zodiacke: of which two possesse the Equinoctiall points of the whole cyrcle (as <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra</hi>). The other twoe nighest to the Solstitiall points, are named the Tropickes (as <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer and Capricornus.</hi>) The firme or fixed signes, next to the principall, are <hi>Taurus, Leo, Virgo, and Aquarius.</hi> The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, or meane (or of two bodies, being the other foure) which placed (as in the middle betwéen the principall and fixed signes) doe so obtaine a common nature of both, as <hi>Gemini, Virgo, Sagitarius, and Pisces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the qualities, they assigned them into foure Trients, which the Latines name Tryangles, and thrée cornered the common writers nameth Triangularites, or Tripli'

cities. The first trient containeth <hi>Aries, Leo, and Sagita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> which are by the space of foure signes inclusiuely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, or of 120. degrées: that are hot and dry, fiery, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke, and masculine.</p>
               <p>The second Tyient comprehended <hi>Taurus, Virgo, and Capricornus;</hi> which beeing distaunt by the like space, are colde, and drie, earthly, melancholicke, and feminine.</p>
               <p>The third Trient hath <hi>Libra, Gemini, and Aquarius,</hi> which beeing distaunt by the space of foure signes, are hot and moyst, sanguine, aereall, and masculine.</p>

But the Ecclipse of the moone hapneth at the full, when as the sun is right against the moone; &amp; that the shadowe of the earth falleth betwéen both, whereby the moons light is darkned. So that the moones Ecclipse is none other, then the falling

               <p>The measure of the large space of either side, occupied by the Planets, limited and included by twoe lynes, and the third drawne or described by the middle, is named the Ecclipticke line, and suns place.</p>

               <p>The Eccliptick line is a greater cyrcle consisting in the middle of the Zodiacke, and deuiding it into twoe equall compasses, defined to be eight degrées in breadth on either side, which the sunne maketh by a yearely motion, going thwartly in one continuall way, is deuided by the foure principall points; as the two Equinoctials, and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, into foure quarters.

               <p>The pointes that touch, are the Equinoctiall (as wee haue aboue written) but the other two, furthest distaunt from the Equatoure (which are as markes or boundes for the suns departure) that when he commeth to the one, hée is carried no further, but stayeth there, and from thence drawne vnto the contrary bound: through which turning backe of the sunne, they are named the Tropickes of the Gréeks, and of the Latines; the solsticiall points. Not for that the sun beeing carried vnto them, stayeth and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any space, but neuer resteth, nor leaueth of his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: séeing within certaine daies the Meridiane or Noone shadowes are varied, the day &amp; night spaces either leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and increased, or decreased and shortned notably; as the like is yearely séene. Of these, that which in the Northerly halfe cyrcle is furthest distant from the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure (named the pointe of the summer solstice) the other standing or being right against that, the point of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter solstice.</p>
               <p>These points change their places two maner of waies, as well according to length of the zodiacke by créeping fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the fore going, as in going to and comming short vnto the Equatoure. First that the Equinoctiall pointes, doe ouer go the places of the fixed stars, against the order and course of the signes; and therefore doe the daies of the solstices begin and goe before. For the summer solstice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of <hi>Olimpias</hi> the first day of Iuly, which began the yeare with the Gréeks at the morning rising of that constellation <hi>Syrius,</hi> being notably knowne to many: but in the yeare of Christes birth, it hapned in the 24. day of Iune, And in the yeare 1570. it hapneth in the 12. day of Iune, about 11. of the clocke before Noone. The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter solstice in the first beginning of <hi>Olympias,</hi> hapned the first day of Ianuary, or there about. In the year of Christs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4323:60"/>
byrth it hapned the 15. day of Decmber (in which day at the houre of 12. in the night, they affirme our sauiour to bee borne. The same winter solstice hapneth in the same yeare 1570. on the 12. day of December, aboute 2. of the clocke at after Noone.</p>

For the obseruations of many times doe witnesse, that the arcke of the Colure of the Solstices reached to these points and Equatoure (which they name the suns greatest thwartnesse or declinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) is deminished by litle &amp; litle.

So that the stablished the difference of the greatest and least to be of 24, minutes.

So that as the thwartnesse failing or diminishing; euen so the points of the greatest declination (which are named the solstices) are yearely drawne and moued néerer vnto the Equatoure by 6. minutes, 27. seconds, 24. thirdes, and 9. fourthes: but dayly by one second, two thirds, and so many fourthes, caried neare vnto it.

               <p>As the Equinoctiall points deuide the Ecclipticke lyne into a Northerly and Southerly halfe cyrcle, euen so the solstitiall pointes parte the same into a halfe cyrcle (ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and descending) as to vs. The ascending beginneth from the beginning of <hi>Capricornus,</hi> and endeth at the last pointe of <hi>Gemini,</hi> and containeth <hi>Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries Taurus, and Gemini.</hi> And the descending from the beginning of <hi>Cancer,</hi> reacheth vnto the end of <hi>Sagita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and comprehendeth <hi>Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, and Sagitarius.</hi> So that the sun in that halfe cyrcle, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth from the Southerly region vnto vs, in that from vs it is digressed into the South, and of the same they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued those names.</p>

But the degrée expressed and she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by that great cyrcle in the Eccliptick, is called the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée of the longitude of the star or planet, which according to longitude from the beginning of <hi>Aries</hi> vnto that place, is the Planet moued.</p>
               <p>The other instructeth, and by demonstration sheweth, that from this line the other fiue Planettes wander, one whiles into the North, &amp; another whiles into the South beeing not equally caried. This wandring from the saide line, is named the latitude of the Planets, and is the arke of the great cyrcle, passing by the Poles of the Zodiacke and true place of the Planet, comprehended betwéene the Ecclipticke, and Center of the star.

               <p>The difference betwéene a declination and latitude: is this, that a latitude is the distance of a star or Planet from the eccliptick, toward either of the Poles: which distance is measured in the greate cyrcle drawne by the body of a star, and Poles of the Zodiacke.</p>
               <p>But the declination is a distance from the Equinoctial, when as the sun is caried by a continual and dayly course in the vpper face of the Ecclipticke, and hath no latitude, but a declination onely: yet the other sixe Planets, haue a latitude and declination. The declination of Planets, is the distance of them (or a degrée of the eccliptick) from the equinoctiall. And this measured by the cyrcle drawne by the body of a starre, or degrée of the ecclipticke, and by the Poles of the worlde. The Planets also are said to ascend and descend, by reason of the thwartnesse and bending of the Zodiacke: for the sun doeth ascend in the Northerly signes, but hee descendeth in the Southerly. In the like maner doe all the other Planets, as well by the reason of the ascention, as also of the place. For planets beeing in Northerly signes, haue the arke of ascention greater than in the Southerly. Besides, this part of the world which declineth into the North, is supposed and iudged as to vs, to be raised higher, by reason of the Horizont.</p>
               <p>Further the definition of a signe shall here bee declared, that the same is ment sundry wayes: one whiles to bee a circumference, an other whiles an vpper face: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to be a solyde body.</p>
               <p>The Zodiacke (as I haue afore declared) is one whiles a line all circumference (which is named the Ecclipticke line) an other whiles a swathe, of eight degrées in breadth of either side: Sometimes the zodiacke is called the plain
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4323:63"/>
vpper face of that Ecclipticke: and in an other place the same called a solyde body, which of the saide swathe, and by the two imagined vpper faces is crossed; of which the tops or highest places ouer the head are ioyned togither in the Center of the earth, and the féete are those Parallels of the Ecclipticke ending the swathe, which may worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called a solide zodiacke.</p>
               <p>The being in a signe is ment sixe waies, in that the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the ecclipticke (as I haue afore written) is deuided into twelue equall arks, which are called signes; and the signes ment in the first maner. Those then drawn and imagined in length by the Poles of that ecclipticke line, and by the pointes of the crossings, yet by great cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as that circumference of the ecclipticke: and so the zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacke vnderstoode and described of those, in the other fiue maners or waies, is deuided into twelue equall portions, whose signes are taken and ment so many waies. A signe therefore in the first maner, is mente the lineall circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; but in the second maner the square portion of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall Sphere included with foure arks: of which two are of the Parallells of the ecclipticke, and two of the cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles deuiding, and the one ending againe in the others. A signe in the third maner, is the deuider of the circle taking here the cyrcumference, which signe is vnderstoode in the first maner. A signe in the fourth maner is a certain square (pinacle wise) hauing the sharpe end turned downwarde to the Center of the worlde, and included with foure deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the foote or broader end reaching vp to the sphericall vpper face; which is a signe ment in the second maner, as this figure more plainly demonstrateth, where the letters <hi>A.

the first maner: the letters <hi>F. K.</hi> doe represent the square portion in the second maner: the letters <hi>C. D.

                  </hi> do represent the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the fourth maner: the letters <hi>A. D.

B.</hi> doe shewe the portion in the first maner: the solide deuider betwéen those halfe cyrcles is expressed in the sixt maner.</p>
               <p>Further a signe in the fifte maner, is a portion of the sphericall vpper face (inclosed betwéene two halfe cyrcles) ended at the Poles of the ecclipticke. To conclude, a signe in the sixt maner is mente a solyde deuider of the Sphere, contained in the saide halfe Cyrcles and Sphericall vpper face, which is a signe vnderstood in the fift maner.</p>
               <p>These diuers diuisions serueth (as they write) vnto that end, whereby all things might be inclosed within the signes. For if signes be described in the first maner, then on such wise those stars onely, and those points are said to be in the signes, whatsoeuer shall be in that cyrcumference of the ecclipticke. And in the first signification also is ment to be vnder the ecclipticke, which agréeth onely to the sun, as at this day the sun is (beeing the 23. day of August) in the 9. degrée, and 9. minutes, of <hi>Virgo</hi> at Noone, which is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4323:64"/>
ment to be vnder that part of the eccliptick, that is named the 9. degrée of <hi>Virgo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If in the second maner planets shall be in signes, which doe not excéed sixe degrées of latitude; or thus in the second signification, to be vnder the zodiacke is monte, that here a signe is expressed, inclosed within a square pinnacle por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This signification agréeth to the other planets (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the sun) which decline from the ecclipticke, as <hi>Mars</hi> in this yeare 1599. is in the 15. degrée of <hi>Virgo,</hi> which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that parte of the zodiacke, that is saide to be the 15. of <hi>Virgo.</hi> Also he hath a latitude Northerly of two degrées, and 28. minutes.</p>
               <p>If in the thirde maner, the sun or any starre shall bee in signes (placed in the plain of the eccliptick, or in the third signification to be in a signe) signifieth to be referred vnto any signe of the zodiacke. For the whole heauen is deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into twelue Regions (in cyrcles passing by the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the signes, and Poles of the Zodiacke) of which Regions each is named a signe. And this signification a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeth to the stars, standing without the zodiacke: as the Northerly Crowne, which in our time is in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and referred vnto the signe of the zodiacke that is called <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio;</hi> in that it is betwéene those twoe halfe cyrcles which passe by the beginning and end of <hi>Scorpio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If in the fourth maner, the planets and stars also, not further distant then sixe degrées from the ecclipticke. Or in the fourth signification, is ment or referred vnto any of the twelue Regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of heauen; into which, heauen by those sixe Cyrcles which passe by the beginninges of the signes and Poles of the zodiacke (as is afore written) is deuided. This signification agréeth to those which are in the ayre, (as be the Comets.) As if I wrote that a Comet were in <hi>Leo,</hi> here I meane the sixe cyrcles passing by the Poles of the zodiacke, and beginnings of the signes, deuiding both heauen and the whole neather Region of the worlde into
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4323:64"/>
twelue equall partes. So that a Comet is saide to bee in <hi>Leo,</hi> séeing it is in that twelfe parte which the twoe halfe cyrcles describe, running or stretching by the beginning and end of <hi>Leo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If in the fift maner, all the stars and points ment in the vpper face of the sphere, be included in signes. If in the sixt maner, then whatsoeuer is in the world (whether the same be in the Ethereall, or Elementarie region) is accounted to be included within a signe.</p>
               <p>Here is further to be noted, that the starres may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be receiued into signes, or inclosed within signes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<figure/>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:4323:65"/>
these sundry deuisions. For the deuision of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipticke, alone were sufficient, that a star or any point be so brought vnto his signe, that the same may be said to bée in the signe. As by a like example the preposition (<hi>in</hi>) vsed for the worde (<hi>sub,</hi>) in English (<hi>vnder.</hi>) So that if the sun were saide to be in <hi>Aries,</hi> then is the same ment to bee and run vnder <hi>Aries.</hi> And for a more readier and easier conceiuing of the former lesson taught, vse the examples before demonstrated.</p>
               <p>Here conceiue, where the cyrcumferences of the cyrcles are ment. And first imagine the circumference of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacke, and all the other cyrcles (as I haue afore written) to be in the hollow vpper face of the first mouer, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as it were in the first (after the second condicion of motions) and demonstrateth alike distaunce and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the cyrcles without impediment.</p>
               <p>Although the Horizont, the Meridiane, the Uerticiall, and other cyrcles (in respect of the habitation or dwelling place) remaine immoueable in that vpper face of the first moouer: yet doeth it nothing hinder (although heauen or the first mouer be drawne about) that such cyrcles be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to bee immoueable. For there is nothing more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeable, then to imagine cyrcles fixed, and those abiding in any vpper face of the earth. So that it is necessary, that the Zodiacke, the Equatoure, and the other cyrcles be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed moueable in the hollow face of the first mouer, as the bound and inclosure of the whole worlde. The Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zont and Meridiane, and the others, placed immoueable in that hollowe and fixed vpper face, in which the whole earth is placed, by this meanes the fixed cyrcles shoulde stay in the fixed vpper face, and the mouable cyrcles shuld be drawne about with the moueable. As in a materiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, and solide sphere a man may sée, in which the zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacke, the Equatoure, and other moueable cyrcles, are drawne about vpon the Exe-trée, betwéene the two Cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4323:65"/>
remaining steady, of which the one representeth the Horizont, the other the Meridian.</p>
               <p>Whether the same may be described in the hollowe, or in the imbossing of the first moouer of the saide cyrcumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, it is little or nothing regarded: yet consider this, that all men may behold and sée within the heauen or first mouer, the hollowe vpper face of his inclosure, to describe and imagine the cyrcles in the same.</p>
               <p>The Cyrcles placed without the materiall instrument, must of necessity force a man to describe the cyrcumferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Cyrcles in that outwarde face of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the Zodiacke is ment and described ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his diffinition (being a greater Cyrcle) whose cyrcumference in the hollowe of the first moouer described into signes, degrées, and minutes, (as was afore writen) is deuided.

cording to the diuers eleuation of the Pole, whereof the Colures are called vnperfect cyrcles.</p>
               <p>There are two maner of Colures, as the Colure of the solstices, and Colure of the equinoctials. These two grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cyrcles are drawne by the Poles of the world: of which the one goeth by the Poles of the Zodiacke, and the other by the sections of the Zodiacke and Equatoure. That which passeth by the Poles of the equatour and Zodiack, doth deuide in two parts each halfe cyrcle, as well of the equatour, as the Zodiacke. Therefore the one condicion of the Colures goeth by the solsticiall pointes of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke (which are the beginnings of <hi>Cancer and Capricorn,</hi> and the furthest pointes from the equatour) whereof it is named the solsticiall Colure. The other is named the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall Colure, séeing it entreth by the saide equinoctiall sections, which are the beginnings of <hi>Aries and Libra;</hi> that is, the equinoctiall points. So that these Colures deuide aswell the equinoctiall as the Zodiacke into foure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in that they goe by the foure principall poyntes of them.</p>
               <p>The Colures generally are called al the greater cyrcles drawne by the Poles of the world, which take their name thereof, insomuch as they neuer are descerned or séene whole in the turning about of the worlde, as the other cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but vnperfect and lacking. For both the arks right against one another about the Poles, in the thwart sphere are not séene both at once.</p>
               <p>For they are either continually in sight to vs, and neuer drawne away or hid like vnto those which be neare to the eleuated Pole. Or else they neuer appeare in sight to vs, but are continually hid from vs, as those which be the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites.</p>
               <p>But the reaching of the Colures fastneth in the two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, extended and passing by the foure principall pointes of the ecclipticke, as the equinoctials and solsticials, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4323:66"/>
touching one another in the Poles of the world, do in their cyrcumferences make right angles, and part the Zodiack and equatoure into foure equall quarters. The Colure of the equinoctials, resting in the equinoctiall points. The other containing the solstiticiall pointes, is called the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of the solstices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Colure of the equinoctials is a greater cyrcle, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable, and euery where alike: drawne by the Poles of the worlde or equatour, and the equinoctial points, as the beginnings of <hi>Aries and Libra,</hi> making with the equatour right sphericall angles, with the Zodiack thwart angles. For oftentimes the greatest cyrcles (by a mutual touching togither) doe make right angles in the sphere, as they cut in two parts or into equall halfe cyrcles, and by the Poles one another: and contrariwaise when they cutte one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Poles, then doe they forme and make right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with their cyrcumferences, and part one the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to equall parts (as writeth <hi>Theodosius</hi> in his first Booke <hi>de Sphera,</hi> and in <hi>propositi,</hi> 18. 19. 20. and 21.)</p>
               <p>Or thus, the Colure of the equinoctials (which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the equinoctiall Colure) is a greater Cyrcle passing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4323:67"/>
by the poles of the world, and the first pointes of <hi>Aries</hi> &amp; <hi>Libra;</hi> where the two Equinoctiall points are said to be: in that the sunne causeth a like day and night in euery place; or for that these pointes are in the Equator, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is called the Colure distinguishing the equinoctials: so that the two Colures crosse one another on the Poles of the world, at right spericall Angles.</p>
               <p>It is called the Colure of the equinoctials, for that it passeth by the equinoctiall pointes, as by the beginnings of <hi>Aries</hi> &amp; <hi>Libra</hi> (which they call the Equinoctial pointes) for that when the sunne hapneth into either of them, the day and night is of equall length throughout the Earth; which commeth to passe twise in the yeare (as in the Spring and Haruest) whereof the one is called the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall spring (and at this day is about the eleuenth of March) which is the day before <hi>Gregory:</hi> the other, the Haruest Spring, and hapneth in our time the 14. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, that is, thrée daies afore <hi>Lambert,</hi> whereof ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this auncient verse:</p>
               <q>Lampert, Gregori, nox est aequata diei.</q>
               <p>The Colure of the Solstices is a greater circle, mouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and euery where alike drawn by the solsticiall points or the beginnings of <hi>Cancer</hi> &amp; <hi>Capricornus,</hi> and the Poles of the Zodiacke and Equatoure, making right sphericall angles with both, for of both is the Poles comprehended. And according to <hi>Theodosius propo. lib. 2. de Spera,</hi> that by any twoe cyrcles crossing one the other (when a thirde deuideth the parts of both equally and in two partes) the same is the greater cyrcle, and passeth by the poles of both. But that which passeth by the Poles of the other Cyrcle, doth part it in two parts, and at right angles.</p>
               <p>Here may be demanded, why the other twoe are called the solsticiall pointes, séeing the Sunne stayeth no where. Which is thus answered, that the sun digressing from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther equinoctiall poynt by his proper motion, doeth dayly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4323:67"/>
depart from the equinoctiall cyrcle, till hée come vnto the solstitiall point, where he is furthest distant from the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure. But immediately after hee beginneth to returne and come againe vnto the equatour, till he come vnto the other equinoctiall pointe. So that the pointe of the suns furthest distance (which is the beginning of <hi>Cancer</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricornus</hi>) and of the same called the solstice, in that the sun stayeth there: that is, ceaseth from his further going or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and beginneth againe to come to the Equatoure. For the sun after his comming vnto that point departeth, and commeth againe to the equatour: so that the end, the departure, and beginning of his comming, is the solstice. Therefore not for that the sun stayeth there, are they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the solstices, although about those pointes of the going and comming of the sun, it is so small, that for foure, sire, or more daies after, he séemeth in iudgement as it were to stay in one declination: and therefore for that cause may be named the solstitials. These of sundrie (as of <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) are also called Tropicke points, through the suns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning. And these may be called Uerticiall or Cardinal cyrcles (séeing they goe by those tops of the world) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse or shewe the foure quarters of the Zodiacke. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer séeing certaine parts of these cyrcles being neare the pole are hid, and the other right against them nothing at all discerned at any time: therefore is it that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Greeke <hi>Kolouroi,</hi> which is in English, maimed and vnperfect, as <hi>Proclus, Diadochus, Mocrobius and Capella,</hi> write. But this agréeth not in the right Horizont, séeing there is no part of heauen, which doeth alwaies remaine there hid. But in the description of the astrolobie, howe large soeuer the same bee, yet onely these cyrcles appeare continually vnperfect.</p>
               <p>Yet further, the Colure of the solstices, or the cyrcle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing the solstices, which also is called the solstitiall cyrcle, is a greater cyrcle drawne and passing by the poles
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4323:68"/>
of the world, and Zodiacke, and the greatest declinations of the same: and by the beginnings of <hi>Cancer and Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornus.</hi> It is called the Colure of the solstices, in that it passeth by the solsticiall pointes (as by the beginnings of <hi>Cancer and Capricornus</hi>) which are named the solsticiall pointes; for that in them the solstice is caused: that is, the suns comming vnto those pointes, departeth not further from the Equinoctiall, but commeth) againe vnto the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall, which is caused twice in the yeare, as in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and winter: whereof the one is called the summer sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice (which in our time hapneth the 12. of Iune or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about) beeing the nexte day after <hi>S. Barnabe</hi> the Apostle, where the longest day is holden to bée. The other the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter solstice, which in our time hapneth about the 11. or 12. day of December (being a day or two before <hi>Lucie</hi>) where the day is accompted shortest: whereof is this auncient verse extant.</p>
               <q>Vitus est Lucia, dant tibi solstitia bina.</q>
               <p>Of the former also ensueth, that there is certaine fixed and moueable Colures. For there is a fixed Colure of the equi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>octiale, which passeth by the poles of the world, and section of the equatoure and Ecclipticke of the first mouer. The fixed Colure of the solstices doth cut this at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles in the poles of the world, and passeth by the middle of the suns greatest declination. Séeing neither the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctials nor solstices, are caused according to the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the astronomers (as afore may appeare) both in these points, aswell as in others: Therefore a man must conceiue, that the Colures be moueable: of which the one goeth by the true equinoctiall; that is, by the section of the suns way, and equatour, and by the Poles of the worlde, and the other of the solstices, passeth by the suns greatest declination. These hitherto written, may more plainer appeare, by this demonstration here following.</p>
               <p>

one from another, the former large instruction of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctials, may easily shew at any time, vnto which a man must alwaies resorte.</p>
               <p>The suns greatest declination, is the arke of the Colure of the solstices, contained betwéene the equatoure and ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tropicke: this of sundry practisioners is diuersly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For <hi>Ptholomie</hi> founde the same in his time to bee of 23. degrées, 51. minutes, and 20. seconds: of which the whole cyrcle is noted to bée 360. degrées, but after <hi>Alnie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of 23. degrées, and 33. minutes. But the later prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisioners haue founde the same to bee 23. degrées, and 30. minutes. <hi>Purbachius</hi> hath found the same to be of 23. and 21. minutes: which variation of the suns greatest decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is, through the comming and going of the eight Sphere, (which is named the trembling motion.) But this is demonstrated and taught more at large in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oricks.</p>
               <p>If any desire to obserue the suns greatest declination, let him take the altitude of the sunne about the winter sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, in the shortest day at Noone: which altitude beeing kept a parte, worke the like, the sun being about the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer solstice, and the suns greatest altitude at Noone found by the rule of the astrolobie; looke that in the bordure of the same, and take the middle of that arke, which is betwéene the suns least and greatest eleuation at Noone, which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth the myddle, and shall bee the Suns greatest decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of the suns declinations, with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stars, is very profitable; in that by the same, and the perfection of the eleuation of the pole, the true place of the sun (if the same be vnknowne) may bee knowne, the suns greatest declination presupposed, after this maner as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.

               <p>Here may be demaunded whether that point of heauen most Northerly, be not the Northerly Pole of the world, and that point most Southerly, the Southerly Pole of the world. To which is thus answered, that if regard be had vnto the Equatoure and right Horizont, which passeth by the Poles of the world, and hath the equatour for the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiall, or in stéede of the verticiall cyrcle. But wee which haue not the Poles of the world in the Horizont (in whose cyrcumference these foure principall pointes of the East, West, North, and South, are accustomed to be noted) are forced to call that Northerly section of the Meridiane and Horizont, the most Northerly point, and that section right against the most Southerly point. For in euery place there are two sections which the meridiane and verticiall cyrcle doe make with the Horizont, which are two right sections in the plaine of that Horizont (cutting at right angles one an other in the Center) that expresse and shew those foure quarters of the worlde, from which the principall windes blowe; as East, West, North, and South.

               <p>To returne vnto the matter of the Meridiane: the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of Meridianes is no otherwise caused, then the swelling of the earth, as in the first part I haue sufficiently written: the cause of which is, that one like parte of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen cannot be the top or height of euery place. Therefore one meridiane cannot serue all places, but that in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a proper Meridiane is caused ouer the head. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiane also is that which when the sun commeth vnto the highest ouer vs, foresheweth by his working and heat the midday. This meridiane is a greater cyrcle, passing by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> poles of the world and Zenith, or a direct pointe ouer the head, abiding immoueable at the motion of the sphere.</p>
               <p>This cyrcle is differing to euery Citty and people, by reason of the East and West, and is a proper meridiane caused ouer the heade. For this is manifest, that at the chaunging of the verticiall point, there is caused an other Meridian, through the swelling and roundnesse of the earth. Also a man may of one meridian line, describe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (as writeth <hi>Iohannes a regio monte</hi>) for in that instant of the Noonetide, by letting downe right a plum line, the shadowe of the line causeth a newe Meridiane line on the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4323:73"/>
platforme. Therefore these with the verticiall line in the the Center to the Horizont (crossing one an other at right angles) doe indicate the foure quarters of the worlde: as the meridian line, the North and South, the verticial line, the East and West.</p>
               <p>The Horizont formeth the quarters of the east and west: of which the one is called the East rising, or easterly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or end: the other called the West setting, and quarter of the West.</p>
               <p>The Meridiane defineth the boundes of the lowest and highest of heauen, and the quarters or middle motions of the day and night time: of which, that consisting the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per halfe Sphere, is named the highest place and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of heauen, the other which containeth the lowest place right against it, called the bothom or lowest of heauen.</p>
               <p>The Meridiane is a greater cyrcle, immoueable, not one and the same euery where, but to euery place peculiar and proper, drawne by the top of the place and Poles of the worlde (vnto which the sun carried by the motion of the first moouer) doeth in the day time cause high Noone, and in the night time drawne right against it causeth mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>night.</p>
               <p>If this cyrcle were moueable like others, then at the motion of the sphere woulde it departe from our Zenith, and so loose the name of the Meridiane: neither woulde it deuide in proper place vnder it, the artificial day into two equall parts; séeing by that motion, the Meridiane should approach néerer to one part of the Horizont, then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part. Nor should it stay the Horizont at right angles, of which it is numbred and accompted amongest the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde cyrcles of the sphere. The like affirmeth <hi>Proclus,</hi> writing that the Meridiane is none of those cyrcles which is noted and decked with starres. For the cyrcles of the sphere are distinguished by starres, whereby those cyrcles may more easily be knowne in heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:4323:73"/>The meridianes are changed by the continuall chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of place in the swelling or imbossing of the earth (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to longitude.) For by going continually right forth toward the East and West, it doeth purchase newe Meridianes: as by going thrée miles forth, then is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pointe of heauen, differing from the first ouer a mans heade and gone further by foure minutes of a degrée.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proclus</hi> affirmeth, that 300. furlongs cause no sensible alterations to happen of the Meridian: and this is ment of those which are placed vnder diuers Meridianes, and Parallelles. For those which are placed vnder one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell and diuers Meridianes, perceiue and sée no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all.</p>
               <p>Hee which goeth strait from the North into the South, or they which directly iourney toward either of the Poles of the worlde, doe continually trauaile vnder one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiane. In that all Merdianes doe go from one Pole to another, therefore no iourney causeth by this meanes an other meridiane.</p>
               <p>There are as many meridians in number, as there bée differences of verticiall points (right ouer diuers parts of the earth) in going toward the East and West. The halfe of the equinoctiall hath 180. degrées, whereof the Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers doe assigne and distinguish so many meridians, in such sorte, that each Meridiane doeth passe by the twoe opposite degrées of that Equinoctiall, and Poles of the world.</p>

The longitude of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<figure/>
or citties is accompted: as for example, in the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, from the point <hi>E.</hi> Westward toward the point <hi>F.</hi> in that the Cosmographers accompted the longitudes at the equatoure, &amp; in it a degrée maketh 700. furlongs on earth. That the Cosmographers begin to accompt the longituds at the West, is for this reason; that the motions of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond mouings (that is of the planets) are accompted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly from the West to the East.</p>
               <p>The longitude of a place is the arcke of the equinoctiall cyrcle, or of any Parallell contained betwéene two Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianes, of which the one lyeth ouer the fortunate Iles, and the other streacheth ouer the top of the proper place noted,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4323:74"/>
where the same distance of place is gathered from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Iles at the equinectiall, or at the Parallell of the place. The fortunate Iles are situated and lying in the sea, called <hi>Oceanus Libicus</hi> beyond <hi>Mauritania</hi> (betwéene the Equatoure and the tropicke of <hi>Cancer</hi>) which in our time is called the Iles of <hi>Canarie,</hi> and lie further into the North from the equatour, then <hi>Ptholomie</hi> noted or acoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. But the latitude, they accompted to bee a space of the earth lying betwéene either pole, accompted in the Meridiane drawne by the poles of the worlde, or a whole tract of the earth knowne and streached beyonde, and on this side the equatoure, toward either Pole of the worlde. They stablished the beginning of the latitude in the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall (as in the middle cyrcle exquisitely betweene ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pole) and common bound to both the Southerly and Northerly places,</p>
               <p>So that the latitude of a place, is the arke of the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diane, betwéene the equinoctiall and Parallell drawne by the top of the place: or it is the distance of a place from the equinoctiall. This alwaies is accounted in that meridian, which hangeth directly ouer the top of the place, and to one degrée of the same, doe 500. surlongs, or 15. Germaine miles answere.</p>
               <p>The arks of the latitudes doe not differ from the eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the pole, but in the standing onely. For the eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pole is the arke of the meridian, from the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zont vnto the Pole, raysed on high from the plaine of the Horizont. The latitude of a place, is the arke of the same meridian, placed betweene the equinoctiall and verticiall point. To conclude, the latitude of a place, and eleuation of the pole do not differ in the magnitude or largenes, but in standing onely.</p>
               <p>By the former figure appeareth, that the Arke of the longitude of places or citties known, is forthwith offered at the first sight: as the arke <hi>E. P.</hi> or <hi>P. O.</hi> or <hi>O. N. &amp;c.</hi>

And séeing the equatour (being in compasse about 360. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées) doeth wholy ascend in 24. houres aboue the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zont regularly: of this it commeth to passe (whiles in ech houre 15. degrées of the equatour doe ascend) that through the longitude of cities, it is easily knowne the hourely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of one place vnto an other, séeing the sun commeth later to the meridian to them which are nearer to the East then to them in the West, whereof if a citty shall be situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>L.</hi> and an other in <hi>K.</hi> the arke <hi>L.

So that the astronomer maketh or accompteth not his day, from the rising or setting of the sun through the thwartnesse of the Horizont, which causeth the variety &amp; notable difference of the inclination of the Zodiacke, vnto the horizont of the angles, and largenesse of the rising. But they begin to accompt from noone or midnight (the sun then occupying the Meridian) through the Sunne, which congruence all the meridianes haue with the right horizont. And that a lesser variety of the inclination of the Zodiacke hapneth vnto the meridiane and angles, which it maketh with the meridiane. Also in this cyrcle is the Zenith or direct point noted, from which the distances of the stars, and Parallel cyrcles are gathered.</p>
               <p>3 The third vtility of this cyrcle is, that the meridian altitudes of the sun and starres are gathered and noted in this cyrcle, but what vtility they offer, shall sufficiently appeare in one or two examples. For when you shall haue the meridiane altitude and this in any time, then thereof you shall easily know the altitude or eleuation of the pole, if you minde to proue and try the same (the sun being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meridiane of your place) take his altitude by some Instrument; as either by an astrolaby, or quadrant, which altitude found, you shall know the particular declination of the sun, by that afore taught, which shall bee caused by the suns place, at the instant time known by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Ephemere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redes. For if the sun shall be in Northerly signes, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the declination of the instant from the suns ascention Southerly: but if the sunne shall be in Southerly signes, then that declination shall be added to the ascention of the suns meridiane, and that which remaineth shall be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuation of the equatoure from the Horizont, or comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Latitude of the place, which is alwayes

For the longitude of euery place from the meridiane (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the fortunate Iles) endeth and resteth at the meridian streaching ouer the toppe of the same. Also it is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:4323:76"/>
a space included within two meridianes, of which the one resteth at the fortunate Iles, and the other ouer the top of the proper place.</p>
               <p>4 In the meridianes (as in the subiect) the distances of the stars from the equatoure, the latitudes of places, and the eleuations of the Pole are accompted. For the studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and skillfull practisioners, obserue the latitudes of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the eleuations of the pole, not to differ in the quan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tity, but in the standing onely. For the eleuation of the pole, is the arke of the meridiane from the horizont, raised vnto the pole. The latitude of the place, is the arke of the same meridian, contained betwéen the equatour and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiall point: so that it is manifest that these arks differing in the standing, doe agrée in magnitude, whose verticiall points, one meridiane containeth, but not one Parallell, by an equall space from the west) be vnequall distant from the equatour, and are then said to differ in the latitude on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Contrariwise, to whose tops one and the same Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell, and not one meridian, but each place proper; those by like spaces from the equatour, be distant by vnlike spaces from the fortunate Iles, and are said to differ in the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude onely. So that in both they are saide to differ; to whome the Parallell only serueth, and they to whome the proper meridiane serueth: for they haue their spaces vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to either bound. Therfore the difference of latitude is the arke of the meridiane, contained betwéene the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelles of the two places, distant from the equatour. The quantity of the same is thus knowne; if from the halfe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatour toward either pole of the places standing, the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser latitude of the nearer, bee abated from the greater lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude more further off: if from the halfe equatour the places be deuided vnder (that the one half leaneth into the North and the other into the South) by the latitudes of both ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether one or both ly vnder one meridian or diuers meridians. For it forceth not in the meridian of both, that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:4323:77"/>
the latitudes bee ioyned togither, séeing all meridians are alike in the sphere.</p>
               <p>The difference of the longitude, is the arke of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall or Parallell, inclosed betwéene the meridianes of the twoe places, distaunt from the fortunate Iles, and in themselues: by which the longitude of one place excéedeth the longitude of another. The same longitude is the arcke of the equinoctial, séeing the places be vnder the equatour. For in the only longitude the places, the common Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelles, and tops of both bended, doe differ: in that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelles (from the equatour) toward the opposite quarters of the equall Parallelles (as places to which they be right ouer) doe likewise differ. The meridians (as is afore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) are the greatest cyrcles of the sphere of the worlde, bended by the verticiall points of all places, but drawn to the equatoure (as by the Poles) of which they passe vnto right angles, and by a mutuall consent, make angles in the Poles of the world, which the arks of the equatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed betwéene those meridians, are measured, that by so much as a quarter of the cyrcle they bee distant from them: euen so the equatoure from his Poles, is on either part distant by a quarter of the greatest cyrcle. Those arks doe containe the difference of longitude, by which one of the meridianes is further distant into the East then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so that the angles vnto the Poles betwéene the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianes, are rightly named the angles of the difference of longitude; and by the arks of the equatour, those also come into knowledge: for there is a mutuall relation betweene the angles and arkes each one of them towards another, which doe measure the angles. The latitude of places, is the distance of the verticiall points from the equatour, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the meridian. If then from the whole quarters of the meridians (which to the equatoure and Pole of the world, toward which the places decline the equall arkes bee stretched to the latitudes, then the seates of the places
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4323:77"/>
giuen, or the verticiall points of them shall be found. And the other arks from these points vnto the Pole (which by a mutuall section doe make an angle) the complements of the latitudes, be known by the degrées abated from 90. in the degrées of the latitudes.</p>
               <p>For a more plaine vnderstanding of the former, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this demonstration here following: where the cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the meridian is described by the letters <hi>AB.</hi> and by the Pole of the world <hi>B.</hi> is the cyrcumference <hi>G. D.</hi> defined. To the verticiall point <hi>A.</hi> or pole of the Horizont is the cyrcumference of the Horizont <hi>E. F.</hi> drawn. Séeing that <hi>B.</hi> the pole of the equatour <hi>G. D.</hi> Therefore the arke <hi>B. D.</hi> a quarter of the greatest cyrcle, by which from <hi>D. G.</hi> the equatour <hi>B.</hi> the pole is distant. And as the letter <hi>A.</hi> is the verticiall point, <hi>E. F.</hi> is the pole of the Horizont: euen so the arke <hi>A. E.</hi> shall bee a quarter of the greatest cyrcle: and the quarters of one cyrcle are <hi>D. B.</hi> and <hi>A. E.</hi> for that cause are they equall in themselues. If therefore the same common be abated from both: that is, the middle ark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene <hi>A. B.</hi> which remaine, shall be the equall arks. And the arke <hi>A. D.</hi> is equall to the arke <hi>E. B.</hi> But the arke <hi>A. D.</hi> is from the verticiall pointe vnto the equatour, which is called the latitude of the place. That <hi>E. B.</hi> is the arke
<figure/>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:4323:78"/>
from the Horizont vnto the pole, which is called the eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pole. Therefore to the latitude of the place is the eleuation of the pole equall, as was afore declared.</p>
               <p>Further by the suns meridian had and found, you may easily conceiue the eleuation of the pole, and habitude of the sphere. For the whole quarter is, of 90. degrées. Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the suns meridian altitude in the equinoctiall, must be subtracted from 90. degrées, the rest shew the eleuation of the Pole. As for example, the suns meridian altitude of <hi>Viteberge</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> in the time of the equinoctiall, is of 38. degrées, and 10. minutes, the rest of the degrées of the quarter shall appeare to bee 51. degrées, and 50. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, which eleuation of the pole neer agréeth to London. So that by so many degrées, is the Pole there eleuated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Horizont. And as the quadrant is from the pole vnto the equinoctial: euen so is the quadrant from the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith vnto the Horizont. If therefore in the time of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall, the distance of the Horizont vnto the suns alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude be of 38. degrées, and 10. minutes; which is not the halfe part of the quarter, the same yet being subtracted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole quarter, doeth shew that the rest shall bee more then halfe part of the quarter: that is, 51. degrées, and 51. minutes. For those spaces which are from the pole vnto the Equinoctiall, and from the Zenith vnto the Horizont, are alike: what the distance of the Zenith is from the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, the same likewise is the Horizont vnto the Pole; that is, the latitude of the place, is equall to the eleuation of the pole.</p>
               <p>To declare that the latitude of a place is equall to the eleuation of the pole, these foure propositions are to be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued. First, the quarters of one and the same cyrcle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where taken, are equall one to the other. Secondly, the poles by the quarter; that is, 90. degrées bee distant from their cyrcle. Thirdly, the Zenith is the pole of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zont. Fourthly and last, the equals abated from the equals
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4323:78"/>
the equals still remaine. So that two quarters of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian taken (as that which is from the equinoctiall vnto the pole, and that which is from the Zenith vnto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizont) which séeing they are quarters of one and the same cyrcle, therefore are they likewise equall one to the other; that is, either containeth 90. degrées, when fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these two quarters the common arke is abated; which is betwéene the Zenith and Pole of the worlde: and the rest of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals remaine (as the arke which is from the equinoctiall vnto the Zenith) and called the latitude of the place; and the arke (which is from the Pole of the world vnto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizont) also called the eleuation of the Pole, as may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded of the former <hi>Viteberge,</hi> that is of 51. degrées, and 50. minutes.</p>
               <p>Yet that you may easilier finde and knowe the eleuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pole of your City or Towne, you must first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and haue the suns meridian altitude; which worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly may be had and obserued by the shadow. As when the suns altitude in the time of the equinoctiall is precisely of 45. degrees, the shadowe then is like to the <hi>Gnomone,</hi> which is at <hi>Venice</hi> (as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth) also of <hi>Milaine</hi> and <hi>Lions:</hi> for the sun to them is in the time of the equinoctial, in the middle of the quarter. But when the suns altitude excéedeth 45. degrées, then is the shadow caused lesser, as of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the sunnes meridian altitude in the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall is of 42. degrées, and 10. minutes: so that the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe is there shorter. Also <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the ninth part of the <hi>Gnomon</hi> in the equinoctiall, doth lack of the noone shadow. But when the suns altitude is lesser then 45. degrées, the shadow of the <hi>Gnomon</hi> is caused lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The like is with vs through all winter and the time of the equinoctiall: for we sée the shadowes of mens bodies to be longer, for that the suns altitude in that time is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer 45. degrées. For how much the shadow is longer then the halfe part of the quarter, so much the lesser is the suns
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4323:79"/>
altitude then 45. degrées. As of <hi>Viteberge</hi> in the 10. day of September, the suns meridian altitude is then of 39. degrees, and 21. minutes: but when the sun is further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant by the 45 degrée of the quarter (or by the halfe of the quarter) then ensueth, that the shadow is so much longer then the <hi>Gnomon,</hi> or 45, degrées. For the Noone shadow in the 10. day of September is the like vnto the <hi>Gnomon,</hi> as the 50. degrées, and 39. minutes, are vnto 45. degrées.</p>
               <p>Heere you sée how by the meridian shadowe, you may finde the suns altitude; which obtained, you shall easily find the altitude or eleuation of the Pole (especially in the time of the equinoctiall.) For the suns altitude then from the whole quarter; that is, from 90. degrées, must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and the eleuation of the pole shall remaine and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be, as is aboue taught.</p>
               <p>Here by the way shall bee taught how to describe and find the meridian line, whose vse is great both for the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician</hi> and <hi>Architecter,</hi> in making of dials, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessary Instruments. To know and do this, haue a plaine body well polished and smothe, standing euen on
<figure/>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:4323:79"/>
euery side, that the one side bee no higher or more leaning then the other; in the Center of which, howe large so euer the cyrcle about be drawne, set vpright a stéele, yron pin, or other <hi>Gnomon,</hi> as here the letters <hi>A. F.</hi> doe expresse: which pin must bee very straight, and not excéede the cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the cyrcle, but his top to be equall to it: then shall it be alike distant round about, when it shall be alike distant from thrée points at the least of the cyrcumference. But the height of the stéele or <hi>Gnomon</hi> may not excéede a quarter of the diameter of the cyrcumference, and that for the same cause, that the meridiane shadowe (which of the shadowes is then most shor) tthat falleth within the aboue said cyrcle described. In this cyrcle thus drawne and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, appeareth a shadow by the <hi>Gnomon</hi> of the suns shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the forenoone, vntill it touch precisely the cyrcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the cyrcle, like as the shadowe <hi>A. C.</hi> demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; the point touched is noted and expressed by the point <hi>C.</hi> In the same maner is the afternoone shadow examined and found; whose point touched, is also noted by the point <hi>E.</hi> So that both the shadowes end within the cyrcumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and at the bounds also of the shadowes, are the two pointes noted. The arke contained and included by the pointes <hi>C. E.</hi> betwéene these, is deuided into twoe equall parts in the point <hi>D,</hi> by which and the Center of the cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>A.</hi> is the right line <hi>B. A. D.</hi> drawne, that shall bee the meridian line, which is as the common section of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizont and meridian. Thus is the way and rule of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian line described. For so <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writeth, and <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes a regio monte</hi> in his <hi>Capindarie,</hi> which as soone as that shadow of the <hi>Gnomon</hi> falleth on his line, it shall then be the point of noone, wheresoeuer the sun at that time is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. If another certaine line shal cut this by the Center of the cyrcle (lately described) at right angles, that shall bee the common verticall section of the cyrcle with the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zont, which may be named the verticiall line.</p>
               <p>Seeing it is somewhat harde to finde the height of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4323:80"/>
Pole vnto any day prescribed, &amp; that the same may more easily and surer be attained and founde, you shall vse this table here following: by the helpe of which you may with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out great labour, finde and know the eleuation of the pole. For to procéede and worke by this manner, seeke first the suns meridian altitude at the day offered, either by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strolaby or quadrant; but rather by the instrument named the quadrant, in whose bordure are 90. degrées drown or written, expressed by reason of the <hi>Gnomon</hi> and shadowe vpwarde. After séeke the degrée of the Ecclipticke by the <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> which the sun obtaineth at noone of the day offered: next by the table folowing, take the declination of the degrée founde (by meane of the equinoctiall) if the sun then shall bee in Northerly signes, abate or subtract from the suns altitude afore found: but if in Southerly signes, then adde vnto the suns altitude. The produce or rest is the eleuation of the equinoctiall, which abstracted or aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the whole quarter; that is, from 90. degrées, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth &amp; sheweth the eleuation of the pole, as in the 10. day of September, the suns altitude in the twelfe houre (or at noone) is of 39. degrées, and 21. minutes. To finde this eleuation of the pole, I enter the table following, where I finde and sée the 27. degrée of <hi>Virgo,</hi> to haue the declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one degrée, and 11. minutes: which degrée and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes (séeing they are in the Northerly part of the worlde) are to be subtracted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the suns altitude that day, and the degrées which remaine are 38. and 10. minutes. The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the equinoctial that day, which subtracted or aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the whole quarter; that is, from 90. degrées, the eleuation of the pole which remaineth, is 51. degrées, and 50. minutes.</p>

Aboue this is the country named <hi>Iseland,</hi> by reason of the frozen waters and sea: where throughout the yeare it so bitterly fréezeth, that through the ycie seas there thicke frozen, it permitteth no ships to come vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except in the thrée hottest months of the yeare. It aboundeth with brimstone, and burneth in many places through the sulphure &amp; brimstone veines. <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, that the Occean sea in North is very large, which in these our dayes is well knowne. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was learned of certaine skillfull sailers (which inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and very much had traualed this coast) that they knew not the limits or bounds of this sea toward the North, but supposed that this sea did compasse the whole earth. By this sea dwell many and mighty people; as the <hi>Danes,</hi> the <hi>Swedens, Norwaies, Gotelandes, Finelands, Russians,</hi> and <hi>Pruchenians:</hi> and vnder the pole artick the <hi>Laplands.</hi> The reason why in these places such force of moysture aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4323:83"/>
is for that a dayly and continuall cold of these places gathereth and thickneth the ayre, and by a continual wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king resolueth into water. For when the ayre is not throughly purged by the suns beames, then the weaknes of them, and far distance of the sun from these places, must of necessity bee continually thicke and darke, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes yéeldeth and giueth plentifull floodes by deawes and raines. <hi>Albert mag.</hi> in his booke <hi>de natura loci,</hi> and 8. chapter, assigneth a witty and laudable reason, why the Northerly be inhabitable. The cause he setteth downe, in that sundry skillfull Mariners affirme (that haue many times sailed into the Northerly partes of the Ocean sea) that in those places is a continuall darknesse, which when men sawe they returned for feare, supposing (nay rather doubting) that none coulde saile any further in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the worlde, through the darknesse, and thicke mist, which hindreth the direction of their iourney. So that the nature of those places cannot bee sufficiently knowne to vs, séeing no man (as the learned report) hath attempted thither, through extremitie of colde their bearing sway. And for that excéeding cold is a mortifying quality, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man may coniecture, that few liuing creatures and beasts can there liue &amp;c. Yet the part of the Northerly Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean (vnto the Easterly side) is sufficiently knowne to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trauailers.</p>
               <p>Although the vttermost boundes of the earth are not wholy knowne, yet the nearest aprroaching to them shall here bee applied, as the longitude of the earth distaunt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene <hi>Peru</hi> (the Realme of <hi>America</hi>) and <hi>Cathaya,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse 315. degrées: or if any minde to accompt the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from the fortunate Iles, they may by a whole cyrcle containe them, euen as the whole Orbe about in a maner doth partly giue place to the water, and are partly dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for men, beasts, and other liuing creatures; although some places of the earth bee more inhabited then others.

               <p>If two places offered or giuen be placed vnder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatour, of which the space is sought, then the arke of the difference of latitude, is the same with the arke of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, neither doth the verticiall cyrcle differ from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatour.

               <p>If two places be giuen, the one standing vnder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatour, and the other distant toward any other quarter from it.

The difference of longitude greater then the quadrant, is of 97. degrées, and 20. minutes. The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant being abated, there remaineth 7. degrées, and 20. minutes. The complement of the latitude of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> is of 56. degrées, and 40. minutes. If of two places giuen, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther standeth without the Equatoure toward some one of the opposite quarters; and the other vnder the equatoure: then is the reason of the standing considered, and the angle of the difference of longitude. For the one differeth either by like spaces from each bound, and is nearer to the Pole, the other to the Equatoure. The same appeareth by the compared latitudes, which like toppes of either place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same Parallel, the vnlike being distant, and the Parallell by a space seperated, toward each place, doe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue peculiar and proper tops. But the angle of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of longitude, either it is right, blunt, or sharpe. This of the placing and diuersitie of the angles, doeth much varie or alter the reason &amp; methode of the searching of these.</p>
               <p>If two places giuen haue equall arks of the latitudes, and from the middle or halfe of the equatoure bee alike di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and how much so euer the angle of the difference of

As for example.</p>
               <p>The longitude of <hi>Danske</hi> is of 39. degrées, and twoe scruples or minutes: the latitude of the same hath 54, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, and 48. minutes. The longitude of <hi>Lubecke</hi> is of 28. degrées, and 20. scruples, the latitude hath 54. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, and 48. scruples. The difference of longitude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth, of 10. degrées, and 42. minutes. The halfe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, of 5. degrées, and 21. scruples. The distance on earth, betwéene <hi>Danske</hi> and <hi>Lubecke,</hi> is of 92 Germaine miles, and a halfe.</p>
               <p>The great citie <hi>Alexandria</hi> vnder the <hi>Turke</hi> (after <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomie</hi>) hath the longitude of 122. degrées, the latitude of the same, is of 41. degrées. That famous <hi>Toletum</hi> or <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> of Spaine, hath a longitude to the same, of 10. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, the latitude of the same is, of 41. degrees. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of longitude betwéene the one and the other, is of 102. degrées. The halfe difference, hath 51. degrées. The complement of the equall latitudes of either, is of 49. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées. The whole distance betwéen both appeareth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine 1077. Germaine miles and a halfe.</p>
               <p>If of two places giuen, the one bee further distant from the equatour then the other, and the greatnesse of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of either latitude differing (as that the arkes of the latitudes be vnequall) so that the diuersity of the angle included with the arks of the complements, shal varie the methode or reason of the search, for that the one giueth and formeth a right angle, another a sharpe, another a blunt angle: yet to these, the angle of the difference of longitude is right. The example of two places differing alike (both in the longitude and latitude) here appeareth. The citty <hi>Tacola</hi> (which at this day is called <hi>Malchaia</hi> or <hi>Magna</hi>) a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4323:85"/>
place of much resort of Marchants. This from the West hath the longitude of 160. degrées, and 30. minutes, of latitude from the equatour, it is 4. degrées, and 15. scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples distant. The other city and place in the countrey of <hi>Pontus</hi> (named <hi>Trapezus</hi>) being a head city of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and was the auncient seat of the Emperours. This hath the longitude of 70. degrées, and 30. minutes, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the same is of 43. degrées, and 5. scruples. The difference of longitude betwéene the one and the other, is of 90. degrées. The arke of distance betwéene both places is of 87. degrées, and 6. minutes: to which 1306. &amp; a halfe Germaine miles answere.</p>
               <p>If the vnequall arkes of the latitudes, and angle of the difference of longitude be lesser then the right, it canseth a diuers reason of the search, by which the arke of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the greater latitude doth varie thrée waies, as it is greater or lesser, and as with the arke by the second in quisition surely knowne, and beeing ioyned, forme either more or lesse a quarter of the cyrcle. Or thus, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle which the vnequall complements of the vnequall lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes include, be sharpe; that is, and if the arks of the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of either place be vnequall, and the difference of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude bee lesser then the quadrant. As in this example more plainer appeareth, of twoe places beeing of sundry longitudes. That worthie citty <hi>Trapezus</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> whose longitude is of 70. degrées, and 30. minutes, the latitude 43. degrées, and 5. minutes. The longitude of that well knowne city of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath 39. degrées, and 8. scruples, the latitude 41. degrées, and 8. minutes. The difference of longitude, betwéene the one and the other, is of 33. degrées, and 22. minutes. Another example not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the former, and not much varying from the former: as the longitude of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is of 66. degrées, and no minutes, the latitude, of 31. degrées, and 40. scruples. The longitude of <hi>Viteberge,</hi> being of 30. degrées, and 30.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4323:86"/>
minutes, the latitude 51. degrées, and 50. scruples. The difference betwéene the one and the other of longitude is of 35. degrées, and 50. scruples.</p>
               <p>If in places vnequally distant from the equatoure, the angle of the difference of longitude shalbe blunt, by which the difference of longitude shall appeare greater than the quadrant. Or thus, that the angle of the difference of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude be blunt, séeing the places are further distant then a whole quarter, and thereby causeth a diuers reason and way of serch from the former; which semblably the diuers quantity of the complement of the greater latitude doeth thrée manner of waies varie, as in the same arke (which perfectly knowne by the second) is either greater or lesser. The example of this appeareth of these two places: the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble city <hi>Antiochia</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> which was after caled <hi>Seleucia,</hi> hath the longitude of 106. degrées, and no minutes, the latitude is of 40. degrées, and 40. scruples, The other of <hi>Toletum,</hi> whose longitude is of 7. degrées, and 4. scruples, the latitude hath 37. degrées, and 50. minutes. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of longitude is of 98. degrées, and 56. scruples, which deducted from the halfe cyrcle (or 180. degrées) the difference that remaineth vnto the halfe cyrcle, is of 81. degrées, and 4. minutes. The like example not much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying from the former of these two places: as the noble ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Portugale</hi> named <hi>Lysebone,</hi> whose longitude is of 4. degrées, and 18. scruples, the latitude hath 39. degrées, and 38. scruples. The other named <hi>Calecute</hi> (although the latitude differeth) hath the longitude of 112. degrées, and no minutes, the latitude is of 5. degrées, and no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. The difference of longitude, containeth 107. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées. and 42. scruples more then the quadrant. The same deducted from the halfe cyrcle, doth expresse the difference remaining vnto the halfe cyrcle to bee of 72. degrées, and 18. minutes. The complement of the greater latitude, is of 50. degrées, and 22. scruples. The complement of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4323:86"/>
lesser latitude, is of 85. degrées, and no scruples.</p>

                  <hi>Ptholomie</hi> when he had learned the longitudes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of certaine notable places, he could extract and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by them the other vnknowne places, by the distances truly learned from trauailers. For by the longitudes and latitudes knowne of two cyrcles, and the distance also of them from any third place, there is then offered and giuen to know, as well the longitude, as the latitude of the third place. Further, in any two places lying and being in the vpper face of the earth, are fiue notes commonly learned. The distance of them, conuerted into degrées: the latitude of the one, and the latitude of the other: the difference of longitudes: the angle vnder the circumferencial distance: and the meridians contained by the other.

                  <p>That the studious and diligent practioners may east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perceiue and perfecter vnderstand these differences of the standing of places, let them often accustome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues therein, that when the longitudes and latitudes of sundry places be offered, they then consider whether they differ in the onely longitude, or latitude only, or in both, and what the latitude is of either, and into which parte from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatour: and besides that, they learne to expresse the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them by proper lines drawne, and the places no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>If the numbers of the latitudes be alike, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the longitudes be vnlike, then doe the places onely differ in the longitude. Therfore by two meridians found and defined, lying crosse to them in one Parallel, imagine and set the place of the greater longitude in the pointe of the crossing further off, that the other in the nearer may be placed vnto the West. For the place alwaies (whose longitude is lesser then the other) is nearer founde to the West, and the other is further distant into the East. The arke also of the Parallell included betwéene either meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, doth demonstrate the difference of longitude.</p>
                  <p>If the numbers of the longitudes shall be alike, and the numbers of the latitudes vnlike, then is the diuersity of the places in the onely latitude. Therefore two Parallels drawn crosse, of which the one being higher and the other lower and crossing them by one meridian, they doe set the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:4323:97"/>
place of the greater latitude in the vppermost point of the crossing, and the other in the lowest point.</p>
                  <p>If the latitudes be alike, as the one Southerly, and the other Northerly: then the middle arcke of the Merydian being betwéene, is equally crossed by the Parallels of the places drawne thwartly by the Arke of the Equatour, in such sort, that the Equatour is by an equall space distant from either.</p>
                  <p>If both the numbers of the longitudes and latitudes shall be vnequall, and either place distant into the North from the Equatour, therefore in both is there a diuersity. Therefore two Meridians being imagined, the one Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall <hi>dextre,</hi> and the other Occidentall <hi>synistre,</hi> and that by so marry Parallels drawne thwartly, which crosse the Meridians, the one Southerly, the other Northerly: and that the place whose greater longitude is touched in the lowest and furthest point, and the other to be noted right against; that is, in the vpper and neerest point. Or thus contrariwise: If one place shall exceed the other, both in longitude and latitude, and be further standing in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher pointe of the crossing, and thereby more farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and the other noted to stand right against, and the seates also of the places vnequally touch, which declareth and containeth the nighest distance of such places.

The halfe of the difference of the latitudes, is 3. degrées, &amp; 37. minutes, which halfe added to the lesser latitude; that is, to <hi>Verona,</hi> which is of 44. degrées, add 49. minutes, doeth then produce or bring forth 48. degrées, &amp; 26. minutes. This produce or increase

is named the middle latitude, in that it is distant by equal degrées and minutes from either latitude of <hi>Vuischegarda</hi> and <hi>Verona;</hi> that is, it excéedeth the latitude of <hi>Verona</hi> by 3. degrées, and 37. minutes, and <hi>Verona</hi> doeth excéede <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uischegarda</hi> by so many degrées, and minutes. With this product or middle latitude; that is, with 48. degrées, &amp; 26. minutes. I enter the former table, and according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction afore taught in the second rule, I finde in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell which is drawne by the middle latitude, to answer to one degrée right against 10.

It was also taught in the second rule, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> if minutes depended to the latitude, that those should be sought in the former table, and by the next eleuation folowing, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall part to be sought. As in this example. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 52. are 9. miles, and 14. scruples noted, and in that 3. degrées, and 37. scruples depende to a middle latitude, I séeke in the table how many miles and scruples are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted next to the latitude folowing, 55. and there I finde 8. miles, and 36. scruples. The difference betwéen the miles and scruples of the eleuations of 52. and 55. is 1. degrée, &amp; 22. minutes. By the proportion of this difference, is the proportionall part gathered and founde, according to the maner afore taught in the second rule.</p>
                  <p>Another example of this third rule for thy further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing of <hi>Viteberge</hi> and <hi>Lipsia,</hi> which differ in the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and latitude: for the longitude of <hi>Viteberge</hi> is of 30. degrées, and 30. minutes, the latitude hath 51. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and 50. minutes. The longitude of <hi>Lipsia</hi> is of 29. degrées, and 58. minutes, the latitude hath 51. degrées, and 24. minutes. The difference of the longitudes is of thirty twoe minutes, the difference of the latitudes is of twenty sixe minutes. The halfe of the difference of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes is of thirtéene minutes, which halfe added to the lesser latitude (as to <hi>Lipsia</hi>) which is of 51. degrées, and 24. minutes, doth produce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The product is caled the middle latitude, in that by equal minuts it is distant from either latitude of <hi>Viteberge</hi> and <hi>Lipsia;</hi> that is, it excéedeth the latitude of <hi>Lipsia,</hi> 13. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and by so many minuts is it excéeded of <hi>Viteberge.</hi> With this product or middle latitude; that is 51. degrées and 37. minutes, I enter the former Table, and by the Instruction afore vttered in the second rule, I find in the Parallel which is drawne by the middle latitude, that 9. miles, and 19. scruples doe answere there to one degrée. And in the second rule afore is taught, that if minutes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende to the latitude, which is sought in the former La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then by the next eleuation must the part proportional be sought. As in this example to the latitude, 51. degrées, are 9. miles and 26. scruples noted. And in that 37. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes depend to the middle latitude, I therefore séeke in the table how many miles and scruples are assigned to the latitude next following; that is, 52. degrées: right against which I finde noted 9. miles, and 14. scruples. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwéene the miles and scruples of the eleuations of 51. and 52. is of 12. minutes: so that by the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto the whole degrée, or 60. minutes, is the proportionall parte drawne or gathered, according to the manner afore taught in the second rule. As thus, that as 69. minutes yeelde 12, euen so doe 37. giue 7. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, which is the parte proportionall. The same mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes subtracted from the miles and scruples assigned to the latitude 51. that is, from the 9. miles, and 26. scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, there remaine 9. miles, and 19. scruples. And so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles and scruples in the Parallel of the middle lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude doth answere vnto one degree. Which being founde and knowne, these nine miles and the scruples, with the differences of longitude, which is of thirty two minutes, I then multiply, and they shew and bring forth 298. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes: which multiplied againe in it selfe, do bring forth the first quadrate to be 88804. minutes. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first

parte of the working of these. Nowe followeth the other part.</p>
                  <p>I multiply first the difference of latitude, as the 26. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes by 15. Germaine miles, and they bring forth 390. minutes, which multiplied againe in it selfe doe yéelde 151200. minutes, as the second quadrant is. Now these two numbers quadrate added, doe bring forth and make 240904. minutes, of which the quadrate or square roote is of 494. minutes of miles. These for that they are the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of miles, ought to be deuided by 60. and then they bring foorth 8. whole miles, and 14. scruples; that is, a fourth part almost of a Germaiue mile.

Wherfore in the third rule are not the miles answering to the degrées of the lesser eleuation taken, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the difference of the latitudes bee small: nor the miles taken, answering to the degrées of the greater eleuation: but the miles are taken answering to the degrées of the middle latitude: for that it lacketh in one part, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored in the other. Of the same may the distance in miles be sought, according to the longitude. After this, in that the space betwéene the Parallel <hi>A.

               <p>And in the same by that multiplication of the miles and degrées, the adding of the product, by the increase and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the root, that the distance of the Cities may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily and surely be gathered, is thus demonstrated. That in euery tryangle right cornered, the square which is made by the side, is drawne against a right angle, and is equall to the two squares which are made by the sides containing a right angle. As the quadrate which is made by the drawing of the line <hi>A. C.</hi> into it selfe, that is equall to the squares, which are caused by the drawing of the line <hi>A.

               <p>The description of the Horizont doth <hi>Macrobius</hi> teach; where he writeth, that the Horizont is after two condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the one, extendeth on euery side vnto the firmament and serueth peculiarly as it were for the deuision of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, in deuiding iustly the skie into two halues: of which the one appeareth in sight to vs aboue the proper Horizont and the other hid vnder that Horizont from vs. Which Horizont hath his name of the skie, and of the same called the celestiall Horizont: whose diameter (after <hi>Macrobius</hi>) is as large as the diameter of the eight sphere, which (as he affirmeth) is the furthest and highest parte of the skie, that men can readily sée and discerne with the eie. But the earthly Horizont, in that the same serueth for the sightes onely of the earth and water, and not stretching vnto the firmament; nor that his halfe diameter (as <hi>Macrobius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) doeth excéede 180. furlongs, which containeth 22.

In that it is the end or bound seperating the neather halfe Sphere from the vpper. And of him also called the edge of the halfe sphere.

               <p>4 The Horizone also is so defined of his office, in that his office is to deuide that part of the worlde in sight, from that hidde vnder the earth. Whereof it is not vnworthily
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:4323:106"/>
called the ender, séeing it permitteth nor suffereth any to sée but the halfe sphere at one time, and therefore is called of some, the cyrcle of the half sphere, as afore taught. This cyrcle is alwaies vnderstood to be described by the vertici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all point, in that as the verticall point is changed, euen so likewise is the Horizone.</p>
               <p>The Horizone is deuided after twoe sortes; first into a right and thwart: secondly, into a sensible and rationall Horizone.</p>
               <p>The Horizone of the right sphere is called right or right cornered, aboue which neither of the Poles of the worlde is eleuated, which they haue whose Zenith is vnder the Equinoctial, or dwell vnder the Equinoctiall. Their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizone is the cyrcle drawne by the Poles of the worlde, which deuideth aswell the meridian as the Equatoure at right angle, through which rightnesse it obtaineth that name, that it is called the right Horizone.</p>
               <p>The thwart Horizone as of the thwart Sphere, from whose plaine the Poles of the worlde be distant, the one is then raised aboue the Horizone, and the other depressed and hid vnder the Horizone. Or thus, the Horizone is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thwart or declined, when either of the Poles of the world is eleuated, which they haue which dwell without the Equinoctiall, whether they dwell Northerly or Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly. And their Horizone crosseth the Equinoctiall at vneuen and thwart angles. And attaineth also the name of a thwart Horizone, through the thwart angles, which it formeth or maketh with the Equatoure. There is also one right Horizone, as there is one simple &amp; right sphere, but the thwart Horizone is many waies changed toward the Poles of the worlde, through the standing and place chaunged on the earth. For the standing is so much the thwarter, as the sphere of the worlde is caused declining, &amp; by how much either of the poles of the world, is drawne and raised higher. So that to it (by the obseruers of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:4323:106"/>
stars) is the name giuen whereby it is called thwart. And note this that the zenith or point ouer the head, is alwaies the Pole of the Horizone: which Pole is here not taken for the celestiall point, vpon which the celestiall mouer or any other cyrcle is drawne, in that the Horizone is immouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as was afore taught: bu taken for the pointe raised, which is the Center of any fyrcle, as here by this figure

Of this deuision hath béen sufficiently intreated, in his proper place. This also is to be noted, that the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone is two waies changed and varied. First, that the Cities and other places are situated or standing either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the East, or toward the West, vnder one Parallell. The second, that the horizone is either varied toward the South or towarde the North, and are situated vnder one meridian, and diuers Parallels. These of themselues for the right vnderstanding the longitudes and latitudes of places, are manifest.</p>
               <p>Further that the eleuation of the Pole (that is the arke which is betwéene the Pole of the world and the horizon, is equall to the distance of the verticiall pointe or Zenith from the Equatour, shall appeare and bee made manifest

                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:4323:107"/>
in this maner. As first that <hi>EBVX.</hi> is the meridian cyrcle <hi>BAX.</hi> the Equatoure, <hi>NV.</hi> the thwart horizone, the Pole of the worlde raised aboue the horizone, <hi>E.</hi> the Zenith, <hi>A.</hi> the Center of the worlde, <hi>R.</hi> the Pole antarticke so much deprssed, the arke <hi>RNC.</hi> the eleuation of the Pole from the horizone <hi>NV.</hi> giuen, <hi>EX.</hi> the latitude of the region or place being the distance of the top pointe <hi>E.</hi> from the Equatour <hi>BX.</hi> And that this is equall to the arke <hi>NO.</hi> as to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Pole <hi>C.</hi> from the horixon <hi>NV.</hi> giuen, which shall be demonstrated in this manner. That <hi>C.</hi> the Pole of the world, is distant from the equatour; <hi>BX.</hi> by a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the meridian, and the like the verticall pointe <hi>E,</hi> is distant from <hi>NV.</hi> the horizon, by a quarter. But the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the equall cyrcles are alike equall, for <hi>XC.</hi> and <hi>NE</hi> be the quarters of the equal cyrcles: therefore in that they be alike equall, is <hi>CE.</hi> the common arke. If now by the common conceiuing and imagination of mind, that from the equals they bee equall, &amp;c. then from either quarters <hi>XC.</hi> and <hi>NE.</hi> the common Arcke <hi>CE.</hi> is to be deducted, &amp; the remainer shall bee equall; that is, <hi>XE.</hi> which to that <hi>NC.</hi> ought to bee. And séeing the latitude of a place is no other, as by the former words appeareth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the distance of his Zenith from the equatoure, that readily hauing the eleuation of the Pole, the latitude or distance of the place from the Equatour shall soone be attained. By which the eleuation of the Equatoure aboue the Horizone in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian cyrcle, as the arke <hi>VX.</hi> is, sheweth no other then the complement of the latitude or eleuation of the pole is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily atained, if you deduct that complement out of 90. deg.</p>
               <p>The sensible Horizone is a space of the earth defined by a compasse rounde about, which the sight of the eie attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and comprehendeth in a plaine and euen field.

cause, that which is contained by sight, is by a certaine si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude agreeing with the artificiall day. And as the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall day is so named, for that artificers doe especially worke in it, euen so the like is the horizone named artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in that towers, foretresses, and castles in time past, were built like the horizone.</p>
               <p>The diameter of this horizone (after <hi>Macrobius</hi>) which nearer agréeth to a truth (then either <hi>Proclus</hi> or <hi>Albertus</hi>) as afore was taught, is of 36. furlongs, to which almost foure Germaine miles answere, and 22. English miles: and so far on a plain and euen ground not hindred by hils or thicke mists, may a man fully sée. And in the same space the imbossed rounds of the earth, being without hils, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and groweth to 250. féele, or 125. cubits: so that this horizone is not sodainly changed, nor in a short space. Therefore of necessity must ensue, that those which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunt by a lesser space then 360. furlongs, to sée alwaies some part of the earth common to both. But those which are distant by many spaces, doe comprehend diuers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes by sight of the eie and diuers horizones.</p>
               <p>The rationall horizone is that which afore was descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, that the same is a greater cyrcle, lying by the edge of the earth, and reaching round about vnto the skie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the celestiall Orbs into two equall halfe Spheres, as the one halfe in sight, and the other hid to vs. Although the plain vpper face of the horizone passeth not by the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth, yet by the edge of the same, through which we sée and obserue the celestiall bodies, that rise aboue and set vnder it: so that they euidently shew, that the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth heauen into two equall halfe spheres, as aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.

This besides is called the artificiall horizone, in that by the benefite of the astronomicall art, it was inuented.</p>
               <p>Or thus not much agréeing to the former, the rationall horizone (which of some is named natural) and according to the mind of <hi>Ptholomie, Cleomedes,</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto the Sphere of the fixed stars, and reacheth euen vnto the same Sphere, and deuideth heauen into equall halfe Spheres, the one halfe appearing aboue the same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the other halfe not appearing, hid vnder it. Such a maner of imagining is not in vaine, nor without cause determined and deuised, séeing that men in the night and in a cleare season, standing on an euen grounde, may sée stars arise vnto sight in the East, which a litle before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not to the sight: and those after drawne by the first moouer vnto the West horizone, that began to go downe be set, and doe not after appeare. By which they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that there is a cyrcle in heauen, deuiding and ending matters in sight from those not séen. So that they nothing doubted to call this cyrcle the rationall horizon (which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with the vpper face by the center of the earth stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched round about vnto heauen) and by the foure quarters of the world, as East, West, North, and South, deuided things séene, from those not séene. And a great helpe it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto this imagination that the earth is perfect round and imbossed, in that of a Globe through his imbossing can be séene but the halfe at a time.</p>
               <p>This also yéeldeth a helpe to reason, by the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the celestiall bodies, although our sight cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the starrie sky, nor fully descerne heauen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man earnestly looke vp and behold it: yet doe we sée stars, whose light extend vnto our eie.

Of which reason it is concluded, that a certaine cyrcle deuideth heauen into twoe equall halues, and do part (as afore taught) the things séene, from those not séene. Although the tariance be but small, in that this star appeareth a very smal while aboue the earth, through the same, that this star of <hi>Aquarius</hi> is Southerly from the ecclipticke line, it greatly forceth not. The like examples may be applied of the superiour planets, when they be situ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ated or appeare opposite in heauen, as they also may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently seen, in the opposition of the sun and moone, when they bee séene neare to the East and West horizone, and where the moone is neare the suns way.</p>

               <p>And if the places bee either situated partly toward the East or West, and partly toward the South or North, the horizones there decline and varie them partly toward the East or West, and partly toward the south or North: which hapneth, by reason that the City is not vnder one Parallell.</p>
               <p>And Cities or countries situated vnder one meridiane doe vary their horizons directly; either toward the South or North.</p>
               <p>There be as many horizons, as there be meridia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And for so much as that of all places cannot bee one manner of Zenith, therefore cannot one Meridiane serue for all places. And séeing the Pole of the Horizone is the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of it, which is in the Meridiane, and that to each place belongeth a proper Zenith, and a proper Meridian, it followeth that to each place belongeth a proper Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone.</p>
               <p>Toward the Poles by the chaunging of places are the horizons chaunged, and the diuers eleuations of the Pole by a certaine occasion caused: also they euidently declare a like alteration to bee caused in the respect of the opposite quarters of the East and West, and doe procure and cause diuers beginnings of the daies and nights, insomuch that the starres generally appearing and seene, doe by order of times and in sundry places, arise and set in the West and hide them vnder the Horizon. For the same maner of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse, which is seene at <hi>Arbela</hi> (after <hi>Plinie</hi>) in the fifte houre of the night, to them of <hi>Carthage</hi> it appeareth in the second houre: so that the sun sooner setteth to them of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bela</hi> by thrée houres, then to them of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Therefore

               <p>The same rationall horizon (as it were on the plainesse of the earth) drawne and streached vnto the sky, doeth the meridian extend to it downward, and deuide the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to twoe halfe cyrcles: of which the one declineth vnto the East, and therof called the East quarter, and the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the West, and of that named the West quarter.</p>
               <p>And the diuers places of the suns rising and setting, doe sundry wise deuide either halfe cyrcle. For the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all rising, and the Equinoctiall setting, (which are points of the horizon, that the sun in the equatoure placed, by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and setting passeth) doe parte and deuide either halfe cyrcle into equall quarters. And with these points do the Poles of the meridian ioyne.</p>
               <p>And either quarters do the other two (as the rising and setting) deuide into two vnequall arks. For of the twoe Northerly quarters, the same which tendeth and looketh vnto the East, is the solsticial rising, and the other the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiall setting. But of the twoe Southerly, the Easterly doth the winter rising deuide, and the Westerly doeth the winter setting part. But by what space these risings and settings may differ and be distant from the former middle in euery horizon, and in the largenesse of rising doth <hi>Ptho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomie</hi> instruct in that eleuation of 40. degrées, and fiftéene scruples.</p>
               <p>Of the shadowes which the sun arising and setting in these points of the horizon causeth, is worthie to bee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and noted, in that the Equinoctial shadowes (which through the sunnes rising and setting in the Equinoctiall pointes are caused) doe fall and extend in straight maner. But the other shadowes not in the same condicion or not in straight line doe fall, but that the solsticiall shadowes in the rising, with the winter shadowes in the setting, and contrariwise the winter shadowes in the rising, with the

First you shall vnderstande, that the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure onely, which (as afore taught) the sunne beeing either in the beginning of <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Libra,</hi> is regularly moued, aswel in the right, as thwart Horizone; and thereof is alwaies the one halfe aboue the horizon, &amp; the other halfe hid vnder the Horizon.

And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, that there are twelue greater cyrcles vnderstoode, which crosse the Equatoure at right angles, and passe by both the poles of the first mouer, from which the said equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, is distinguished into 24. equall parts, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

And that these may clearer and perfecter be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, imagine your selfe to bée vnder the equatoure; that is, in the right Sphere: in such a standing shall the halfe meridian Cyrcle bee the line of the twelfe houre, and the halfe horizontal circle, the line of the sixt houre before noon: and the other halfe of it, the line of the sixt houre at after noone. By which imagination firmely conceiued, may a man imagine betwéen the halfe horizontall cyrcle, and the halfe meridian cyrcle, to be other fiue halfe cyrcles firme and immoueable, which are not mooued but as the verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call point is moued, being distant each from other by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall distance, as by 15. degrées of the equatour. The first after the horizon, is applied to the seuenth houre, &amp; so forth of the rest. And in like maner betwéen the meridian halfe cyrcle, and the occidentall horizone are other fiue cyrcles vnderstoode (according to the fourmer deuision) and that which followeth the meridian, shall be applied to the first houre, that which next foloweth to the second houre, and so forth of the others. Besides, imagine the sun to ascend from the horizon, and when he shall be come vnto the first halfe cyrcle from the horizon, then shall he shed a shadowe furthest westward, and being drawne vp vnto the second, shal make a shorter shadow, and the shadow shal alwaies (vntill the sun bee come vnto the halfe noonestéede cyrcle, where he sheddeth or sendeth a shadow) plum down right to the earth: but descending from the Noonstéede vnto the West, the Sunne causeth then the like shadowes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>

plainly all the former. So that the pole articke with the rest of the cyrcles must be raised aboue the horizon, and the halfe cyrcles of either sixt houre, seuered or deuided from the horizon. Of this ensueth, that the equatoure leaueth the verticall point, and howe much the Northerly pole is raised aboue the horizon, somuch doth the equatour depart from the verticall pointe (as afore in the proper place is aptly demonstrated) &amp; howe much one quarter of the halfe cyrcle of the sixt houre is raised togither with the Pols, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much the other quarter with the opposite pole is depressed and standeth vnder the horizon. Of this procéedeth, that they crosse one the other in the East parte, and that in one and the same point, the Equinoctiall, the horizontall cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the halfe Cyrcle of the sixt houre of the morning. These throughly learned and vnderstoode, and the sphere applied to the materiall with any houre cyrcle, by which the harder or more curious matters are made manifest and plaine; you shall then readily sée, that the sun whiles hee runneth in the Northerly signes, doeth sooner come in the morning vnto the horizontal circle, then vnto the halfe cyrcle of the sixt houre in the morning: but the sun running in Southerly signes, he then causeth the contrary; that is, he attaineth or commeth sooner vnto the halfe cyrcle of the sixt houre of the morning, than vnto the horizon. And of this ensueth, that the nights here are longer, but the daies there bee the longer. The arke furthermore contained in the Parallell cyrcle to the Equatoure, and passing by the suns place (betwéen the horizon and the halfe cyrcle of the sixt houre) is the difference betwéene the equinoctiall day, and purposed day, whatsoeuer or how much the same be, which is worthily to be noted. Besides these, it greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth to vnderstand in these thrée cyrcles, the equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the horizon, and verticall cyrcle, that the vpper faces ending at those cyrcles, the equinoctiall truely by the same receiueth and causeth a deuision that the vpper face also is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:4323:115"/>
supplied and placed vnder, and receiueth and maketh the like; that is, equall. But the vpper face which is placed and standing vnder the horizone, doeth receiue and make an vnequall deuision, euen the same that the horizone is, which of the houre cyrcles is vnequally deuided. And the like also may be gathered and iudged of the deuision of the vpper face of the verticiall cyrcle, which (euen as his cyrcle) is vnequally deuided.

are sixe cyrcles that are imagined of the astronomers, by which heauen is deuided into twelue parts; among which are the Horizone and meridian, whereby the whole is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into foure equall parts: and those twelue parts, are (of the astronomers) called mansions or houses. But as touching the constitution and forming of the celestial hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, there are sundry old and late opinions, but whether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is the worthier, or to be the rather allowed, is not here mente to bee stoode vpon, nor aptely belongeth to the matter I entreat of, so well as in the proper place is agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: yet certaine, and especially the auncient, which were <hi>Campanus,</hi> a singular mathematician and astronmer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the houses by the fiue cyrcles of heauen, méeting an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ioyning at the Poles of the world; from which they deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole heauen (togither with the meridiane) into twelue equal houses. But for a better and readier instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they formed and drewe them in this maner. After the foure principall quarters or angles of heauen were drawne, and that the right ascention of the middle of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen was had, then were the partes of the Zodiacke dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently considered (that occupy as well the Easterly as the Westerly Horizone) and then were the right ascentions sought of those partes: which being done, the constitution and making of the two houses in the Easterly part of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, was the right ascention of the mid heauen, deducted from the right ascention of the Horizone: and the remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was distributed into thrée equall parts. In the bound of the first part (in accompting from the Noonstéed toward the East) was there imagined a cyrcle for the beginning of the eleuenth house: but in the bound of the second parte (from the Noonestéede) was the beginning of the twelfe house placed. After in the bounde of the third parte, from the Noonstéed, was the beginning of the first house drawn: and the like was wrought and done in searching for the 2.

they deducted and subtracted the right ascention of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> west part, from the right ascention of the mid heauen or noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead, and the remainer or rest (as afore taught) was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed into thrée equall parts. After that in the ende of the first portion (from the noonstead towardes the West) the auncients constituted or placed the bound of the ninth house, with the circle comming from the poles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: and in the bound of the second portion, was the beginning of the eight house formed. These attained, the degrées and partes of the degrées of the Zodiack answering to ech arkes of the Equatoure, were sought in the Tables of the right sphere: but the houses standing vnder, were defined and made like to their opposites.

               <p>It is manifest by that afore taught, that the sun in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day doth gaine toward the East (against the dayly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) one degrée of the Zodiack: and of this hapneth, that he in each day through the thwartnesse of the Zodiack de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth a certaine newe cyrcle in heauen, and in the nexte day another, and so forth by order, as the like may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by a small corde, winded close about a Nun or top, beginning from the foote vpward, euen so the sun begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to turne againe at the first degrée of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> doth

And each of these Parallelles (euen as the greater cyrcles) containe 360. degrées, which bée so much lesser, then the degrées of the greater cyrcles, and occupy or comprehend somuch the lesser space in heauen, as answereth to the vpper face of the earth, as by how much the more fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the compasse and largenesse of the greatest cyrcle they lacke, by reason of the distance.

               <p>These lesser cyrcles, do offer and teach sundry vtilities.

               <p>In the second, the Parallels (which the verticial points forme) when they expresse the boundes of the latitudes of places, then are they standing vnder, by which their lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudes or distances from the West are accompted.</p>
               <p>In the third, the Parallels (which either the Planets or the fixed stars describe) referred vnto the Equatour, do expresse the boundes of their drawings or motions from the equatour.

and that for how long time they tarry aboue the earth, or otherwise hid within the earth, and vnder the Horizone, doth either shew.</p>
               <p>In the fourth, the greatest and chiefest vtilities of the Parallels are, that which on the habitable earth the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisioners seuer by such distances, as by how much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test artificiall daies are by a quarter of an houre longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased and extended.

For the longest day increaseth from minute to minute, from houre to houre, and from the latitude of one degrée, vnto the latitude of 66. degrées, and 30. minutes. In which the day artificial is of 24. houres, and is thereof called a whole day. For in the latitudes following, and beyonde, hee increaseth into many whole daies.</p>
               <p>A like definition hath <hi>Proelus,</hi> where hee writeth that the summer Tropicke, is the furthest cyrcle Northwarde that the sun describeth: into which when the sun is come, he then maketh his summer turne, and causeth also at that time the longest day and shortest night of the yeare: from which turning backe, he goeth againe toward the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coast of the world: so that of the same <hi>Proclus</hi> it is called a Tropicke (which is in English) a returning cyrcle. For it is euident to all men, that after the sunne beginneth to turne, he may in short time after, or at the least within 5. dayes, but especially at Noone in euery wéeke, be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to discend and go lower and lower, vntil he become vnto the Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne</hi> or the winter cyrcle: where he turneth againe, as you may plainly learne and vnderstand by the former description of that cyrcle.</p>
               <p>The Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne</hi> is a lesser cyrcle, and one of the naturall cyrcles, which is by the like space distaunt from the Equatoure into the South, and described of the sun in the beginning of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> as being vttermost to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the South (which is the bound of the suns greatest

This cyrcle also is called the winter Solstice, and winter Tropicke; in that when the sun co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into this cyrcle, it is presently win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: that is, the shortest day of the yeare.

From which he goeth

no further toward the South, but returneth vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary quarter of the world: and hereof this Circle is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Tropicke, or circle of returne. Now these thrée are principally noted: the equatour, and the two Tropickes, for the course of the sunne.

Of which in the same day, the sun describeth <hi>g f.</hi> the parallell to the equatour, which is called the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer,</hi> in that the sun beginneth from this place to approach or draw nearer to the Equatoure; vnto which when the sun shall come, hee then descendeth vnto the neather halfe sphere, in the halfe cyrcle <hi>d c.</hi> Hee being come againe vnto the point <hi>c,</hi> doth from his center by the motion of the principall or first mouer in the Poles of the world, describe the Parallell <hi>c i.</hi> that is, the tropicke of <hi>Capricorne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Polare cyrcles, are two of the lesser cyrcles neare to the Poles of the world, being alike equall distant to the equatour which vpon the Poles of the equatour described are drawne by the Poles of the Zodiacke. And these are named the Polare Cyrcles, in that they bee neare to the Poles: of which, that neare to the Pole articke, is called the arcticke cyrcle, of the greater or lesser Beare drawne
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:4323:123"/>
in it, or for that this cyrcle is described about the pole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke: the other that is right against<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is named the antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke Cyrcle, in that it is drawne aboute the Antarticke Pole.</p>
               <p>Or thus, the arcticke is a lesser cyrcle, which the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly pole of the Zodiacke is so far distant from the Pole articke of the world, as is the suns greatest declination: or as <hi>Proclus</hi> writeth, that the fore foote of the greater Beare by the dayly motion formeth. The same cyrcle (after the minde of the learned) is distant from the equatour 66. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, and 30. minutes almost. To whome this altitude is higher by 23. degrées, and almost 29. minutes. To those parts of the earth is the pole arcticke extaunt in sight, and continually appeareth. It also secludeth and parteth the vntemperate Northerly Zone, from the next temperate Zone: where the Solsticiall Tropicke is made the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly cyrcle, and in that place vnder this altitude of the pole 66. degrées, and 31. minutes: there all the stars and images contained from the solsticiall Tropicke vnto the Pole are seene: as both the Beares, the Dragon, <hi>Cephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Cassiopia, Perseus, Auriga</hi> or the <hi>Carter,</hi> whole Bootes (except from the knées downeward) the crowne <hi>Hercules</hi> (except the head and right arme) the <hi>Harpe,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> the great <hi>Horse Andromeda</hi> (except the left <hi>Cubit</hi>) the halfe of the Northerly <hi>Fish</hi> almost, <hi>Deltoton,</hi> a part of the backe of <hi>Taurus,</hi> the necke and Northerly <hi>Horne,</hi> a great parte of <hi>Gemini,</hi> and the head and necke of <hi>Leo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not vnlike to the former, doth <hi>Proclus</hi> describe them: where hee writeth, that the Northerly cyrcle is the same, which of al those that to vs continually be séen or appeare, is for trueth the greatest; and that also toucheth the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone at one onely point, being wholy described aboue the earth. And the stars that are inclosed within this cyrcle, do neither rise nor set, but are continually séen all the night drawn about the Pole.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:4323:123"/>The South or antarticke cyrcle, is thus defined of him, that the same is equal and equidistant to the Northerly or articke cyrcle, and toucheth the Horizon at one point. The whole of this cyrcle is hidden vnder our Horizone, so that all the stars placed and drawn in it, abide euer out of sight to vs.</p>
               <p>The like description that the antarticke Parallel is a lesser Cyrcle, which the Southerly Pole of the Zodiacke draweth about as it were by the dayly motion, doeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe about the Southerly toppe of the world, and is by a like space distaunt from the Equatoure and the antarticke pole of the world, as the articke is from his opposite. And doth seperate or deuide the vntemperate Southerly Zone from the next temperate Zone.</p>
               <p>Further it is manifest, that the distance of the Poles of the ecclipticke from the poles of the world, doe agrée with the greatest bowing or declination of the ecclipticke or the sun: In that the poles from their cyrcles, bee alwaies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant a quarter of the cyrcle, and the colure of the solstices, is here taken for that which comprehendeth either Pole. And when the quarters standing betwéene the poles, and the cyrcles of the poles, be in themselues, or betwéene one the other equall, as the arke of the same cyrcle, then the middle arke common to both, which (as exempted) goeth betwéene the poles of the world and the ecclipticke, and so parteth and leaueth them equall. For the one halfe of the other equall arks, is from the poles of the ecclipticke vnto the poles of the world, and the other, is from the furthest point of the ecclipticke vnto the equatour. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that so much is the distance of the poles of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipticke from the poles of the worlde, as is the suns grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test declination, being 23. degrées, and 28. minutes, and two fiftes almost. Or thus, that the pole of the Zodiacke is far distant from the pole of the world, as is the greatest declination af the sun from the Equinoctiall cyrcle: and by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4323:124"/>
the equidistance also on each side of the arctick cyrcle from the Pole of the world, that that part of the Colure compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended betwéene the first point of <hi>Cancer</hi> and the articke cyrcle, is almost double so much vnto the greatest declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sun.</p>
               <p>And if cyrcumspectly you consider the maner of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you shall readily perceiue that those cyrcles which euer more be of like largenesse, increase and decrease togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the twoe Tropicke cyrcles, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease or decrease of the suns declination. As appeareth by the letter <hi>n.</hi> in the foresaid figure, that representeth the Northerly pole of the ecclipticke or Zodiack, moued from the letter <hi>n.</hi> into <hi>o.</hi> by the motion of the first moouer, and returning againe into the point <hi>n,</hi> shall be moued the cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle describing <hi>n o.</hi> being distant from the Northerly pole <hi>a.</hi> asmuch as is the suns greatest declination <hi>h g.</hi> as hereafter by demonstration shall plainer appeare. And this cyrcle named the arcticke, in that it is described by the arcticke of the Zodiacke. The like is described from the point <hi>r.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pole antarcticke, by the motion from <hi>r.</hi> vnto <hi>s.</hi> and returning againe vnto <hi>r.</hi> so that the antarcticke cyrcle <hi>r s.</hi> is equall to his opposite, and equidistaunt to the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure.</p>
               <p>This probation, that the distaunce of the Poles of the worlde and Zodiacke, is equall to the suns greatest decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, doth require before hand, these thrée propositions. The first that the quarters of each cyrcle any where taken be in themselues or betwéene one another equall. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that the poles by a quarter; that is, by 90. degrées, be distant from their proper cyrcle. The third, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals deducted from their equalles, then doe the equalles rest.</p>
               <p>As for example, if you borowe two fourthes in one and the same Colure cyrcle, that is the Solsticiall of the same parte, where it passeth by the beginning of <hi>Capricorne,</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:4323:124"/>
and is the like from the pole of the worlde vnto the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, and that other, is that which is from the Pole of the Zodiack vnto the Zodiacke or ecclipticke: and of this I thus reason, that when the equals be deducted or abated from the equals, the remainer shall be equall. Therefore are the foresaid quarters equal, in that they be in the same cyrcle, and that from either is the equall or common arke deducted; that is, the same which is contained betweene the Equinoctiall and the pole of the Zodiacke, which arke doeth containe 66. degrées, and 31. minutes almost. So that the arks, resting or remaining of these quarters be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall; that is, the distance of the poles of the Zodiack, and the Equinoctiall, is equal to the suns greatest declination. For if 66. degrées, and 31. minutes bee deducted from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarter, the remainer then shalbe 23 degrées, and 31 minutes: which is the distance betwéen the foresaid poles and the greatest declination of the sun.</p>
               <p>This other example demonstrateth, that the suns grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test declination and the distance of the poles of the zodiack or ecclipticke from the poles of the world, is equall and of like largenes, and that what soeuer hapneth to the distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the said Poles. For as this increaseth or decreaseth, the like doth that decrease or increase. Of this it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that the two foresaide articke cyrcles, is nowe in our time lesser through the decreasing of the suns greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and that the Tropickes are greater then they were in <hi>Ptholomies</hi> time.</p>
               <p>The example here followeth, where <hi>i f.</hi> representeth the Exe trée of the world, <hi>e a k.</hi> the Exe-trée of the Zodiacke, <hi>c l m n.</hi> the Meridian or Colure of the Solsticis, <hi>c m.</hi> the Equatour, <hi>b l.</hi> the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer, d n.</hi> the Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne, I.</hi> the Pole articke, <hi>F.</hi> the Antarticke and opposite pole to it, <hi>k.</hi> the pole of the Zodiacke, and <hi>e.</hi> his opposite, <hi>b c.</hi> the greatest declination of the Sunne, which in our time the practisioners haue founde to be of 23. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées,

                  <figure/>
28. minutes, and 30. seconds: which in <hi>Ptholomies</hi> time was of 23. degrées, 51. minutes, and 20. secondes. The letters <hi>e g.</hi> and <hi>h k.</hi> be the two articke cyrcles. The arke <hi>b c.</hi> is equall to the arke <hi>i k.</hi> in such wise, that it may plainly appeare that <hi>b h k.</hi> and <hi>c i k.</hi> be the two quarters of one and the same cyrcle, <hi>f c k m.</hi> All the quarters of the cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle bee a like equall one to the other, <hi>c b i.</hi> and <hi>b i k.</hi> bee the two quarters, in one and the same solsticial Colure cyrcle. So that <hi>c b i.</hi> is equal to that <hi>b i k.</hi> and the ark <hi>b i.</hi> is to both the quarters equall or common. If then the equalles bee from the equals deducted, the remainer shall be equall, as aboue taught. For from the saide equall quarters, <hi>c b i.</hi> &amp; <hi>b i k.</hi> deduct the equall, that is <hi>b h i.</hi> or the common. And the remaining arks, of the said equall quarters, shall be in themselues equall, that is, <hi>c b.</hi> shall bee equall to the arke

               <p>Wherefore a zone (after the minde of the Gréekes) is a portion, tract, or space of heauen, or earth, betwéene the two Parallels or lesser cyrcles, being nighest equidistant, or contained betwéene the roome equidistaunt and Pole of the world, and gyrdeth or compasseth as it were the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or earth.

               <p>The zones haue sundry names, for of the Gréekes they be called <hi>zóne,</hi> and of the Latines by a borowed word <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> as may appeare by <hi>Iulius Firmicus, Macrobius, Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Ouide,</hi> and other Latines.

               <p>And how many zones they bee, may easily appeare, in that the astrologians, Geographers, Phisitions and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, do deuide as well the heauen as earth into siue roomes or spaces, by the foure Parallels or lesser cyrcles: of which there bee two maner of zones: the celestiall and the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>The celestiall, are the cause of the earthly, in that the earthly lie directly vnder them. And of the zones, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall bee they which the astronomers by imagination de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and distribute in the hollow of heauen: the earthly, be they which lie perpendicularly vnder. And both also be temperate, and vntemperate zones.</p>
               <p>The celestiall zones, in that they haue nothing of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary qualities, therefore doe they not by heat burne and scorch, nor by cold make stiffe: nor cause a temperate mixture of qualities or temperatnesse, yet are they noted and descerned by the names of the qualities; as the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zones, which being the author of the sun, and fountaine both of light and heate, and running continually in the middle zone of heauen is diuersly felt, according to the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of the distance.</p>
               <p>Or thus, there are no qualities formally attributed to the celestiall zones, but to them onely vertually, which is on this wise to be vnderstoode, as that the celestiall zones of themselues be neither cold, hot, nor temperate, but are so called through the suns declination from the equatour, as well into the North, as into the South quarter of the world: In the which declination, is the like matter felte, as well in the suns right sending downe of beames, as in the thwart proiection of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the vpper face of the earth, which diuersly changeth the heat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But of later yeares it is found contrary, in that at <hi>Molucca, Good-hope, Calicute,</hi> and <hi>Samatra,</hi> rich drugges, and other fine spices haue beene there gotten by the Spantards and Portingals, and yéer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haunted by them, as at this day the same is throughly known to many: which also confesse that the places vnder the Equinoctiall, and the rich City <hi>Calecute,</hi> being by the sea coast of <hi>Inde,</hi> standing betwéene the equatour and our Tropicke of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and vnto the other Tropicke South vnder the Burning zone, that the places is habitable and peopled, although very cumbersome with extremity of heat. Also that space on earth containeth 685. Germaine miles, or 23500. furlongs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ptholomie</hi> and <hi>Auicen</hi> affirme, that the places betwéen the equatour and summer Tropicke is habitable, and that many Cities bee there, although the sunne in those places through his direct beames (and especially vnder the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour) doth by the ouer much heat and continual heat, burn and mightily scorch. The like doe sundry others affirme, which write, that those places is conuenient for the life of creatures, in that vnder the equatour there bee many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:4323:128"/>
which although resolued and run through the heate, yet doe they breath and send vpward colde vapors, which the sun continually maintaineth in drawing vp through his vehement heat, and sending down mighty showers of raine: which vapors in the night (through the suns fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest distance vnder the earth, and especially at midnight) cause a mighty cold and chilling ayre: which the sun after his rising, vntill he be somewhat ascended aboue the earth cannot sodainly ouercome and put away that cold impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the ayre. So that the people there inhabiting, bee monstrous of forme, and haue rude wits, wondrous wild and terible conditions, like to wilde and furious beasts.</p>
               <p>The countries which lie vnder the Southerly Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels, as those which are described by the Equinoctiall line, vnto the summer Tropicke, where the sun is drawne and runneth ouer the tops of them: there through the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of vapors, rayne, and night colde, is the suns heate repressed, mitigated, and dulled; so that the heades of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> or <hi>Moores</hi> be litle, hauing but litle and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red braines, their bodies short, hauing thicke crisped haire on their heades, grosse and dull of senses, blacke scorched or burned bodies, withred or wrinckled faces, crooked of stature, being in a maner hot by nature, and cruell condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, through the mightinesse of heat in those places. And the constitution also of the ayre is there such, that al liuing and cresent things on that earth, are found and known to agrée with them. Further it is to be noted and vnderstood, that any there trauailing from the Northerly places, the further they goe towarde the South, somuch the stronger heat or burning they shalbe annoyed with.</p>
               <p>The two temperate zones be next adioining to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning zone, the one on the Northerly, and the other on the Southerly side of it. And the beginnings of either bee the hotter, the ends colder, the middle of them exquisitly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate: in the other parts doth the heat either so much the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:4323:128"/>
more excéede, or the bitter colde ouercommeth and ruleth, as howe much the nearer they approach or come vnto the burning Zone, or otherwise vnto either of the extreame Zones, which continually cause a bitter and an extreame colde.</p>
               <p>The cause of this diuersity, is through the suns beames, for the sun continually moouing in the middle iourney of heauen (described betwéene the two Tropicks) and digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or going beyond the prefixed bounds of nature, doeth not shew his beames vnto diuers parts of the earth in one manner, but vnto the places right vnder, and in the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning zone the tractes or countries contained vnder them, doth he send downe right beames, which stretcheth to the vpper face of the earth at right angles. And vnto the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of either temperate zone, doeth the sun send downe thwart or slope beames. And vnto the places vnder either cold zone, doth he streach long beames on the plaine of the earth, euen the like as being neare to the Horizone, which neither reach vnto the vpper face of the earth, nor cause angles, but kéep an equall distance vnto it, do streach forth infinitely.</p>
               <p>But those beames of the sun doe neither giue light, nor heat, but turne backeward: in that the property of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion which of the beame against a solider resistance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting or letting the penetration, is a certaine repercus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and reuerberation) that increaseth and doubleth the force of the direct beame, and by the reflexed beame to it adioyned, or at the least by his vertue applied and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
               <p>Séeing this reflexion is the especiallest cause of the heat and that the angles of the reflexions falling doe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally make or be equal in the angles: for that cause do they much vnlike increase the force of the directe beames, and their effectes doe notably varie. So that in the burning zone, the reflexion stretcheth vnto right angles, séeing the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:4323:129"/>
straight or right beames are caried &amp; led into themselues, in such sort that as direct and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lexen, they méete and bee mixed, and in this, doubling as it were the vertue and force of the direct beames, is on such wise increased, that it kindleth, burneth, and consumeth.</p>
               <p>And in either temperate zone, is the reflexion caused at right angles in that the sun beames doe thwartly reach to the vpper face of the earth, and are turned and extended backward vnto thwart angles, which how much the née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and liker they bee to the right, so much the nearer doe they ioyne either beames togither: by which they procéed and come into the nearer parts of the burning zone. But so much the blunter as they streach, so much the longer do they seperate either beames, as howe much the more they are extended vnto the extreame or outmost bounds. And for this cause doe they more heat then the fore parts of the temperate zone, whose heate is a litle gentler or milder then the heate of the burning zone, and the beames a litle further of: whose colde notwithstanding differeth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from the extreame or outmost vntemperate zones.</p>
               <p>And those which streach and fall into the middle region of either temperate zone, doe cause a meane betwéene the right and very sharp angles, and yet not directly matched or ioyned, nor doe they by so neare a space communicate their vertue, as in the beginning of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither by so large a distance as in the end, but in the middle in a maner: So that they cause and increase a temperate heate in the same zone.</p>
               <p>But in the extreame or colde Zones, is no reflexion of beames caused, for those beames equally distant from the earth are streached forth infinitely: and for that cause doe those neither giue light nor moue or procure heat, neither doe those zones at any time warme, either perfectly cleare, or appeare bright: but that they continually be foggy, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, darke, and bitter or extreame cold, through the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4323:129"/>
mists, which more and more increase, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the northerly pole. And yet many affirme, a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dwelling in those places, yea and vnder the Northerly pole, but far colder and bitterer dwelling, through the far being from the way of the sun, and beholding of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortabler starres. For the Sunne through his ouer far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, cannot by his presence aboue the earth comfort and heate.</p>
               <p>This now is the perfect cause of the diuers and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall coustitutions of the ayre and chiefe qualities in each zones: so that of the particular constitutions be other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. But to returne vnto the temperate Zones, the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of either temperate Zone is of 43. degrées almost, of Germaine miles 645. and of furlongs 21500. So that the Boreallor Northerly zone beginning from the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> endeth at the arcticke cyrcle, or at the degrée of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 66. and 31. minutes. And the Southerly from the Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> is extended or reacheth vnto the antarcticke cyrcle, or the degrée of the Southerly latitude 66. and 32. minutes.</p>
               <p>The vntemperate cold zones that reach fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate vnto the poles of the worlde, doe mooue continuall cold and frosts. So that the beames of the sun, although they pearse and enter through, yet seeing they extende not backward, nor through the reflexion or streaching backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be strengthned and sharpned, therefore can they not so heate, that by the thawing they dissolue the earth and yse, nor put away or voyde the mist. Now the vntempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Northerly zone, beginning from the 66. degrée and 31. minutes of the Northerly latitude, endeth at the Pole arcticke: and the vntemperate southerly zone, begun from the same bounde of the Southerly latitude, extendeth and endeth at the pole antarcticke.</p>
               <p>Those people which dwell vnder the burning zone, bee named of the Gréekes <hi>Amphiskioi Amphiscij,</hi> in that the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:4323:130"/>
Noone shadowes, at diuers times of the yeare, goe or be cast to them twoe waies, as toward the South or North. And twise also in the year runneth the sun right ouer their heades (as is demonstrated in the second Theorme of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide</hi>) so that at Noone it commeth to passe, that they haue almost no shadow: for the sun being direct or in right line ouer their heades at Noone, hee then sendeth downe right Beames, which are cast or streached to the plaine of the earth at right angles: so that their shadowe falleth and is right vnder the feete, and not on any side of them. So that the sun in any other time of the yeare beeing without the verticall pointes, the shadowes at Noone are one whiles cast into the South, and another whiles into the North vnto them: euen as the sun digressing from their toppes or Noonstéed is either caried into the North, or otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth into the South.</p>
               <p>This sorte of people which bee vnder either temperate zone, are called of the Gréeke Cosmographers <hi>Eteroskioi, Heteroscij,</hi> in that they haue a single shadowe. For with them the Nooneshadowes continually run or goe toward one quarter onely. So that to them dwelling Northward the Noon shadow streacheth towarth the arcticke or Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly quarter. By which it appeareth that the sun neuer ascendeth ouer their heades, but continually casteth or streacheth his beames thwartly into those contries, which alwaies forme their thwart angles with the plaine of the earth, or els fall a-slope vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>Those people which possesse, and dwel vnder either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate or cold zones, are named of the Gréeke writers <hi>Periskioi, Periscij:</hi> for that their shadowes in one artificiall day are caried and run rounde, as it were about them on the plaine of the earth: so that the sun vnto those places ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth or sendeth not straight, thwart, or sloape, but long beames running on the horizone, which as they streach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long infinitly; euen so the shadowes going and lying on
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4323:130"/>
the flat of the earth, and extended along, doe increase infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly. And these zones also vnder the poles, extend to that proper place, where the Tropicke cyrcles, and the Arctick cyrcles be all one. <hi>Strabo</hi> likewise writeth, that the colde zone reacheth to that place, where the Tropick is the arc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke cyrcle; that is, where this first Zone endeth, and the temperate beginneth: the Pole beeing 66. degrées, and a halfe aboue the horizon: so that this pole must be from the toppe of their heads in that place 23. degrées, and a halfe.</p>
               <p>Further, these people that haue their shadowes running rounde about them, dwell within the Polare cyrcles: In that all people whose Zenith is within 23. degrees and a halfe of any of both the Poles, haue their shadowes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing aboute them, but those people (as afore written) dwelling nearer vnder the Pole, the longer is their day, and by that reason doe the shadowes run the oftner about them. For where the day is of 24. houres long, the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow doth run but once about, yet where the day is of halfe a yeare long, the shadowes doe run 183. times about.</p>
               <p>Here conceiue that there be fiue zones on earth, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the fiue celestiall zones, both in the heat, temperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and cold: which for a plainer vnderstanding, vse this figure here following demonstrated.

               <p>These so finished, you shall then sée on that plaine or flat the fiue earthly zones rightly described. For the space here represented of the earth by the Tropicke lines <hi>e f.</hi> and <hi>g h.</hi> included, doth demonstrate the burning zone. In that the suns heat by his direct beams ouer it, doth continually strongly heat and burne that space of the earth: wherefore you may rightly draw a straight line from the letter <hi>g.</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>f.</hi> representing the suns iourney.</p>
               <p>And the space of the earth included of the line <hi>i k.</hi> the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke cyrcle, and the arke answering to the Northerly line <hi>i k,</hi> doth iudiacate the cold and frozen zone Northerly. And that other Region or space contained right against, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the antarcticke cyrcle, doth demonstrate the colde Southerly zone. And the tract or space of the earth inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the lines <hi>i k.</hi> and <hi>E F.</hi> doth iudicate our tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate zone Northward, and that reasonably habitable: and the other portion of the earth contained within the lines <hi>g h.</hi> and <hi>l m.</hi> doth manifestly shew the temperate souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zone.</p>
               <p>Where <hi>Ptholomie</hi> and other auncient Cosmographers write, that the burning zone is vnhabited, or as a desart, <hi>Aristotle, Plinie,</hi> and <hi>Iohn de sacro bosco</hi> (in his treatise of the Sphere) write the contrary: Besides these, it is well knowne at this day, yea by experience vnderstood of those that haue yearely gone and come from the countries lying vnder that zone; that is, betwéene the two Tropicks to be
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:4323:132"/>
inhabited. Further this burnt zone is inhabited and well replenished with people that there dwell, as the same is throughly known to many that haue passed to and frothe Indies: so that it may euidently appeare, that the heate there is not extreame, nor so distemperate, séeing the time of the heate that they suffer, continueth not long, nor the heat sharply worketh or causeth his vttermost effect. For the sun but a small time tarieth aboue the Horizone in the burnt Region or Zone (as certain astronomers write) as the space of twelue houres onely: so that the heat there is much qualified and suppressed, through the colde rising in the night time; whereof it is manifest, that he causeth not his extreame hotnesse there, although hee streacheth his beames perpendicularly on the earth. Therefore may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maruaile, that sundry ancient men affirme these parts to be vnhabitable, séeing they knew of <hi>Arabia, Foelix, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia, Taprobana,</hi> and diuers other contries lying vnder the burnt zone: yea besides these, are <hi>Guinea, Calicute, Muluca</hi> and <hi>Gatigara,</hi> well knowne to lie or bee vnder the burning Zone: and many of the people in those countries liue long: and the same Region also is inhabited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished well with people. A like affirmation hath <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> and <hi>Auicen</hi> (as afore written) that the middle zone is habitable, for they agrée co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rary to the old writers, that in the same Region of the world, which the auncient Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mographers named to bee the burnt Zone, that it is a far temperater dwelling, than vnder the Tropicks it can bee in any wise. And that people dwell vnder the Tropickes, the ancient neuer doubted. Wherfore if so resonable dwel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling be vnder the Tropicks, it cannot be otherwise (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth <hi>Petrus de apono</hi>) that vnder the Equatoure, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the sunnes sharpe heate) but that men may dwell there for all the vntemperatnesse of heate. To bee briefe, al the writers of later yeares agrée, that the middle zone is not onely habitable, but found and known by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:4323:132"/>
reasons, and by experience, that the same is most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and the earth vnder it rich, both of golde and rich drugges, and reasonable well furnished of all things néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for mans life. So that in the same middle Region of the earth vnder the Equatour, it appeareth, that through the coldnesse of the night, it doth there temper sufficiently the burning heat of the day. Besides these, after the mind of <hi>Hiero. Cardane,</hi> in that <hi>Saturne, Mercurie,</hi> and the moon (which properly are cold and moyst planets) haue a great force in the Regions vnder this zone, but especially the moon, that worketh her most force there in the night time, more then the other twoe: and of this cause more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratnesse in the day time. Besides these, it is well known that those people haue two summers, and two winters in the yeare. For in the yeare of our Lord 1530. at the will and charge of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift Emperor, a parte of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> westward was discouered, where <hi>Peru</hi> among the rest, was found richest both of Gold and other rich things and costly drugges, which is situated in longitude, of 290. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées from the West toward the East, and is distant 5. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées from the Equatoure toward the South. But what substance of Gold and other rich things hath yearely bene brought from this yle, néedeth not here any further reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall. And the like is to be considered and noted of the other two zones, contained betwéene the Polare cyrcles, and Poles of the worlde. Although <hi>Albertus Mag.</hi> denieth, a commodious dwelling for men in those places, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the same by probable reasons, yet experience reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and denieth those opinions of his, and other ancient writers. In that it is well knowne that <hi>Gothland, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Russia, Lapeland, Groueland,</hi> and diuers other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries towarde the North pole, is inhabited and well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled. And <hi>Galeottus Naruiensis</hi> proueth, that men dwell vnder the North pole, affirming the same not to bee true, that the cause of the cold there is onely the far distaunce of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:4323:133"/>
the sun, as not of the heate by nearenesse of his comming. In that the sun by reason of the signe in which he is, either increaseth or diminisheth them with vs. Besides he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the colde is not so dispersed rounde about, as that it compasseth rounde after the forme of a cyrcle, nor that the heate in like sort doeth run round about the whole body of the earth. Further <hi>Cardane</hi> writeth, that vnder the poles, there is no such coldnes as some suppose, in that the Moone, <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> haue the greatest latitudes, in respect of the sun, and the others besides. For the moon hath fiue degrées to the North, <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> excéed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eight degrées Northward, but <hi>Saturne</hi> which is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of cold, scarcely performeth thrée degrées Northward. Besides these, the Moone more auaileth Northward and Southward neare to the poles, then the sunne, in that she nearer approacheth those parts. For the Moone (as aboue said) hath fiue degrées of latitude: as well to the North, as South: so that when she shall be in the first degrée of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> with her greatest latitude Northward; that is, in the head of the Dragon, she shal then be néerer by fiue degrées to the Northerly pole, then the sunne. And in like maner, when she shalbe in the taile of the Dragon (at the entrance and beginning of <hi>Capricorne</hi>) she shall bee nearer the pole antarcticke by fiue degrées than the sun. Although in the winter the moone should be in the beginning of <hi>Capricorn</hi> with the Southerly latitude of foure or fiue degrées, yet may she worke and cause more in the change of weather, and shall cause more in <hi>Scotland</hi> than the sun, in that her power and vertue there is such. But in <hi>Brasilia</hi> and vnder the antarcticke pole for two causes, the one, in that shee is there of such power, and the other for that in her working she is nearer.</p>

So that vnder the Equinoctiall the beames most rightly and downe right falling, doe make right angles on the vpper face of the earth, which through the same causeth a most great heat. Also the beames faling
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:4323:136"/>
toward either poles, doe cause thwarter angles, and they make the angles more vneuen or thwarter, and therof the same heat is the lesser. And in the temperate zone (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the summer) the beames doe make almost angles fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto a rightnes, but in the winter vnto a thwartnes; so that in the same Region is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious dwelling. But in the colde zones the angles are caused vnlike or vneuen, &amp; thwartest or slopest, as in the burnt Zone they are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most downward: in somuch that the cold zones e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (as the burnt) are commodious to dwel vnder. For the beames falling and reflexed, how much néerer they fal and be togither, somuch the stronger and mightier they moue and cause the heat: as we dayly sée that the sun in the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéed being (as in the summer) to cast or streach downe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most perpendicular or down right beames: which beames also are almost reflected into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, of which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test heat of the day then is caused. And contrariwise, the sun being in the East or west, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beames streaching downward and reflexed, are scatred and run abroade; the effects be lesser, and the heat much abated and féebled. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so the beames in the burnt zone bee perpendicular or plum downright, which reflexed into themselues do cause a most great heat. In the temperate zone doe the beames bylitle and litle fall sloper and sloper, of which they cause there a temperate heat.
