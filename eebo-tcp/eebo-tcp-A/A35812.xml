            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O Lord God of mercy and pardon, give me a just remembrance and sad apprehensions of my sinnes; teach me to bewaile them with as great an indignation and bitternesse, as I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with complacency and delight. Let my prayers and my confession come into thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and obtaine a mercy for me and a pardon. Let not thy justice and severity so remember my sinnes, as to forget thine own mercy; and though I have committed that for which I deserve to be condemned, yet thou canst not loose that glorious attribute whence flowes comfort to us and hopes of being saved. Spare me therefore, O mercifull God, for to give pardon to a sinner that confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his sinnes, and begges remission, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to thy power, nor disproportionate to thy justice, nor unusuall to thy mercy and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est clemency.

Thou delightest not in the death of a sinner, but in his conversion there is joy in Heaven; and when thou hast delivered me from my sinnes, and saved my soule, I shall praise and magnifie thy Name to all eternity.

Despise me not, O Lord, for I am thy creature, despise me not, for thou didst dye for me, cast me not away in thine anger, for thou camest to seek me, and to save me.

               <p>O Lord God, Blessed Iesu, Eternall Iudge of quick and dead, I tremble with horror at the apprehension when I call to mind with what terrors and Majesty thou shalt appeare in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a fire shall go out from thy presence and a tempest shall be stirred up round about thee, such a tempest as shall rend the rocks levell the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, shake the earth, disorder and dissolve the whole fabrick of the heavens, and where then shall I, vile sinner, appear, when the heavens are not pure in thy sight. Lord I tremble when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that sad truth, If the righteous scarcely be saved, where then shall the wicked and the ungodly appeare? I know, O Lord, that all my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret impurities shall be laid open before all the Nations of the world, before all the orders and degrees of Angels, in the presence of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble millions of beatified spirits. There shall I see many that have taught me innocence and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, many that have given me pious example, many that have dyed for thee, and suffered tortures ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they would offend thee. O just and dear God, where shall I appeare, who shall plead for me that am so loaden with impurities, with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, with ingratitude, with malice, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of an affrighting conscience? Lord what shall

But thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my God, thou art my judge and my advocate, and thou art to passe sentence upon me for those sinnes, for which thou diedst. O reserve not my sinnes to be punished in the life to come, for then I dye eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, but bring me in this world to a holy, a sharp and Salutary repentance. Behold I am in thine hands; grant I may so weep, and be contrite for my sinnes, that in the houre of my death I may finde mercy, and in the day of judgement I may be freed from all the terrors of thy wrath, and the sentence of the wicked, and may behold thy face with joy and security, being set at thy right hand, with all thy saints and Angels to sing an eternall Alleluiah to the honour of thy mercies. <hi>Amen,</hi> sweet Iesu. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>MOST Mercifull and indulgent Iesu, hear the complaint of a sad and miserable sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for I have searched into the secret recesses of my soul, and there I finde nothing but horror, and a barren wildernesse, a neglected conscience over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with sinnes and cares, and beset with fears and sore amazements. I finde that I have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served due reverence towards my superiors, nor modesty in my discourse, nor discipline in my manners. I have been obstinate in my vain purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, cosen'd in my own semblances of humility, pertinacious in hatred, bitter in my jesting, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Subjection, ambitious of power, slow to good actions, apt to talke, ready to supplant my neighbours, full of jealousies and suspition, scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and censorious, burdensome to my friends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull to my benefactors, imperious to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferious, boasting to have said what <hi>I</hi> said not, to have seen what I saw not, to have done what I did not, and have both said, and seen, and done what I ought not, provoking thy divine Majesty with a continuall course of sinne and vanity. And yet, O Lord, thou hast spared me all this while, and hast not taken away my life in the midst of my sinnes, which is a mercy so admirable and of so vast a kindnesse, as no heart or tongue can
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41631:8"/>
think, or speak. If thou hadst dealt with me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I had deserved, and might justly have expected, I had been now, now at this instant seal'd up to an eternity of torments, hopelessely miserable, fearing the revelation of thy day with an insupportable amazement: and now under the sweet influences of thy mercies, J am praying to thee, confessing my sinnes, with shame, indeed at my basenesse and ingratitude, but with a full hope and confidence in thy mercy. O turne the eyes of thy divine clemency with a gracious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect upon a wretched sinner, open the bowels of thy mercy, and receive me into favour. O my dear God, let thy grace speedily worke that in me for which thou so long hast spared me, and to which thou didst designe me in thy holy purposes and mercies of eternity, even a true faith, and a holy life, conformable to thy will, and in order to eternall blessednesse. I remember, O Lord, the many fatherly expressions and examples of thy mercies to repenting sinners, thy delight in our conversion, thy unwillingnesse to destroy us, thy earnest invitation of us to grace and life, thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure at our dangers and miseries, the infinite variety of meanes thou usest to bring us from the gates of death, and to make us happy to eternity. These mercies, O Lord, are so essentiall to thee, that thou canst not but be infinitly pleased in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations

Remember not, O Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how we have despised thy mercies, sleighted thy judgements, neglected thy Commandments; but now at length establish in us great contrition for our sinnes, leade us on to humble confession and dereliction of them, and let thy grace make us bring forth fruits meet for repentance, fruits of justice, of hope, of charity, of religion and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may be what thou delightest in, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and just, and mercifull, vessels prepared for honour, temples of the holy Ghost, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thy praises to all eternity, O blessed Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su, who livest and reignest, ever one God, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
