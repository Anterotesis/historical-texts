            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as <hi>Pliny</hi> speakes of <hi>Callimachus</hi> (an excellent Painter, but one
that was so curious, that the grace of his work was much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the diligence; for, he could never tell, when he had done
well) that, he was <hi>maximus sus calumniator,</hi> his own worst
<hi>detractor:</hi> So does <hi>Aristides</hi> observe of an excellent Prince,
administring that Empire with Remissenesse and Favour,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41398:3"/>
which is best sway'd by Iustice, and by Power; that he is
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, his own greatest <hi>Rebel;</hi> For, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

his own naturall <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> in all <hi>High Actions,</hi> to an
<hi>inferior communication,</hi> and adoption of <hi>other Councells,</hi> It of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
hapneth to him, as it does, to many other kind Masters in
the World, That, whatsoever he shall, heretofore, have gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
shall be no longer thought on, as a piece of <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Mercy;</hi> but, whatsoever He shall, henceforth, deny, shall be
now lookt on, as an Act of great <hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>Tyranny.</hi> The
sadde testimony, which the <hi>Miseries</hi> of our present <hi>Warre</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
unto this Truth, will save the labour of examining other
witnesses; and the sadder testimony, which the <hi>Mistakes</hi> of
our late <hi>pretended Peace,</hi> afford, will save the examination of
them. Never did <hi>condescention,</hi> (I had almost said, <hi>submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>)
in any <hi>Prince,</hi> meet with so much <hi>scorne</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi>
from any <hi>People;</hi> whil'st all His former Acts of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
that should have Instructed their <hi>obedience,</hi> doe but Arme
their <hi>Pride:</hi> By <hi>receiving,</hi> they only learne to <hi>Aske;</hi> and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten a <hi>Power</hi> into their hands, they are now so farre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured
of <hi>Majesty,</hi> that, if they cannot get her <hi>Scepter,</hi> (as they
hope, they shall) They are resolv'd, not to let goe her <hi>Sword;</hi>
not unlike, to some young passionate lovers of Beauty, who,
when they cannot obtaine the Eldest daughter to Wife, whom
they most desire, will match her Sister. They think it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to cousen us of our Monies; now, they cousen us of our
very Sences; and whilest they call upon the World, to behold
and see a <hi>Treaty,</hi> They cheat them, with a very <hi>Trick.</hi> They
have dealt with this whole Kingdom, now, as they dealt with
the Lord <hi>Mack-Quire,</hi> not long since; They have, in a manner,
<hi>executed</hi> a Common-wealth, these three or foure years, by
Rapines, by Rebellions, and by all the sad appertenances of
Warre; and now, They <hi>cut it downe,</hi> as it were in a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Treaty, for a well setled Peace; but, to what end? not, as
purposing or intending any such blessing, as Peace, unto the
Kingdom, that should animate it, as it were, with a new life,
and make it happy; but, only, to recover a little, so much of her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41398:3"/>
exanimated Spirits, as shall make her sensible, and more appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of fresh and new Miseries. For, that in the late <hi>Treaty,</hi>
they never did intend a <hi>Peace,</hi> I think, will be easily made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to any common judgement and understanding, that shall
observe and weigh no more, then these foure particulars. First
their <hi>Indisposition</hi> and <hi>Aversion</hi> from <hi>Treating:</hi> Secondly,
their <hi>Impotent</hi> and <hi>Imperfect Qualification</hi> of their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
to <hi>Treat:</hi> Thirdly, their <hi>Insolent Expostulations</hi> and
<hi>Demands</hi> in the <hi>Treaty:</hi> and Lastly, Their <hi>Inexorable Obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Deafnesse,</hi> against all <hi>Enlargement, Prorogation,</hi> or
<hi>Reviving</hi> of the <hi>Treaty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. Concerning the first of these, their naturall <hi>indisposition</hi>
and <hi>aversion</hi> from <hi>Treating.</hi> It is worth observing, That from
the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> last, when His Majesty recommended this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
first unto them, unto the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>November</hi> last, when their
<hi>Propositions</hi> were brought downe to <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon which the
<hi>Treaty</hi> was founded, there passed almost five whole Monthes
betweene. A Small Time, for the grave <hi>Advices</hi> of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to worke in, in such a poynt full of perplexities, as this,
<hi>Whether it be better for the Kingdome, to have Peace, or Warre?</hi>
If the question had been onely put, whither <hi>Presbytery</hi> were
not better then <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> whereon dependeth but the Ruine
of the <hi>Church?</hi> or whether <hi>Democracy,</hi> were not better then
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> whereon dependeth, but the Ruine of the <hi>State?</hi>
or lastly, whither the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome, were not safer
in their hands, then in the Kings; whereon dependeth, but the
Ruine of them <hi>both?</hi> For the ventilation and agitation of such
easie poynts, as these, a matter of <hi>Three Dayes</hi> a piece, is time
enough; (for no more would be allowed us, at <hi>Vxbridge)</hi> as
if the <hi>Church,</hi> amongst the other new markes of <hi>Primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi>
were in this also, to be reckoned the more like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
<hi>Christ;</hi> for <hi>dying</hi> and <hi>rising</hi> again; for laying down her old <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious</hi>
and <hi>Carnall</hi> Body, and taking up a new, <hi>glorious</hi> and
<hi>Spirituall</hi> Body, and all in <hi>Three Dayes?</hi> But when a poynt of
so great concernement, as this, comes in debate, <hi>whither it be
better to have Peace, or Warre?</hi> A poynt, which, if it miscarry
never so little in the stating, may chance endanger That Lords
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41398:4"/>
               <hi>Pension,</hi> and this Lords <hi>Place;</hi> may chance endanger the <hi>Tryall</hi>
of some of the Members, and the <hi>Trade</hi> of more; may chance
returne them, to their Originall <hi>three-penny Seates,</hi> that have
sat, all this while in great State, upon the <hi>Stage?</hi> It will aske
time, to traverse and discusse it; and foure or five monthes Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
is truely, with the shortest. All this while, indeed,
had they a very hard game to play. They held the <hi>Wolfe</hi> by the
<hi>Eare,</hi> as they say; They durst not <hi>hold</hi> a <hi>Treaty,</hi> when the King
offered it, for then, They knew they should loose <hi>Themselves;</hi>
and They durst not <hi>let it goe,</hi> when it was offered; for, then they
knew they should loose the <hi>People.</hi> Was it not high time, for
to bestirre them now, and like true <hi>State-Iugglers,</hi> expresse
a little skill? First therefore, to make the People a little
sport in the street, the better to perswade them faster in;
They doe give it out, that if the <hi>King</hi> would acknowledge
them His <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Great Councell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
then They would <hi>Treat;</hi> as if this were a World
for men, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to admire
<hi>Names</hi> for <hi>Things:</hi> as if <hi>Theodora</hi> in <hi>Procopius,</hi> having been
a common Whore, and now comming to the Court to be
<hi>Iustinians</hi> wife, were ever a whit the honester Woman, for
<hi>Euphemia's</hi> name; as if they knew not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how to imitate their
dear <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as <hi>Aesops Asse</hi> did the <hi>Dogge,</hi> who,
seeing the <hi>Dogge</hi> leap upon his Master, and his Master stroke
him, and call him by his Name, thought that He might doe so
too, and be as welcome. When this did not take, as was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
(for I dare say, They stood upon this Denomination, They
desired the grant of this <hi>Liberty,</hi> but as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his
youth is reported to have desired the gift of <hi>Chastity,</hi> which He
had rather God would have denied him) when there was no
Remedy, but that <hi>Treat</hi> they must; By meere slight of hand,
they draw some <hi>Propositions,</hi> which they will have called, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
for a safe and a well grounded Peace,</hi> like so many Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
out of their mouth, the various <hi>Colours</hi> whereof doe so
please the Peoples Eyes, that they cannot see the <hi>Cordes;</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
which the very Anabaptists have already <hi>Christned</hi>
in their <hi>Child-hood,</hi> and call'd them <hi>Propositions of Peace;</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41398:4"/>
which I am confident, They dare not hope to see, at their full
yeares of Action and Accomplishment, even by a successefull
<hi>Warre.</hi> And thus, having made the <hi>Quarrell</hi> become the
<hi>Decision;</hi> having by cleanly conveyance, jugled the true ground
of the <hi>Warre</hi> on the Kings part, into the Foundation of the
<hi>Peace</hi> on their part: They hope, they have satisfied the World,
now, that They are for <hi>Peace,</hi> but that the King is not; And
they doubt not, I warrant you, to raise good Summes out of the
People, for the continuance of <hi>Warre,</hi> upon the credit of these
pretended Intentions, which they had of <hi>Peace:</hi> as your ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Iuglers</hi> of <hi>Small<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wares</hi> use to doe; who will put a pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
into the poore Country-fellowes mouth, that shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>suffer</hi> some of his Tricks, and then make him pay his penny,
besides, for <hi>seeing</hi> them.</p>
            <p>II. In the second place, observe their <hi>Impotent</hi> and <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Qualification</hi> of their Commissioners to <hi>Treat:</hi> For first,
whereas, the King invested his Commissioners, or any ten of
them, with a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>whole</hi> Power, not only to <hi>Meet</hi> and <hi>Treat,</hi>
but also, to <hi>Compose</hi> and <hi>Conclude</hi> a Peace, obliging Himselfe
under his own Royall Hand to ratifie whatsoever they should
doe: The Men of <hi>Westminster</hi> endow their Commissioners,
but with <hi>halfe</hi> a <hi>Power;</hi> A <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Treat;</hi> but reserve to
themselves the better <hi>halfe,</hi> a <hi>power</hi> to <hi>Conclude;</hi> tying up their
Commissioners onely to such <hi>Instructions,</hi> as, either were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>given</hi> them, or else, from time to time, <hi>should be.</hi> Now, let
all the World Iudge, whether these men had any <hi>Love</hi> to
<hi>Peace,</hi> (nay, whether they, rather, did not <hi>Feare</hi> it) who, durst
not trust their owne Members, creatures of their owne election
and free choyce, with the managery and regulating of it. The
<hi>Kings Majesty</hi> trusted his Commissioners with a <hi>power,</hi> which,
if they had abus'd, they had, indeed, <hi>abus'd the King,</hi> by giving
and betraying up his <hi>Rights;</hi> but, They had not <hi>abus'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi>
nay, they might have done it, no doubt, to their owne
<hi>great advantage:</hi> But, if <hi>They</hi> had trusted their Commissioners
with such a <hi>power,</hi> those Commissioners could not have <hi>abus'd
the Parliament,</hi> by giving up, and betraying of their <hi>Rights,</hi>
but withall, They must <hi>abuse Themselves,</hi> and doe it, to their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41398:5"/>
owne <hi>speciall disadvantage:</hi> And yet, so <hi>zealous</hi> is the King for
<hi>Peace,</hi> that it might be setled, that, Those men, who might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
his Power to his prejudice, <hi>are</hi> trusted; and so <hi>jealous</hi> are
the Rebels of <hi>Peace,</hi> least it should be setled, that Those men,
who could not abuse the Parliament-power, but to their owne
prejudice, <hi>are not.</hi> Now: what could the World expect, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

persons, who were rather Parliament-<hi>Conduits,</hi> to conveigh
such Answers, and the Reflection of such <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as were

speak upon occasion, and to utter, what They themselves

any <hi>Reason,</hi> as being <hi>against the usage of Parliament,</hi> yet) a
little <hi>Rhetorique</hi> to colour, and set off the businesse; but, were
onely their <hi>dumbo Oracles,</hi> which opened not their mouth, or
ever spake word, but, as the <hi>Devill</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> (who, was
brought every day from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Vxbridge</hi> in a Cloak-bagg,
as the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> they say, was once brought from <hi>Rome</hi> to
<hi>Trent</hi>) did usually possesse them, and inspire them. I believe,
they durst confide in their <hi>Committee;</hi> but, they durst not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in their <hi>Commissioners.</hi> The <hi>Grand Committee,</hi> they knew,
was, as the <hi>first-running</hi> of this Rebellion; all the <hi>Strength</hi> and
<hi>Spirit</hi> of Sedition was in it; which would keep life in their
Designes and Purposes, though at the very last gaspe; But these
<hi>Commissioners,</hi> are but like the <hi>second-tapp,</hi> which runnes <hi>smaller</hi>
and <hi>smaller;</hi> there might possibly they thought, be some rellish
and tincture of <hi>Allegiance</hi> in some of them; and therefore, they
durst not adventure any rich Commodities, in a <hi>bottome,</hi> that
had, or might have, more <hi>pieces,</hi> then they could imagine. In
the meane time, God help the poore common people of this
Land, that have <hi>trusted</hi> these men with their Fortunes, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Lives, in managing of a <hi>Warre,</hi> for the space of <hi>three
yeares,</hi> and over; who, now dare not <hi>Trust</hi> one another,
with either, in setling of a <hi>Peace,</hi> for the space of <hi>three whole
Dayes</hi> together.</p>
            <p>III. Thirdly, consider their <hi>Insolent Expostulations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41398:5"/>
in the <hi>Treaty.</hi> Whereas <hi>Warre</hi> is ever full of <hi>Tumors,
Risings</hi> and <hi>Swellings;</hi> all <hi>Treaties</hi> have in them, still, a kind of
<hi>lankenesse, leanenesse,</hi> or as it were, a <hi>falling away</hi> of Desires;
(for, if there be not a mutuall <hi>condescension</hi> on both Sides; if one
part onely <hi>take,</hi> and the other onely <hi>give:</hi> The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
may have a <hi>clove</hi> put in her <hi>Mouth,</hi> but she hath not
cur'd her <hi>Lunges,</hi> and as one <hi>disadvantage</hi> does <hi>beget</hi> a Treaty,
so another <hi>advantage</hi> will <hi>break</hi> it) And then, to what <hi>one</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement,
in what <hi>one</hi> part, of what <hi>one</hi> Proposition, did their
Commissioners ever <hi>condescend?</hi> In what <hi>one</hi> thing, did they
goe lesse at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> then before they did at <hi>Oxford:</hi> unlesse
perchance you will account it a greater insolence, to <hi>defie</hi> the
King at <hi>fifty miles</hi> distance from their owne dung-hill, then to
doe it at <hi>fifteene?</hi> Men, that will pretend to <hi>Treat,</hi> and yet will
proceed in no <hi>complying,</hi> but all in a <hi>commanding</hi> and <hi>Imperious</hi>
way, as these men did, can no more properly be said to <hi>Treat,</hi>
then the Slave and his Master in <hi>Terence,</hi> could be said to <hi>Fight;</hi>
when the one with <hi>beating,</hi> and the other with <hi>being beat,</hi> at
last, They were <hi>both</hi> sore and weary. <hi>Induciae sunt Belli Feriae,</hi>
saith <hi>Varro: Truces</hi> and <hi>Treaties,</hi> are Warre's <hi>Holy-dayes:</hi> and
as <hi>Religion</hi> useth to have her free practice and exercise in the
<hi>one,</hi> so should <hi>Reason</hi> in the other; and for men to urge onely
<hi>Demands</hi> in a <hi>Treaty,</hi> which lyes open on purpose, for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <hi>Debates,</hi> is all one, as for a man to think to make a <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme,</hi>
of nothing but <hi>Conclusions,</hi> because he would have no
Proposition <hi>denyed.</hi> Besides, if nothing lesse then the granting
of <hi>all</hi> these Demands can obtaine a <hi>Peace,</hi> (as it should seeme it
cannot) I would faine know, <hi>what</hi> these men propose unto
themselves if they should obtaine by <hi>Warre?</hi> What can They
have more to <hi>Aske,</hi> or the King to <hi>Give,</hi> unlesse it were his
<hi>Life?</hi> (and if any thing secure that, it must be their <hi>Scorne,</hi>
as preferring that of any <hi>Constables</hi> before it.) Suppose (I doubt
not, but the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> will ever keep them at the distance
of a Supposition, and therefore I suppose) that all Successe,
which ever yet crown'd impious Attempt, should wait on thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the sacking of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> were prosperous and for tunate <hi>once,</hi>
for <hi>seaven yeares</hi> together, in an Insurrection under the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi>
which is more then ever they could boast off, either before
or since) Yet I dare say, that in these Propositions, They have
endeavoured to lay some particular Obligations upon the King,
in the way to <hi>Peace</hi> (as for example, that Imperious Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Two Princes <hi>Right</hi> in their <hi>Electorall Dignity,</hi>
which is the provision of the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Proposition) which They
themselves will never be able to make good unto their Malice,
if they should succeed and prosper in this unnaturall <hi>Warre:</hi>
And are these fit <hi>Ingredients</hi> for a <hi>Peace?</hi> If they can gaine
that, in order to a <hi>Peace</hi> (that is, a <hi>Curbe</hi> and <hi>Bridle</hi> on the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
Law</hi>) which they cannot loose by <hi>Warre,</hi> (because
they never had it) I should commend the playing of their
Cardes; and think they doe just, as some cunning Merchants of
their owne Miseries use to doe; that will ordinarily get more
by the <hi>Breif,</hi> then they could loose, by the <hi>Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say, They demanded of the King, in order to our
Peace, in a manner, but two things; An abolition of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Government,</hi> for the setling of the <hi>Church;</hi> and a disposall
of the <hi>Militia</hi> to Commissioners of their owne Nomination,
for the securing of the <hi>State.</hi> And to say truth, They did not:
but then, if you mark it, These <hi>two</hi> particulars doe stand out,
and shew themselves as the most <hi>prominent pieces</hi> of all their
Propositions, as those <hi>Two</hi> teeth did in the Worme, which
<hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esias</hi> writes of in his <hi>Indian</hi> Stories: which indeed, were all
the teeth that Worme had: and yet with those <hi>two</hi> Teeth,
was that Worme able to pull downe any <hi>Camel</hi> or <hi>Oxe,</hi> that
happened to come neare him. The bare concession of these,
involves a totall <hi>Alteration</hi> in the Government, both of the
<hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Civill</hi> State; and all other things contained in
their Propositions, <hi>non sunt plura, sed minora,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi>
speakes, They are not more <hi>parts</hi> of Insolence, but lesser <hi>pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the abolishing of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> there passed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
with the Divines: one side pressing <hi>for it,</hi> and the
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>against it.</hi> Those Arguments on our part, that concluded
<hi>against</hi> the abolishing thereof, were drawne, as I have learnt,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41398:6"/>
from these three severall Heads: First, from the poynt of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi> the King having taken a Solemne <hi>Oath</hi> to maintaine the
<hi>Rights</hi> &amp; <hi>Liberties</hi> of Holy Church: Secondly, from the poynt
of <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> The alienation of Things offer'd <hi>unto God,</hi>
being accompanied still with visible, and more then ordinary
Iudgements <hi>from God,</hi> either upon the <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Fortunes,</hi> or
<hi>Families,</hi> of those men that are the chiefe Instruments and
Actors therein: and Thirdly, from the poynt of <hi>Divine Right;</hi>
Episcopacy having been accounted and accepted, as an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi>
and <hi>Institution</hi> of Christ himselfe, by the most Learned
men that have lived in all Ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>Against those Arguments deduced from the two first heads,
there was scarse any thing offered in the shape of a <hi>Reply,</hi>
which indeed was not <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> even in the Iudgement
of their owne Commissioners: for it appear'd, in those Two
questions of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Perjury,</hi> Their understanding of the
<hi>State</hi> thereof, was like their Conscience of the <hi>Sinne,</hi> little or
just none at all. Indeed <hi>little</hi> could be said, by <hi>greater</hi> Clerkes
then they: for as the Oratour observes of some Creatures, that
are pretty nimble at shifting for themselves, so long as they
are in <hi>Cranies</hi> and in <hi>Holes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who notwithstanding are soone
overtaken and caught when they are brought out into an <hi>open
Field,</hi> where every man may see them; So there are some pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Truth, which will admit of <hi>disquisition,</hi> whither they
be so, or no, so long, as they doe but peep now and then, out
of the <hi>Pitt;</hi> which, when they are once laid open to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
will beare no Argument; because they carry their
owne <hi>light</hi> with them, that does betray them. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the third Head, those Arguments that were instituted in
defence of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> thereof, out of the Scriptures, to
those, They made a shift to say <hi>something;</hi> and although that
<hi>something</hi> were no more like an <hi>Answer,</hi> then an <hi>Ape</hi> is like a
<hi>Man:</hi> yet their owne Commissioners, who saw them beaten
from their two other <hi>Workes,</hi> and yet were resolved never to
give up the <hi>Fort;</hi> abett those Answers, and seeme to wonder,
that we were not satisfied therewith. Alas! I cannot blame
young <hi>Gamesters</hi> at disputing, if they <hi>catch</hi> up their <hi>last Stake.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41398:7"/>
It was all they had to live on. The two former Heads, that of
<hi>Sacriledge,</hi> and the other of <hi>Perjury,</hi> they frighted them so, that
they durst not look them in the Faces: They were indeed so
<hi>open,</hi> and so <hi>demonstrable:</hi> But this Third Head of <hi>Divine
Right;</hi> because they thought it a <hi>Head in a Bagge:</hi> because
They knew it was more <hi>Problematicall,</hi> and would admit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
on <hi>either</hi> side: therefore they stick close to that, and
thinke they can avoyd all Arguments from Scripture, that may
be brought to <hi>prove</hi> it; nay, They thinke they can raise as good
Arguments out of the Scripture, that shall conclude <hi>against</hi> it.
And truely, I would not have any man thinke it strange, for
men of contrary Perswasions to have contrary Conceptions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which <hi>Scripture</hi> they did neither
<hi>make</hi> nor <hi>write,</hi> and, which <hi>Scripture,</hi> is brought to prove and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
a Truth, perchance, which, either it did not intend <hi>at
all,</hi> or but upon occasion, and <hi>by</hi> the <hi>by;</hi> (as it may well happen
in the case of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and in most other poynts of <hi>Christian
Practice.</hi>) Why should any man, I say, wonder at this, that shall
observe the very same Men, according to their <hi>different,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
interests,</hi> to have as <hi>divided</hi> and <hi>different understandings,</hi>
upon some <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> which <hi>Law,</hi> notwithstanding, they
themselves <hi>fram'd</hi> and <hi>made,</hi> and which <hi>Law</hi> was brought to
prove and evidence a Truth, which was one of the very <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
why that <hi>Law</hi> was made: (as it happened afterwards in
the Case of the Kings <hi>Power</hi> in making a <hi>Cessation</hi> with <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Full Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. CXLIV. CXLV.</note>
whither it <hi>were</hi> limited, or whither it were <hi>not</hi> limited by the
<hi>Statute made this Parliament;</hi> and as it will happen in most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poynts of <hi>Civill-Right.</hi>) Not that I can think these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
brought on either side, to be of <hi>equall</hi> worth and strength
(for as it appeares by <hi>all</hi> their Commissioners <hi>Answers</hi> which
I have read, so does it appeare by <hi>some</hi> of their Commissioners
<hi>Arguments,</hi> which I have heard, that They had <hi>no Power to
Conclude</hi>) but that I thinke <hi>Ignorant Men,</hi> in pursuing of any
<hi>Truth,</hi> to be like <hi>ignorant Hunters</hi> in pursuance of their <hi>Game;</hi>
who whatsoever they can light on, by the by, lay hold on
strait; and if they come to sell it, will be sure to aske much
more then it is worth, or then any other man who knowes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41398:7"/>
what the Thing is will give, <hi>Imbecillitate suâ pretium rei metientes,</hi> as he saies; having no better measure of the things
<hi>worth,</hi> then their owne <hi>weakenesse;</hi> Or, that I thinke, with
Saint <hi>Hilary, quot voluntates, tot fides;</hi> there are as many
severall <hi>Faiths,</hi> as there are, <hi>Willes;</hi> and, when men of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
engagements, fall into heats and disputes, in poynts, which
are not mathematically <hi>demonstrable;</hi> their severall <hi>affections</hi>
ordinarily will improve into severall <hi>opinions,</hi> and they will
judge of things, not according to <hi>other</hi> mens <hi>proofes,</hi> but their
own <hi>praepossessions:</hi> And therefore, for my part, I have ever
thought most of our <hi>Divinity Disputation,</hi> but a kind of
<hi>Church-Duell;</hi> which does oftner declare, which is the <hi>Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
side, then, which the <hi>Truer;</hi> &amp; so much the more often, by
how much, it may fall out easily, that the truth may be on <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
But if men will proceed to Disputes and Arguments,
(which, seldome, or, never, is, to any purpose; for, either,
those persons, at whose request, or for whose satisfaction that
Disputation is instituted, are able to judge of the solidity and
strength thereof, or they are not: If they are not able to judge
of it, they receive no good by it; and, If they are able to judge,
they do not need it) it is a requisite <hi>expedient</hi> for hopefull
proceedings in that kind, That, men proportion their Proofes
according to the nature and condition of those <hi>Propositions,</hi>
which they are to <hi>prove:</hi> If the matter, be a <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Beliefe,</hi>
the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the best <hi>proofe</hi> thereof; b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cause the Scripture
exactly conteynes all <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> but if it be, a <hi>Matter</hi> of
<hi>Practise,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> is not the best <hi>Proofe</hi> thereof; because,
as it containes not exactly, all <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Forme,</hi> so, neither is
there any reason, why it should containe them; it being the
principall, if not the sole end of <hi>Scripture,</hi> to transmit those
<hi>Lawes</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> unto the world, by which, it should be <hi>gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
and not, to transcribe the <hi>Formes, Institutions,</hi> and <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
in <hi>degrees,</hi> of those Officers, who, then did, and ever
were, to <hi>governe</hi> it. Nor does it a whit impeach the <hi>Divine

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> founded in
the first Apostles, if there should chance to be found, no <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Text</hi> in Scripture, which, in <hi>expresse tearmes,</hi> does settle
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41398:8"/>
and establish that <hi>Foundation:</hi> no more, then it does impeach
the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> in a <hi>State,</hi> founded in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
or, in any other <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the World, a thousand yeares
agoe, because in the <hi>Code,</hi> or <hi>Digest</hi> of those Fundamentall
<hi>Lawes,</hi> by which those Kingdoms have been so long <hi>govern'd,</hi>
there is no <hi>particular Act</hi> or <hi>Lawe,</hi> made, in <hi>direct wordes,</hi>
which does establish and ordaine, that <hi>Imperiall</hi> and <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall</hi>
Forme of <hi>Government.</hi> And therefore, there is no more
reason in the world, when a man sees, or may see, that the
whole Church of <hi>Christ</hi> in all ages, hath ever acknowledged,
and observed a difference of Order between a <hi>Bishop</hi> and a
<hi>Priest,</hi> why, he should inferre, that at first, a <hi>Bishop</hi> and a <hi>Priest</hi>
were <hi>all one,</hi> no doubt, because the word <hi>Presbyter,</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is sometime given to <hi>both:</hi> Then there is, when he reads,
or may read, that the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in all ages, never
had but <hi>One</hi> High-priest; Why, he should inferre, that at last,
there were <hi>Two</hi> High Priests in that <hi>Church,</hi> no doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> are <hi>both</hi> called <hi>High Priests</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in Scripture.</p>
            <p>I speake none of this, as if I thought the <hi>Divine Right</hi>
of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> could not be prov'd by Scripture (for I rest
most assured, it is as cleerly <hi>prov'd</hi> from thence as the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
of the <hi>Lords Day:</hi> which particular, I rather doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon, because, in these Propositions for a well setled Peace,
There is <hi>One</hi> Act desired to be passed, for the <hi>Abolishing</hi> of the
<hi>One,</hi> and <hi>Another</hi> Act desired to be passed, for the <hi>Observation</hi>
of the <hi>other;</hi> when all knowing men must confesse, their <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>
and <hi>Tenure</hi> in the Scripture, to be <hi>equall,</hi> and the
<hi>same.</hi>)
But because I think, that <hi>Scripture</hi> is not the right <hi>Topick,</hi> out
of which men ought to deduce and draw those <hi>proofes;</hi> If it
finde but any <hi>footing</hi> in the Scripture, the Churches univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
<hi>Practice</hi> of such a <hi>Proofe,</hi> is the best <hi>Proof</hi> that can be made,
of such a <hi>Practice;</hi> In regard, that <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and Good
Life, as they are <hi>Essentiall</hi> to the Church, so, they are <hi>Vnivocall;</hi>
and, the Scripture, as it delivers them, <hi>once,</hi> so it delivers them,
<hi>ever:</hi> but, <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Forme,</hi> and Government, if they
should be confest <hi>Essentiall</hi> to the Church, in their <hi>Institutions;</hi>
yet, are they not alwaies <hi>Vnivocall,</hi> in their <hi>operations;</hi> but of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41398:8"/>
necessity must <hi>rise</hi> and <hi>fall,</hi> and, either <hi>admit</hi> of grouth, or
<hi>seem</hi> to doe so, according to the <hi>conditions</hi> and <hi>changes</hi> of time,
that will <hi>suite</hi> best unto them. Besides, the condition of the
<hi>Mysticall</hi> Body, the body of the <hi>Church,</hi> as considered in her
<hi>Infancy,</hi> to my thinking is not much unlike to the condition of
the <hi>Naturall body,</hi> the body of Man, as considered in <hi>His;</hi> and
the severall operation of <hi>orders</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> is not much unlike
to the severall operation of <hi>soules</hi> in the <hi>other;</hi> now we know
that the <hi>reasonable soule,</hi> albeit a soule of <hi>another</hi> order, then the
<hi>sensitive</hi> (being derived from a nobler extraction, and origine)
and infused from the beginning into the Body, no lesse <hi>then it,</hi>
yet, it exercises little or no <hi>distinct</hi> operations in that body <hi>from
it;</hi> till such time as that body come to yeares of understanding,
where <hi>Reason</hi> may have room and scope to work in, at her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
In like manner that <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> might be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the beginning in the Church, and be superinduc't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Preisthood,</hi> as a <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>nobler</hi> Order from
it; and yet, in the <hi>nonage</hi> of the Church, there may be little or no
<hi>distinction</hi> found in the Scripture, of Administration of those
<hi>Orders;</hi> which then began most eminently to appear, when that
<hi>Body</hi> of the Church was a little more grown, and come to <hi>years,</hi>
and had <hi>Instruments</hi> fitted, and <hi>Organs</hi> well prepared for the
<hi>execution</hi> thereof. Furthermore it would be considered, that
there is something almost in every <hi>practicall</hi> Text of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
like to that which the Painters call the <hi>Aire</hi> in every <hi>Face;</hi> if <hi>all</hi>
the <hi>parts</hi> of a Face, be taken in their right feature and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that <hi>Aire</hi> be not taken (which Aire is a kind of <hi>center,</hi>
wherein all <hi>consents</hi> of <hi>similitude</hi> and <hi>likenesse</hi> meet) one man
will confidently pronounce the Face <hi>is</hi> like, and another will
as confidently pronounce as he, that it <hi>is not;</hi> and both believe
themselves to be very right in <hi>judgement;</hi> If the <hi>sense</hi> of the
words of any Text be taken and understood, according to the
<hi>partiall</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> acceptation of those words in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and then the <hi>Generall</hi> Aire, the <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Harmony</hi> of the
<hi>whole</hi> Text, with that which went <hi>before,</hi> and that which <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes;</hi> The Relation and Interest which it hath to <hi>persons</hi> and
<hi>places,</hi> or that <hi>cast of the lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41398:9"/>
some <hi>Times, Vsages,</hi> and <hi>Customes;</hi> if all this be not taken, and
understood, as well: One man, may deduce <hi>one</hi> conclusion from
that text, and another man, <hi>another</hi> crosse to that, and both
think themselves to have inferred <hi>justly.</hi> No mervaile then, if
these men, should produce <hi>some Texts</hi> of Scripture, that colour
for <hi>Presbytery</hi> to those mens Apprehensions, that are resolv'd
before, <hi>to set it up:</hi> and no mervaile, if they produce <hi>other
Texts,</hi> that look a squint upon <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> to those mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that are resolv'd before, <hi>to pull it downe;</hi> For,
when the <hi>Aire</hi> of the Face, is mist, it is no longer, a <hi>Picture,</hi>
but a <hi>Phancy;</hi> and, whom, every man is pleas'd to think it
like, like to them, it is, and, when the <hi>Aire</hi> of a T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xt is mist
(as they, generally, either, never goe about to take it, or, ever
misse it) That text, is like the Children of <hi>Israells Manna,</hi>
which will tast, to every man, according to the particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and inclination of his own palate; or, like <hi>Pauso's</hi>
Horse, which was, ever ready made, whither you would
have the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Heeles</hi> stand uppermost, all was one. And,
therefore our Commissioners chalkt them out the readiest way,
to detect the <hi>unlawfulnesse</hi> of <hi>Episcopall Government,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on p. 56. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> LXIX.</note> if there
were any; when, <hi>They desired to be informed by them, when,
and where any Nationall Church since the Apostles time, was
ever governed without it.</hi> For, if they pretend <hi>that</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be unlawfull, and yet, can shew <hi>no other;</hi> it is a shrewd
argument, that they doe but <hi>pretend</hi> it; For, it can hardly be
imagined, that Christ should ordaine but <hi>one</hi> only <hi>lawfull</hi> forme
of Government in his <hi>Church,</hi> that was to abide, <hi>even unto the
end of the World:</hi> and, that, that <hi>Forme</hi> should so soon decay
and perish, as that there should not remaine the least foot-step
or impression of it in his <hi>Church,</hi> for the whole space of Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred years together. But their Commissioners will
not heare of this; They tell us, that, what our Lords <hi>did men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning a Nationall Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their Reply 21. Feb. p. 57. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> LXX.</note> 
               <hi>is a new Question, which
hath not, as yet, been any part of the subject of their Debate.</hi>
Good Lord I how well acquainted are these men with <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall,</hi>
and <hi>Classicall,</hi> and <hi>Synodicall,</hi> and <hi>Nationall</hi> Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
which are for them: and, what a strange matter they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41398:9"/>
make, of a <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> because, it is against them? This
is but just, as I have known some beggars, who will make
you believe they do not understand scarce a word of <hi>good Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
because they find, they can get more with <hi>Canting.</hi> Well:
They are willing for all this, to believe <hi>Episcopall</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>unlawfull:</hi> and I make no question (at least no <hi>new
Question,</hi> for I believe, it is already stated) but that, They
look to be well <hi>paid</hi> for their opinion. But this I must tell
them; I would not have them <hi>found</hi> that <hi>unlawfulnesse</hi> on
Scripture; or I would have them <hi>finde</hi> it; For, as concerning
all their arguments out of Scripture, which have hitherto been
brought against it, I will say no more but this; That they have
concluded no more against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> even to those very
persons that have such unequall thoughts, and so prejudicate
affections to that sacred <hi>Order;</hi> Then they may conclude, when
they please against the keeping of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> against the
<hi>Baptizing of Infants,</hi> against <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> or in a word, against
any one Article, either of Christian <hi>Practice</hi> or <hi>Beliefe,</hi> establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the Church; when the <hi>disbeliefe</hi> of any one of these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
is like to prove as <hi>advantagious</hi> and <hi>beneficiall</hi> to them,
as the <hi>disbelieving</hi> of this <hi>Episcopacy</hi> hath done.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> their demands were <hi>Two;</hi> First,
They demand the <hi>sole Nomination of all the Persons to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
therewith</hi> wholly to themselves, not allowing the
King, not only <hi>the Power of nomination of one man</hi> in Twenty,
but not so much as <hi>the Power of exception against one man</hi> in
Twenty: Secondly, they demand the <hi>Continuance of this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
during pleasure,</hi> and <hi>without any limitation</hi> or <hi>restriction</hi> of
Time. And truely, when I met with this, I began to think,
that in short time, the Rebels would invest the King with such
a <hi>Prerogative,</hi> as <hi>Agatharcides</hi> reports of the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> that
they allowed their King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So long as he kept <hi>close,</hi> and within
his <hi>Court,</hi> it was lawfull for him to doe <hi>any thing,</hi> what he
would; but if once he stirr'd a foot, but out of his <hi>Palace,</hi> it was
then lawfull for them to <hi>stone</hi> him. <hi>His Majesties most Loyall
and most Humble Subjects,</hi> will be content to spare him a little
<hi>Honour;</hi> but they will be sure to clip, and pare him to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41398:10"/>
quick, of all His <hi>Power.</hi> So that upon the whole matter; the
Case is this. <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Nokes</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Stiles</hi> fell out, and fought;
and having drawne some bloud one from another, at last, they
were contented to put up their Swords, and be made Friends;
Provided, that both their Swords might be put into such hands,
as might prevent all further quarrelling betweene them.
<hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Stiles,</hi> he proposes that both their Swordes may be put
into <hi>Two friends</hi> hands; that the <hi>ones</hi> Friend may keep the <hi>one,</hi>
and the <hi>others</hi> Friend the <hi>other.</hi> But <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Nokes,</hi> (though
causelessely he drew first on <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Stiles,</hi> which meant him no
harme yet now) afraid least <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Stiles</hi> should doe him mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
will have both the Swords put into <hi>his owne</hi> hands, or
He will not be Friends. Now certainly, though upon severe
examination of this offer'd Composition, there be no <hi>reall</hi> secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
founded upon that motion, even of <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Stiles</hi> (for if the
<hi>Two</hi> Swords should be put into <hi>two</hi> Friends hands as he desires;
The <hi>Danger</hi> might be <hi>more,</hi> because <hi>They</hi> might fall out also,
as the <hi>other</hi> did before them: But the <hi>Security</hi> is <hi>not,</hi> because
<hi>two Persons</hi> are no more <hi>secure</hi> against <hi>two,</hi> then <hi>one</hi> against <hi>one)</hi>
yet there is more <hi>Imaginable</hi> security, that is, Men will be more
apt to <hi>conceive</hi> and <hi>imagine,</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Stiles</hi> intended and
meant honestly, as equally, and as indifferently to provide for
both their securities, as possibly upon the suddaine he could, in
<hi>this His way;</hi> then They can <hi>imagine</hi> or <hi>conceive,</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> a
<hi>Nokes,</hi> could intend or meane in <hi>that</hi> way of <hi>His.</hi> And yet this
is the way the Parliament will take, or none; Vnlesse they may
have the <hi>whole</hi> Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> put into the hands of such
Persons amongst themselves, whom they shall nominate, They
will not heare of <hi>Peace.</hi> Now if the Nomination of Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
for the <hi>Militia</hi> be deviced, as the fittest Instrument in
order to <hi>security</hi> of Sides, as no doubt it is; reason will, that, as
the <hi>Feares</hi> are equall and reciprocall on both sides, so should the
<hi>securities</hi> be also; And then what reason is there in the world,
that the King should not as well desire the <hi>sole Nomination</hi> of
all the Commissioners of the <hi>Militia,</hi> in order to <hi>His</hi> better
<hi>Security</hi> from <hi>Them;</hi> as that They should desire the <hi>sole No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
of those Commissioners, in order to <hi>their</hi> better <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41398:10"/>
from <hi>Him?</hi> Oh! there is great Reason, they will tell us;
and such a Reason that we little thought on;<note place="margin">Full Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Pag. 92. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. CXXXVI.</note> For <hi>This Power
of the Commissioners,</hi> whom they desire to Nominate, without
the King, <hi>is not to be exercised by them untill a Peace be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Treaty, and then His Majesty will be fully secured
by the Lawes of the Kingdome, and by the duties and affections of
His People.</hi> If I understand ought, the Result of that which
is here said, is this: There are <hi>two</hi> wayes of <hi>securing</hi> both the
King and the Kingdome, when the <hi>Peace</hi> is once setled, from
those mutuall <hi>Feares</hi> and <hi>Iealoufies,</hi> which the one hath of the
other; and they are these: First the <hi>sole and whole Nomination
of such a number of Commissioners,</hi> that shall have <hi>power over all
the Forces of this Kingdome both by Sea and Land:</hi> that is one
way; and Secondly, The <hi>benefit</hi> and <hi>use of the Lawes of the
Land,</hi> together with the <hi>Duties and Affections of the People</hi>
to guard ones Person; that is another way. Now the justest and
most equall way, to divide this <hi>double</hi> Security between <hi>both</hi>
Parties, against their <hi>double</hi> Feares, is this: For <hi>Them</hi> to take
the <hi>Sole Nomination of all Commissioners that shall have Power
over all the Forces of the Kingdome, both by Sea and Land;</hi> and
so secure the Kingdome <hi>this</hi> way: and for <hi>Him</hi> to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the <hi>Lawes of the Land,</hi> and the <hi>Duties and Affections
of His People;</hi> and so secure Himselfe <hi>that</hi> way. But what if
this way be neither just nor equall? I have a just suspition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, which I wish they would remove; For I demand: This
Security, which the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and the <hi>Duties</hi> and
<hi>Affections</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> can give, either it is <hi>greater</hi> then that
other Security, which consists in the <hi>Sole Nomination of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,</hi>
or it is <hi>lesse,</hi> or it is <hi>even,</hi> and as <hi>commensurate</hi> in all
parts and proportions, as any two things can be. That both
these Securities are <hi>equall</hi> on all parts, I believe, they will not
say; because I know, they never measur'd them; for albeit,
they may reckon and number the strength of their <hi>Horses,</hi> and
their <hi>Armes,</hi> yet they may not reckon and number the <hi>Aff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
and <hi>Hearts</hi> of the <hi>People:</hi> or if they have numbred
them, and find them <hi>equall</hi> on all partes; I hope I may say it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
not <hi>Incivility,</hi> and I know They must <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41398:11"/>
two <hi>Equall Securities,</hi> for the King to Choose, and then the
matter is ended. But if they say, it is either <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>lesse,</hi> then
are the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> still in the very same <hi>Insecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Feares,</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> which they were before; and so these
wayes which they have found out for <hi>mutuall securities,</hi> do not
reach their <hi>Ends;</hi> and by consequence are not in reason to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on. For if the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> and the <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the People</hi> be a <hi>lesser</hi> security to the King, then the <hi>sole
nomination of Commissioners</hi> is to the Parliament; then is not
<hi>He</hi> so secure from <hi>Feares</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> from <hi>Them,</hi> as <hi>They</hi> are
from <hi>Him;</hi> And if they be a <hi>greater</hi> security, then are not <hi>they</hi> so
secure from <hi>Feares</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> from <hi>Him,</hi> as <hi>He</hi> is from
<hi>Them</hi> So that, take these wayes how you please, and they must
needs prove either <hi>impossible</hi> or <hi>uselesse; uselesse,</hi> if one of the
securities be <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>lesse</hi> then the other, for then they doe
not equally proportion the <hi>Securities</hi> unto the <hi>Feares: Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
if once they goe about to number the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi>
of the People, and reckon upon them: which commonly the
greater sort of People themselves doe not truely know.</p>
            <p>And as it is against <hi>Reason,</hi> this Demand of Theirs, so is it
against <hi>Law;</hi> The Power of <hi>Warre</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and the Managery
of the <hi>Civill</hi> Sword, being so rivetted and incorporated into the
<hi>Crowne,</hi> by the <hi>Fundamentall Lawes</hi> of this Land, that without
manifest <hi>Alteration</hi> in the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it cannot be distinguished and divided from it. When
They are told of this, They tell us againe; that this Demand of
Theirs, <hi>conteines no such Alteration,</hi> as we speake off,<note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 62. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. LXXV.</note> but <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
that, which by the Wisedome of the Parliaments of both
Kingdomes is judged necessary at this time,</hi> for <hi>the security of His
Majesties Kingdomes, and preservation of the Peace now to be
setled.</hi> But if these words admit of any, they must admit of one
of these foure sences; and let us see, whither any one of them
make a <hi>true Answer</hi> to that which hath been said. For first, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they must meane, that to <hi>have had</hi> a Power, and now to
<hi>have it not,</hi> is no <hi>Alteration,</hi> (and surely that is false; for if a
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>otion from <hi>being such,</hi> to a <hi>not being such;</hi> be a proper <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation,</hi>
as the Philosopher telleth us, it is; Certainly, to <hi>have</hi> the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41398:11"/>
Sole Power of the Sword <hi>in ones handes,</hi> is a <hi>being such;</hi> and to
<hi>have no</hi> Sword in <hi>ones Power,</hi> is a <hi>not being such;</hi> and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
an <hi>Alteration.)</hi> Or Secondly, they must meane, that
such an <hi>Alteration</hi> in the Government of the State, which <hi>both
the Parliaments</hi> of the Kingdome <hi>desire,</hi> is not to be tearm'd an
<hi>Alteration;</hi> (and truely that is true; so long, as <hi>both the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments</hi>
onely <hi>desire it:</hi> but when They <hi>obtaine</hi> that desire, then
it is as perfect an <hi>Alteration,</hi> as if it were made by <hi>Force</hi> and
<hi>Violence:</hi> as a man does as truely loose his money when he is
<hi>cheated,</hi> as he does when he is <hi>rob'd:</hi> and then 'tis false again.)
Or in the third place, Their meaning must be, that, that <hi>Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which is <hi>for the better,</hi> namely, the <hi>preserving of the Peace,</hi>
and <hi>securing of the Kingdomes, and is judged necessary</hi> to that
end, <hi>by the wisedome of both the Parliaments,</hi> that, is not to be
call'd an <hi>Alteration;</hi> (and if the other sense be <hi>false,</hi> this cannot
be <hi>true:</hi> for it is all one, in respect of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of
an Alteration in the <hi>Civill Body,</hi> whither it be done in <hi>Passion,</hi>
and for <hi>the worse,</hi> or in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> and for <hi>the better:</hi> as it is all
one, in regard of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of an Alteration in the
<hi>Naturall Body,</hi> when he that was well the last minute, and is
ill the next, whither he be made so sick, either by his <hi>Surset</hi> or
his <hi>Physicke.)</hi> Or last of all, They must meane, that They doe
not know what an <hi>Alteration</hi> is: (and that may be <hi>True;</hi> but
supposing the <hi>Wisedome of the Parliament,</hi> it were better for
their credit to be <hi>False:)</hi> And then, take these words of theirs,
in any one of these foure sences, which you please, and they
signifie just <hi>nothing</hi> in the way of a <hi>true Answer</hi> to that objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning <hi>Alteration,</hi> which our Commissioners urg'd
them with before; For the words taken in either of the three
first sences, doe indeed containe an <hi>Answer,</hi> but that Answer is
not <hi>Truth:</hi> and taken in the last sence, They may indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a <hi>Truth,</hi> but that Truth is no <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Demand notwithstanding so sencelesse and unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the very <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> receives a new accession
of Insolence, from the <hi>circumstance</hi> of <hi>time:</hi> For (as if their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
could have no <hi>soule,</hi> unlesse that soule were <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</hi>)
First, they desire this nomination of the Commissioners,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41398:12"/>
               <hi>without any limitation or restriction of Time;</hi> and Secondly they
desire it for <hi>seaven yeares</hi> at least,<note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 88. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, CXXXI. 21. <hi>Feb.</hi>
               </note> and after <hi>the expiration of that
tearme, to be setled and exercised in such manner, as shall be agreed
on by His Majestie, and the Two Houses of Parliament in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and by His Majestie, and the Estates of the Parliament in
Scotland, and not otherwise.</hi> So that for these <hi>seaven yeares</hi> it
seems they will proceed with the King, as <hi>God</hi> did with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchad-nezzar</hi>
for his <hi>seaven times;</hi> He shall <hi>converse with
Beasts,</hi> (that is, He shall be no better then any one of the <hi>Beasts

<hi>Rights</hi> all this while being taken from Him; which after
those <hi>seaven yeares,</hi> like <hi>Nebuchad-nezzars</hi> understanding, shall
revert and return safe again unto Him. And is not this a gracious
condescension? Is not this a kind relaxation of the former Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour?
are not these men willing to comply, and to do any thing
for Peace? I will not say that either this <hi>is</hi> a condescension, and
a complying on their parts, or that <hi>nothing is;</hi> but I will say that
either this <hi>was</hi> a condescension and complying on their parts,
or that <hi>nothing was;</hi> for in all those <hi>Twenty dayes</hi> of the <hi>Treaty,</hi>
which should have bin intended by both sides, for reciprocall
abatements of the rigour of their first Desires, They never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
from any <hi>one</hi> part of any <hi>one</hi> of their Propositions, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the particular of this <hi>Limitation;</hi> and <hi>eighteen</hi> of the <hi>twenty
dayes</hi> were full elapsed and expired, before ever they expressed
<hi>that.</hi> But what if these <hi>Oraculous</hi> words of theirs should have
a <hi>double</hi> sense? what if that which we are willing to take, as a

               </hi> should prove a <hi>greater Grievance?</hi> I think if these
words <hi>[And after the expiration of the said tearme, the</hi> Militia
<hi>of the Kingdome to be seiled, and exercised in such manner, as shall
be agreed on by His Majestie and the two Houses of Parliament,
&amp;c.]</hi> be well weigh'd and examined, although they may seem
to return the King, after His <hi>seaven yeares</hi> Apprenticeship,
unto his <hi>Liberty</hi> againe, and as it were make Him <hi>Free,</hi> yet they
will signifie no more in order, to any such true <hi>Freedom,</hi> then in
that old expression of [<hi>For ever and a day</hi>] that <hi>Day,</hi> there sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
in order unto any true <hi>time;</hi> For if the King shall not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
His own Legall Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> when those <hi>seaven
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41398:12"/>
yeares</hi> are expired, <hi>Otherwise,</hi> then by both <hi>Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be agreed on</hi> (as their words expresly say, he shall not)
what is the difference between His condition, during these <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
yeares,</hi> and His condition when those <hi>seaven yeares</hi> shall be
expired, but only in this, that for <hi>seaven yeares</hi> He shall have no
Power <hi>with them;</hi> and after those <hi>seaven yeares</hi> He shall have no
Power <hi>without them;</hi> so that either way He is bereaved of His
<hi>Right;</hi> and for ought I can see yet, more this <hi>last way,</hi> which is
proposed in the way of <hi>Concession,</hi> and <hi>Favour;</hi> then he is, the
<hi>first way,</hi> which is imposed by way of <hi>Oppression</hi> and <hi>Rigour.</hi>
For the King, having no Power <hi>with them,</hi> but being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for <hi>seaven yeares,</hi> from the nomination of Commissioners,
hath thus much of Liberty left him, that he is not oblig'd, either
to <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> to answer for those miscarriages of State, that
shall happen in the mean while, by Persons that may abuse
their Trust; and although he <hi>suffer</hi> something, yet all this
while, he is sure, that He shall <hi>Doe</hi> nothing, <hi>against his owne
will;</hi> But the King having no power <hi>without them,</hi> that is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Power ordered, as it is like to be, when his <hi>Seaven
yeares</hi> are out, by <hi>both His Houses of Parliament, and</hi> [O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERWISE]
<hi>not to be exercised;</hi> may be reduced to this
straite and necessity, that if <hi>both His Houses of Parliament</hi>
shall agree upon some <hi>Person</hi> notoriously disaffected to His
Majesties <hi>Rights</hi> or <hi>Governement,</hi> who thereby, perchance,
shall have merited some marke of His <hi>Displeasure;</hi> The King
notwithstanding, shall be compelled and enforced, to <hi>Doe</hi>
something <hi>against his owne will;</hi> and to set upon such a man a
speciall stampe of <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Favour;</hi> Which indeed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is a piece of <hi>infelicity</hi> then a part of any <hi>Power;</hi> as we
call it <hi>Power</hi> in God, whereby he is able to doe <hi>any</hi> Thing;
and yet, doe not call it <hi>Power</hi> but <hi>Weaknesse,</hi> even in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
if he should be able to <hi>sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having thus extracted all the <hi>Pure Metall</hi> of the
Crowne, by their demands; having thus extenuated and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated
all the Kings Power of <hi>making Warre;</hi> they begin to
bethink themselves, of disposing the <hi>Allay</hi> too, for their best
advantage; They will not leave Him, so much, as a Power
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41398:13"/>
neither, of <hi>Making Peace.</hi> For they demand, <hi>That the Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <hi>and all Treaties with the Rebells, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of both Houses of Parliament be pronounced voyde;</hi> And
<hi>that the Prosecution of the Warre in Ireland, be setled in both
Houses of Parliament, to be managed by the joynt advice of both
the Kingdomes:</hi> Good God! That these ill men should not be
content to rob their King of all His <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Royalty;</hi> that
they should not be content to render Him no <hi>True King;</hi> But
their petulant insolence must attempt His very <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty;</hi>
But they must attempt to render Him no <hi>True Man?</hi>
As if they had a purpose to constraine Him, to a needlesse
<hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Promise</hi> now; that with more colour, and better
credit, hereafter, they might <hi>distrust</hi> Him; as they report of the
daughter of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> who was first purposely <hi>ravisht,</hi> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wards, she might be put to <hi>death;</hi> because being a <hi>Virgin,</hi> by
the Law she could not <hi>suffer?</hi> For this particular demand of
<hi>making the Cessation voide,</hi> was made in the moneth of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
last; and that very <hi>Cessation voyded</hi> of it selfe, expired in the
Moneth of <hi>March;</hi> Now if the Kings Commissioners had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to the latter part of this Demand, <hi>the setling of the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Warre in both Houses of Parliament,</hi> for the time
to come; what could the voyding of this <hi>Cessation</hi> contribute
to the current of their <hi>designe</hi> (but onely by way of scandalous
<hi>Reflexion</hi> upon His Majesties <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Promise</hi>)
when that <hi>Cessation</hi> would voyd it selfe, would exhale and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of it selfe, before ever those <hi>Designes</hi> of theirs could be
ripe for any prosecution?</p>
            <p>I confesse, when I look well upon it, me thinkes the true
state of this question, concerning the <hi>Irish Cessation,</hi> is the
same with the state of that question in <hi>Plutarke,</hi> concerning
<hi>Demonides</hi> his <hi>shooes. Demonides</hi> was a lame impotent man,
and therefore had his <hi>shooes</hi> made very <hi>wide</hi> and <hi>easy</hi> for his
feet; Those <hi>shooes,</hi> when a cunning youth had stolne one day
from him, and some of his neighbours comming in, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to extenuate and alleviate his Losse, that he might be the
lesse affected with it, had told him, that they were but a <hi>scurvy</hi>
paire of <hi>clouterly</hi> shooes, and very <hi>naughtily</hi> made; <hi>Demonides</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41398:13"/>
replyed, that the <hi>shooes</hi> indeed, were no very <hi>good shooes;</hi> but
they were <hi>very good shooes</hi> for <hi>Demonides,</hi> because a better
paire would not have fitted his sore feet halfe so well. In like
manner, it may be said of this <hi>Cessation;</hi> That indeed, it was no
<hi>very good</hi> Cessation; because peradventure other <hi>Cessations</hi>
heretofore, have been made, according to the more punctuall
Rules of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Advantage:</hi> But it was a <hi>very good Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for <hi>Ireland;</hi> because the condition of her infirmity was
such, that she could admit no <hi>better.</hi> For when the Chiefe <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices</hi>
and <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> when the chiefe <hi>Commanders</hi> and
<hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Campe,</hi> when both of them shall complaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King, of the miserable condition and posture of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
for very <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Food;</hi> and advertise Him, by their Letters,
of her present inabilities to maintaine the prosecution of a
<hi>Warre;</hi> what could the King doe more, in discharge of His
duty both to God and Man, then to admit of a <hi>Cessation,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to a present <hi>Peace?</hi> The <hi>Houses of Parliament</hi> it seems
would not help them <hi>at all;</hi> (for after <hi>Six months</hi> expectation,
they send them provision of Victualls, for some <hi>Seaven daies,</hi>
as if they purposed a <hi>scorne</hi> to the Miseries of their poore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
rather then a <hi>succour.</hi>) And the King could not help
them <hi>better,</hi> then by giving his <hi>Approbation</hi> to a <hi>Cessation,</hi>
which the Publique <hi>Ministers</hi> of the State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and assented to, there, as fittest for the present condition
of that Kingdome; and so shew Himselfe, at least <hi>willing</hi> to
<hi>Respite</hi> that Cause as well as He could, which He well knew
himselfe <hi>unable,</hi> to <hi>Revenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>in Inducijs Bellum manet, quamvis Pugna cesset,</hi> say our
Books; So long as the Parties ingaged in a Warre, proceed no
further then <hi>Cessations,</hi> and <hi>Truces</hi> for a time, There is only a
<hi>suspension</hi> of the <hi>Fight,</hi> there is no <hi>suffocation</hi> of the <hi>Quarrell;</hi>
which may better be resum'd again, when they that manage
it, shall have out-grown those necessities and encombrances,
which compell'd them first unto it: so that if this <hi>Cessation</hi> were
Destructive to either of the Parties, it is most like to be so to the
<hi>Rebels;</hi> who were not in that visible Distresse, and want of all
sort of Provision, as the <hi>Protestant</hi> party was; and if the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41398:14"/>
of the <hi>protestants</hi> were the <hi>worse</hi> condition when the <hi>Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
began,</hi> because the actuall necessities of both sides were
<hi>unequall,</hi> and <hi>We</hi> wanted more then <hi>They;</hi> certainly the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Rebels</hi> cannot be the <hi>better</hi> condition, when the
Cessation shall <hi>end;</hi> because the possible supplies of both sides
must be confessed <hi>equall,</hi> and <hi>They</hi> can be no more releiv'd, then
<hi>We.</hi> Notwithstanding all this, this <hi>Cessation of Ireland</hi> is explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and exclaim'd against by both Houses of Parliament, as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to His Maiesties good Subiects,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 99. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. CXLV.</note> 
               <hi>and to the Protestant
Religion, and only for the advantage of the Popish Rebels.</hi> Indeed
I do read, that there may be <hi>Destruction</hi> in a <hi>Cessation;</hi> for the
Prophet <hi>David</hi> calling all men to behold the works of the
Lord, and what <hi>destruction he hath wrought upon the earth;</hi> in
the 46 <hi>Psalme;</hi> makes his first instance in the poynt of a <hi>Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in the next words that follow, <hi>He maketh Warrs to cease.
vers.</hi> 9. But the Prophet had a <hi>Mysticall</hi> meaning in his words;
and so no doubt have They; For surely they mean that a <hi>Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is <hi>destructive</hi> to the good Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> just in the
very same sense, that the <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Victuals</hi> is a <hi>Preservative</hi> for
them; and, if that be not a <hi>mysticall</hi> sence, I know not what is.
But if these men would speak plaine, they would say, That this
<hi>Cessation</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> is <hi>Destructive to His Majesties ill Subjects</hi>
here in <hi>England,</hi> who cannot have that convenient colour
now, to raise <hi>Forces</hi> and levy <hi>Monies,</hi> for the suppression of a
Rebellion <hi>there;</hi> which <hi>Monies</hi> and <hi>Forces,</hi> they may convert,
(as heretofore too often they have done) to the feeding and
fomenting of their own Rebellion <hi>here.</hi> And this is evidently
the Reason, why they so desire a <hi>prosecution of the Warre in
Ireland,</hi> and demand the settlement of that <hi>Prosecution</hi> in their
own hands; that having once a Power, of impropriating all the
Succours of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to their own Rebellious ends and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
they may with better advantage, mannage the Warre here
in England, against the King; when they shall have <hi>Two</hi>
swords for His <hi>One;</hi> and may fight against Him, not only with
His <hi>Enemies,</hi> but with His <hi>Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if <hi>both Houses of Parliament,</hi> intended only the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Iustice upon those accursed Rebells, and not some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41398:14"/>
ends of their own, no lesse accursed then they, (for the
grounds of all Rebellions are alike; and if there be <hi>any</hi> just
ground for <hi>one, no</hi> ground is unjust, that is laid for any <hi>other</hi>)
Certainly the King would be thought on, as a fitter instrument
of execution, (whither He be considered as <hi>King,</hi> or as <hi>one
single</hi> Person, who can have but <hi>one will,</hi> and so cannot differ
from himselfe) then a <hi>collected</hi> body, made out of <hi>many Persons</hi>
of two Kingdoms, (those of each Kingdom having a <hi>negative
voyce</hi>) who thereby may have <hi>Two</hi> willes, and so differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves; whereby the main businesse must needs
receive obstruction. Neither does that avoid this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which these men say; namely,<note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 120. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. CLXXIV.</note> That <hi>in case of any disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
in the Committee, the two Houses of Parliament are to
prosecute that Warre;</hi> unlesse they can imagine any man so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as not to think it as possible for the two <hi>Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to disagree, as for <hi>one</hi> Committee; Besides, when the
Parliament had a mind to settle the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for the
preservation of the Peace, in the hands of some Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of their own naming, and would exclude the King, from
so much as the nomination of any one amongst them; They
give this, as a reason of their desire;<note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 92 n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. CXXXVI. 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Feb.</note> 
               <hi>That is the Commissioners
should be severally named, as the King would have had them;
probably they would have acted according to their severall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
and the warre thereby would be more easily revived;</hi> And is
it not as probable now, if the prosecution of the Warre in
<hi>Ireland</hi> should be setled in a Committee of two severall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the Persons of that Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
should have <hi>severall interests,</hi> and ends in the carrying on
of that Warre, according to their severall <hi>Necessities</hi> or <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and so what <hi>one</hi> aymes at, as a <hi>Conversion,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> may
intend, as <hi>Conquest?</hi> by which meanes, the Warre either will
be <hi>retarded,</hi> or, which is worse, <hi>exchanged?</hi> I doe not asperse ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the two Nations with the unworthinesse of these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes;
But I must needs say this: When a great mans House is on
Fire, which he is able to quench, with the servants help of his
own Family, and yet strangers will be pressing in whether he
will or no; It is an even wager, if <hi>Two</hi> men come in together
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41398:15"/>
to <hi>Helpe;</hi> but <hi>One</hi> of them comes to <hi>Steale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this <hi>Committee of both Kingdoms</hi> should have but <hi>one</hi> and
the <hi>same end,</hi> and that end, a good one. The quenching of the
Fire of that Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the reducing of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Kingdome to His Majesties Obedience: yet certainly,
reason would not, that the <hi>prosecution</hi> of such a good end, should
be put into the hands of such <hi>State-Empericks,</hi> who will goe
about to cure a burnt Finger, by putting it into another Fire:
who thinke to quench the flames of that Rebellion <hi>there,</hi> by
blowing up a greater Rebellion <hi>here.</hi> And let no man wonder,
that I call this Rebellion a <hi>greater:</hi> For as the <hi>Casuists</hi> use to
say, That, when a man Sweares, <hi>the greater</hi> the subject-matter
of his Oath is, the <hi>lesse</hi> is the sinne: So doe I say, That, when a
man Rebels, the <hi>better</hi> his Ground is, whither it be <hi>Religion</hi> or
<hi>Gods Glory,</hi> the <hi>worse</hi> is his Rebellion: because he goes about
to lay that for a <hi>Foundation,</hi> which will never incorporate with
any part of the <hi>Superstructure</hi> or <hi>Building.</hi> Nay, further then
all this: If it should please God to give these men the grace of
true Repentance, so that they should detest this unnaturall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<hi>here;</hi> and with unfeigned hearts should set themselves
to the extirpation and rooting out of that Rebellion <hi>there;</hi> yet,
in reason, were not the <hi>prosecution of that Warre,</hi> to be put into
their handes, even then; because, in the <hi>Traverses</hi> of an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Warre,</hi> In those ordinary <hi>reciprocations</hi> and <hi>returnes</hi> of
<hi>Fortune;</hi> In those <hi>ebbings</hi> and <hi>flowings</hi> of Successe, which are
not the <hi>lesse naturall</hi> to great Enterprizes, because, <hi>lesse certain:</hi>
There will fall out many particular emergent occasions, both
for <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Councell, quae, non dum fiunt laudentur, sed cum
facta sunt,</hi> as the <hi>Oratour</hi> speaks: The <hi>Successe</hi> whereof, will
much depend upon the <hi>Secrecy:</hi> and the greatest commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that can be given the <hi>doing</hi> of them, is, that they are already
<hi>done.</hi> Which Councells can never runne so cleare through a
<hi>Sive,</hi> as through a <hi>Pipe:</hi> where, <hi>many</hi> Heads have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing
thereof, as where, but <hi>one.</hi> And therefore it was not
a piece of <hi>Pride</hi> but <hi>Policy,</hi> in that great States-man, who would
usually debate all his Designes of Warre amongst his Councell;
but then, would be sure never to follow that Advice, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41398:15"/>
generally was accounted for the <hi>best:</hi> because by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he had observ'd, that a <hi>lesse Expedient,</hi> accompanied with
<hi>secrecy</hi> and <hi>silence,</hi> operated more in the wayes of <hi>Advantage;</hi>
then a <hi>greater Expedient,</hi> expos'd to common <hi>observation</hi> and
<hi>knowledge.</hi> And then let all the World Iudge, whither it stand
with ordinary <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> to commit the <hi>prosecution
of a Warre</hi> to their Hands, who doe now manage an Actuall
Warre against their owne Prince, and are in open Rebellion
against Him; which ordinary <hi>Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Discretion</hi> would
not entrust them with (as being a <hi>Multitude</hi>) if They should
returne to their Subjection and Obedience.</p>
            <p>IV. In the last place, observe their <hi>inexorable obduration</hi>
and <hi>deafnesse</hi> against all <hi>enlargement, prorogation,</hi> or <hi>reviging</hi> of
the <hi>Treaty.</hi> For being importun'd by the King Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for an <hi>Addition</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> (that so, as they might <hi>give</hi> Fuller
Answers to those Propositions of the Parliament if there were
occasion; so they might hope to <hi>receive</hi> some kind of Answer
to those Propositions of the King: of which some, received <hi>no
direct</hi> Answer, and some, <hi>no Answer at all.</hi>) They kept them
still in suspence, till the very <hi>Twentieth Day,</hi> that Day, when
the Treaty was to break up, before ever They would give
them Answer: And then they tell them,<note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 148. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. CXCV.</note> 
               <hi>That their Lordships
having not given full and satisfactory answers concerning</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>the</hi> Militia, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>They cannot for those reasons expect
an Addition of Time:</hi> (A man would thinke, they should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have given more time in hope of <hi>Fuller Answers:</hi> speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
having nothing else to doe, but to receive the Homage of
our Commissioners, as if they had come rather to <hi>keep</hi> a <hi>Court,</hi>
then to <hi>speed</hi> a <hi>Commission.</hi>) Neither <hi>have they received any
Instructions to continue this Treaty any longer then the Twenty
Dayes, of which this is the last.</hi> Oh! the torment of having an
ill <hi>Conscience,</hi> and hearing <hi>Reason!</hi> I dare say, never was any
Cheater in the Pillory, gladder to see the <hi>Iudges</hi> come from
<hi>Westminster,</hi> then these ill men were to s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the <hi>Twentieth Day,</hi>
that was to redeem them from the cruelties of a convinced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding!
And yet, as your ordinary Players, when they
cannot play that Comedy which was intended, because some
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41398:16"/>
of their principall men of partes are drunke: will lay the fault
on the Spectators, and say, the <hi>House</hi> or <hi>Galleries</hi> are not full:
So these <hi>Actors</hi> of a <hi>Peace;</hi> when they durst not continue the
<hi>Treaty</hi> any longer, because of those Overtures that were made
by our Commissioners concerning a <hi>Cessation,</hi> concerning the
<hi>Kings Returne to Westminster,</hi> and concerning a present <hi>disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of both Armies,</hi> the very steame and ayre whereof, was
able to turne the braines of this Rebellion, and to make it stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
They tell our Commissioners, that it seemes <hi>We had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that the Treaty should end with the Twenty Dayes;</hi>

<hi>meanes to continue it, being so well knowne to be, a good Progresse
in the Propositions for</hi> Religion, <hi>the</hi> Militia, <hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>wherein
they cannot find any satisfaction that was intended by Vs to be
agreed unto.</hi> But when (as any man would imagine) did they
tell them this? Truely just, when the last instant of the <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Dayes</hi> was now expired; After Twelve a clock at night;
when They were sure no <hi>Answer</hi> could be given, <hi>as part of
the Treaty,</hi> without their Consent; As if the Rules of <hi>Treating</hi>
were like those of <hi>Scolding,</hi> and the simple World must needs
imagine, that because They had the <hi>last Word,</hi> They had the <hi>best
Cause.</hi> I must professe ingenuously, when I met with this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and compar'd it with the <hi>drolleryes</hi> of many of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Papers,</hi> where meere <hi>Fumes</hi> are maintain'd like <hi>Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi>
and so much <hi>Reason,</hi> as will hardly make a cracker, is
mounted like some whole piece of <hi>Canon,</hi> that must sweep and
carry all before it; I could not, on the suddain, satisfie my selfe,
whither I were reading <hi>Solids</hi> or <hi>Phancies;</hi> whither I had
met with a <hi>Relation</hi> or a <hi>Romance.</hi> I could never heare any
thing of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> but me thoughts, it sounded like the
report of some <hi>Enchanted Castle,</hi> which every <hi>Knight</hi> is bound
by his Adventure to <hi>seeke,</hi> but knowes not where to <hi>find:</hi> For
their Commissioners urge and presse Our Commissioners, ever
and anon <hi>unto it:</hi> and yet never so much as offer them any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Idea,</hi> visible <hi>Forme,</hi> or <hi>Representation</hi> thereof, whereby
they might be enabled to passe their Iudgement and Opinion
<hi>of it.</hi> I never could read their Papers concerning <hi>Episcopacy,</hi>
but me thoughts, it lookt, like to some strange <hi>Blacke-Knight,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41398:16"/>
that was much afflicted and oppressed, but <hi>no body could know
the Cause:</hi> for I saw plainly, They were resolv'd to ruine it,
<hi>though they had no Reason.</hi> And then, let the ground be never so
disadvantagious, the Weapons never so unequall, the Quarrell
never so unjust, or the Designe never so impossible: I found
that the <hi>Knight</hi> did ever <hi>kill</hi> the <hi>Giant,</hi> as in all <hi>Romances,</hi> He is
wont to doe: For let the Proposition be against <hi>Law,</hi> let it be
against <hi>Reason,</hi> nay, let it be against <hi>Religion,</hi> all is one for that:
and the <hi>Parliament</hi> is sure to have the better of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But did Our Commissioners make no <hi>good Progresse</hi> in their
three Propositions as these men pretend? First, it is evident,
<hi>We</hi> proceeded farther in <hi>Their</hi> Propositions, then <hi>They</hi> did in
<hi>Ours;</hi> for, apprehending the businesse of that Meeting in its
true and proper notion, as being intended rather for a <hi>triall of
Iudgements,</hi> then a <hi>tickling of Humours,</hi> Our Commissioners
never returned Answer to their Papers, but such as was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and made up of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience, Iustice</hi> and <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
which of necessity must satisfie, either wife men or good;
whereas They rather gave <hi>Excuses</hi> then <hi>Answers,</hi> when They
did give any; and sometimes They would not give so much as
that: which I think was so farre from being <hi>Satisfactory,</hi> that
it was not <hi>Civill.</hi> And doe these men accuse us of breaking up
the Treaty by our <hi>ill Progresse</hi> in their Propositions; when We
had Propositions, (which They were to <hi>Treat</hi> on as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Tenour of their own <hi>Commission,</hi>) wherein not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
They made not so much as <hi>any kind of progresse</hi>
at all? Secondly, We conceive, (and so We doubt not but the
wiser world will,) that the Commissioners on both sides, were
to be reckoned on as <hi>Parties,</hi> who were mutually to make up
this <hi>good progresse</hi> between them, by their complying and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating
Hands; and not as <hi>Iudges</hi> for the <hi>one</hi> side to determine,
whether that <hi>were good</hi> or no, which the <hi>other</hi> side had made;
and therefore we think, there is no more reason on the one side,
why our Progresse on Their Propositions should be reckoned
and accounted <hi>no good Progresse,</hi> because <hi>They</hi> say <hi>it is not;</hi>
Then there is on the other side, why it should not be reckoned
and accounted a <hi>good Progresse,</hi> because <hi>We</hi> say <hi>it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:41398:17"/>They find themselves a little pinch't with this; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
They produce a Reason against our <hi>good Progresse,</hi> which
they doubt not, but will satisfie the World, (Then, truly must
they serve the World, as they serv'd Vs at <hi>Vxbridge:</hi> suffer it
onely to receive a <hi>Paper,</hi> and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not suffer it to Returne an
<hi>Answer;</hi> for otherwise, there is roome enough for a <hi>Reply.</hi>)
And that reason, is this: that, <hi>For Religion We granted them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
litle or nothing but what already They were in possession of by
the Lawes of this Kingdome.</hi> Should this which they alleadge
be true, certainly this were a strange Argument against us, to
prove, that we made no <hi>good Progresse</hi> in their Propositions,
because we <hi>granted little or nothing, but what they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in possession of by Law;</hi> For, if the defence of their <hi>Lawes,</hi>
was one of the chiefe ingredients that made the <hi>Warre,</hi> (as out
of doubt it was; and foure yeares agoe, what other language did
they speake? wherefore did they take up Armes, but for the
<hi>maintenance</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> their <hi>Liberties,</hi> and their <hi>Lawes?</hi>)
Assuredly, the bare Concession of the free use and benefit of
those <hi>Lawes,</hi> is a signe of faire progression in the way to <hi>Peace.</hi>
He that should have told the Souldier when he first took up
Armes, that he was to fight for the making of <hi>New</hi> Lawes, and
not for the maintaining of the <hi>Old,</hi> would, I believe, have found
but very cold <hi>Musters;</hi> But in few yeares, see, to what a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of sinne</hi> these Men are growne; At first, They took
up their Armes to compell and force the King <hi>to keep the
Lawes;</hi> and now, They are resolv'd by like, never to lay them
downe againe, if He will not <hi>Break them.</hi> It is one of the Kings
<hi>Propositions</hi> offered to them,<note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 18. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. VIII.</note> That <hi>whatsoever hath been done
contrary to the knowne Lawes of the Kingdome, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
and recalled:</hi> and I dare presume, His Majesty would
allow that for a <hi>good Progresse</hi> upon His Propositions, if the
Parliament would but grant Him <hi>that;</hi> nay, He would aske no
more; He would repose Himselfe in <hi>that,</hi> as the sole <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement</hi>
of His Desires; and yet, that very thing which the King
would be contented to rely and rest on, as upon <hi>His End;</hi>
namely, That <hi>nothing should be done contrary to the knowne esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht
Law of this Land;</hi> That, will not the Parliament accept
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41398:17"/>
of in the condition of a <hi>good Progresse,</hi> onely bending and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto. Truely, this <hi>Allegation</hi> of theirs, is so full of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that I could almost wish it True: that is, I could wish
our Commissioners had <hi>not granted them,</hi> so much as <hi>very little,</hi>
but had granted them entirely <hi>nothing at all,</hi> but what they are
in <hi>possession of already by Law;</hi> because I cannot well see, how
they could grant it. But, what if all this which they alleadge
be false? What if our Commissioners were so farre from gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them <hi>very little,</hi> but <hi>what they were in possession of already
by Law,</hi> that they granted them <hi>very much?</hi> What if those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Concessions, which <hi>were never yet</hi> established by Law,
were <hi>more</hi> then those which <hi>were?</hi> Nay, what if it evidently
be made appeare, that they never were by <hi>Law of the Land</hi> in
possession of any the least of those <hi>Concessions,</hi> which our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
offered unto them? I am so charitable in conceiving
these men may have some Flesh in their Foreheads, that I hope
the <hi>Scotsh</hi> Commissioners (who must be a little <hi>excus'd</hi> for <hi>not</hi>
being <hi>Acquainted</hi> with our Lawes, unlesse they had rather be
<hi>accus'd</hi> for their <hi>Acquaintance</hi>) had the penning of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that was the <hi>Stopple</hi> of the Treaty; because, although the
words be <hi>English,</hi> yet the sence, is <hi>Scotsh;</hi> But out of all doubt,
there is not greater evidence of Light, then of this Truth; That
of all those nine or ten <hi>Concessions</hi> which our Commissioners
offered, upon the point of <hi>Religion,</hi> in the way of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Advancement of a blessed Peace; There were none of
them, but were the <hi>Spawnes</hi> of so many <hi>New Lawes:</hi> There
was not one of them, to which the Church, and Church-men
were heretofore oblig'd, by any known established Law of the
Kingdome, whatsoever. And now let all men Iudge of their
<hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>other</hi> Testimonies, which cannot easily be reduc't to
a convenient Teste: who dare thus abuse the World with
<hi>Falshhood</hi> in <hi>This,</hi> which lyes so open and obnoxious to a plaine
and ordinary Tryall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the <hi>Militia,</hi> they say,<note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 155. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. CXCVII.</note> We made no <hi>good
Progresse</hi> therein, and therefore <hi>were resolv'd,</hi> it seemes, the
<hi>Treaty should break up;</hi> Because We <hi>thought it not fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to any one of their Demandes, but made some new Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41398:18"/>
of our owne, which were not in any degree sufficient for
the setling and securing of the Peace of both the Kingdomes.</hi> I
did ever thinke, till now, that it was one thing to make a
<hi>Progresse,</hi> and another thing, to make an <hi>End:</hi> Doe they say,
We made no <hi>good Progresse</hi> in the <hi>Militia,</hi> because We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
not unto their <hi>whole Demands?</hi> They might altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as properly say, that a Country-man travailing towards
<hi>London,</hi> hath made no <hi>good Progresse</hi> in his Iourney; because,
He is not come as yet, to <hi>Charing-Crosse.</hi> Questionlesse a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
is made on their Demandes, when We Consent, but
unto any <hi>part</hi> thereof; and the <hi>better</hi> that <hi>part</hi> is, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to, the <hi>better</hi> is the <hi>Progresse.</hi> Now, if <hi>halfe</hi> of any
Thing be a good <hi>part,</hi> then is our Progresse upon their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
a <hi>good Progresse;</hi> for We consented to the one <hi>halfe</hi>
of every thing that was required. They demanded the Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of <hi>all</hi> the Commissioners: and We granted them the
Nomination of <hi>halfe;</hi> They demanded the <hi>Militia</hi> for <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
yeares:</hi> and We would have given them it, for <hi>Three.</hi>
But I perceive, He grants them <hi>nothing,</hi> that does not grant
them <hi>all;</hi> and it fares with the Parliaments <hi>Demands,</hi> as some
report it does, in the fortunate Ilands of <hi>Arabia,</hi> with the
People <hi>Dayes;</hi> They know not what belongs to <hi>dawning:</hi>
They never see Day, till the <hi>whole</hi> Sunne appears unto them.</p>
            <p>Besides, if Our Commissioners had made no better <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse,</hi>
then They pretend: if We had exhausted all those
<hi>Twenty Dayes</hi> assigned for the Treating upon Their Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in meere <hi>Tergiversation</hi> and <hi>Cavill:</hi> if We had <hi>denyed</hi>
Our <hi>Assent</hi> to all their Demands, and then had been never
able to make good any colourable Reason for that Our <hi>Denyall;</hi>
yet certainly, Their Originall <hi>Commission</hi> having a kind of
<hi>Counter part,</hi> and they being authorized to Treat upon those
<hi>Three Propositions</hi> offered by <hi>Vs</hi> to <hi>Them:</hi> as well, as upon
these other <hi>Three,</hi> offered by <hi>Them</hi> to <hi>Vs:</hi> Reason and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would, that an <hi>equall</hi> number of <hi>Propositions,</hi> should have
been allow'd an <hi>equall</hi> number of <hi>Dayes:</hi> and then, if the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
and Issues of both, had happily falne out equally unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
yet, no one side could have had just cause for to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41398:18"/>
of the partiall and uneven proceedings of the other.
And although We doe not urge it, as an Argument of <hi>Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
and <hi>Pride,</hi> that Their Propositions must be Treated on,
<hi>in the first place,</hi> before the Kings; yet, when the pretence
of Our <hi>ill Progresse</hi> upon <hi>Theirs,</hi> is made a Reason of their <hi>no
Progresse</hi> at all on <hi>Ours:</hi> We cannot but look upon this <hi>Order</hi>
and <hi>Disposall</hi> of the <hi>partes,</hi> as an Argument of great <hi>Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,</hi>
against a <hi>Peace:</hi> and which hath somewhat of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of an Affected and Studyed <hi>Obstruction,</hi> cast in the wayes
thereof. For those <hi>Three Propositions</hi> of <hi>Theirs,</hi> if They had
been denyed at <hi>Vxbridge;</hi> yet, they might have been granted
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in a Full and Free Convention of Parliament;
out of which I know not well, indeed, how They could be
granted. But <hi>these Three Propositions</hi> of <hi>Ours,</hi> They, cannot be
granted at <hi>Westminster,</hi> if They be denyed at <hi>Vxbridge:</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
you thinke it fit to perswade <hi>one</hi> man to lay downe the
Bucklers, whilest <hi>another</hi> beats him. The Kings Proposition
for a present <hi>Cessation</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> could not be setled, but <hi>in</hi> a
<hi>Treatie;</hi> The Parliaments Proposition against the <hi>Cessation</hi>
which was already past, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> might be setled, <hi>out</hi> of it;
and yet, so inraged &amp; incensed are these men against that Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<hi>there;</hi> that they will not endure the mention of any
thing that sounds like it, <hi>here;</hi> as that impetuous <hi>Emperour,</hi>
who, by witchcraft having learnt <hi>three letters</hi> of His name,
that was afterwards to Succeed him; put every man to death
whom he could lay hands on, that had those <hi>three letters,</hi> for
the beginning of his Name. His Majesties <hi>Returne to West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
(which Our Commissioners desired in the second
place) could not be <hi>Safe,</hi> but as both Sides agree, <hi>before He
commes:</hi> But <hi>Episcopacy</hi> (which their Commissioners desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to have abolisht) could not be, but <hi>unsafe,</hi> even <hi>after his
comming:</hi> for if there be just Reason to take it away, <hi>now;</hi>
there will be reason, <hi>then.</hi> And yet, so transported are they,
with a passionate and eager pursuit of a thing, in the perswasion
whereof <hi>both Parties</hi> professe they <hi>differ:</hi> that they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Discourse, or <hi>Treat</hi> of another thing, wherein <hi>both Sides</hi>
professe before hand, that They doe <hi>agree.</hi> Both <hi>Armies</hi> cannot
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41398:19"/>
be <hi>Disbanded</hi> (according to that Demand of Ours) but <hi>before</hi>
the King and Parliament doe <hi>meet:</hi> but the Power of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi>
may be setled (according to that Demand of Theirs)
<hi>after</hi> that <hi>Meeting;</hi> and indeed, there is but little reason, that
this Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> should now come in <hi>projection</hi> in
these <hi>Times of Warre:</hi> which must lye <hi>Dormant,</hi> as Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
confesse, and not be put in <hi>Execution,</hi> till the <hi>Time of
Peace.</hi> And yet, so violent are these Men in setling of a <hi>Power,</hi>
which <hi>must not be exercis'd,</hi> but in the Time of <hi>Peace;</hi> That
they will heare of no course, that may be taken in the meane
time, for <hi>dissolving</hi> of the <hi>Warre:</hi> like ordinary People in a
Croude; that will make such hast, <hi>every man</hi> to get <hi>first</hi> out
of dores, that <hi>no man</hi> stirres. So that, upon viewing of the
whole matter, We can cast all these obstacles and Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the wayes of <hi>Peace,</hi> that arose out of this perverse
Method of handling the Propositions, into no other Mould,
but this; That They, <hi>never intending to conclude a Peace,</hi>
resolved in the first place to Treat of <hi>Their</hi> Propositions, which
they knew, no man with <hi>Honesty</hi> or <hi>Conscience</hi> could <hi>Grant;</hi>
That, in the second place, they might with better colour avoyd
the Treating upon <hi>Our</hi> Propositions, which they knew, no man
with <hi>Conscience</hi> or <hi>Honesty,</hi> could offer to <hi>Deny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, if all this which hath bin said, be not enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
with men of common understanding, that these <hi>Rebels</hi>
never did <hi>intend a Peace,</hi> but that they purpose to make this
Warre, which at first was their <hi>Necessity,</hi> now, become their
<hi>Trade</hi> (for too many of them know not how to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it) yet this <hi>One Consideration</hi> is sufficient to enforce them
to beleife, if they will but weigh it well, and that is this: That,
They never would allow the <hi>Tender</hi> and <hi>Offer</hi> of all those
things, for Overtures of <hi>Peace;</hi> the <hi>Stoppe</hi> and <hi>Obstruction</hi>
whereof, they themselves, ever professed, till now, was the
greatest <hi>Incentive</hi> and <hi>Occasion</hi> of the <hi>Warre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They took up Armes, for the <hi>Liberty of the Subject;</hi> to
vindicate and to recover <hi>that;</hi> and yet, in all this Treaty, they
never let fall so much as any one <hi>word</hi> or <hi>sillable,</hi> tending or
bending <hi>thereunto.</hi> They did well to set those words, [<hi>The
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41398:19"/>
Liberty of the Subject</hi>] in their <hi>Banners,</hi> so as they did; For all
the World cannot but see, that they meant it for a <hi>Flourish;</hi>
For, when the Kings Commissioners urged and pressed this
point, of the <hi>Liberty of the Subject</hi> in many severall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and desired,<note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 18. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. VIII. Prop. 3.</note> that <hi>all illegall Power used over the Subject, as
imprisoning, or putting him to death without Lawe; stopping
of his</hi> Habeas Corpus, <hi>and imposing upon his Estate, without
Act of Parliament</hi> (the very grievance, which these men
heretofore possest the World they labour'd under; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
urg'd them to take up Armes, that so they might redresse
them) <hi>should from henceforth be utterly disclaimed;</hi> They
would never so much as admit of any Treaty thereof, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
any colourable Answer concerning it.</p>
            <p>They took up Armes for <hi>Defence</hi> of their <hi>Religion;</hi> And
yet, in all the <hi>Twenty daies</hi> of this whole <hi>Treaty,</hi> were never
able to produce any <hi>one</hi> Article of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> avowed and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> wherein that Church had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
either from the <hi>Truth,</hi> or from <hi>Her selfe:</hi> And for points
of <hi>Discipline;</hi> when the King offer'd in His Propositions, all
<hi>ease</hi> to <hi>tender Consciences, in such particulars as should be agreed
on by a Nationall Synod legall called;</hi> They would never heare
thereof; but, put off the <hi>Treating</hi> of that Proposition, as they
did the rest, with this uncivill Answer;<note place="margin">Full Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 141. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. CLXXXIV.</note> That, <hi>when the Houses
of Parliament shall be satisfied in the good progresse of the Treaty
upon their Propositions, concerning</hi> Religion, <hi>the</hi> Militia, <hi>and</hi>
Ireland, <hi>they will give time for the Treaty upon these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

they were resolved before hand, both to be <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi>
as already hath appeared.</p>
            <p>They have raised severall Armies, upon this very reason
and ground, <hi>To bring the King</hi> (whom they pretended to be
