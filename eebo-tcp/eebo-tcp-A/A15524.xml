            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HEaring by iust and certaine report, not of a few, what work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and effect my meane labours at the Funerall of your FATHER (that graue and godly Minister of Christ) had, through Gods blessing, in the hearts of sundry, and very many

hearers, that houre in great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies assembled: and being once and againe, by writing and word, earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly solicited to copie out that SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON which I vttered by helpe of memory, without any benefite of Notes, through straightnes of time, and store of businesse: I condiscend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against all thought and purpose on my part (when I first conceiued, and was deliuered of this lesse then nine houres birth) not onely to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie it out and put it in paper, for the priuate vse of some; but to commit it to the Presse, for the more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good of many, which were not present auditors: Euery good thing being so much the better the more common it is; and writing being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned of GOD to be a meane of the teaching of his Church, as well as liuely voyce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1941:3"/>Now, after I entred this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vpon these grounds, to whom could I more fitly dedicate it then to your selues, his nine CHILDREN, whom towards his last breath hee did as earnestly couet to make you heyres of his graces, as of his goods? Pictures serue to put vs in minde of our friends departed; so let this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and testimony giuen him at the preaching of it, be to you a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of your good Father, who left behinde him much more good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to imitate, then goods to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy: yet of earthly substance so much as may witnesse how greatly God had blessed him with worldly and spirituall blessings, with the dew of heauen, as well as with grace from heauen.</p>
            <p>Walke carefully in his steps: thinke it to be your greatest shame to degenerate, and your chiefest
<pb facs="tcp:1941:4"/>
commendation to resemble him. As hee before his death prouided for foure of you Flockes to feede, fields to sowe, houses to build; so like good shepheards attend the flockes whereof the holy Ghost hath made you ouerseers, and which Christ hath purchased with his own bloud. Let not such a rich prize perish through your negligence and sloath, but as scribes, taught to the kingdome of God, store vp old and new things in aboundance, which you may draw out to refresh the tender Lambes and deare sheepe of Christ: Withall, like good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen prouide pure and good seede, which you may scatter in the morning and in the euening, in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and out of season; for yee know not which will prosper. Finally, as skilfull builders, lay no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation then that which is layd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<pb facs="tcp:1941:4"/>
euen Christ Iesus, the head corner stone, vpon which see you doe build Gold, Siluer, and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones, that is, pure Doctrine, which will abide the examination of the spirit; that when the LROD of the house commeth you may heare the blessed voyce, <hi>Enter into your Maisters ioy yee faithfull seruants.</hi> Farewell.</p>

            <p>TOuching this reuerend man (whose last obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies and Funerall rights wee come now to performe) I am bound to say something, in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects: First, of <hi>God,</hi> that he may haue the prayse of his owne worke and gifts in him.

suffer any euill to be spoken or done by others: All these doe beare witnesset of him, that hee was a <hi>good</hi> man. Neither indeede could hee be lesse, if the Poet have well described a good man, when hee thus wrote,
<q>Vir bonus est quis? qui consulta legum qui patres, iuraques seruat:</q>

him: Yet this present parcell of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth mention some honourable things that did befall him about his death, as namely, the lamentation of diuers women, and good people, in witnesse of his innocencie, that he died a iust, and good a man, in which behalfe they bewayled him, and not for the cause of his miserie alone: for then they vvould haue mourned for the two theeues that vvere crucified with him. Againe the horrible iudgement threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here by Iesus vnto the Iewes, for putting him so cruelly to death, is an euidence of his vprightnesse, and how deere and beloued hee was vnto God his father, howsoeuer for a time hee did forsake him, that hee might suffer afflictiue things to merit the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankinde.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The other part of our Text was the euent that followed this mourning; namely, a graue speech, which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our vttered by occasion thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. Which speech is partly <hi>prohibitory, Weepe not for me,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:1941:12"/>

                  <hi>And there followed him.</hi>] That is, came neere vnto him, euen behind his backe. They bewailed and lamented him, that is, their inward sorrow was so vehement as it brast out into teares, as appeares by vers. 28. What women these were that thus followed &amp; lamented, though not expressed in the Text; yet probable to haue beene such as had heard his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of whom reade in <hi>Luke</hi> 8.2.3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 1. 2. and elsewhere. It is the manner at <hi>Executions</hi> and <hi>Funerals</hi> of persons of note and name, that many flocke and follow to the place, some out of curiositie to heare and see: some out of compassion to bewaile and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their case and their losse. So it was here, many followed Christ as enemies, some as friends out of loue, much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that a man so innocent and so bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent,
<pb facs="tcp:1941:12"/>
vvhich had done so much good to so many, by his doctrine &amp; miracles, should so vniustly suffer.</p>
               <p>First of all,<note place="margin">Obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> note here how manifold testimonie vvas giuen to Iesus of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie from all sorts of persons and creatures. <hi>Iudas</hi> which betrayed him, affirmed him to be an innocent, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Pilate</hi> which condemned him, not onely with his mouth, sayd, <hi>What euil hath hee done? Matth.</hi> 27.23. and againe, <hi>I finde no fault in him at all, Iohn</hi> 19.4. but by the Ceremonie of washing his hands, publikely protested so much, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.24. His Wife being troubled about Iesus in her dreame, sent her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band this message, <hi>Haue thou nothing to doe with that iust man, Matth.</hi> 27. 19. The Centurion seeing what hapned, sayd, <hi>Of a truth this was the Son of God, Luke</hi> 23. Many people and women in our Text by their teares condemne the crueltie of the Priests and Elders, and other Iewes, and iustifie his integritie. Yea, not reasonable, but euen vnsensible creatures, as the Graues which opened, the stones which cleft asunder, the Sun
<pb facs="tcp:1941:13"/>
which was Eclipsed, the Ayre darkened, all these (as with one voyce) did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime him an innocent person.</p>
               <p>We read of a certaine Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, who vpon the strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents about the suffering of Iesus, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red these vvords, <hi>Aut mundi machina dissoluitur, aut Deus naturae patitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> This serueth to the confutation and confounding of these wicked Iewes, vvhich thought, and still do thinke that Christ suffered as an euill doer, a sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, or seditious person, whereas his death had not taken away sinne from others, if any sinne had beene in himselfe. It became vs to haue a Sauiour, separate from sinners, holy, vndefiled, &amp;c. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, here is matter of comfort for all such as see and feele their owne iniquities with godly sorrow, being humbled for them, and displeased with them because they are sinnes, the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a iust GOD, and the causes of the death of an immaculate Lambe: let such reioyce and be glad, because Christ hauing no sinnes of his owne to suffer
<pb facs="tcp:1941:13"/>
for; therefore it must needs be he came to saue such sinners, the iust to die for the vniust, to seeke vp that vvhich is lost.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> learne here our Christian dutie, which is to mourne, and bee touched with heauinesse for the death of godly persons; as the Israelites mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for <hi>Iacob,</hi> a right good man: and afterwards for <hi>Moses</hi>an vpright Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and singular Prophet, <hi>Deut. vlt.</hi> Also, the Iewes lamented sore for zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Iosiah,</hi> that restorer of Religion, keeping a yearely remembrance of his death, see <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. ver. 2. When <hi>Stephen</hi> the protomartyr, a man full of Fayth and the holy Ghost, dyed, there was great lamentation made for him, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.2. and <hi>Paul</hi> hauing said to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at <hi>Melitum,</hi> that they should see his face no more, they fell vpon his necke and weptsore, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.38. There be diuers reasons why we ought to bee affected with sorrow, vvhen righteous persons are taken from vs. First, Gods Commandement. 1 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.4. Secondly, the example of holy
<pb facs="tcp:1941:14"/>
men, and of Iesus, vveeping at the death of <hi>Lazarus, Iohn</hi> 11.35. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the world is continued and spared for the sake of good men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. If ten righteous men had beene found in <hi>Sodome,</hi> God had not punished it. To <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 27.24. God gaue all the liues of those vvhich were in the Ship with him. Certainely, the iust by their prayers stand in the gap, and doe stay and hold backe many iudgements that they breake not out and fall downe vpon the heads of the vvicked.</p>
               <p>Againe, the taking away of good men is commonly the fore-runner of some calamitie.<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> When <hi>Lot</hi> was out of Sodome then came downe fire from heauen to consume them. And after the death of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> Gods people vvere carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues into a strange Land.<note place="margin">Esay 57.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Esay</hi> saith ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that righteous persons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued hence, that they may not see the euill to come.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> At a word, godly persons be the props and pillers of Church and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>The meditation of this doctrine will help vs:<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> First, to make better account of
<pb facs="tcp:1941:14"/>
good men, to whom wee are so much beholden; that we haue them in singular loue,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> honouring a Prophet and a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, because they be such.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Vse hath 3 branches</note> this checketh three sorts of persons. First, those which hate the iust (as <hi>Cain</hi> hated <hi>Abel</hi>;) and thinke them to be the troublers of the world (as <hi>Achab</hi> falsly thought of <hi>Elias</hi>;) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing them as enemies to Kings and States, (as CHRIST and his Apostles were iudged of;) putting them to death as euill doers (as <hi>Antipas</hi> was, <hi>Reu.</hi> 3.) Secondly those which being shamelesly wicked, doe reioyce at the fall of good men, esteeming it a great benefit to be without them, as they in the <hi>Psalme,</hi> cheered themselues with <hi>Dauids</hi> sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, saying, <hi>There, there, so would wee have it: hee is downe, and shall neuer rise againe.</hi> Or, as the Iewes triumphed when they had nayled IESVS to the Crosse, and that hee had giuen vp the Ghost. Thirdly, such as through sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse blockishnesse are without all fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of sorrow when God strikes at such famous Lampes (as this lying before
<pb facs="tcp:1941:15"/>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note>Lastly, it must prouoke vs all in such cases to be touched in heart, working our selues to grieue at such Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when they happen, that wee be not found hardened, like those of whom <hi>Esay</hi> complaineth, that vvhen mercifull men vvere taken from the Church, they did not consider it in their heart, they regarded not that God deliuered them from future euill, <hi>Esay</hi> 57.1.

                  <hi>But Iesus turned backe to them.</hi>] Here beginneth the second generall part, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Speech or Sermon of Iesus, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by this Lamentation. And ere wee come to examine the particulars, I commend this Lesson, as to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet more specially to the Ministers of Christ, that they attend their Calling to the vtmost, being prompt to instruct, reproue, and admonish, as long as they may. See how Iesus being set in great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, neare to a cruell death, led be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb facs="tcp:1941:15"/>
Souldiers, bound with cords, yet remembreth his vocation: and being sent of God into the vvorld, vvith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement from his Father, to teach his will, to call men to repentance, hee accordingly, euen to the last period of his life, warneth the Iewes of their sinne, and threatneth Gods iudgements for the same; and as a Prophet fore-telleth their misery.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Ieremie</hi> vvhen the King and Princes, by the malice of the Priests, had cast him into prison, yet euen then hee causeth <hi>Baruch</hi> to vvrite his Prophesies, and to reade them to the people. Also <hi>Paul</hi> being prisoner at <hi>Rome, Act.</hi> 28. 31. yet euen there hee taught the kingdome of God by mouth to such as came to him; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring Gods Word was vnbound, wrote many diuine Epistles, as that to <hi>Galat.

to the violence of his enemies, as if he had beene compelled to dye, and could not haue resisted their rage: whereas none did take away from him his life,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.18</note> he laid it downe of himselfe, partly out of the great loue that hee bare to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and partly to declare the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward his heauenly Father, vvho had appointed to redeeme the vvorld by the death of his Sonne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.8.

they crucified the Lord of glory, and put to death that iust One, after they had rayled, and spitted on him, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and shamefully entreated him; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, this sinne of crueltie against Iesus, I doubt it is little thought on, or mistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to be amongst vs, (because Iesus is long since gone from vs) whereas there be sundry wayes how men may now,<note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes Christ may bee killed.</note> &amp; doe often fall into it.

               <p>Moreouer, they which doe in cruell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> manner oppresse Christians, spoyling them wrongfully in goods, libertie or life; is not this to persecute Christ in his members?

               <p>And what other thing doe they then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> but kill Christ through vnmercifulnes, which doe not feed him when hee is an hungred, &amp; doe not harbour him when he is harbourlesse, and doe not cloath him when he is naked? We know that they which doe not these things to the least of Christs, they doe it not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. It is truely sayd of an auncient writer, <hi>Si non pauisti occidists:</hi> for the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> writeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. of the couetous rich men, that they doe kill the iust by vvithdrawing their wages from them (vvhereupon they should liue,) also we perceiue by the vvords of Christ in the Gospell, that not to saue life (when we may) is to destroy and to take away life: and the truth is, it is a like cruel, vtterly to quench ones life by
<pb facs="tcp:1941:23"/>
violence, or by hardnesse of heart, to keepe away that from him whereby hee should preserue life.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But I vvill shew you a greater cruelty then all this, committed against Christ in his members, by false prophets, by negligent teachers, and blinde guides, vvhich put the precious soules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in danger to perish euerlastingly, eyther by teaching corrupt doctrine, or no doctrine; eyther by sowing heresies, or not by sowing the seed of the word: as an vnfaithfull steward doth starue the family by not giuing euery one their portion of meat: so are they soule mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers which deny vnto Gods people their appointed food of the word. <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. sayth of false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that they doe hunt the soules of the people (as a wilde beast doth hunt the poore Lambe to kill him.) It is the sentence of our Sauiour CHRIST, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. that hirelings doe loue the fleece and lucre better then the soules of the flocke, doe come to kill and to destroy. Finally, it is expresly written in the <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> that there the people
<pb facs="tcp:1941:23"/>
doe perish where vision or preaching faileth. There is no crueltie to the soule-crueltie, which first or last wil call down for wrath vpon the heads of those which are guilty of it. If <hi>Abels</hi> bloud cryed to God for vengeance, how much more will the bloud of soules doe it?</p>
               <p>In the first of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when <hi>Daniel</hi> and the other children of the Iewes, desired to be fed vvith pulse, and not with meate which came from the Kings table, the Eunuch which kept them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that he durst not. For (saith he) if your faces be not well liked when the King shall looke vpon you, he will take away my head from me. I doe not say vnto Idoll-Shepheards and dumbe dogges, (through whose negligence or ignorance, the soules of the people haue leanenesse entred into their soules, and looke vvith euill fauoured counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances) that God will strike their heads from their shoulders, but this I dare say &amp; auouch, that without true repentance he will cast both their boydes and soules into hel; and with the euill steward in the Gospell, who said in his heart, <hi>my Master
<pb facs="tcp:1941:24"/>
will deferre his comming,</hi> and so fall to bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his fellow-seruants, they shall be cut in pieces, and their portion shall be giuen them with Hipocrits, and at the last they shall be burned with fire and brimstone. O therefore that euill and sloathfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters would consider this in time, and lay it neere vnto their heart and repent of their cruelty past, and hence forth carrie more mercifull hearts towards the inheritance of Christ, yeerning and pittying the spirituall necessities of Christ his sheepe, after his owne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Matthew</hi> 9. 36.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is greatly to be wished, that all vniust and Sacriligious persons, and Patrons, who are the direct and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all occasions of plunging many soules, into endlesse perditions, by wrongfully detaining the hyers of Gods labourers, by which meanes the Church of Christ is pestered with foolish Ministers, and blinde Shepherds, that God I say, would giue them better mindes, and change their bloudy hearts into pittifull hearts, to take compassion on their brethren, which doe by heapes runne vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

               <p>From this first condition there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto the righteous,<note place="margin">Vse 1.

They are hereby warned aboue all things to take heede of barrennesse in their profession, and to studie how to be fruitfull and profitable continually: carefully doing the workes both of their generall and particular Callings, out of a sincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to glorifie God, and to benefit their neighbours. As earthly Husbandmen which haue planted their grounds with trees, after they haue dunged, vvatered, trimmed and pruned them, they expect
<pb facs="tcp:1941:28"/>
that they should bring forth fruit (as they may by good right and reason) if they misse of their hope, and their trees proue barren after all their cost and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour bestowed, they cut them downe, and cast them into the fire, as did that man, mentioned in the Gospell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 7. who comming to his vineyard, and finding his Fig-tree empty, tooke order with the dresser to haue it hewen downe: so God that heauenly husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which hath grafted you, as Trees, in the Orchard of his Church, vvill proceede against you in all rigour and seueritie, when hee commeth to visit you, and to looke for fruit, he shall finde your branches eyther emptie and bare, or with a few clusters vpon them, after all his paines and charge, after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious instructions, and benefits, both bodily and spirituall; which ought to haue preuailed so greatly vvith you, as to haue made you thinke, not onely of bringing forth fruit, but of increasing and abounding in fruit, as the Apostle prayeth for the <hi>Colossiaus, Chap.</hi> 1 <hi>v.</hi> 10. And as he exhorteth the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1941:28"/>
that they may increase in loue, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in euery good word, and in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good worke: so that it is not enough for Christians sometimes to doe well, and to speake well, to bring forth a little fruit, as it were a sprinckle, here a Figge, and there a Grape: but according to the time that they haue stood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church, and the meanes they haue had to grow vp in godlines, they ought to striue to be abundant and plentifull in the fruits of righteousnesse, for God will require much where hee hath committed much.</p>
               <p>Whereof it would come to passe,<note place="margin">Vse 2. a double comfort.</note> that (amongst many other) you shall reape these two comfors especially: first, that the more greene and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you are in pietie and innocency of life, the more yee shall become like vnto IESVS CHRIST your Lord and Sauiour; who was euer eyther say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or doing some good, eyther curing the sicke, or raysing the dead, or casting out deuils, or instructing the ignorant, or rebuking the obstinate (as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him) that hee went about doing
<pb facs="tcp:1941:29"/>
good, and that hee did all things well: now what greater consolation can there be to a godly mind in the whole world, then to beare the image of Christs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and goodnesse? for they that be good and holy as Christ was good and holy, they are sure to be like him in happinesse, as they are like him in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. Whosoeuer imitateth his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency shall be partakers with him of his glory: for where Christ is, there must his seruants be, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. But vnto this comfort which is very great, adde a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which is not small; namely, that Figs, Grapes, or other fruits, are not so delightfull and pleasing to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man, as the good workes vvhich doe grow vpon the Christian tree are gratefull and acceptable vnto GOD, through Iesus Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. Hence good workes be tearmed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>the sweet fruits of righteousnesse</hi>; and in the <hi>Canticles, Cha.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 14.

with all the trees of incense, Myrrhe, and Aloes, with all the chiefe spices.</hi> Oh what a comfort is this to know that the chiefest and choysest spices are not so sweet to our taste, as our good works be pleasing vnto our heauenly Father!</p>
               <p>But to passe on to the other part of the condition,<note n="2" place="margin">Part of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Crosse.</note> which concernes the godly in this life: it might be wondred that they being for innocency of life and plentifulnesse of good fruits so like Christ, so pleasing to God, euen as green fruitfull Trees are to the husbandman, yet as if they were the worst of all men, hated of God and man, they should vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe and suffer so many heauy and hard troubles and dangers, their life being as full of miserie as it is short for continuance (as <hi>Iob</hi> saith;)<note place="margin">Iob 14. 1.</note> their daies as euill as few, (as <hi>Iacob</hi> complained;) they being subiect to peculiar afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for righteousnes sake,<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 9.</note> such as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth crosses and persecutions; beside those tribulations which be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, so as the righteous, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon with a fleshly eye, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to their present and

<pb facs="tcp:1941:30"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7.

               <p>Secondly, to purge out corruptions in herent, and remayning sinnes, that they might be more fruitfull in good workes, as men doe lop and cut their Vines and other trees, least growing too ranke in leaues, they should bring forth little fruit. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19 2. 3. Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> saith, the corrections which God hath sealed, are sent to take downe his pride (that hee may walke humbly with his God) and to turne him from his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise (that hee may liue holy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably
<pb facs="tcp:1941:31"/>

               <p>Thirdly, to make man know what is in himselfe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. to his faith, as gold is tryed and purged in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. to manifest and encrease patience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. that the children of God by their strength of faith, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which they finde to be giuen them of God, to enable them to beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Crosse, and to endure tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to stand fast in the euill day, they may grow to experience, &amp; from thence by degrees come vnto that hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which confoundeth not, but filleth the heart with ioy vnspeakeable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3.4.5. 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to withdraw and weane them from the loue of these wroldly things, that the world may be crucified to them, and they to the world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.

               <p>Lastly, to giue to the godly which now are troubled, certaine demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

The first is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not to promise to our selues a constant ease, and quietnesse in this world, as if we could liue here alwayes in pleasures and prosperity. Whereas, beside that which is written, experience telleth vs all things earthly to be mutable, and nothing so subiect to change as men and their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: for as soule weather and storme
<pb facs="tcp:1941:32"/>
followeth a calme, and faire seasons, and night day, and Winter Summer; so sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse succeeds health; pouerty riches; aduersity prosperity, sorrow ioy: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Mariners in a calme prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a storme, and prouident men in plenty looke out, &amp; lay vp for the dayes of famine, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did: so Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are bound in prosperity to prepare for aduersity; for these take turnes, and nothing else is seene vnder the Sunne. Sathan, and the wicked will not suffer the godly to lacke trouble and affliction. Crosse is a necessary and perpetuall companion of the Gospell.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Crux Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelijl; comes.</hi>
                  </note> Wherefore as a man that meanes to build,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.33</note> will first cast and consider whether hee haue meanes sufficient; and as a Captaine will waigh his forces ere he goe to warre: so good Christians must arme themselues, and get a resolution, with strength and power from heauen, to goe thorow stitch with their profession: for he is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be Christs Disciple that hath not this setled affection, to forsake all for his Sauiours sake, and for his Gospell. What <hi>Paul</hi> said of himselfe, euery one in some
<pb facs="tcp:1941:32"/>
measure must be ready to doe, not onely to be bound, but to dye for the Lord Iesus.</p>
               <p>A second vse of the former doctrine is,<note place="margin">2. Dutie.</note> to admonish the Children of God to be patient and well-contented with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, when they shall happen, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer long and sharp they proue, seeing it is the pleasure of their Father, and the portion of all their brethren (those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which they suffer being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in the rest of the Saints which be, or haue beene, or shall be in the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.) for all that will liue godly, must (a necessitie in it, not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency alone) suffer persecution, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. and that they haue Christ their guide and Captaine, vvho hath led them the way, and doth both minister strength enough to beare and abide the crosse, and hath promised the victory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. Yea, and turneth the crosses of his people to such and so manifold commodities. The meditation of these things must preuaile to stay them from grutching or fainting, and keepe them in their vprightnesse &amp; constancy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

being vveary in their minde, or weary of wel-doing.<note place="margin">3. Vse.</note> Finally this rebukes the prophane persons, two wayes, both because they rashly iudge of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when they be vnder the scourge, censuring them for hypocrites and men hated and cast out of GOD, forlorne and desperate, (as <hi>Elihu,</hi> and the other did of <hi>Iob</hi>) and the Courtiers of <hi>Saul,</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the Iewes of CHRIST. Whom they thought to be quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, because they saw him sore plagued, and not deliuered: and also for that they falsly sooth and flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their sinnes, as if they vvere deere to God and beloued of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his indulgence and lenity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, presuming of God, that he will not destroy them, but with blessings and kindnesses still fill and follow them, boasting (as if they were at a couenant with hell, and death) that no euill shall come neere them, that they shall sit and raigne as Queenes, and feele no misery, nor euer be remoued: wherein they are deceiued; <hi>for if these things be done to the greene tree, what will be done to the dry!</hi>

               <p>The vse whereunto this estate of the wicked,<note n="1" place="margin">Vse.</note> thus wofull and vnhappy, must serue (if wee deale wisely,) is, first of all in respect of the righteous, to holde them from impatiencie and fretting, such as <hi>Dauid,</hi> (<hi>Psal.</hi> 37. and 73.) and <hi>Ieremie</hi> did fall into, when they saw the outward felicitie of the wicked, how they

If such holy men vvere offended, how may we mistrust our selues, lest the honour and riches of euill men be a scandall and an offence to vs, and make vs vveary of all, and to giue ouer our vprightnesse, and to like of their wayes, and chuse their conuersation? Howbeit, arme your selues against such stumbling blockes, by this meditation, that when the green tree hath such things done vnto it, the things done to the dry, what will they be? And if God haue a rod for the the righteous, hee hath a sword for the vniust, which hee will whet, and draw, and strike them dead withall.

Stripes and vvounds are prepared for the righteous; but Fire and Brimstone, Hayle, Storme and Tempest, shall be the portion of Sinners. Hee comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the godly which offend of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as a Father, angry vvith his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and forgetfull childe; but as a fierce Iudge against the wicked, vvhich sinne wilfully and of malice.</p>

knowledge, and regarded not instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he called and they heard not, they answered not when hee cryed to them; but despised his counsell, and would none of his correction: therefore when their feare commeth, he shall not heare their cry, nor answere when they call, but shall laugh at their desolation, and mocke when their dreadfull fall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</p>
               <p>If men when they heare such things threatned, and withall doe see with their eyes such greene trees (as this our text speakes of, or this which now lyeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs) so wonderfully smitten of God, with such vnwonted distresses and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases, would enter into such a serious meditation concerning themselues as this; when these vnharmfull and holy persons, mercifull and righteous men, which feared God and liued iustly, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing euill, could not escape the fierce wrath of God; what will be mine end, which haue lifted vp my minde to vanitie, and walked in crooked wayes, minding earthly things, and my heart set vpon euill workes! oh, how happy

might they become! And when they read that other mens sinnes so burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and bruised Christ, (himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinlesse and iust) let them thinke what will light vpon their heads, being so full of sinne, if they doe not turne from their iniquities with all their hart, and with all their soule.</p>
               <p>This is the profit which impenitent persons must labour to make of the Iudgements of God vpon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and nor to doe as they in <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 2. 3. 4. which forgot themselues, there owne guilt and danger, and tooke such as <hi>Pilate</hi> killed and mingled their bloud with their Sacrifices, and them vpon whom the Tower of <hi>Shiloam</hi> fell, and crushed them to death, to be greatest sinners: whereas our Sauiour directed their eyes backe to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and consider their owne perillous condition; that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they repented, they likewise should perish.</p>
