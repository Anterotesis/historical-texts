            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am long ſince perſwaded, that to ſay, ot doe ought worth memory,
and imitation, no purpoſe or reſpect ſhould ſooner move us, then
ſimply the love of God, and of mankinde. Nevertheleſſe to write
now the reforming of Education, though it be one of the greateſt
and nobleſt deſignes, that can be thought on, and for the want
whereof this nation periſhes, I had not yet at this time been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't,
but by your earneſt entreaties, and ſerious conjurements; as having my
minde for the preſent halfe diverted in the perſuance of ſome other aſſertions, the
knowledge and the uſe of which, cannot but be a great furtherance both to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of truth, and honeſt living, with much more peace. Nor ſhould the
lawes of any private friendſhip have prevail'd with me to divide thus, or tranſpoſe
my former thoughts, but that I ſee thoſe aims, thoſe actions which have won you
with me the eſteem of a perſon ſent hither by ſome good providence from a farre
country to be the occaſion and the incitement of great good to this Iland. And,
as I hear, you have obtain'd the ſame repute with men of moſt approved wiſdom,
and ſome of higheſt authority among us. Not to mention the learned correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which you hold in forreigne parts, and the extraordinary pains and diligence
which you have uſ'd in this matter both heer, and beyond the Seas; either by the
definite will of God ſo ruling, or the peculiar ſway of nature, which alſo is Gods
working. Neither can I thinke that ſo reputed, and ſo valu'd as you are, you would
to the forfeit of your own diſcerning ability, impoſe upon me an unfit and over
ponderous argument, but that the ſatisfaction which you profeſſe to have receiv'd
from thoſe incidentall diſcourſes which we have wander'd into, hath preſt &amp; almoſt
conſtrain'd you into a perſwaſion, that what you require from me in this point, I
neither ought, nor can in conſcience deferre beyond this time both of ſo much need
at once, and ſo much opportunity to trie what God hath determin'd. I will not
reſiſt therefore, what ever it is either of divine, or humane obligement that you lay
upon me; but will forthwith ſet down in writing, as you requeſt me, that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<hi>Idea,</hi> which hath long in ſilence preſented it ſelf to me, of a better Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in extent and comprehenſion farre more large, and yet of time farre ſhorter,
and of attainment farre more certain, then hath been yet in practice. Briefe I ſhall
endeavour to be; for that which I have to ſay, aſſuredly this nation hath extreame
need ſhould be done ſooner then ſpok'n. To tell you therefore what I have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
herein among old renowned Authors, I ſhall ſpare; and to ſearch what many
modern <hi>Ianua's</hi> and <hi>Didactics</hi> more then ever I ſhall read, have projected, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
leads me not. But if you can accept of theſe few obſervations which have
flowr'd off, and are as it were the burniſhing of many ſtudious and contemplative
yeers altogether ſpent in the ſearch of religious and civil knowledge, and ſuch as
pleaſ'd you ſo well in the relating, I here give you them to diſpoſe of.</p>

The end then of learning is to repair the ruins of our firſt parents by regaining to
know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love him, to imitate him, to be
like him, as we may the neereſt by poſſeſſing our ſouls of true vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being
united to the heavenly grace of faith makes up the higheſt perfection. But becauſe
our underſtanding cannot in this body found it ſelfe but on ſenſible things, not
arrive ſo cleerly to the knowledge of God and things inviſible, as by orderly
conning over the viſible and inferior creature, the ſame method is neceſſarily
to be follow'd in all diſcreet teaching. And ſeeing every nation affords not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and tradition anough for all kinde of learning, therefore we are chiefly
taught the languages of thoſe people who have at any time been moſt induſtrious
after wiſdom; So that language is but the inſtrument convaying to us things uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be known. And though a linguiſt ſhould pride himſelfe to have all the
tongues that <hi>Babel</hi> cleft the world into, yet, if he have not ſtudied the ſolid things
in them as well as the words and lexicons, he were nothing ſo much to be
eſteem'd a learned man, as any yeoman or tradeſman competently wiſe in
his mother dialect only. Hence appear the many miſtakes which have made
learning generally ſo unpleaſing and ſo unſuccesfull; firſt we do amiſſe to ſpend
ſeven or eight yeers meerly in ſcraping together ſo much miſerable Latin, and
Greek, as might be learnt otherwiſe eaſily and delightfully in one yeer. And that
which caſts our proficiency therein ſo much behinde, is our time loſt partly in too
oft idle vacancies given both to ſchools and Univerſities, partly in a prepoſterous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
forcing the empty wits of children to compoſe Theams, verſes, and Orations,
which are the acts of ripeſt judgement and the finall work of a head fill'd by long
reading, and obſerving, with elegant maxims, and copious invention. Theſe are
not matters to be writing from poor ſtriplings, like blood out of the noſe, or the
plucking of untimely fruit: beſides the all habit which they get of wretched barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
againſt the Latin and Greek <hi>idiom,</hi> with their untutor'd <hi>Angliciſms,</hi> odious
to be read, yet not to be avoided without a well continu'd and judicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
among pure Authors digeſted, which they ſcarce taſte, wheras if after ſome
preparatory grounds of ſpeech by their certain forms got into memory, they were
led to the praxis thereof in ſome choſen ſhort book leſſon'd throughly to them, they
might then forthwith proceed to l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arn the ſubſtance of good things, and Arts in
due order, which would bring the whole language quickly into their power. This
I take to be the moſt rationall and moſt profitable way of learning languages, and
whereby we may beſt hope to give account to God of our youth ſpent herein: And
for the uſuall method of teaching Arts, I deem it to be an old errour of univerſities
not yet well recover'd from the Scholaſtick groſneſſe of barbarous ages, that in
ſtead of beginning with Arts moſt eaſie, and thoſe be ſuch as are moſt obvious to
the ſence, they preſent their young unmatriculated novices at firſt comming with the
moſt intellective abſtractions of Logick &amp; metaphyſicks: So that they having but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
left thoſe Grammatick flats &amp; ſhallows where they ſtuck unreaſonably to learn
a few words with lamentable conſtruction, and new on the ſudden tranſported under
another climat to be toſt and turmoild with their unb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llaſted wits in fadomles and
unquiet deeps of controverſie, do for the moſt part grow into hatred and contempt of
learning, mockt and deluded all this while with ragged notions and babblements,
while they expected worthy and delightfull knowledge; till poverty or youthfull
yeers call them importunately their ſeverall wayes, and haſten them with the ſway

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155150:2"/>
of friends either to an ambitious and mercenary, or ignorantly zealous Divinity;
Some aſſur'd to the trade of Law, grounding their purpoſes not on the prudent, and
heavenly contemplation of juſtice and equity which was never taught them, but
on the promiſing and pleaſing thoughts of litigious terms, fat contentions, and
flowing ſees; others betake them to State affairs, with ſouls ſo unprincipl'd in vertue,
and true generous breeding, that flattery, and court ſhifts and tyrannous aphoriſmes
appear to them the higheſt points of wiſdom; inſtilling their barren hearts with a
conſcientious ſlavery, if, as, I rather think, it be not fain'd. Others laſtly of a
more delicious and airie ſpirit, retire themſelves knowing no better, to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of eaſe and luxury, living out their daies in feaſt and jollity, which indeed
is the wiſeſt and the ſafeſt courſe of all theſe, unleſſe they were with more integrity
undertak'n. And theſe are the errours, and theſe are the fruits of miſpending our
prime youth at the Schools and Univerſities as we do, either in learning meere words
or ſuch things chiefly, as were better unlearnt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall detain you now no longer in the demonſtration of what we ſhould not
doe, but ſtrait conduct ye to a hill ſide, where I will point ye out the right path of
a vertuous and noble Education; laborious indeed at the firſt aſcent, but elſe ſo
ſmooth, ſo green, ſo full of goodly proſpect, and melodious ſounds on every ſide,
that the harp of <hi>Orpheus</hi> was not more charming. I doubt not but ye ſhall have more
adoe to drive our dulleſt and lazieſt youth, our ſtocks and ſtubbs from the infinite
deſire of ſuch a happy nurture, then we have now to hale and drag our choiſeſt and
hopefulleſt wits to that aſinine feaſt of ſowthiſtles and brambles which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſet before them, as all the food and entertainment of their tendereſt and moſt
docible age. I call therefore a compleate and generous Education that which fits
a man to perform juſtly, skilfully and magnanimouſly all the offices both private
and publike of peace and war. And how all this may be done between twelve, and
one and twenty, leſſe time then is now beſtow'd in pure trifling at Grammar and
<hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> is to be thus order'd.</p>
            <p>Firſt to finde out a ſp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tious houſe and ground about it fit for an <hi>Academy,</hi> and
big enough to lodge a hundred and fifty perſons, whereof twenty or thereabout
may be attendants, all under the government of one, who ſhall be thought of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
ſufficient, and ability either to doe all, or wiſely to direct, and overſee it done.
This place ſhould be at once both School and Univerſity, not needing a remove to
any other houſe of Schollerſhip, except it be ſome peculiar Colledge of Law, or
Phyſick where they mean to be practitioners; but as for thoſe generall ſtudies which
take up all our time from Lilly to the commencing, as they term it, Maſter of Art, it
ſhould be abſolute. After this pattern, as many edifices may be converted to this uſe,
as ſhall be needfull in every City throughout this land, which would tend much to
the encreaſe of learning and civility every where. This number, leſſe or more thus
collected, to the convenience of a foot company, or interchangeably two troops
of cavalry, ſhould divide their daies work into three parts, as it lies orderly.
Their ſtudies, their exerciſe, and their diet.</p>
            <p>For their ſtudies, Firſt they ſhould begin with the chief and neceſſary rules of
ſome good Grammar, either that now uſ'd, or any better: and while this is doing,
their ſpeech is to be faſhion'd to a diſtinct and cleer pronuntiation, as neer as may
be to the <hi>Italian,</hi> eſpecially in the vowels. For we Engliſhmen being farre norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

So that to ſmatter Latin with an engliſh mouth, is as ill a hearing as law French.

                  </gap>, Plutarch,</hi> and other Socratic diſcourſes. But in Latin we have none of
claſſic authoritie extant, except the two or three firſt books of <hi>Quintilian,</hi> and
ſome ſelect peeces elſe where. But here the main skill and groundwork will be, to
temper them ſuch lectures and explanations upon every opportunity, as may lead and
draw them in willing obedience, enflam'd with the ſtudy of learning, and the
admiration of vertue; ſtirr'd up with high hopes of living to be brave men, and
worthy patriots, dear to God, and famous to all ages. That they may deſpiſe and
ſcorn all their childiſh, and ill taught qualities, to delight in manly, and liberall
exerciſes: which he who hath the Art, and proper eloquence to catch them with,
what with mild and effectuall perſwaſions, and what with the intimation of ſome
fear, if need be, but chiefly by his own example, might in a ſhort ſpace gain them
to an incredible diligence and courage: infuſing into their young breſts ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
and noble ardor, as would not fail to make many of them renowned and
matchleſſe men. At the ſame time, ſome other hour of the day, might be taught
them the rules of Arithmetick, and ſoon after the elements of Geometry even play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the old manner was. After evening repaſt, till bed time their thoughts will be
beſt taken up in the eaſie grounds of Religion, and the ſtory of Scripture. The
next ſtep would be to the Authors of <hi>Agriculture, Cato, Varro,</hi> and <hi>Columella,</hi> for
the matter is moſt eaſie, and if the language be difficult, ſo much the better, it is
not a difficultie above their yeers. And here will be an occaſion of inciting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
them hereafter to improve the tillage of their country, to recover the bad
ſoil, and to remedy the waſt that is made of good: for this was one of Hercules
praiſes. Ere halfe theſe Authors be read, which will ſoon be with plying hard,
and dayly, they cannot chooſe but be maſters of any ordinary proſe. So that it will
be then ſeaſonable for them to learn in any modern Author, the uſe of the Globes,
and all the maps firſt with the old names; and then with the new: or they might be
then capable to read any compendious method of naturall Philoſophy. And at the
ſame time might be entring into the Greek tongue, after the ſame manner as was
before preſcrib'd in the Latin; whereby the difficulties of Grammar being ſoon
overcome, all the Hiſtoricall Phyſiology of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> are open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to <hi>Senecas</hi> naturall queſtions, to <hi>Mela, Celsus, Pliny,</hi> or <hi>Solinus.</hi> And
having thus paſt the principles of <hi>Arithmetic, Geometry, Aſtronomy,</hi> and <hi>Geography</hi>
with a generall compact of Phyſicks, they may deſcend in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall
ſcience of <hi>Trigonometry,</hi> and from thence to Fortification, <hi>Architecture,</hi>
Enginry, or navigation. And in naturall Philoſophy they may proceed leiſurly
from the Hiſtory of <hi>Meteors,</hi> minerals, plants and living creatures as farre as
Anatomy. Then alſo in courſe might be read to them out of ſome not tedious wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the inſtitution of Phyſick; that they may know the tempers, the humors, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and how to manage a crudity: which he who can wiſely and timely doe, is
not onely a great Phyſician to himſelfe, and to his friends, but alſo may at ſome

time or other, ſave an Army by this frugall, and expenceleſſe meanes only; and
not let the healthy and ſtout bodies of young men rot away under him for want of
this diſcipline; which is a great pitty, and no leſſe a ſhame to the commander. To ſet
forward all theſe proceedings in nature &amp; mathematicks, what hinders, but that they
may procure, as oft as ſhall be needfull, the helpfull experiences of Hunters, fowlers,
Fiſhermen, Shepherds, Gardeners, <hi>Apothecaries;</hi> and in the other ſciences, <hi>Architects</hi>
Engineers, Mariners, <hi>Anatomiſts;</hi> who doubtleſſe would be ready ſome for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and ſome to favour ſuch a hopefull Seminary. And this will give them ſuch
a reall tincture of naturall knowledge, as they ſhall never forget, but dayly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with delight. Then alſo thoſe Poets which are now counted moſt hard, will
be both facil and pleaſant, <hi>Orpheus, Heſiod, Theocritus, Aratus, Nicander, Oppian,
Dionyſius</hi> and in Latin <hi>Lucretius, Manilius,</hi> and the rurall part of Virgil.</p>
            <p>By this time, yeers and good generall precepts will have furniſht them more
diſtinctly with that act of reaſon which in <hi>Ethics</hi> is call'd <hi>Proa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reſis:</hi> that they may
with ſome judgement contemplat upon morall good and evill. Then will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
a ſpeciall reinforcement of conſtant and ſound endoctrinating to ſet them
right and firm, inſtructing them more amply in the knowledge of vertue and the
hatred of vice: while their young and pliant affections are led through all the
morall works of <hi>Plato, Xenophon, Cicero, Plutarch, Laertius,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Locrian</hi>
remnants; but ſtill to be reduc't in their nightward ſtudies wherewith they cloſe
the dayes work, under the determinat ſentence of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Salomon,</hi> or the
Evangels and <hi>Apoſtolic</hi> ſcriptures. Being perfit in the knowledge of perſonall duty,
they may then begin the ſtudy of Economies. And either now, or before this, they
may have eaſily learnt at any odde hour the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue. And ſoon after, but
with warineſſe, and good antidote, it would be wholſome anough to let them taſt
ſome choiſe comedies Greek, Latin, or <hi>Italian:</hi> Thoſe tragedies alſo that treate
of houſhold matters, as <hi>Trachiniae, Alceſtis</hi> and the like. The next remove muſt be
to the ſtudy of <hi>Politics;</hi> to know the beginning, end, and reaſons of politicall
ſocieties; that they may not in a dangerous fit of the common-wealth be ſuch poor,
ſhaken, uncertain reeds, of ſuch a tottering conſcience, as many of our great
counſellers have lately ſhewn themſelves, but ſtedfaſt pillars of the State. After
this they are to dive into the grounds of law, and legall juſtice; deliver'd firſt, and
with beſt warrant by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and as farre as humane prudence can be truſted, in
thoſe extoll'd remains of Grecian Law-givers, <hi>Lycurgus, Solon, Zaleucus, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondas,</hi>
and thence to all the Romane <hi>Edicts</hi> and tables with their <hi>

down to the <hi>Saxon</hi> and common laws of England, and the Statutes. Sundayes alſo
and every evening may be now underſtandingly ſpent in the higheſt matters of
<hi>Theology,</hi> and Church Hiſtory ancient and modern: and ere this time the Hebrew
tongue at a ſet hour might have been gain'd, that the Scriptures may be now read
in their own originall; whereto it would be no impoſſibility to adde the <hi>Chaldey,</hi>
and the <hi>Syrian</hi> dialect. When all theſe employments are well conquer'd, then will
the choiſe Hiſtories, <hi>heroic poems,</hi> and <hi>Attic</hi> tragedies of ſtatlieſt, and moſt regal
argument, with all the famous Politicall orations offer themſelves; which if they
were not only read; but ſome of them got by memory, and ſolemnly pronounc't
with right accent, and grace, as might be taught, would endue them even with the
ſpirit, and vigor of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Cicere, Euripides,</hi> or <hi>Sophocles.</hi> And now laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will be the time to read with them thoſe organic arts which in able men to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

palm into a gracefull and ornate Rhetorick taught out of the rule
of <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Phalereus, Cicero, Hermogenes, Longinus.</hi> To which
Poetry would be made ſubſequent, or indeed rather precedent, as being leſſe ſuttle
and fine, but more ſimple, ſenſuous and paſſionate. I mean not here the proſody
of a verſe, which they could not but have hit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on before among the rudiments of
grammer; but that ſublime art which in <hi>Ariſtotles poetics,</hi> in <hi>Horace,</hi> and the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
commentaries of <hi>Caſtelvetro, Taſſo, Mazzoni,</hi> and others, teaches what the
laws are of a true <hi>Epic</hi> poem, what of a <hi>Dramatic,</hi> what of a <hi>Lyric,</hi> what
decorum is, which is the grand maſter peece to obſerve. This would make them
ſoon perceive what deſpicable creatures our common timers and play writes be,
and ſhew them, what Religious, what glorious and magnificent uſe might be made
of Poetry both in divine and humane things. From hence and not till now will be
the right ſeaſon of forming them to be able writers and compoſers in every excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
matter, when they ſhall be thus fraught with an univerſall inſight into things.
Or whether they be to ſpeak in Parliament or counſell, honour and attention would
be waiting on their lips. There would then alſo appear in Pulpits other viſages,
other geſtures, and ſtuffe otherwiſe wrought then what we now ſit under, oft times
to as great a triall of our patience as any other that they preach to us. Theſe are
the ſtudies wherein our noble and our gentle youth ought to beſtow their time in a
diſciplinary way from twelve to one and twenty; unleſſe they rely more upon their
anceſtors dead, then upon themſelves living. In which methodicall courſe it is ſo
ſuppoſ'd they muſt proceed by the ſteddy pace of learning onward, as at convenient
times for memories ſake to retire back into the middle ward, and ſometimes into
the rear of what they have been taught, untill they have confirm'd, and ſolidly
united the whole body of their perfited knowledge, like the laſt embattelling of a
Romane legion. Now will be worth the ſeeing what exerciſes, and what recreations
may beſt agree, and become theſe ſtudies.</p>

               <p>The courſe of ſtudy hitherto briefly deſcrib'd, is, what I can gueſſe by reading,
likeſt to thoſe ancient and famous ſchools of <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Iſocrates, Ariſtotle</hi>
and ſuch others, out of which were bred up ſuch a number of renowned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,

their Academies and <hi>Lycaeum,</hi> all for the gown, this inſtitution of breeding which
I here delineate, ſhall be equally good both for Peace and warre. Therefore about
an hour and a halfe ere they eat at noon ſhould be allow'd them for exerciſe and
due reſt afterwards: But the time for this may be enlarg'd at pleaſure, according
as their riſing in the morning ſhall be early. The exerciſe which I commend firſt, is
the exact uſe of their weapon; to guard and to ſtrike ſafely with edge, or point;
this will keep them healthy nimble, ſtrong, and well in breath, is alſo the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt

and make them hate the cowardiſe of doing wrong. They muſt be alſo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiz'd

to excell, as need may often be in fight to tugge, to grapple, and to cloſe. And this

nature in her firſt concoction, and ſend their mindes backe to ſtudy in good tune

hours before ſupper, they are by a ſudden alarum or watch word, to be call'd out

ſuffer their empty &amp; unrecrutible Colonells of twenty men in a company, to quafle

of the yeer, when the air is calm and pleaſant, it were an injury and ſullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
againſt nature not to go out, and ſee her riches, and partake in her rejoycing
with heaven and earth. I ſhould not therefore be a perſwader to them of ſtudying
much then, after two or three yeer that they have well laid their grounds, but to ride
out in companies with prudent and ſtaid guides, to all the quarters of the land:
learning and obſerving all places of ſtrength, all commodities of building and of
ſoil, for towns and tillage, harbours and Ports for trade, Somtimes taking ſea as
farre as to our Navy, to learn there alſo what they can in the practical knowledge
of ſailing and of ſea fight. Theſe waves would trie all their peculiar gifts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and if there were any ſecret excellence among them, would fetch it out, and

to the good of this nation, and bring into faſhion again thoſe old admired
vertues and excellencies, with farre more advantage now in this puritie of Chriſtian

youth into thir ſlight and prodigall cuſtodies and ſend them over back again tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
into mimics, apes &amp; Kicſhoes. But if they deſire to ſee other countries at three
or four and twenty yeers of age, not to learn principles, but to enlarge experience,
and make wiſe obſervation, they will by that time be ſuch as ſhall deſerve the regard
and honour of all men where they paſſe, and the ſociety and friendſhip of thoſe in
all places who are beſt and moſt eminent. And perhaps then other Nations will be
glad to viſit us for their breeding, or elſe to imitate us in their own Country.</p>

but will require ſinews almoſt equall to thoſe which Homer gave Ulyſſes, yet I am
