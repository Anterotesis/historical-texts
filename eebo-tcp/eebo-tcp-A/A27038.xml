            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:100550:3"/>
the Countrey, having little lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for ſtudy in <hi>London.</hi> I was glad to ſee that the more curious ſtomacks of the Citizens did not nauſeate our plain Countrey Doctrine, which I ſeemed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the diligent attention of the greateſt Congregation that ever I ſaw met for ſuch a work: But I little expected that you ſhould have ſo far eſteemed that diſcourſ, as to have thought it meet for the view of the world, as I underſtood by a Meſſage from you, deſiring it may be Printed. I readily obey your will, when it gives me the leaſt intimation of the will of God. Its poſsible ſome others may afford it the like favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Acceptance and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

I have added the <hi>9, 10, 11,</hi> and <hi>12.</hi> Heads or Common-places, which I did not deliver to you for want of time, and becauſe the reſt are too briefly touched (as contrived for an hours work) I have enlarged theſe; though making them ſomewhat unſuitable to the reſt, yet ſuitable to the uſe of thoſe that they are now intended for: The Directions alſo in the end are added.</p>

It was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo in <hi>London</hi>: It is not ſo in all other places, or famous Cities in the world: Nor are you ſure that it will be alway ſo with you. It doth me good to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what bleſſed Lights have ſhined among you, that now are more gloriouſly ſhining in a higher ſphere: <hi>Preſton, Sibbes, Stoughton, Tayl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:100550:4"/>
Stock, Randal, Gouge, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,</hi> with multitudes more that are now with Chriſt! It did me good to read in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> funeral Sermon, by one of your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and faithful Guides, what a number of ſound and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Labourers are yet cloſe at work in that part of Chriſts Vineyard! And it did me good in that ſhort experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation while I was there, to hear and ſee ſo much of their Prudence, Unity and Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Believe it, it is the Goſpel of Chriſt that is your Glory: and if <hi>London</hi> be more honorable then other great and famous Cities of the earth, it is the
<pb facs="tcp:100550:5"/>
light of Gods face, and the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power of his Ordinances and ſpirit that doth advance and honour it. O know then the day of you viſitation!</p>
            <p>Three things I ſhall take leave to propound to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which I am certain God requireth at your hands. The firſt is, that you grow in knowledge, humility, heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Vnity, according to the bleſſed means that you enjoy. In my eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is the greateſt ſhame to a people in the world, and a ſign of barbarouſneſs, or blockiſhneſs, when we can hear and read what famous, learned powerful Miniſter ſuch a place, or ſuch a place had, and yet ſee
<pb facs="tcp:100550:5"/>
as much ignorance, ungodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unrulineſs, and ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if the Goſpel had ſcarce ever been there. I hope it is not thus with you: but I have found it ſo in too many places in <hi>England</hi>: We that never ſaw the faces of their Miniſters, but have only read their holy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, have been ready to think, <hi>ſure there are but few igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or ungodly ones in ſuch a Congregation! Sure they are a people rich in Grace, and eminently qualified above their brethren, who have lived underſuch Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as this! At leaſt, ſure there can be none left that have an enmity to the fear of God!</hi> But when we have come
<pb facs="tcp:100550:6"/>
to the Towns where ſuch men ſpent their lives, and laid out their labours, we have found ignorant, ſott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh worldlings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable or giddy unſtable Profeſſors, and ſome haters of godlineſs among them. O what a ſhame is this to them in the eyes of wiſe men! and what a confounding aggravation of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r ſin before God! Thrive therefore and be fruitful in the Vineyard of the Lord, that it may not repent him that he hath planted and watered you.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is this; Improve your intereſt to the utmoſt, for the continuance of a faithful Miniſtery among you: and when any places are void, do what
<pb facs="tcp:100550:6"/>
you can to get a ſupply of the moſt Able men. Your City is the Heart of the Nation: you cannot be ſick but we ſhall all feel it. If you be infected with falſe Doctrines, the Countreys will ere long receive the Contagion. You have a very great influence on all the Land, for good or evil! And do you think the undermining enemies of the Church have not a ſpecial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon you in this point? and will not promote it as far as is in their power? Could they but get in Popiſh or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Teachers among you, they know how many advantages they ſhould gain at once! They would have ſome to grieve and trouble your faithful Guides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb facs="tcp:100550:7"/>
hinder them in the work, and leſſen that eſtimation which by their Vnity they would obtain: And every Deceiver will hope to catch ſome fiſh, that caſteth his Net among ſuch ſtore. We beſeech you, if there be Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Holy, Judicious men in <hi>England,</hi> that can be had for ſupply on ſuch occaſions, let them be yours; that you may be fed with the Beſt, and Guided by the Wiſeſt, and we may have all recourſe to you for advice: and where there are moſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers and Seducers, there may be the moſt Powerful, Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing helps at hand: Let us in the Countrey have the honeſt raw young Preachers, and ſee that you have the chief Fatherspunc;
<pb facs="tcp:100550:7"/>
and Pillars in the Church. I ſpeak it not for your ſakes alone, but becauſe we have all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on you.</p>
            <p>The third thing which I humbly Crave, is, that you will <hi>Know them which Labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you, and to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake; and be at Peace among your ſelves. 1</hi> Theſ.<hi>5.12, 13.</hi> And that you will in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of grieving or rejecting your Guides, <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit yourſelves; for they watch for your ſouls as they that muſt give account, that they may do it with joy, and
<pb facs="tcp:100550:8"/>
not with grief, for that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for you.</hi> Heb. <hi>13.17.7.</hi> Encourage your Teachers, for their work is great, their ſpirits are weak they are but frail men; the enemy is more induſtrious againſt them then any men; &amp; their diſcouragements are very many, and the difficulties which they muſt encounter are very great. Eſpecially, Obey, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and Encourage them in the work of Government and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Chriſts Diſcipline, and managing the Keyes of the Kingdom which he hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands. Do you not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what a ſtrait your Teachers are in! The Lord Ieſus requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them to exerciſe his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline faithfully and impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb facs="tcp:100550:8"/>
He giveth them not empty Titles of Rule, but layes upon them the burden of ruling: It is <hi>his work,</hi> more then <hi>their</hi> Honor that he intends: and if they will have the <hi>Honor,</hi> it muſt be by the <hi>work.</hi> The work is, as to Teach the ignorant, and convince the unbelieving and gainſaying, ſo to admoniſh the diſorderly and ſcandalous, and to reject and caſt out of the Communion of the Church the Obſtinate and Impenitent; and to ſet by the Leprous, that they infect not the reſt; and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thus the pretious from the vile, by Chriſts Diſcipline, that dividing ſeparations, and ſoul-deſtroying Tranſgreſsions may be prevented or cured. This
<pb facs="tcp:100550:9"/>
work Chriſt hath charged upon them, and will have it done whoever is againſt it. If they obey him and do it, what a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, what clamours and diſcontents will they raiſe! How many will be ready to riſe up againſt them with hatred and ſcorn! though it be the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work of Chriſt, which even under perſecution was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church-Guides. When they do but keep a ſcandalous untractable ſinner from the Communion of the Church in the Lords Supper, what repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings doth it raiſe! But, alas, this is a ſmall part of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: If all the apparently obſtinate and impenitent were caſt out, what a ſtir would they
<pb facs="tcp:100550:9"/>
make! And if Chriſt be not obeyed, what a ſtir will conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence make? And it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between Chriſt and men, but between men and men, that your Guides are put upon ſuch ſtreights. The Separatiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them for ſuffering the Impenitent to continue mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Churches, and make it the pretence of their ſeparation from them; having little to ſay of any moment againſt the authorized way of Government; but only againſt our ſlackneſs in the Execution. And if we ſhould ſet to the cloſe exerciſe of it, as is meet, how would City and Countrey ring of it, and what Indignation ſhould we raiſe in the multitude
<pb facs="tcp:100550:10"/>
againſt us! O what need have your Guides of your Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and beſt Aſsiſtance in this ſtreight! God hath ſet them on a work ſo ungrateful and diſpleaſing to fleſh and blood, that they cannot be faithful in it, but twenty to one they will draw a world of Hatred upon themſelves, if not mens fiſts about their ears. Feſtred ſores will not be lancht and ſearch with eaſe: Corrupted members are unwilling to be cut off, and caſt aſide: Eſpecially if any of the great ones fall under the cenſure, who are big in the eyes of the world and in their own. And yet our Soveraign Lord muſt be obeyed; and his houſe muſt be ſwept, and the filth caſt
<pb facs="tcp:100550:10"/>
out, by what names or Titles ſoever it be dignified with men: He muſt be pleaſed, if all be diſpleaſed by it. VVithdraw not your help then from this needful work. It is by the <hi>Word, Spirit and Miniſtery,</hi> that Chriſt the King of his Church doth Govern it: Not ſeparatedly, but joyntly, by all three: To diſobey theſe, is to diſobey Chriſt: and ſubjection to Chriſt is Eſſential to our Chriſtianity. This well thought on might do much to recover the <hi>Unruly</hi> that are Recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. You may conjecture by the ſtrange oppoſition that Church-Government meets with from all ſorts of carnal and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed minds, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:100550:11"/>

Becauſe there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of knowing the ſame Truths, and the beſt are imperfect in degree. The principal growth in knowledge that we ſhould look af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er, is not to know <hi>more</hi> matters then we kne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100550:14"/>
and firmer apprehenſion, which we darkly and ſleightly knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. You may more ſafely be without <hi>any</hi> knowledge at all of many lower Truths, then without <hi>ſome further degree</hi> of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe which you already know. 4. Beſides it is known by ſad experience, that many periſh who know the Truth, for want of the Conſideration of it, and making uſe of what they know, and ſo their knowledge doth but condemn them. We have as much need therefore, to teach and help you to get theſe Truths which you know into your hearts and lives, as to tell you more. 5. And indeed, it is the impreſſion of theſe great and maſter-Truths, wherein the vitals and eſſentials of Gods Image upon the ſoul of man doth conſiſt: And it is theſe Truths that are the very Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the great works that are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100550:15"/>
to be done upon the heart, by the ſpirit and our ſelves. In the right uſe of theſe it is, that the Principal part of the skill and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom of a Chriſtian doth conſiſt: and in the diligent and conſtant uſe of theſe lyeth the life and trade of Chriſtianity. There is nothing amiſs in mens hearts or lives, but it is for want of ſound knowing and believing, or well uſing theſe fundamentals. 6. And moreover, me thinks, in this choice of my ſubject, I may expect this advantage with the hearers, that I may ſpare that labour that elſe would be neceſſary for the proof of my doctrine: and that I may alſo have eaſier acceſs to your hearts, and have a fuller ſtroak at them, and with leſs reſiſtance. If I came to tell you of any thing not Common, I know not how far I might expect belief from you. You might ſay, <hi>theſe things
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100550:15"/>
are uncertain to us, or all men are not of this mind</hi>: But when every hearer confeſſeth the Truth of my Doctrine, &amp; no man can deny it, without denying Chriſtianity it ſelf, I hope I may expect that your hearts ſhould the ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The words of my text, are the reaſon which the Apoſtle giveth both of his perſwading other men to the fear of God, and his care to approve to God his own heart and life. They contain the Aſſertion and Deſcription of the great Judgement, and one uſe which he makes of it. It aſſureth us, that Judged we <hi>muſt be</hi>; and <hi>who</hi> muſt be ſo Judged, and <hi>by whom,</hi> and <hi>about what,</hi> and <hi>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100550:16"/>
what terms,</hi> and <hi>to what end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning of the words, ſo far as is neceſſary, I ſhall give you briefly. <hi>We all,</hi> both we Apoſtles that Preach the Goſpel, and you that hear it, <hi>muſt,</hi> willing or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, there is no avoiding it, <hi>Appear,</hi> ſtand forth or make our appearance, and there have our hearts and wayes laid open, and appear as well as we. <hi>Before the Iudgement ſeat of Chriſt; i.e.</hi> before the redeemer of the world, to be Judged by him as our Rightful Lord. <hi>That every one,</hi> even of all mankind which are, were, or ſhall be, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>May receive,</hi> that is, may receive his ſentence adjudging him to his due; and then may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the execution of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and may go away from the barr with that Reward or Puniſhment that is his due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law by which he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100550:16"/>
is Judged. <hi>The things done in his body,</hi> that is, the due Reward of the works done in his body: or as ſome copies read it, <hi>The things proper to the body,</hi> i.e. due to the man, even body as well as ſoul. <hi>According to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad</hi>: i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>e. This is the cauſe to be tried and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether men have done well or ill whiles they were in the fleſh, and what is due to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deeds. <hi>Knowing therefore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i.e.</hi> Being certain therefore that theſe things are ſo, and that ſuch a Terrible Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt will come, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to become Chriſtians and live as ſuch, that they may then ſpeed well when others ſhall ſhall be deſtroyed: or as others, <hi>Knowing the fear of the Lord,</hi> that is, the true Religion, <hi>we perſwade men.</hi>

            <p>The ordinary method for the handling of this ſubject of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be this. 1.

               <p n="2">2. As alſo, God as Redeemer; the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt having a derived ſubordinate power. God loſt not his right to his creature either by mans fall, or the Redemption by Chriſt, but by the latter hath a new and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right: but it is in and by Chriſt that God Judgeth: For as <hi>meer Creator of innocent man,</hi> God judgeth none, but hath committed all Judgement to the Son, who hath procured this right by the redeeming of fallen man, <hi>John</hi> 5.22. But as the Son only doth it in the neereſt ſenſe, ſo the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Creator doth it remotely and principally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that the power of the Son is derived from the Father, and ſo ſtandeth in ſubordination to him as Fountain or Efficient.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100550:20"/>2. In that the Judgement of the Son (as alſo his whole Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip) to bring men to God their maker as their ultimate end, and recover them to him from whom they are faln, and ſo as a means to that end, the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſon is ſubordinate to the Father.</p>
               <p>From hence you may ſee theſe following Truths worthy your conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all men are Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and none are the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of themſelves or any other; or elſe the Creator ſhould not Judge them on that right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Chriſt dyed for All, and is the Redeemer of the world, and a ſacrifice for All; or elſe he ſhould not Judge them on that Right. For he will not Judge wicked men as he will do the Devils, as the <hi>meer enemies</hi> of his Redeemed ones, but as being

themſelves his ſubjects in the world, and being bought by him, and therefore become his own, who ought to have glorified him that bought them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Hence it appeareth that all men were under ſome Law of Grace, and did partake of ſome of the Redeemers mercy. Though the Goſpel came not to all, yet all had that <hi>mercy</hi> which could come from no other Fountain but his Blood, and which ſhould have brought them neerer to Chriſt then they were, (though it were not ſufficient to bring them to believe:) and which ſhould have led them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.

there a thought paſs thy a heart, or a word paſs thy mouth, which God was not acquainted with: and as he knows them, ſo he doth obſerve them. He is not as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect man, taken up with other buſineſs, ſo that he cannot mind <hi>All.</hi> As eaſie is it with him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve every Thought, or Word, or Action of thine, as if he had but <hi>that one</hi> in the world to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: and as eaſie to obſerve each particular ſinner, as if he had not another creature to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the world.

Righteouſneſs may be perverted here on earth, by out-witting the Judge; but ſo will it not be then: To hope any of this, is to hope that God will not be God.

though it muſt firſt be evinced that we are ſinners, and have deſerved Death according to the Law of pure nature; yet that is not the upſhot of the Judgement.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This may be gathered from what was laſt ſaid. The great Cauſe of the Day will be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and determine, who ſhall dye and who ſhall live; who ought to go to heaven, and who to hell for ever, according to the Law by which they muſt then be Iudged.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As there is a twofold Law by which they muſt be Iudged, ſo will there then be a twofold Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. The firſt will be, that they were <hi>ſinners,</hi> and ſo having violated the Law of God, they Deſerve Everlaſting Death ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Law; If no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

                  </gap>ld; for it is moſt certain that all are ſinners, and as certain that all ſin deſerveth Death. The only defence againſt this Accuſation lyeth in this Plea: Confeſſing the charge, we muſt plead that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for ſins, and upon that conſideration God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us; and therefore being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, we ought not to be puniſhed; To prove this we muſt ſhew the pardon under Gods hand in the Goſpel. But becauſe this pardoning Act of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel doth forgive none but thoſe that Repent and Believe, and ſo return to God, and to ſincere Obedience for the time to come; therefore the next Accuſation will be, that <hi>we did not perform theſe Conditions of forgiveneſs; and therefore being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and Rebels againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100550:31"/>
we have no right to pardon, but by the ſentence of the Goſpel, are lyable to a greater puniſhment, for this contempt of Chriſt and Grace.</hi> This Accuſation is either <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe</hi>; where it is <hi>true,</hi> God and Conſcience who ſpeak the truth may well be ſaid to be the Accuſers: Where it is <hi>falſe,</hi> it can be only the work of Satan the malitious adverſary; who, as we may ſee in <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, will not ſtick to bring a falſe Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>If any think that the Accuſer will not do ſo vain a work, at leaſt they may ſee that <hi>potentially,</hi> this is the Accuſation that lyeth againſt us and which we muſt be juſtified againſt. For all <hi>Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> implyeth an <hi>Actual</hi> or <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Accuſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that is truly accuſed of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Impenitency, or Unbelief, or Rebellion, hath no other Defence
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100550:31"/>
to make, but muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>He that is falſly accuſed of ſuch non-performance of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt deny the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and plead his own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteouſneſs as againſt that Accuſation, and produce that Faith, Repentance and ſincere Obedience and Perſeverance by which he fulfilled that Condition, and ſo is <hi>Evangelically Righteous</hi> in himſelf, and therefore hath part in the blood of Chriſt which is inſtead of a <hi>Legal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all things elſe, as having procured him a pardon of all his ſin, and a right to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory.</p>
               <p>And thus we muſt then be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Chriſts ſatisfaction only, againſt the accuſation of being <hi>ſinners in general,</hi> and of deſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods wrath for the Breach of the Law of works: But we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100550:32"/>
muſt be juſtified by our faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and ſincere Obedience it ſelf, againſt the accuſation of being <hi>Impenitent, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, and Rebels againſt Chriſt,</hi> and having not performed the Condition of the promiſe, and ſo having no part in Chriſt and his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>
               <p>So that in ſumm you ſee, that the cauſe of the day will be to enquire, whether being all known ſinners, we have accepted of Chriſt upon his terms, and ſo have right in him and his benefits, or not? Whether they have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this vain world for him, and loved him ſo faithfully, that they have manifeſted it, in parting with theſe things at his Command. And this is the meaning of <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Where the enquiry is made to be, whether they have fed and viſited him in his members, or not? That is, whether they have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100550:32"/>
ſo far loved him as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and God by him, as that they have manifeſted this to his members according to Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it coſt them the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard or loſs of all: Seeing danger, and labor, and coſt, are fitter to expreſs Love by, then empty Complements and bare Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Whether it be particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after, or only taken for granted that men are <hi>ſinners,</hi> and have deſerved Death according to the <hi>Law of works,</hi> and that Chriſt hath ſatisfied by his death, is all one as to the matter in hand, ſeeing Gods enquiry is but the Diſcovery and Conviction of us.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a five fold Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence among men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. When the fact is notorious. 2. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an unſuſpected Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100550:35"/>
Iudge. 3. The parties Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion. 4. Witneſs. 5. Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and viſible effects of the action. All theſe Evidences will be at hand, and any one of them ſufficient for the conviction of the guilty perſon at that day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the ſins of <hi>all men</hi>; ſo the <hi>Impenitency</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> was notorious, or at leaſt will be then. For though ſome play the hypocrites and hide the matter from the world and themſelves, yet God ſhall open their hearts and former lives to themſelves, and to the view of all the world. He ſhall ſet their ſins in order before them ſo, that it ſhall be utterly in vain to deny or excuſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If any men will then think to make their cauſe as good to God as they can now do to us, that are not able to ſee their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will be foully miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Now they can ſay they have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100550:35"/>
as good hearts as the beſt: then God will bring them out in the light; and ſhew them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and all the world, whether they were good or bad. Now they will face us down that they do truly Repent, and they obey God as well as they can, but God that knoweth the Deceivers, will then undeceive them. We cannot now make men acquainted with their own unſanctified hearts, nor convince them that have not true Faith, Repentance or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but God will convince them of it; They can find ſhifts and falſe anſwers to put off a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> with; but <hi>God</hi> will not ſo be ſhifted off. Let <hi>us</hi> preach as plainly to them as we can and do all that ever we are able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with the impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and unholyneſs of their own heart, and the neceſſity of a new heart and life, yet we cannot do
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100550:36"/>
it; but they will Believe whether we will or not, that the old heart will ſerve the turn; But how eaſily will <hi>God</hi> make them know the contrary? <hi>We</hi> plead with them in the dark; for though we have the candle of the Goſpel in our hands when we come to ſhew them their corruption, yet they ſhut their eyes, and are wilfully blind. But <hi>God</hi> will open their eyes whether they will or not, not by <hi>holy Illumination,</hi> but by <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced conviction</hi>; and then he will plead with them as in the open light. <hi>See here thy own unholy ſoul, canſt thou now ſay thou didſt love me above all? canſt thou deny but thou didſt love this world before me? and ſerve thy fleſh and luſts, though I told thee if thou didſt ſo thou ſhouldſt dye? Look upon thy own heart now, and ſee whether it be a holy or an unholy heart; a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or a fleſhly heart; a heavenly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100550:36"/>
or an earthly heart? Look now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the courſe of thy life, and ſee whether thou didſt live to me, or to the world and thy fleſh?</hi> Oh how eaſily will God convince men then of the very ſins of their thoughts, and in their ſecret Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, when they thought that no witneſs could have diſcloſed them! Therefore its ſaid, that the Books ſhall be opened, and the dead Iudged out of the books, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Evidence will be <hi>the knowledge of the Judge.</hi> If the <hi>ſinner</hi> would not be <hi>convinced,</hi> yet it is ſufficient that the <hi>Judge</hi> knoweth the Cauſe; God needeth no further witneſs; he ſaw thee committing adultery in ſecret, lying, ſtealing, forſwearing in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. If thou do not know thy own heart to be unholy, it is enough that God knoweth it. If you have the face to ſay, <hi>Lord,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100550:37"/>
when did we ſee thee hungry</hi>? &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.44. yet God will make good the charge againſt thee, and there needeth no more Teſtimony then his own. Can fooliſh ſinners think to lie hid or eſcape at that day, that will now ſin <hi>wilfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Judge</hi>? that know every day that their <hi>Judge</hi> is <hi>looking</hi> on them while they forget him, and give up themſelves to the world, and yet go on even under his eye, as if to his face they dared him to puniſh them?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Evidence will be, <hi>the ſinners Confeſſion.</hi> God will force their own Conſciences to witneſs againſt them, and their own tongues to confeſs the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. If they do at firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it, he will leave them ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, yea and condemning themſelves before they have done.</p>
               <p>Oh what a difference between
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100550:37"/>
their language now and then! <hi>Now</hi> we cannot tell them of their ſin and miſery, but they either tell us of our own faults, or bid us look to our ſelves, or deny or excuſe their fault, or make light of it; but <hi>then</hi> their own tongues ſhall confeſs them, and cry out of the wilful folly that they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and lay a heavyer charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them then we can now do. <hi>Now</hi> if we tell them that we are afraid they are unregenerate, and leaſt their hearts are not truly ſet upon God; they will tell us they hope to be ſaved with ſuch hearts as they have; But <hi>then,</hi> Oh how they will confeſs the folly and falſneſs of their own hearts! You may ſee a little of their caſe even in deſpairing ſinners on earth, how far they are from denying or excuſing their ſins. <hi>Judas</hi> crys out. <hi>I have ſinned in betraying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, Mat.</hi> 27.4. out of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100550:38"/>
their own mouth ſhall they be Judged. That very tongue that now excuſeth their ſin, will in their torments be their great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer. For God will have it ſo to be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Evididence will be the <hi>witneſs of others.</hi> Oh how many thouſand witneſſes might there be produced, were there need, to convince the guilty ſoul at that day!</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the Miniſters of Chriſt that ever preached to them, or warned them, will be ſufficient witneſſes againſt them: <hi>we muſt needs</hi> teſtifie that we preached to them the truth of the Goſpel, and they would not believe it. We preached to them the goodneſs of God, yet they ſet not their hearts upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhewed them their ſin, and they were not humbled. We told them of the danger of an unregenerate ſtate,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100550:38"/>
and they did not regard us: we acquainted them with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Neceſſity of holineſs, but they made light of all: We let them know the deceitfulneſs of their hearts, and the need of a cloſe and faithful examination, but they would not beſtow an hour in ſuch a work; nor ſcarce once be afraid of being miſtaken and miſcarrying. We let them know the vanity of this world, and yet they would not forſake it, no not for Chriſt and the hopes of glory: We told them of the everlaſting felicity they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but they would not ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſeek it.</p>
               <p>What we ſhall think of it <hi>then,</hi> the Lord knows; but ſurely it ſeemeth <hi>now</hi> to us a matter of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſad conſideration, that we muſt be brought in as witneſſes againſt the ſouls of our neighbors and friends in the fleſh. Thoſe whom
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100550:39"/>
we now unfeignedly love, and would do any thing that we were able to do for their good, whoſe well fare is dearer to us then all worldly enjoyments: Alas, that we muſt be forced to teſtifie to their faces for their condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Ah Lord, with what a heart muſt a poor Miniſter ſtudy, when he conſidereth this, that all the words that he is ſtudying muſt be brought in for a witneſs againſt many of his hearers! with what a heart muſt a Miniſter Preach, when he remembreth that all the words that he is ſpeaking muſt condemn many, if not moſt of his hearers! Do we deſire this ſad fruit of our Labours? No: we may ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.16. <hi>I have not deſired the woful day, thou knoweſt</hi>: No, if we deſired it, we would not do ſo much to prevent it: we would not ſtudy, and preach, and pray,

But if men will not hear, and there be no remedy, who can help it?

Alas! we are not our own Maſters. As we now ſpeak not to you in our own names, ſo then we may not do what we liſt our ſelves, or if we might, our wills will be as Gods will. God will make us Judge you, &amp; witneſs againſt you: Can we abſolve you, when the righteous God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you? when God is againſt you, whoſe ſide would you have us be of?

Many a time did we intreat them to try whether they were Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or not? whether Chriſt and his Spirit were in them, or not?

The drunkard ſhall Remember, In ſuch an Ale-houſe I was ſo oft drunk, and in ſuch a Tavern I vvaſted my time; The Adulterer and Fornicator ſhall Remember the very Time, the Place, the Room, the Bed, vvhere they committed vvicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

               <p n="3">3. The very effects alſo of mens ſins will be an Evidence againſt them. The wife and children of a Drunkard are Impoveriſhed by his ſin: His family and the neighborhod is diſquieted by him. Theſe will be ſo many Evidences againſt him.

               <p>One covetous unmerciful Landlord doth keep a hundred, or many hundred perſons or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in ſo great neceſſities, and care and labour, that they are tempted by it to overpaſs the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

               <p>Yea, the poor whom they have neglected to relieve, when they might; the ſick whom they have neglected to viſit, when they might, will all witneſs then againſt the unmerciful, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>The many ignorant, worldly, careleſs ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, that have periſhed under an idle, unfaithful Miniſter, will be ſo many witneſſes againſt him to his Condemnation!

               <p n="2">2. And as theſe Evidences will convince men of ſin, ſo there are many more which will convince them of the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of their ſin. And theſe are ſo many that it would too much lengthen my diſcourſe to ſtand on them. A few I ſhall briefly touch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The very mercy of God in <hi>Creating</hi> men, in giving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their <hi>Being</hi> to them, will be an Evidence for the Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſin againſt him. What? will you abuſe him, by whom it is that you are men? will you ſpeak to his diſhonor,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100550:55"/>
that giveth you your ſpeech? will will you live to his diſhonour who giveth you your Lives? will you wrong him by his own creatures? and neglect him without whom you cannot ſubſiſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Redemption of men by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, will be an evidence to the exceeding Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their ſins. You ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Lord that bought you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.

Muſt Chriſt Redeem you by ſo dear a price from ſin and miſery, and yet will you continue the ſervants of ſin, and prefer your ſlavery before your freedom, and chooſe to be Satans drudges, rather then to be the ſervants of God? The ſorrows and ſufferings that Chriſt underwent for you,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100550:55"/>
will then prove the increaſe of your own ſorrows. As a neglected Redeemer, it is that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you. And then you would be glad that it were but true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that Chriſt never d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You will then underſtand that you were not your own, but were bought with a price, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100550:56"/>
therefore ſhould have glorified him that Bought you, with your Bodies and Spirits, becauſe they were His, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. This one Aggravation of your ſin will make you doubly and remedileſly miſerable, that you Trod under foot the Son of God, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the blood of the Covenant, wherewith you were ſanctified, an unholy thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27, 28, 29. and crucified to your ſelves the Son of God a freſh, and put him to open ſhame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover; All the perſonal mercies which they received, will be ſo many Evidences for the condemnation of the ungodly. The very earth that bore them, and yielded them its fruits, while they themſelves were unfruitful to God: The Aire which they breathed in: the food which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the cloaths which

covered them, the houſes which they dwelt in, the beaſts that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for them, and all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that dyed for their uſe: All theſe may riſe up againſt them to their condemnation. And the Judge may thus expoſtulate with them, [Did all theſe mercies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no more Thanks? ſhould you not have ſerved him that ſo liberally maintained you? God thought not all theſe too good for you, and did you think your hearts and ſervices too good for him? He ſerved you with the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry labours of your fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and ſhould you have grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear his eaſie Yoak? They were your ſlaves and drudges, and you refuſed to be his free ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and his ſons? They ſuffered Death to feed your Bodies, and you would not ſuffer the ſhort forbearance of a little forbidden fleſhly pleaſure, for the ſake of

               <p>Oh how many thouſand mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God will then be review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe that neglected them to the horrour of their ſouls, when they ſhall be upbraided by the Judge with their baſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal! All the deliverances from ſickneſs and from danger; all the honours, and priviledges, and other commodities, which ſo much contented them, will then be Gods Evidences to ſhame them and confound them.

Moreover, All the means which God uſed for the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſinners in the day of their viſitation, will riſe up againſt the Impenitent ſouls, in Judgement to their condemnation. You can hear Sermons careleſsly and ſleepily now; but O that you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how the review of them will then awake you! You now make light of the warnings of God and man, and of all the wholſom advice that is given you: but God will not then make light of your contempt. Oh what cutting Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions will they be to the hearts of the ungodly, when all the means that were uſed for their good, are brought to their remembrance on one ſide, and the temptations that drew them to ſin on the other ſide, and the Lord ſhall plead his

Now is the time for you to beſtir your ſelves; Life and Death are are before you. You have gales of Grace to further your voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: There are more for you then againſt you. God will help you: his Spirit will help you: his

Miniſters will help you: every good Chriſtian will help you; the Angels themſelves will help you, if you will but reſolvedly ſet your ſelves to the work; And yet will you not ſtir? Patience is waiting on you; Mercies are enticing you; Scourges are driving you; Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtayeth for you; the Lights of God ſtand burning by you to direct you; And yet will you not ſtir, but lie in darkneſs? And do you think you ſhall not hear of this? Do you think this will not one day coſt you dear?</p>

               <p>Having already ſhewed you what the Defence muſt be, that muſt be ſufficient to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>If any firſt demand, Whether the Evidence of their ſin will not ſo overwhelm the ſinner, that he will be ſpeechleſs and paſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe? I anſw.

For <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. Chriſt telleth us, that [Many will ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name have

               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:100550:61"/>It is clear then, that Excuſes they will be ready to make, and their full Conviction will be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after theſe Excuſes (at leaſt as in their minds, if not in words); But what the particular excuſes will be, we may partly know by theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scriptures which recite them, and partly by hearing what the ungodly do now ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And becauſe it is for their preſent benefit that I now make mention of them, that they may ſee the vanity of all ſuch Excuſes, I will mention them as I now meet with them in the mouths of ſinners in our ordinary diſcourſe. And theſe Excuſes are of ſeveral ſorts; ſome by which they would Juſtifie their eſtate; ſome excuſes of particular Actions; and that either in whole, or in part; ſome by which they would put by the penalty, though they confeſs the ſin; ſome by which they lay the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100550:61"/>
blame on other men; and in ſome they vvould caſt it upon God himſelf. I muſt touch but ſome of them very briefly.</p>
               <p>The firſt Excuſe. <hi>I am not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe things which I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of. I did love God above All, and my Neighbor as my ſelf; I did uſe the world but for Neceſsity, but God had my heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The All-ſeeing Judge doth know the contrary; and he will make thy conſcience know it. Look back man, upon thy heart and Life Hovv ſeldom and hovv neglectfully didſt thou think of God? hovv coldly didſt thou vvorſhip him, or make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him? hovv careleſsly didſt thou ſerve him? and think much of all that thou d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dſt therein? Thou rather thoughteſt that his ſervice vvas making more ado than needs, and didſt grudge at thoſe that vvere more diligent
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100550:62"/>
than thy ſelf; But for the world, How heartily, and how conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly didſt thou ſeek and ſerve it. And yet wouldſt thou now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Judge that thou didſt Love God above all? He will ſhew thee thy naked Heart, and the courſe of thy former life, which ſhall convince thee of the contrary.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Excuſe. <hi>I lived not in any Groſs ſin, but only in ſmall Infirmities. I was no Murderer, or Adulterer, or Fornicator, or Thief; nor did I deceive or wrong any, or take any thing by violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Was it not a Groſs ſin, to love the world above God, and to neglect Chriſt that dyed for thee? and never do him one hours hearty ſervice, but meerly to ſeek thy carnal ſelf, and live to thy fleſh? God will open thine eyes then, and ſhew thee a thouſand Groſs ſins, which thou now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100550:62"/>
or makeſt light of. And it is not only Groſs ſins, but All ſin, great or ſmall that deſerveth the wrath of God, and will certainly bring thee under it for ever, if thou have not part in Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thee: wo to the man that ever he was born that muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in his own name for his ſmalleſt offences.</p>
               <p>The third Excuſe. <hi>I did it Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly: I knew not that there was ſo much required to my ſalvation. I thought leſs ado might have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the turn: and that if I lookt to my body, God would take care of my ſoul: and that it was better to truſt him what ſhould become of me hereafter, then to trouble my mind ſo much about it. Had I known better, I would have done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you knew not better, who was it long of but your ſelf? Did God hide theſe things
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100550:63"/>
from you? Did he not tell them you in his word as plainly as the tongue of man can ſpeak, That except you were Regenerate and born again, you ſhould not enter into the Kingdom of God? <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5. That without holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs none ſhould ſee God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. That you muſt <hi>ſtrive</hi> to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; for many ſhall <hi>ſeek</hi> to enter, and ſhall not be able, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. That if you lived after the fleſh you ſhould dye; and if by the Spirit you mortified the deeds of the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſhould live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. That if any man have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. And to be carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded is death: but to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded is life and peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. That you muſt not lay up for your ſelves a treaſure on earth, where ruſt and moths do corrupt, and thieves break
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100550:63"/>
through and ſteal, but muſt lay up for your ſelves a rreaſure in heaven, where ruſt and moths do not corrupt, and thieves do not break through and ſteal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19, 20. That you muſt ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and the Righteouſneſs thereof, <hi>Mat</hi> 6.23. and not Labour for the food that periſheth, but for the food that endureth to everlaſting life, which Chriſt would have given you, <hi>John</hi> 6.27. That if you be riſen with Chriſt, you muſt ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not the things that are on earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. Yea your very Converſation ſhould be in Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19.20, 21.</p>
               <p>What ſay you, Did not God tell you all this and much more? and plainly tell it you? Turn to your Bibles, and ſee the words,

and let them witneſs againſt you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And could you think with any Reaſon, that your ſouls being ſo much more precious then your bodies, you ſhould yet do ſo much more for your bodies then your ſouls? Could you think all the labour of your lives little enough for a frail body, that muſt he ſhortly in the dirt; and that your Immortal ſouls ſhould be no more regarded? Could you think with any Reaſon, that you ſhould do ſo much for a life of a few years continuance and do no more for a life that ſhall have no end?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And whereas you talk of <hi>truſting God with your ſouls,</hi> you did not truſt him: You did but on that pretence, careleſsly diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them. If you truſt God, ſhew any word of Promiſe that ever he gave you to truſt upon, that ever an Impenitent, Carnal, Careleſs perſon ſhall be ſaved?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100550:64"/>
No: he hath told you enough to the contrary And could you think that it was the will of God, that you ſhould mind your bodies more then your ſouls, and this life more then that to come? Why, he hath bid you ſtrive, and run, and fight, and labour, and care, and ſeek, and uſe violence, and all diligence for the ſafety of your ſouls, and for the life to come: But where hath he bid you do ſo for your bodies? No, he knew that you were prone to do too much for them; and therefore he hath bid you, [Care not, and Labour not] that is, Do it as if you did it not: and let your Care and Labour for earthly things be none in compariſon of that for heavenly things. You know God can as well maintain your lives without your care and labour, as ſave your ſouls without it: And yet you ſee he will not, he doth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100550:65"/>
not: You muſt plough, and ſow, and reap, and threſh, for all Gods Love and Care of you, and not ſay, I will let all alone and truſt God. And muſt you not much more uſe diligence in much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things? If you will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fourth Excuſe. <hi>I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought up to learning, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as read: Nor did my Parents ever teach me any of theſe things, but only ſet me about my worldly buſineſs, and provide food and rayment for me: but never once told me that I had a ſoul to ſave or loſe, and an everlaſting life to provide and prepare for. And therefore I could not come to the knowledge of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The greater is their ſin, who thus neglected you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this is no ſufficient Excuſe for you.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100550:65"/>
Heaven is not prepared for the Learned only: nor will Chriſt ask you at Judgement, whether you were good Scholars, or not, no nor ſo much as whether you could write or read. But conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well! was not Gods word ſo plainly written, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned might underſtand it? Did he not put it into the moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſtile, though he knew it would be offenſive to the proud Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the world of purpoſe that he might fit it to the capacities of the ignorant? And if you could not read, yet tell me, Could not you have learned to read at 20, or 30 years of age, if you had been but willing to beſtow now and then an hour to that end? Or at leaſt, did you not live neer ſome that could Read? and could you not have procured them to read to you, or to help you? And did you not hear theſe things
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100550:66"/>
read to you in the Congregation by the Miniſter? or might have done if you would? And if your Parents did neglect you in your youth, yet when you came to a fuller uſe of Reaſon, and heard of the matters of ſalvation from Gods Word, did it not concern you to have looked to your ſelves; and to have redeemed that time which you loſt in your youth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by doubling your diligence when you came to riper years? The Apoſtles gathered Churches among Heathens that never heard of Chriſt before; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted many thouſand ſouls that were never once told of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or the way to ſalvation, till they had paſt a great part of their lives. If you loitered till the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the day, it behoved you then to have beſtirred your ſelves the more: and not to ſay, Through the fault of my Parents,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100550:66"/>
I loſt the beginning of my life, and therefore I will loſe all: they taught me not then, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not learn now. Have you not ſeen ſome of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, who were as ill educated as your ſelves, attain to much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge afterwards by their Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry? And why might not you have done ſo, if you had been as induſtrious as they? May not God and Conſcience witneſs, that it was becauſe you cared not for knowledge, and would not be at the pains to get it, that you knew no more? Speak truth, man, in the preſence of thy Judge, was thy heart and mind ſet upon it? Didſt thou pray daily for it to God? Didſt thou uſe all the means thou couldeſt to get it? Didſt thou attend diligently on the word in publike, and think of what thou heardeſt when thou cameſt home? Didſt thou go to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100550:67"/>
the Miniſter, or to others that could teach thee, and intreat them to tell thee the way to ſalvation? Or didſt thou not rather careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect theſe matters; and hear a Sermon as a common tale, even when the miniſter was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Heaven or Hell? It was not then thine unavoidable Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but thy negligence.</p>
               <p>Yea further, anſwer as in the preſence of God: Didſt thou Obey ſo far as thou <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ninth Excuſe. <hi>I lived among ungodly perſons, that derided all that feared God; ſo that if I had not done as they did, but had made any more ado to be ſaved, I ſhould have been the very ſcorn of the place where I lived.</hi>

And ſeeing ſo ſmall a matter would drive you from heaven, and part God and you as a mock, as the wind of a mans mouth, No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if you be commanded, to Depart from him into everlaſting fire.</p>
               <p>The tenth Excuſe. <hi>I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſons to my Parents, or Maſters, or Landlord, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, who threatned to undo me, if I had addicted my ſelf to ſo ſtrict a life, and if I would not believe and do as they did.</hi>

                  <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body, and after that can do no more; but fear him that is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell fire; yea I ſay unto you, fear him.

Chriſt told you before hand, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100550:72"/>
if you could not forſake all the world and your own lives for him, you could not be his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37, 38, 39. And ſeeing you thought his terms too hard, and would needs ſeek you out a better ſervice, even take what you have choſen and found.</p>
               <p>The eleventh Excuſe. <hi>I ſaw ſo many follow their pleaſures and their worldly buſineſs, and never look after theſe higher things, and ſo few go the other way, that I thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſure God would not damn ſo great a part of the world; and therefore I ventured to do as the moſt did.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God will make good his word upon many or few. Did you doubt of his will, or of his power? For his will, he hath told it you in his word. For his power, he is as able to puniſh many as one man. What is all the world to him, but as a drop of a Bucket,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100550:73"/>
as the duſt of the ballance; He told you before hand that the gate was ſtrait, and the way to heaven was narrow, and few did find it, and the gate to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was wide, and the way was broad, and many did enter in at it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13, 14. And if you would not Believe him, you muſt bear what your unbelief hath brought you to. What if you had twenty children, or ſervants, or friends: and the greater part of them ſhould prove falſe to you, and ſeek your deſtruction, or prove diſobedient, and turn to your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? would you think it a good excuſe, if the reſt ſhould do the like, becauſe of their example? will you therefore wrong God, becauſe you ſee others wrong him? would you ſpit in the face of your own Father, if you ſaw others do ſo? God warned you, that you ſhould not follow a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

And if yet you will <hi>do</hi> as moſt <hi>do,</hi> you muſt even <hi>ſpeed</hi> as moſt <hi>ſpeed.</hi> You ſhould not ſo much conſider, who they be, as what they do, and whether they go, and who they forſake, and what they loſe, and what ſtrength is in the Reaſons that move them to do this. And then you would find, It is <hi>God</hi> they forſake, it is <hi>ſin</hi> they chooſe, it is <hi>heaven</hi> they loſe, it is <hi>hell</hi> they run into, and it is no true reaſon, but Satans deluſion, and ſenſual inclinations that lead them to it.

               <p>The twelfth Excuſe. <hi>I ſaw ſo many faults in thoſe that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Godly, and ſaw ſo much Diviſion among them, that I thought they were as bad as others; and among ſo many opinions, I knew not what Religion to be of.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. And for their diverſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you ſhould have taken coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel at Gods word, which was right: Did you firſt ſearch the Scripture impartially, as willing to know the Truth, that you might obey it? and did you pray daily that God would lead you into the Truth? and did you obey as much as you knew? Did you joyn with the godly ſo far as they are all agreed? They are all agreed in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental

Articles of Chriſtianity, and in all things abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to a holy Life, and to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that all known ſin is to be forſaken, and all known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be done. Why did you not ſo far then agree with them? Alas, the imperfections of the godly, and the falſe Accuſations of the malicious world, will prove but a poor cover for your wilful ungodlineſs, and Chriſt will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of the vanity of theſe Excuſes.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth Excuſe. <hi>The Scriptures were ſo dark, that I could not underſtand them. And I ſaw the wiſeſt men differ ſo much in the expoſition of them, that I thought it was in vain for me to trouble my ſelf about them.

The plaineſt Greek or Hebrew Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that can be written, will be utterly obſcure to him that is but newly entred the Engliſh School: yea after many years time that he ſpends in learning. Did you ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hard, and pray for Gods teaching, and enquire of others, and wait patiently in Chriſts School, that you might come to further knowledge by Degrees? and were you <hi>willing</hi> to know, even thoſe Truths that called you out to ſelf denyal, and that did put you on the hardeſt fleſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing duties?

               <p>The fourteenth Excuſe. <hi>There were ſo many ſeeming Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Scripture, and ſo many ſtrange improbable things, that I could not believe it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The contradictions were in your fancy, that did not underſtand the word which you read. Muſt the raw unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Learner deſpiſe his book or Teacher, as oft as in his ignorance he thinks he meets with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions? Did you think God was no wiſer then you, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not himſelf, becauſe you underſtood him not? Nor could

reconcile his own words, becauſe you could not reconcile them? You would needs be a Judge of the Law, inſtead of obeying it, and ſpeak evil of it, rather then do it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And thoſe things which you called improbable in the word, were the wonders of God, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to confirm it. If it had not been confirmed by wonders, you would have thought it unproved: and yet now it is ſo confirmed, you will not believe the Doctrine, becauſe the witneſs ſeems incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. And that is, becauſe they are matters above the power of man: As if they were therefore above the power of God! You ſhall at laſt have your eyes ſo far opened, as to ſee thoſe ſeeming contradictions reconciled, and the certainty of thoſe things which you accounted Improbable: that you may be forced to confeſs the

Could you expect that thoſe ſhould come to heaven, that would not believe there was ſuch a ſtate, but refuſed it, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the world before it?

Every thing is hard and grievous to him who loaths it, and whoſe heart is againſt it. The chief thing that God called you to, was to <hi>Love</hi> him, and make him your <hi>Delight.</hi> And are Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſuch grievous things? It was not grievous to you to love your meat, or drink, or money: It was no hard matter to you to love a friend that loved you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no nor to love your ſin, which was your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: And what ſhould make it ſeem hard to Love God, but a wicked heart? Is not he Better, and more Lovely then all theſe? And had you but Loved him, all the reſt of his ſervice would have ſeemed eaſie to you. To think of him, to ſpeak of him, to pray to

               <p>The eighteenth Excuſe. <hi>It was God that made me of a ſenſual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: he gave me an Appetite to Meat, and Drink, and Eaſe, and Luſt; He gave me that fleſh which ruled me: How then can he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me, for living according to the nature which he gave me?</hi>

               <p n="2">2. And whereas you ſpeak of the power of theſe objects, was there not much more in God, in Chriſt, in the promiſed glory, to have drawn your heart another way? why then did not theſe take

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your will was not free from Gods Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; nor was it free from its natural inclination to Good in general; for either of theſe were more properly ſlavery. 3. Nor was it free from the Influence of a dark underſtanding. 4. Nor free

from its own contracted vitious Inclination. 5. Nor freed from the Temptations of the fleſh, the world and the Devil.</p>
               <p>But it was 1. Free from any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Determination to evil, or to any thing that was doubtful. 2. And free from the Coaction or Violence of any. 3. And free from an irreſiſtible Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any exterior cauſe, at leaſt, ordinarily. So that naturally, as men, you have the power or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of determining your own wills, and by your wills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Ruling your inferiour Faculties in a great meaſure; yea of Ruling the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Phantaſie it ſelf, which doth ſo much to diſpoſe of our Underſtanding. And if your wills which are naturally free, are yet ſo habitually vitious, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline you to do evil, that is not an excuſe, but an Aggravation of your ſin. But of this more, under the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:100550:85"/>The two and twentieth Excuſe. <hi>But I have not Power of myſelf to do any thing that is good: What can the creature do? without Chriſt we can do nothing. It is God that muſt give me Ability, or I can have none: and if he had given it me, I had not been an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever or Impenitent. I can no more Believe of my ſelf, than I can fulfill the Law of my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe are the vain Cavils of learned folly, which God will eaſily anſwer in a word. The word [Power] is taken in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſenſes. Sometime, and moſt commonly and fitly, for a faculty or ſtrength by which a man <hi>Can</hi> do his duty if he <hi>Will.</hi> This Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Power you have, and the worſt of ſinners have while they are men on earth. Were they Actually willing, they might Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably perform ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; And were they Diſpoſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100550:86"/>
willing, they might Actually Believe and will. And thus the ungodly have Power to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometime the word [Power] is taken for Authority, or Leave; for legal or civil Power. And thus you have all not only Power or Liberty to Believe; but alſo a Command, which makes it your Duty, and a Threatning adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which will condemn you if you do not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometime the word [Power] is taken Ethically and leſs proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for a Diſpoſition, Inclination, Habit or Freedom from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary habit or diſpoſition. And in this ſenſe, its true, that none but the effectually called have a Power to Believe. But then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, 1. That this is but a moral leſs proper, and not a Phyſical proper Impotency: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Auſtin</hi> chuſeth rather to ſay,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100550:86"/>
that all men have <hi>power</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but all have not a <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf; becauſe we uſe to difference <hi>Power</hi> from <hi>willingneſs</hi>; and <hi>willingneſs</hi> actuateth the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> which we had before. And therefore our Divines chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to call Grace a Habit, when they ſpeak exactly, then a Power; and Dr.<hi>Twiſs</hi> derides the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians for talking of a <hi>Power</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in a <hi>Power.</hi> 2. Note that this Impotency is but the ſame thing with your unwillingneſs and wilful blindneſs, in another word. 3. Note that this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency is long of our ſelves as to the Original, and much more as to the not-curing and removing of it. Hath God given you no means towards the cure of this diſability, which you have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected? 4. Note that this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency is no juſt excuſe, but an Aggravation of your ſin. If you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100550:87"/>
were <hi>willing</hi> to be the ſervant of Chriſt, and yet were not Able, either becauſe he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you, or becauſe of a want of natural faculties, or becauſe of ſome other natural difficulty which the <hi>willingeſt</hi> mind could not overcome; this were ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: But to be Habitually wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in refuſing Grace, is worſe then to be meerly Actually unwilling. If a man have ſo accuſtomed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to murder, drunkenneſs, ſtealing, or the like wickedneſs, ſo far that he <hi>cannot</hi> leave it, will you therefore forgive him, or will any Judge or Jury hold him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed? Or rather think him the more unfit for mercy? 5. Note alſo that the want of a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Habit, no nor the preſence of the contrary Habit, do not Efficiently determine the will to particular acts: much leſs take away its natural Freedom. 6. And
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100550:87"/>
that till Habits attain an utter predominancy, (at leaſt) there is a Power remaining in the will to reſiſt them, and uſe means againſt them. Though Eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the perverſe Inclination may hinder the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>The three and twentieth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. <hi>I have heard from learned men, that God doth determine all Actions Natural and Free, as the firſt efficient Phyſical Immediate Cauſe; or elſe nothing could Act. And then it was not long of me that I chooſe forbidden Objects, but of him that irreſiſtibly moved me thereto, and whoſe Inſtrument I was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a trick of that wiſdom which is fooliſhneſs with God, and to be deceived by vain Philoſophy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The very principle it ſelf is moſt likely to be falſe, and thoſe that tell you this, to err. Much
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100550:88"/>
more, I think, may be ſaid againſt it then for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I am ſure it is either falſe, or reconcileable with Gods Holineſs, and mans liberty and culpability; ſo that its a mad thing to deceive your ſelves with ſuch Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal uncertainties, when the Truth which you oppoſe by it is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly certain. That God is not the Author of ſin, but man himſelf, who is juſtly condemned for it, is undoubtedly true: and would you obſcure ſo clear a Truth, by ſearching into points beyond hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reach, if not unſound, as you conclude them?</p>
               <p>The four and twentieth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. <hi>But at leaſt, thoſe learned Divines among us that doubt of this, do yet ſay that the will is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily and infallibly Determined by the Practical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and that is as much unreſiſtibly neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by Objects: and therefore
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100550:88"/>
whatever act was done by my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding or will, was thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, and I could not help it. They ſay, Liberty is but the Acting of the faculty agreeably to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And it was God as Creator that gave</hi> Adam <hi>his faculties: and God by providential diſpoſe, that preſented all Objects to him, by which his underſtanding, and ſo his will were unavoidably neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the former; uncertain, if not certainly falſe. Were this true, for ought we can ſee, it would lay all the ſin and miſery of the world on God, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable neceſſitating Cauſe; which becauſe we know infallibly to be falſe, we have no reaſon to take ſuch principles to be true, which infer it. The underſtanding doth not by a neceſſary efficiency Determine the will, but morally;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100550:89"/>
or rather is regularly a Condition or neceſſary Antecedent, without which it may not Determine it ſelf. Yea the will by commanding the ſenſe and phantaſie, doth much to determine the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. As the eye is not neceſſary to my <hi>going,</hi> but to my <hi>going right,</hi> ſo is not the Underſtandings Guidance, neceſſary to my <hi>willing</hi> (there the ſimple Apprehenſion may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) but to my <hi>Right willing.</hi> There are other wayes of Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the will. Or if the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding did Determine the will Efficiently and Neceſſarily, it is not every act of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that muſt do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it be ſo, when it ſaith, This <hi>muſt</hi> be don, &amp; ſaith it importunatly; yet not when it only ſaith, This may be done, or you may venture on it; which is the common part which it hath in ſin.</p>
               <p>I am not pleaſed that theſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Objections fall in the way,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100550:89"/>
nor do I delight to put them into vulgar heads; but finding many young Schollars and others that have converſed with them, aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with theſe Temptations; I thought meet to give a touch, and and but a touch, to take them out of their way; As Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi> hath done more fully in the Preface to his <hi>Hidden Manna,</hi> on this laſt point, to which I refer you. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add this;</p>
               <p>The will of man in its very Dominion doth be are Gods Image. It is a ſelf Determining Power, though it be <hi>byaſſed</hi> by <hi>Habits,</hi> and <hi>needs</hi> a <hi>Guide.</hi> As the Heart and Vital Spirits by which it acteth, are to the reſt of the Body, ſo is <hi>It</hi> to the ſoul. The Light of Nature hath taught all the world, to carry the Guilt of every crime to the <hi>will</hi> of man, and there to leave it; Upon this all Laws and Judgements are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100550:90"/>
grounded. From Ignorance and Intellectual weakneſs, men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fetch. Excuſes for their faults; but from the <hi>Will</hi> they are Aggravated. If we think it ſtrange that mans will ſhould be the firſt cauſe, ſo much as of a ſinful <hi>mode,</hi> and cannot anſwer all occuring Objections; It may ſuffice that we are certain the Holy Majeſty is not the Author of ſin; and he is able to make all this as plain as the Sun, and eaſily anſwer all theſe vain Excuſes, though we ſhould be unable. And if we be much ignorant of the frame and motions of our own ſouls, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of that high ſelf determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning principle, Free-Will, the great ſpring of our Actions, and the curious Engine by which God doth <hi>Sapientially</hi> Govern the world, it is no wonder; Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſoul can know it ſelf but by Reflexion, and God gave
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100550:90"/>
us a ſoul to <hi>uſe,</hi> rather than to know it ſelf; and to know its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and operations, rather then its Eſſence.</p>
               <p>The five and twentieth Excuſe. <hi>No man can be ſaved, nor avoid any ſin, nor believe in Chriſt, but thoſe whom God hath predeſtinated thereto. I was under an irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sentence before I was born: &amp; therefore I do nothing but what I was predeſtinated to do, &amp; if God decreed not to ſave me, how could I help it.</hi>

Gods Judgements are more plain, but his Decrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſecret purpoſes are myſterious; And to darken certainties, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recourſe to points obſcure, is no part of Chriſtian wiſdom.

               <p n="3">3.

And therefore this no more cauſed you to ſin, then if there had been no ſuch Degree. And its a doubt whether that Decree be not negative; A willing ſuſpending of the Divine will, as to evil; or at moſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to permit it.</p>
               <p>The ſix and twentieth Excuſe. <hi>If it be no more, yet doth it make my perdition unavoidable; For even Gods foreknowledge doth ſo;

The Prince that makes a Law againſt murder, could lock you up, and keep you from being a Murderer! But are you excuſable if he do not? We are certain that God could have hindred all the ſin and

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100550:96"/>
not in your perſon, nor you in him: It was not you that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the price, but God himſelf; Chriſt was not mans Delegate in ſatisfying, and therefore received not his Inſtructions from us, nor did it on our terms, but his own. It was not the <hi>ſame thing</hi> which the Law threatned, that Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent: for that was the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſinner himſelf: and not the ſuffering of another for him, it cannot therefore be yours, but on Chriſts own terms. He dyed for thy ſin, but with this intent, that for all that, if thou Refuſe him, thou ſhalt dye thy ſelf. It is therefore no wrong to thee to dye, for it was not thou that dyedſt before: And Chriſt will take it for no wrong to him: For <hi>he</hi> will Judge thee to that Death.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Had this been True, thy ſin would not have condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee. But there is no mocking God. He will ſhew thee then thy naked heart, and convince thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that thought they Believed and Repented, that indeed they did not.

If all thy life had been ſpent in perfect works except one day, they would not make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſins of that day; For they are but part of thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p n="2">2. The Devils and the damned have ſuffered much more than you already: and yet they are never the neerer a deliverance. When thou haſt, ſuffered ten thouſand years, thy pain will be never the neerer an end. How then can a little miſery on earth prevent it? Alas poor ſoul, theſe are but the foretaſts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of thy ſorrow.

had the Goſpel, is more plainly opened to us in Gods word. Their <hi>Sentence</hi> is opened in many places of Scripture, but moſt fully in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. whence we will now collect it.</p>
               <p>There we find that Jeſus Chriſt the Redeemer, as King of the world, ſhall ſit in Judgement on all men at the laſt; and ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth the Sheep from the Goats, and ſo ſhall paſs the final Sentence. This Sentence is twofold, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Condition of them that are Judged. To them on the right hand, there is a Sentence of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and Adjudication to everlaſting glory; To them on the left hand, here is a Sentence of Condemnation to everlaſting Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The Sentence on each of theſe containeth, both the ſtate which
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100550:101"/>
they are Judged to, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or cauſe of the Judgement to that ſtate. For as God will not Judge any to Life or Death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt cauſe, ſo he will publiſh this cauſe in his ſentence, as it is the manner of Judges to do; If you ſay, <hi>Chriſt will not uſe a voice</hi>; Let it ſatisfie, that though we know not the manner, yet if he do it but by mental diſcovery, as he ſhews men <hi>what</hi> ſhall everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly befall them, ſo he will ſhew them <hi>why</hi> it ſhall ſo befall them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Sentence</hi> on them on the <hi>Right</hi> hand, will contain, 1. Their Juſtification and Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> and that both as generally denominated, &amp; as particularly determined and deſcribed. 2. And the cauſe of this Judgement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general they ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Bleſſed.</hi> Satan would

All the Promiſes in the Goſpel could not perfectly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thoſe their fears; all the comfortable words of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſubdue them; all the tender mercies of God in Chriſt did not perfectly ſubdue them; But <hi>now</hi> they are vanquiſhed all for ever.

is called a Kingdom, partly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God the King, in whoſe glory we ſhall partake in our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and partly Metaphorically from the Dignity of our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For ſo it is that our ſelves are ſaid to be made Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. and 5.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and not that we are properly Kings, for then we muſt have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects who muſt be Governed by us.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee their Bleſſedneſs in the Fountain, end and ſtate of Dignity: As to the Receptive Act on their part, it is expreſſed by two words; one ſignifying their firſt entrance on it, <hi>Come</hi>: the other their <hi>Poſſeſſion, Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>: that is, poſſeſs it as given by the Father, and Redeemed by the Son, and hold it in this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure for ever.</p>
               <p>The true Believer was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this life, that indeed there
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100550:103"/>
was no true Bleſſedneſs, but this enjoyment of God in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven. The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed this to his heart by his Word and Spirit: And therefore he contemned the ſeeming Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs on earth, and laid up for himſelf a Treaſure in heaven, and made him friends with the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of unrighteouſneſs, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured all his hopes in this Veſſel. And <hi>now</hi> he findeth the wiſdom of that choice in a rich return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God made him ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant as to ſell All for this Pearl of greateſt price: and therefore now he ſhall find the gain.

                  </gap>m unto this! I leave the believing ſoul to think of it, and to make it the daily matter of his Delightful Meditation. What an unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Joy in one moment, this Sentence of Chriſt will fill his ſoul with. Undoubtedly it is now quite paſt our comprehenſion: though our imperfect fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of it may well make our lives a continual Feaſt.</p>
               <p>Were it but our Juſtification from the Accuſations of Satan, who would have us Condemned either as <hi>ſinners</hi> in general, or as Impenitent, Unbelieving Rebels, againſt him that Redeemed us, in <hi>ſpecial,</hi> it would lift up the heads
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100550:104"/>
of the Saints in that day: After all the fears of our own hearts, and the ſlanderous Accuſations of Satan and the world, That we were either Impenitent Infidels, or Hypocrites, Chriſt will then Juſtifie us and pronounce us <hi>Righteous.</hi> So much for the <hi>Condition to which</hi> they are Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reaſon or Cauſe of this Juſtification of the Saints, is given us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both 1. In a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, and 2. In a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Deſcription. 1. In General, it is becauſe they were <hi>Righteous,</hi> as is evident, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.46. <hi>The righteous ſhall go into life Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And indeed it is the buſineſs of every juſt Judge, to juſtifie the righteous, and condemn the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous. And ſhall not the Judge of all the earth judge righteouſly? <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. God makes men Righteous, before he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100550:104"/>
Judges them ſo: and Judgeth them Righteous <hi>Becauſe</hi> they are ſo. He that abominateth that man who ſaith to the Righteous, thou art wicked, or to the wicked, thou art Righteous, who Juſtifieth the wicked, and Condemneth the Righteous, will certainly never do ſo himſelf.</p>
               <p>Indeed he will Juſtifie them that are ſinners, but not againſt the Accuſation <hi>they that are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>: but againſt the Accusation, that <hi>they are guilty of Puniſhment for ſin</hi>: but that is, becauſe he firſt made them juſt; and ſo Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by pardoning their ſin through the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And its true alſo, that he will Juſtifie thoſe that <hi>were wicked,</hi> but not thoſe that <hi>are wicked</hi>; But Judgement findeth them as Death leaveth them: and he will not take them for wicked, that are ſanctified and cleanſed of their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100550:105"/>
former wickedneſs. So that Chriſt will firſt pardon them, before he juſtifie them againſt the charge of being ſinners in general: and he will firſt give men Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and new Obedience, before he will Juſtifie them againſt the charge of being Impenitent, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels or Hypocrites, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unpardoned, and doubly guilty of damnation. This two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold righteouſneſs, he will firſt <hi>Give</hi> men, and ſo conſtitute them Juſt; before he will <hi>Declare</hi> it, and <hi>Sentence</hi> them juſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reaſon of the Sentence, particularly Deſcribed, is from their Faith and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100550:105"/>
priſon and ye came to me: Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye have done it to one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me, Mat.</hi> 25.35. to 41. Here is 1. The cauſal conjunction <hi>for.</hi> 2. And the Cauſe or Reaſon it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Concerning both which, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, 1. How it is that mans Obedience and ſelf-denyal is The Reaſon and Cauſe of his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 2. Why it is that God will have the Reaſon or Cauſe thus Declared in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; obſerve, that Its one thing to give a Reaſon of the Sentence, and another thing to expreſs the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Benefit, Given</hi> us by the promiſe, and <hi>Judged</hi> to us by the <hi>Sentence.</hi> Mans Obedience was no proper Cauſe why God did in this life <hi>Give</hi> pardon of ſin to us, or a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100550:106"/>
Right to glory: much leſs, of his Giving Chriſt to dye for us. And therefore as to our Conſtitutive Juſtification at our Converſion, we muſt not <hi>ſay</hi> or <hi>think</hi> that God doth Juſtifie us, For or <hi>Becauſe</hi> of any works of our Obedience, Legal or Evangelical. But when God hath ſo Juſtified us, when he comes to give a Reaſon of his Sentence in Judgement, he may and will fetch that Reaſon, partly from our Obedience, or our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Conditions of the New Covenant. For as in this life, we had a Righteouſneſs conſiſting in free pardon of all ſin through the blood of Chriſt, and a Righteouſneſs conſiſting in our perſonal performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the promiſe which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that pardon, and continueth it to us: ſo at Judgement we ſhall accordingly be juſtified And as our Evangelical perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100550:106"/>
commonly called <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> was at firſt only in our Faith and Repentance, and Diſpoſition to obey: but afterward in our Actual ſincere Obedience, in which ſenſe we are Conſtitutive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Juſtified or made Righteous here by our works, in <hi>James</hi> his ſenſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.24. ſo accordingly a double Reaſon will be aſſigned of our ſentential Juſtification; One from our pardon by Chriſts blood and merits; which will prove our Right to Impunity and to Glory. The other from our own Faith and holy Obedience, which will prove our Right to that pardon through Chriſt, and to the free Gift of a Right to glory: and ſo this laſt is to be pleaded in ſubordination to the former. For Chriſt is become the Author of Eternal ſalvation to all them that Obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 9. He therefore that will be ſaved,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100550:107"/>
muſt have a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſave him as the Author, and an <hi>Obedience</hi> to that Chriſt, as the Condition of that ſalvation; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both muſt be declared in the Judgement.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon why the Judge doth mention our Good works, rather then our Believing, may be becauſe thoſe holy ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions of Faith and Love to Chriſt, do contain or certainly imply Faith in them, as the life of the tree is in the fruit: but faith doth contain our works of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience but only as their cauſe. Theſe works alſo are a part of the perſonal Righteouſneſs which is to be enquired after, that is, we ſhall not be judged righteous, meerly becauſe we have Believed, but alſo becauſe we have added to our Faith vertue; and have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved our Talents, and have loved Chriſt to the hazard of all
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100550:107"/>
or his ſake. For it is not only or principally for the goodneſs of the work conſidered in it ſelf, or the good that is done by it to the poor: but it is as theſe works did expreſs our Faith and Love to Chriſt, by doing him the moſt coſtly and hazardous ſervice; that by Faith we could ſee Chriſt in a poor beggar or a priſoner; and could love Chriſt in <hi>Theſe</hi> better then our worldly goods or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which we muſt part with or hazard by the works that are here mentioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reaſons why Chriſt will ſo publikely Declare the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal righteouſneſs of men, to be the Reaſon or Cauſe of his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſentence, it is becauſe It is the buſineſs of that day, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to glorifie Gods meer Love and Mercy, but eminently to glorifie his Remunerative Juſtice; and not only to expreſs his love to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100550:108"/>
Elect as ſuch, but to expreſs his love to them as <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> and ſuch as have denyed all for Chriſt, and Loved God above all; And to ſhew his juſtice to the men, and faithfulneſs in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling all his promiſes, and alſo his holinſs in the high eſtimation of the holineſs of his people. I ſhall expreſs this in the words of a Learned Divine (Dr <hi>Twiſs,</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> pag. 40.) <hi>Was there no more in Gods inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when he elected ſome, then the manifeſtation of the riches of his glorious grace? Did not God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo to manifeſt the Glory of his Remunerative Juſtice? Is it not undenyable that God will beſtow ſalvation on all his Elect (of ripe years) by way of reward and Crown of Righteouſneſs, which God the Righteous Judge will give?</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2 Theſ. 1. <hi>It is great pitty this is not conſidered, as uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100550:108"/>
it is not: Eſpecially for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Conſequence thereof in my Judgement.</hi> So far he.</p>
               <p>So much of the Sentence of Juſtification which ſhall be paſſed by Chriſt at Judgement upon the Righteous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are next to conſider of the Sentence of Condemnation which ſhall then by Chriſt be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the unrighteous. Which is delivered to us by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. in the ſame order as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>This Sentence containeth; 1. The Condemnation it ſelf. 2. The Reaſon or Cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>The Condemnation expreſſeth the miſery which they are judged to. 1. Generally, in the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Curſed.</hi> 2. Particularly by Deſcription of their Curſed ſtate.</p>
               <p>To be <hi>curſed,</hi> is to be a People

deſtinated and adjudged to utter unhappineſs; to all kind of miſery without remedy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their <hi>Curſed</hi> condition is deſcribed in the next words, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me into Everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Depart</hi>! From whom? from the God that made them in his Image.

Chriſts barr to be Judged. But from all expectations of ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying theſe again, or ever <hi>taſting</hi> their former delights; from theſe they muſt Depart: Not from their <hi>ſin,</hi> for that will go with them: But the liberty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that part of it which was ſweet to them, as Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all Voluptuouſneſs; from theſe they muſt <hi>Depart.</hi> But this is Conſequential: It is Chriſt and the Poſſibility of ſalvation, that they are Sentenced to <hi>Depart</hi> from.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Whither</hi> muſt they <hi>Depart</hi>? 1. Into fire. 2. Into <hi>that</hi> fire which was prepared for the Devil and his Angels. 3. Into everlaſting fire.</p>

                  <hi>ſire,</hi> let us not vainly trouble our ſelves to enquire. It is enough to know, that as fire is one of the moſt grievous Tormentors of the fleſh, ſo grievous will be thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Torments to the whole man, ſoul and body. Such as is moſt fitly repreſented to us under the notion of <hi>fire,</hi> and of <hi>burning.</hi> Its eaſie for a ſecure unbelieving ſoul to read and hear of it! but woe, and ten thouſand woes to them that muſt endure it. In this life they had their good things, when it went harder as to the fleſh with better men; but now they are tormented, when the Godly are comforted, as <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But why is it called <hi>a fire prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>? 1. What is this Divel that hath Angels? 2. Who are his Angels? 3. When was it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them? 4. Was it not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100550:111"/>
alſo prepared for wicked men? To theſe in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſeems by many paſſages in Scripture, that there is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der among Spirits, both Good and Bad; and that there is one Devil that is the Prince over the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſeems therefore that its the reſt of the evil Spirits, that are called <hi>his Angels.</hi> And ſome think that the wicked who ſerved him in this life, ſhall be numbered with his Angels in the life to come. Indeed the Apoſtle calls him, <hi>The God of this world,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. as is ordinarily Judged by Expoſitors: and <hi>the Prince of the power of the Aire, the Spirit that now worketh in the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, Eph.</hi> 2.2. And he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth falſe ſeducing Teachers, <hi>The Miniſters of Satan,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.15. But that wicked men are here meant as part of his Angels, is not clear.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:100550:111"/>3. If it be the preparation of Gods Purpoſe that is here meant, then it was from <hi>Eternity</hi>; but if it be any Commination of God as Ruler of the Angels, than was this fire prepared for them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, from the beginning of that Commination, and was <hi>Due</hi> to them at their fall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſeems that the Reaſon why here is no mention of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Hell-fire for the wicked, but only for the Devils, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed it <hi>was not</hi> prepared alſo for the wicked; but to note, that it is the Torment which was <hi>firſt</hi> prepared for, or aſſigned to the Devils, thereby ſhewing the greatneſs of the miſery of the wicked, that the Devil and his Angels muſt be their Compan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Though ſome think, as is ſaid before, that the reaſon why wicked men are not mentioned here, is becauſe they are part of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100550:112"/>
the Angels of the Devil, and ſo included. And ſome think it is purpoſely to manifeſt Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And how apparently Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are the Judgements of the Lord! that thoſe men who would here entertain the Devil into their hearts, and daily familiarity, ſhould be then entertained by him into <hi>his</hi> place of Torments, and there remain for ever in his ſociety! Though few entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him into Viſible familiarity with their bodies as Witches do, who ſo make him their <hi>Familiar</hi>; yet all wicked men do entertain him into more full and conſtant familiarity with their ſouls, then theſe witches do with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, How <hi>familiar</hi> is he in their

Hopes of the Commodities or Preferments of the world: he hath another kind of Voice which you muſt hear, and another face to ſhew you, that will make you know a little better, whom you had to do with! You would be afraid now to meet him in the dark; what will you be to live with him in everlaſting darkneſs? Then you will know who it was that you entertained and obeyed, and plaid with in your ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as the Text tells us, that it is <hi>a fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> So it telleth us, that is <hi>An everlaſting fire.</hi> It had a beginning: but it ſhall have no end. If theſe wretches would have choſen the ſervice of God, they would have met with no difficulty or trouble, but what would have had a ſpeedy end: Poverty and Injuries would have had an end: ſcorns and abuſes
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100550:114"/>
would have had an end; faſting, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation ſorrow for ſin, watching, and fighting againſt our ſpiritual enemies, would all have had an end. But to avoid theſe, they choſe that eaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that pleaſure, which hath brought them to that torment which <hi>never</hi> will have end. I have ſaid ſo much of theſe things already in my Book called the Saints Reſt, that I will now ſay but this much. It is one of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the world, how men that do believe, or think they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this word of Chriſt to be true, that <hi>the wicked ſhall go into Everlaſting fire,</hi> can yet venture on ſin ſo boldly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and live in it ſo fearleſsly, or ſleep quietly till they are out of this unſpeakable Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger! Only the Commonneſs of it, and the known wickedneſs of mans heart, doth make this leſs wonderful. And were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to convince us, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100550:115"/>
are Mad and Dead as to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, this were enough; That ever the greateſt pleaſures or profits of the world, or the moſt enticing baits that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil can offer them, ſhould once prevail with them to forget theſe endleſs things and draw them to reject an Everlaſting Glory, and caſt themſelves deſperately into <hi>Everlaſting fire</hi>; Yea, and all this under daily warnings and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and when its told them before hand by the God of Truth himſelf! For the Lords ſake, Sirs, and for your ſouls ſakes, if you care not what Miniſters ſay, or what ſuch as I ſay, yet will you ſoberly read now and then this 25. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and Regard what is told you by him that muſt be your Judge! and now and then bethink your ſelves ſoberly whether theſe are matters for wiſe men to make light of?
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100550:115"/>
and what it is to be <hi>Everlaſtingly in Heaven or in Hell fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We have ſeen what is the Penalty contained in the ſentence againſt the ungodly: The next thing that the Text directs us to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Cauſe or Reaſon of the Sentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſ. 42, <hi>For I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ye gave me no meat,</hi> &amp;c. The Reaſon is not given expreſly either for their ſin againſt the Law of works, that is, Becauſe they were ſinners, and not perfectly <hi>Innocent:</hi> Nor yet from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, which is the great ſin againſt the Law of Grace: But it is given from their not expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Faith and Love to Chriſt in works of mercy and ſelf-denyal. And why is this ſo?</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt not ſuppoſe that theſe words of Chriſt, do expreſs the <hi>whole</hi> Judicial proceſs in every point; but the chief parts. It is
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100550:116"/>
ſuppoſed that all men are convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of being ſinners againſt the perfect Law of the Creator, and that they are guilty of Death for that ſin: and that there is no way but by Chriſt to obtain delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But becauſe all this muſt be acknowledged by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous themſelves, as well as by the wicked, therefore Chriſt doth not mention this, but that only which is the turning point or cauſe in the Judgement. For it is not all ſinners that ſhall be finally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all Impenitent, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing ſinners, who have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled finally againſt their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the reaſon why Faith it ſelf is not expreſſed, is, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is clearly implyed, and ſo is Love to Chriſt as Redeemer: in that they ſhould have Relieved <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in his members: that is, as its expreſſed, <hi>Matth.</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:100550:116"/>
10.42. they ſhould have received a Prophet in the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; and a Diſciple in the name of a Diſciple; All ſhould be done for Chriſts ſake: which could not be unleſs they Believed in him, and Loved h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m. 2. Alſo becauſe that the bare Act of Believing is not all that Chriſt requireth to a mans final Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: But holy ſelf-denying Obedience muſt be added. And therefore this is given as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Condemnation, that they did not ſo obey.</p>
               <p>We muſt obſerve alſo, that Chriſt here putteth the ſpecial for the general: that is, one way of ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> denying Obedience, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Love, inſtead of ſuch Obedience in general! For all men have not ability to relieve thoſe in miſery, being perhaps ſome of them poor themſelves. But all have that Love and ſelf-denyal,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100550:117"/>
which will ſome way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it ſelf. And all have hearts and a Diſpoſition to do thus, if they had ability; without ſuch a Diſpoſition, none can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>It is the fond conceit of ſome, that if they have any love to the godly or wiſh them well, it is enough to prove them happy. But Chriſt here purpoſely lets us know, that whoever doth not Love him at ſo high a rate, as that he can part with his ſubſtance or any thing in the world, to thoſe uſes which he ſhall require them, even to relieve his ſervants in want and ſufferings for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſake, that man is none of Chriſts Diſciple, nor will be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him at the laſt.</p>

               <p>When man had broken the Law of his Creator at the firſt, he was lyable to the Sentence of Death, and God preſently ſate in Judgement on him, and ſentenced him to ſome part of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had deſerved: But upon the Interpoſition of the Son, he forbore the reſt, reſolving on a way that might tend to his Recovery: And Death is due yet to every ſinner for every ſin which he commits, till a pardon do acquit him.

is more than the firſt loſs. As if a man ſhould loſe his Purſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, when another hath once found it for him: Or rather as if a Traytor Redeemed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and having his life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours offered him, if he will Thankfully Accept it and come in, ſhould by his Refuſal and Obſtinacy, loſe this Recovered Life, which is offered him: which is an addition to his former pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.</p>
               <p>Beſides that the Higher degree of Glory will be loſt, which Chriſt would beſtow on him, more then was loſt at firſt. The very work of the Saints in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will be to Praiſe and Glorifie him that Redeemed them: and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him: which would not have been the work of man if he had been innocent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Pain of ſenſe, the laſt Judgement by the Redeemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:100550:119"/>
will Sentence them to a far ſorer Puniſhment then would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln them, if no Saviour had been offered them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. The conſcience of <hi>Adam</hi> if he had not been Redeemed, would never have Tormented him for Rejecting a Redeemer, nor for refuſing or abuſing his gracious offers, and his mercies; nor for the forfeiting of a Recovered Happineſs; nor for refuſing the eaſie terms of the Goſpel, which would have Given him Chriſt and ſalvation for the Accepting; nor for neglecting any means that tended to Recovery: No nor for refuſing Repentance unto Life, nor for diſobeying a Redeemer that bought him by his blood. As all theſe are the penalties of the Redeemers Law and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo is it a ſorer penalty then Conſcience would have inflicted meerly for not being perfectly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;

and they will be far ſorer gripings and gnawings of the never-dying worm for the abuſe of theſe Talents, than if we had been never truſted with any after our firſt forfeiture. Yea and God himſelf will accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion his Puniſhments. So that you ſee that Privatively and Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, or as to their Loſs and their Feeling, the Redeemer will paſs on them a heavyer doom then the Creator did, or would have done according to the firſt Law to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man.</p>

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100550:120"/>
and Impenitent, Ungodly perſons do, hath no other to Appeal to. Chriſt would have been a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary and Refuge to thee from the Law of works, hadſt thou but Come in to him: But who ſhall be a Refuge to thee from the wrath of Chriſt? The Goſpel would have freed thee from the Curſe of the Law of works, if thou hadſt but believed and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: But what ſhall free thee from the Condemnation of the Goſpel? Had there no Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lain againſt thee, but that thou waſt in general a ſinner, that is, that thou waſt not perfectly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, Chriſt would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that charge by his blood. But ſeeing thou art alſo guilty of thoſe ſpecial ſins which he never ſhed his blood for, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee from that Accuſation? When Chriſt gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for ſinners, it was with this
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100550:121"/>
Reſolution both in the Father and himſelf, that none ſhould ever be Pardoned, Juſtified or Saved by that Ranſom, that did not in the time of this life, ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return to God by Faith in the Redeemer, and live in ſincere obedience to him and perſevering herein. So that he plainly <hi>exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted</hi> final Infidelity, Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Rebellion from pardon: He never dyed for the final non-performance of the Conditions of the New Covenant. So that his Judgement for theſe will be peremptory and remedileſs. If you ſay, Why cannot God find out a remedy for this ſin, as well as he did for the firſt? I ſay, God cannot lye, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. He muſt be True and Faithful, as neceſſarily as he muſt be God, becauſe of the Abſolute perfection of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and he hath ſaid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that there ſhall be no more remedy.</p>

but theſe wiſhes are all in vain. <hi>There is one Time, and one Way of a ſinners Deliverance; If he fail in that one, he periſheth for ever</hi>: all the world cannot help him after that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 2. <hi>I have heard thee in a time accepted; and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured thee: Behold now is the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time: behold now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> Now he ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock; If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> But for the time to come hereafter, hear what he ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25, 26. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye Refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my Reproof; I alſo will laugh at your Calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100550:126"/>
when your fear cometh as Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you; then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not Anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me; for that they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord; They would none of my counſels; they deſpiſed all my Reproof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices; for the Turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the Proſperity of fools ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; But who ſo hearkneth to me, ſhall dwel ſafely, and ſhall be quiet from fear of evil.</hi> I have recited all theſe words, that you may ſee and conſider, whether I have ſpoke any other thing than God himſelf hath plainly told you of.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this much of the

But having ſpoke ſo much of all this already elſewhere, as is ſaid before, I will forbear here to repeat it, leaving the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that deſireth it, there to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it.</p>

               <p>BEloved hearers, it was not to fill your fancies with news that God ſent me hither this day; nor to tell you of matters that nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you; nor by ſome terrible words to bring you to an hours amazement and no more; But it is to tell you of things that your eyes ſhall ſee, and to foretell you of your danger while it may be prevented; that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls may be ſaved at the laſt, and you may ſtand before God with comfort at that day; But becauſe this will not be every mans caſe, no nor the caſe of moſt, I muſt in the name of Chriſt deſire you to make this day an enquiry into your own ſouls, and as in the preſence of God let your
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100550:127"/>
hearts make anſwer to theſe few Queſtions which I ſhall propound and debate with you.</p>
               <div n="1" type="question">

                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>DO you ſoundly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Doctrine which I have preached to you?</hi> What ſay you Sirs? do you veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Believe</hi> it as a moſt certain Truth, that you and I, and all the world muſt ſtand at Gods barr and be Judged to Everlaſting Joy or Torment? I hope you do all <hi>in ſome ſort</hi> Believe this: but blame me not if I be jealous whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you <hi>ſoundly</hi> believe it, while we ſee in the world ſo little of the effect of ſuch a Belief. I confeſs I am forced to think that there is more infidelity then faith among us, when I ſee more ungodlineſs then godlineſs among us: And I can hardly believe <hi>that</hi> man that will ſay or ſwear that he believeth
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100550:128"/>
theſe things, and yet liveth as careleſly and carnally as an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. I know that no man can love to be damned; yea I know that every man that hath a reaſonable ſoul, hath naturally ſome love to himſelf, and a fear of a danger which he verily apprehendeth; he therefore that liveth without all fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt think liveth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all apprehenſion of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Cuſtom hath taught men to hold theſe things as the Opinion of the Country; but if men ſoundly believed them, ſurely we ſhould ſee ſtranger effects of ſuch a faith, then in the moſt we do ſee. Doth the ſleepy ſoul that liveth in ſecurity, and followeth this world as eagerly as if he had no greater matters to mind; that never once trembled at the thoughts of this great day; nor once asked his own ſoul in good ſadneſs, <hi>My ſoul, How doſt thou
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100550:128"/>
think then to eſcape</hi>? I ſay, doth this man Believe that he is going to this Judgement? Well, Sirs, whether you believe it or not, you will find it true; and believe it you muſt before you can be ſafe. For if you do not Believe it, you will never make ready. Let me therefore perſwade you in the fear of God to conſider, that it is a matter of undoubted Truth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider that it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs word of the God of Truth; revealed in Scripture as plainly as you can deſire. So that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unbelieving without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Gods Word, or giving him the lye, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 49, 50. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, and 1.32. <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>The hour is coming in which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth: they that have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100550:129"/>
done good, unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the Reſurrection of damnation. Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed to all men once to dye, and after this, the Judgement. Rom.</hi> 14.9.12. <hi>So then every one of us ſhall give Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf to God. Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great ſtand before God: and the Books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the Book of life: and the dead were Judged out of thoſe things which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Books, according to their works. Mat.</hi> 12.36, 37. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, the ſhall give account thereof in the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For by thy words thou ſhalt be Juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> Many more moſt expreſs Texts of Scripture do put the Truth of this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of all queſtion, to all
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100550:129"/>
that believe the Scripture, and will underſtand it. There is no place left for a Controverſie in the point: It is made as ſure to us as the Word of the living God can make it: And he that will queſtion that, what will he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? What ſay you Sirs? Dare you doubt of this which the God of Heaven hath ſo poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed? I hope you dare not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, it is a maſter-part of your faith, if you are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and a fundamental Article of your Creed, that Chriſt ſhall come again to Judge the quick and the dead. So that you muſt Believe it, or renounce your Chriſtianity, and then you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſt and all the hopes of mercy that you have in him. Its impoſſible that you ſhould ſoundly Believe in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not believe his Judgement and Life Everlaſting; becauſe as he
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100550:130"/>
came to bring Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light in the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. ſo it was the end of his Incarnation, Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, to bring you thither; and its part of his honour and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which he purchaſed with his blood, to be the Lord and Judge of all the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If therefore you believe not heartily this Judgement; deal plainly and openly, and ſay you are Infidels and caſt away the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical vizor of Chriſtianity, and let us know you, and take you as you are.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider that it is a Truth that is known by the very light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that there ſhall be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for the Righteous, and a miſery for the wicked after this life: which is evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that we have undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able natural reaſon for it. 1. God is the Righteous governor of the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100550:130"/>
world, and therefore muſt make a difference among his ſubjects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of their waies; which we ſee is not done here, where the wicked proſper, and the good are afflicted; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee there is a neceſſity that God ſhould make promiſes and threatnings of everlaſting happineſs or miſery, for the right governing of the world; for we certainly perceive that no lower things will keep men from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all humane ſociety, and living worſe then bruit beaſts; and if there be a neceſſity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch threats and promiſes, then there is certainly a neceſſity of fulfilling them. For God need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no lye or means of deceiving, to rule the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as we ſee it by Reaſon, ſo by certain experience, that this is diſcernable by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100550:131"/>
for all the world, or almoſt all do believe it. Even thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where the Goſpel never came, and have nothing but what they have by nature even the moſt Barbarous Indians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſome life after this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a difference of men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are here: Therefore you muſt believe thus much, or renounce your common Reaſon and humanity, as well as your Chriſtianity. Let me therefore perſwade you all in the fear of God to confirm your ſouls in the belief of this, as if you had heard Chriſt or an Angel from heaven ſay to you, <hi>Oh man thou art haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Judgement.</hi>

Tell me, is it ſo, or not?</p>
                  <p>Alas Sirs! Is this a matter to be forgotten? Is not that man even worſe then mad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods Judgement and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinks of it? when if they were to be tryed for their lives at the next Aſſize, they would think of it, and think again, and caſt 100

times which way to eſcape. Me thinks you ſhould rather forget to go to bed at night, or to eat your meat, or do your work, then forget ſo great a matter as this.</p>
                  <p>Truly I have often in my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts been ready to wonder that men can think of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any thing elſe, when they have ſo great a thing to think of. What! forget that which you muſt remember for ever! forget that which ſhould force remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, yea and doth force it with ſome, whether they will or not! A poor deſpairing ſoul cannot forget it: He thinks which way ever he goes he is ready to be Judged. Oh therefore Beloved, Fix theſe thoughts as deep in your hearts as thoughts can go. Oh be like that holy man, that thought which way ever he went, he heard the Trumpet ſound, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100550:132"/>
the voice of the Angel calling to the world, <hi>Ariſe ye dead, and come to Judgement,</hi> You have warning of it from God and man, to cauſe you to Remember it; do not then forget it. It will be a cold excuſe another day, <hi>Lord, I forgate this day, or elſe I might have been ready</hi>: you dare not ſure truſt to ſuch excuſes.</p>

                  <p>When I began to preach of theſe things long ago, I confeſs the matters ſeemed to me ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that I was afraid that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would have run out of their wits w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is their thanks to God for his Patience: Becauſe his Sentence is not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpeedily therefore their hearts are ſet in them to do evil, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.11. As if God were ſlack of his Promiſe, as ſome men Account ſlackneſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. When one day with him is as a 1000. years, and a 1000. years as one day.

                  <p>Three or four things there be ſhould bring any matter to the heart. 1. If it be a matter of exceeding weight. 2. If it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern not others only, but our ſelves. 3. If it be certain. 4. If neer.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things are here to be found, and therefore how ſhould your hearts be moved at the Conſideration of this great day!</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What matter can be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with the Tongue of man of greater moment? For the poor creature to ſtand before his Maker and Redeemer, to be Judged to Everlaſting Joy or Torment? Alas! all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this world are playes, and toyes, and dreams to this: Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of profit or diſprofit are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100550:134"/>
to it: Matters of credit or diſcredit are unworthy to be named with it: Matters of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life or death are nothing to it. We ſee the poor bruit beaſts go every day to the <hi>ſlaughter,</hi> and we make no great matter of it, though their life be as dear to them as ours to us. To be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an <hi>Everlaſting</hi> death or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this is the great danger, that one would think ſhould ſhake the ſtouteſt heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, and awake the dulleſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to prevent it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its a matter that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every one <hi>of your ſelves,</hi> and every man or woman that ever lived upon the earth, or ever ſhall do: I am not ſpeaking to you of the affairs of ſome far Countrey, that are nothing to you, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to marvail at; which you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw, nor ever ſhall do: no; It is thy own ſelf man or woman
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100550:135"/>
that heareſt me this day, that ſhalt as ſurely appear before the Judgement-Seat of Chriſt, as the Lord liveth, and as he is true and faithful; and that is as ſure as thou liveſt on this earth, or as the heaven is over thee. That man that heareth all this with the moſt careleſs blockiſh heart, ſhall be awakened and ſtand with the reſt at that day; that man that never thought of it, but ſpent his time in worldly matters, ſhall leave all, and there appear; that man that will not believe theſe things to be true, but make a jeſt of them, ſhall ſee and feel what he would not Believe, and <hi>he</hi> alſo ſhall be there: The <hi>godly</hi> that waited in hope for that day, as the day of their full Deliverance and Coronation, they ſhall be there. Those that have lain in the duſt theſe 5000. years, ſhall riſe again and all ſtand there. Hearer,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100550:135"/>
whoever thou art, believe it, thou mayeſt better think to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meat, to ſee without light, to eſcape death, and abide for ever on earth, then to keep away from that Appearance. Willing or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, thou <hi>ſhalt</hi> be there. And ſhould not a matter then that ſo concerneth <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> go neer to thy heart, and awake thee from thy ſecurity?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is a matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable certainty, I have partly ſhewed you already, and more would do, if I were Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to known Infidels. If the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs world had any juſt reaſon to think it were uncertain, their careleſneſs were more excuſable. Me thinks a man ſhould be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with that which he is certain ſhall come to paſs, in a manner as if it were now in doing. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Ye</hi> perfectly <hi>know that the day of the Lord ſo cometh,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="4">4. This day is not only <hi>certain,</hi> but it is <hi>neer</hi>; and therefore ſhould affect you the more. I confeſs, if it were never ſo far of, yet ſeeing it will come at laſt, it ſhould be carefully regarded: But when the Judge is at the door, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.9. and we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the barr, and it is ſo ſhort a time to this Aſſize, what ſoul that is not dead will be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure?</p>
                  <p>Alas Sirs! what is a little time when it is gone? how quickly ſhall you and I be all in another world, and our ſouls receive their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judgement, and ſo wait till the body be raiſed and judged to the ſame Condition?

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100550:136"/>
us: and what is a year or two, or a 100? how ſpeedily is it come? how many a ſoul that is now in heaven or hell, within a 1000 years dwelt in the places that you now dwell in, and ſate in the ſeats you now ſit in? And now their time is paſt, what is it? Alas; how quickly will it be ſo with us: You know not when you go to bed, but you may be Judged by the next morning: or when you riſe, but you may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judged before night: but certainly you know that ſhortly it will be; and ſhould not this then be laid to heart?

who ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, and not condemned when Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes; They that have a good cauſe in a Goſpel ſenſe.

                  <p>If you further ask me <hi>who theſe are</hi>; remember that I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that every man that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally righteous by fulfilling the Condition of Salvation in the Goſpel, ſhall be ſaved, and he that is found unrighteous, as having not fulfilled them, ſhall periſh at that day.</p>

as you remain unready for Judgement? How do you keep the Thoughts of it out of your mind, that they do not break your ſleep, and meet you in your buſineſs, and haunt you every way you go, while Judgement is ſo neer, and you are ſo unready? But I ſhall proceed to my next Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>

the work. Me thinks you ſhould all ſay, We will do any thing that the Lord ſhall Direct us to do, rather than we will be unready for the final doom! O that there were but ſuch hearts in you, that you were trully <hi>willing</hi> to follow the gracious Guidance of the Lord, and to uſe but thoſe ſweet and reaſonable means which he hath preſcribed you in his Word, that you may be ready for that day! Alas, it is no hard matter for me to tell you, or my ſelf, what it is that we muſt do, if we will be happy; and it is no very hard matter to <hi>Do</hi> it, ſo far as we are truly <hi>willing</hi>; but the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is, to be <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>throughly willing</hi> to this work.

So when you are tempted to neglect the daily worſhipping of God in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and the Catechizing and Teaching of your children or ſervants, eſpecially on the Lords Day, bethink your ſelves then, what account you will give of this to Chriſt? when he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted you with the care of your children and ſervants, ſhall call
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100550:152"/>
you to a reckoning for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that truſt?</p>
                  <p>The like muſt be Remembred in the very manner of our Duties; How diligently ſhould a Miniſter ſtudy? how earneſtly ſhould he perſwade? how unwearyedly ſhould he bear all oppoſitions and ungrateful returns? and how carefully ſhould he watch over each particular ſoul of his charge (as far as is poſſible) when he Remembers that he muſt ſhortly be Accountable for all in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And how importunate ſhould we all be with ſinners for their Converſion, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that themſelves alſo muſt ſhortly be Judged? Can a man be cold and dead in prayer, that hath any true apprehenſion of that Judgement upon his mind, where he muſt be accountable for all his prayers and performances?
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100550:152"/>
O Remember, and ſeriouſly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, when you ſtand before the Miniſter to hear the word, and when you are on your knees to God in prayer, in what a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that ſame perſon, even your ſelves muſt ſhortly ſtand at the Barr of the dreadful God! Did theſe thoughts get throughly to mens hearts, they would waken them out of their ſleepy Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and acquaint them that it is a ſerious buſineſs to be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. How careful ſhould we be of our thoughts and words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we believingly remembred that we muſt be accountable for them all! How carefully ſhould we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what we do with our Riches, and with all that God giveth us, and how much more largely ſhould we expend it for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in works of Piety and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if we believingly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100550:153"/>
that we muſt be Judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we have done, and give account of every Talent that we receive?
