            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Watermens Caſe,
In Relation to the BILL for Increaſe and
<hi>Encouragement of Seamen.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the Bill for Encouragement of Seamen, the Regiſter for them is made
Voluntary, as fearing that an Act to force them into a Regiſter would
be ſo great an Infringement of Liberty, as might diſcourage and obviate
the future Breeding of Seamen, and cauſe many of the preſent, either
to decline going to Sea, or betake themſelves to the Service of ſome
Foreign State. For which Reaſons 'tis Humbly hoped, That the ſaid Regiſter
may be made Voluntary to the Watermen as well as others; ſince the forcing
them thereinto, will much Diſcourage, and be the Ruine of many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Company of Watermen, That are more ſubject to, and have ſuffered more
by the Sea-Service, than any other Society, and may put a great ſtop to the
future Breeding of Watermen. Whereas the ſaid Company now is one of the
beſt Seminaries for Breeding up Youth to the Sea, and is computed to have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
above 4000 Voluntiers and Preſſed Men for the Navy, ſince His Majeſty's
Happy Acceſſion to the Crown.</p>
            <p>It's therefore Humbly ſubmitted to the great Wiſdom of this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Whether it might not highly conduce towards the Furniſhing the Navy
with great Numbers of Able Men, and thereby better promote the good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of the deſigned Regiſtring of Seamen.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Watermen were allowed to continue their being Regiſtred in their
own Company as they now all are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And all Lightermen, Bargemen, and others employed in Rowing on the
River <hi>Thames</hi> (Fiſhermen and Trinitymen excepted) be Incorporated with the
Watermen into one Body Politique, and be Regiſtred in the ſame Manner, and
under the ſame Penalties, as the Watermen now are; which Regiſter may from
time to time (as required) be tranſmitted unto the Admiralty. Whereby a
more Exact and full Liſt of all Watermen may be more ſpeedily had, and with
leſs Charge than others can procure, that do not know or are converſant amongſt
the Watermen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And ſeveral Thouſands of Stout and Able Men, as Lightermen, Bargemen,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be added, and made forth coming, more than the Regiſtring Bill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends,
or ſeems to have any notice of. Which Perſons being now ſubject to
no Order or Regulation, withdraw and abſent themſelves in times of Preſſing,
and commit many other Irregularities on the River, which cannot by any means
be ſo certainly and readily prevented, as by Uniting ſuch perſons unto, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them under the ſame Orders and Regulations with the Watermen. For the
Barges now leave their luſty and able Men at <hi>Kingston, &amp;c.</hi> and are brought from
thence to <hi>London</hi> with Old Men only.</p>
            <p>And the Young and Able Lightermen hide and withdraw from their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
until the Preſs is over, which makes Wages very dear, obſtructs Trade,
and raiſes the price of Proviſion, Fewel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which tends to the prejudice of all,
eſpecially the poorer ſort.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A great many more Subſtantial and conſiderable Perſons will be then added
to the Watermens Company; for want whereof, and good By-Laws, with
reaſonable Penalties, for puniſhing Offenders, many Abuſes have formerly been
committed, the Company's Stock miſapplyed and embezelled, (none being
qualified to Sue for the ſame) and the Charities of ſeveral diſcouraged or diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Which then it's hoped will be effectually prevented, and the Income thereby
conſiderably increaſed, and duly applyed for Relief and Support of the Decayed
and Diſabled Members of the ſaid Company, and the Widows of ſuch, and in
Educating and Breeding up their poor and helpleſs Children in the Art of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
to the great Increaſe and Encouragement of Seamen, Advantage of
Trade, and Security of the Kingdom.</p>
