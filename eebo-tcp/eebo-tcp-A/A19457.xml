            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>¶ <hi>AND</hi> hitherto hauinge treated what proofe men shold make apon their seruauntes, I shall thurdely speake of bothe their offyces and dueties interchaungeably. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the chiefe pointe is, that either haue a well willing mynde towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des thother, Thone to deserue, tho ther to rewarde. For the good wil is that, that supplieth a gret deale in soch offices. Then that from the begynninge eyther so maye beare with other, tyll at laste apon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquaintance in manners, a faster frendship may knit betwixe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for amonges many, soch fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp is disioigned, before thone can knowe thother thouroly. And then againe, many at the furste ar mysliked, who, better assaied, may
<pb facs="tcp:10364:10"/>
content you well ynoughe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on thone part, auaileth the ma sters ientilnes, and (as who saith) winking at smal faultes. On tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the seruauntes willingnes to fulfill all his maisters hestes. In many, some light tatches do reign, but soch as with as many vertues ar recompensed again. As if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be hastye, but yet soone cawlmed, but at neade a faithfull freinde.</p>
            <p>So fareth it by a seruaunt, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture hault mynded. Who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles by a soft meats may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed, the same being both tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and at all assayes right profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. And some there be again dut witted, yet if ye enioigne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought they wyll geue good eare, with no lesse dilygence to the same. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth a master to interteigne his seruantes betwene both: that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

his sternes maye withdrawe their good hertes, nor yet his to moch softnes moue them to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes. Nomore shulde their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raige with to moche chiding or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilinge be sharpened: but rather with good intreaty be made boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnto him, soo that nexte vnto his wief, and children, shulde the seruauntes in his howse be chery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. he oweth them their fode and clothing, nat ouer daintie, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as neade requireth, and they again owe vnto their master, good and true seruice. Wherapon they ar called megnial, &amp; chargetakers, because they perteign to howshold and ought to tend well their may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters busines. For and if that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is wourthly blamed, As ma ny slaues so many ennemies. (Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles euen amonges soche slaues,
<pb facs="tcp:10364:11"/>
there haue some ben, who in theyr lordes defence haue litle estemed their owne liefes). Howe moch the more then maye we conceiue soche truste apon our seruauntes? And yet all slaues were nat soche as in Comedies they ar set fourthe.</p>
            <p>Therence in his comedie named, Adelphos, setteth fourth an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of one only slaue to be wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicioned: and that was poore Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, slaue also vnto a pore wydowe. In an other of his comedies enty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hecyra,</hi> he faigneth Parmeno slaue vnto Pamphilus to be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deale geuin to vices, and a verye drawlatche, both inquisitiue, and a blabbet fourthe of thinges tolde vnto him. Whiche two faultes are of lyke kynde, and yet soch as most men haue an espece of. Therfore vnles they many wayes be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb facs="tcp:10364:11"/>
I reke it no wisedome in tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge eany seruauntes with secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, where as the greater nede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streignith nat. no more then chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, or wiefes, in as moch as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng is more harde, then counseil kepinge, and though a seruaunte be trusty, yet is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mind chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yea and by priuey whisterers may he sone be corrupted. For such a kinde of men is there, the moste malicious and reprouable that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be deuised, whose chief delighte is to sowe discorde atwixe the seruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and their maisters, who where in deade they ne can well gouerne their owne meigny, yet take they apon them the rule of others. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting this verse of Homere, nat without cause so moche praysed.

The ciuile lawe graunteth acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againste them that corrupte a mans slaue, or bondeman, and I thinke the selfe same case may sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in a seruaunte also corrupted. for what so euer he doth amis in, they ar to wite that entised him thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. It is an honest mans parte to exhorte others seruauntes to their dueties doing, and when strife fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth betwene them and their may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to set them (as moche as in him lieth) at agrement. But those wyked tounges that go aboute to disseuer seruauntes from their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, ar wourthy being hanged vp in the chimney roofe to be parched dry with smoke. Moreouer as it cometh of ientilnes to remit lighte faultes, soo if you finde your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes gyltie of eany greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as of theft, adultery, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:10364:12"/>
slaundre, or accusement rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed apon eany person, then would I aduise you withoute longe chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding straight to dismisse him. And because seruantes throughe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall abode, and practise in howse with their maisters, muste neades haue some intellygence of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, This gifte therfore would I chiefely wisshe in them, neyther to harken moche what is doone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, nor yet to spread fourth thin ges doone at home. Whiche were better vntolde, namely soche as at meales were perhappes spoken vn dre the frankeste fashon. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge can be more knauyshe then soche, as (accordinge to Geta his guise in Therence) when so theyr master hauing shut the dore to him is in secrete communication with some freinde of his, then holdyng

Wourthely is that slaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, who when his mayster at supper, throughe drunkinnes, hadde vttred certaine wourdes of treason against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Augustus Cesar, the nexte mornyng aduised hym therof, and that ere reaport of the same might throughe his accusers come to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars eares, he shulde goo and axe his pardone at hym. Wherapon Cesar nat alonely forgaue the mai ster, but also moued him to enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise

his so faythefull a slaue, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the same of his owne reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues a certayne stipend to liue on. A seruaunte that bryngeth many newis into his masters house, may we well suppose will cary owte as many. Some men make but smal counte of surfeites or drunkynnes in their seruauntes, as thoughe the same were a fault more wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye of lawghter, then displeasure. Whiche in deade, myght partely be borne with, ne were nat the same a trayner of soo huge a heape of vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces folowynge, When therby ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes become lyther, vnstanche of tounge, brawlers, fyghters, yea and commenly fulfylled with diseases, so likewyse is horehaunt by som men litle passed of. But yet thereby seruauntes get the frenche
<pb facs="tcp:10364:14"/>
euyl, and deale the same amonges their masters childern and hole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, infectinge oftetymes bothe maister, and maistres, maye the same then be counted a light fault in them? Naye verely. And albeit to be amourus, as ferfourth as the law againsaith nat, may somwhat be permitted in younge folkes. yet certes soche louinge causeth moch inconuenience: when thereby ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes after vndue meanes make shifte to furnishe their crauynge lemans with gay giftes, and them selfes also with gay appareil. But of all others, those are the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleste that defyle the selfe howse they dwel in with their lechery, &amp; vncleaner then the burdes ar, doo beray theyr owne nestes. Speadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in a seruaunte is moche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the wise Salomon.
<pb facs="tcp:10364:14"/>
Hast thou seen (saith he) a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that spedely dispatcheth his busines? he shal waite before princis, and shal nat lowte to meane men. Then bla meth he as moche eany stouthefull dolt, that foldinge his armes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guither, ydleth fourth the tyme, or beinge sente on an errante fyndeth many barres in the same with col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propheting, as, a lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in the way, a beare haunteth such a wood, It is lyke to be fowle wether. so is he nat sent fourthe, but rather thruste owte by the shoulders. Then shal he houer by the waye apon euerye lyght occasion, staieng hym self e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the nonis, lest if he returne the shortlier, he maye straighte be put to a newe taske. But yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers speadines auayleth nat soo moch, vnles an auised considrance be ioigned therto: els, were it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Then, as it is a kynde parte in a master, nat to burthen his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes ouermoche, so oughte he also take kepe, that hauing somwhat aye in hande, they do spende their time in some fruict, yea rather shuld he put them to vnneadfull workes, then that slowthes rust myght byte apo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. For as themperour Helioga balus was wont to set his men to taske in this wise, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding one within soch espace to catche him so many. M. flies, an other so many.
<pb facs="tcp:10364:15"/>
M. spiders, &amp; so forth, to thend that beynge pestred with this busynes, they ne myght do accordinge to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers seruantes vsages, who take apon them to haue an oyer in their maisters publike offices, oftetimes vndre that pretence, selling winde vnto suters. albeit this was but a fonde deuise of Heliogabalus, yet may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same be aplied to our exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. Pamphilus (as There<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in <hi>Hecyra</hi> expresseth) sendith away his slaue Parmeno to the hauen side, apon a faigned messaige, lest being (as in deade he was) bothe inquisitiue, &amp; a blabbe also, he might haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling in matiers of priuitie mete to be concelid. I haue knowne also som me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cause their seruantes write some thing of smal purpose, suppo sing it better for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do a thig net ther here, ne there, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that through

idlenes they shuld intend to worse occupations. Lowlynes is a fayre thinge in a seruaunt, for ye shall see some choplogikes, who skante wyl forbeare their owne maisters. Themperour Hadrianus is moch commended for that he warned a slaue of his goinge amides two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours, to remembre his owne de gree and condition. But nowe a dayes a seruaunt, if his maister be but of a meane estate, wyll little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme him, nat so moche regarding how great wages, as of how great a man he receiueth the same. That although this mean maister do no wourse feade, and clothe him, yea and better tendeth his bryngynge vp, then doth that great lorde, yet vnder his wynge liftes he vp his hornes, vnder thother semith he no thinge well apaied with him selfe.
<pb facs="tcp:10364:16"/>
So a seruantes pride reboundeth. oftetimes to his maisters reproch.</p>
            <p>Moreouer somme there be that grudge to do ought, because they haue of their owne to lyue with, or for their wourshipful stockes sake. But what maketh that to their ma sters, who bestowe no lesse coste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, then if they were taken vp by the highe waye. Let no man therfore counte so moche apon his degree at home, as of that rowme in seruice, whiche willingely he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh him self vnto. It is an euil custome vsed amonges many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inespeciall amonges An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishemen, to keape abowte them for a shew only, a superfluous no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

bande shal that be of tryfling tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes, both doltishe, drunkin, and eke piking. And therfore may Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilles verse well be verefyed, 
<q>
                  <l>VVhat shal the maisters do at last?</l>
                  <l>when seruantes bribe, and steale so fast?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For who so hath many seruantes, must neades haue some vnthrifty, then one onely is inough to marre the hole flocke. To this I harde it ones saide by a freind of myne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceited, He that hath but one man, hath some man, he that hath two, hath haulf a one: but he that hath thre, hath neuer a oone. For then if oughte be mysdone, thone wyl twyte the fault in the other. If ought be nat done, eche wyll saye he thought his fellowe had goone about it. Iulianus themperour is moche commended, for that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the empresse his wiefes deceas,

And therefore as a wise man bieth howsehold stuf, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to serue him selfe, then to fead others eyes, so a great deale sooner ought vnnecessary meigny be put away, who ar nothing els but con sumers of vitailes, as Homer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them.

            <p>Nat seldome the waywarde dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of a maister is in cause that fewe canne abyde in howse with him. That and if soche are wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely noted, as vse their slaues or bondemen (cost they neuer so litle) no better then bearinge beastes, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens they ar men as we be, howe moch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more deserue they blame, that vse their seruauntes after like rate, being freemen, and but apon a condicion onely apprentised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs? Adde herevnto, that amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges christen me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there ought a grea ter respecte of humanitie be had in all intentes. For we all be seruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes vnder one maister, and as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge those thynges wherein ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raye felicitie chiefely consisteth, the lowest ar on euin bourde with the

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidre with him selfe, thus: what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer good tourne I do him, I do it as for my brother, he being a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of the selfe same body I am of, and therby shal I merite of Christ him selfe. Thus then ought a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to repute againe: What euer seruice I do vnto him, the same do I vnto Christe, who byddeth vs with all our good hertes to obeye our maisters, and wyll therefore him selfe rewarde vs, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so vnientill. But nowe some seme to make it tough, in that they shuld become seruantes to others, settinge fourth what hiegh seruice they do, and thereby thyncke them seluis moch beholden vnto, in that they daigne to be obeysant, as who saith they bare in many poynctes with their maysters. But then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb facs="tcp:10364:19"/>
they considre nat, howe this ministration is egally delt betwen them. For as to smaller pourpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the seruaunte endeuorith hym selfe towardes his maister, soo he againe in greter matters doth his parte no lesse, Findinge him bothe howserome, fode, and clothing, ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge him from vnthrifty compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, bringinge him vppe as well in sundry craftes, as also in lernyng, and good manners, yea and with an easy bytte refraigninge his pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant courage, and slydinge youthe, which els suffred to ronne at large wolde stomble apon all vnhappy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. That admitte it were so wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a thyng to lyue in awe, ar nat lordes and princis sonnes then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so wretched? But howe goodly a thynge is it (I praye you) for a ser uaunte to lyue vnder great, wise,
<pb facs="tcp:10364:20"/>
and lerned men, when therby (and that without coste, or trauaile) he attaineth knowleage in many thin ges, and also endeweth hym selfe both with wisedome, sobrenes, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy, and manerly fashons. That and if eany mishappe chaunce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the seruaunt, as by slaunder or violence done apon hym, who but the master is ready to support him, if he fall in eany greuous malady, what thought (trow ye) wyll a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge maister conceiue for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerey?
