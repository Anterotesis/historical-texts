            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT has been a complaint of late a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome of the Romiſh Church, that the Proteſtants have miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Doctrine of their Church, to make That and Them odious to the World: And on the other ſide, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants accuſe ſeveral of the late Writers in that Church, of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſguiſing and palliating their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, the better to impoſe upon and ſeduce thoſe to their Religion that do not ſufficiently underſtand it. The latter juſtifie their charge by producing ſuch Authors as have in ſeveral Ages not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:106659:3"/>
taught that Doctrine, but taught it as the Doctrine of their Church: The former deny the charge by appealing from particular Authors to an higher Authority, to Councils and publick Acts and Decrees, to Miſſals, Breviaries, Catechiſms,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now though thoſe Proteſtants are not to be blamed, when the Authors they quote have been firſt licenſed and approved in that Church, and were never afterward condemn'd by it; yet in compoſing this Catechiſm out of their Writings, to avoid contention as much as I can, I have generally obſerved their directions, and have ſeldom made uſe of particular Authors among them, but when it is for the Explication of a Doctrine that is not ſufficiently explain'd, or for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of a Doctrine generally received. And if after all, any ſhall oppoſe his own, or the Sentiments of ſome Authors of a later date, to theſe Authorities I
<pb facs="tcp:106659:3"/>
here produce; I conceive we have no more reaſon to take the Sence of their Church from their particular opinion, and modern Explication, than they would have us to take it from particular Authors among themſelves, which they decline. I am very confident that the Quotations throughout are true (exceping what Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors may happen to eſcape the Preſs) having again and again examined them; and I have been as careful as I could not to miſtake the ſence of them; that I might rightly underſtand and truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Doctrine which I profeſs to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for without a faithful and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial examination of an error, there can be no ſolid or true confutation of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Reader will eaſily obſerve, that the Roman Catechiſm is all along on the left Page, and the Reply on the right.</hi>

This Sovereign power they were forbidden to attempt or deſire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 26. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging it, that he challenged an equality with the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 17. and upon occaſion withſtood S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Gal. 2. 11.</p>
                  <p>To this we may add the judgment of S. <hi>Cyprian. The other Apoſtles are the ſame S.</hi> Peter <hi>was, endowed with an equal fellowſhip of honour and power.</hi> Epiſt. de unit. Eccleſ.</p>

Ezek. 18. 31, 32. <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit, for why will ye die,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The End is the Honour of God, and the Edification of the Church; and then God is honoured, when the Church is edified. The Means conducing to that End, are to have the Service ſo adminiſtred, as may inform the Mind, engage the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and increaſe Devotion.

                  <p>For God alone can receive our Prayer, or can give what we pray for, or be the Object of our Faith and Truſt.

                     <hi>R. 34, 35, 36, 37. THere is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Reaſon for all,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 8. 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather, that is riſen again, who is even at the Right-Hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scripture knows no difference, nor doth teach us to diſtinguiſh (as they do) between a Mediator of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and Redemption; but on the contrary teaches, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106659:21"/>
he alone makes Interceſſion for us, who died and roſe, and is at the Right-Hand of God, and he alone has a right to our Prayers, and to him alone may we addreſs them.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Origen: All Prayers, and Supplications, and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, are to be ſent up to God the Lord of all, by that High Prieſt who is above all Angels, being the iiving Word of God.</hi> L. 5. cont. Celſ. p. 233, 239.</p>
                  <p>So again; <hi>We ought to pray only to the God over all, and his only Son the firſt born of every Creature, who, as our High Prieſt, offers his Prayers to his God, and our God.</hi> Lib. 8. p. 395, 402.</p>
                  <p>To have other Mediators and Interceſſors, is <hi>not to hold the Head,</hi> in the Judgment of the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 19. and ſo the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> determines, where it's ſaid, <hi>Chriſtians ought not to forſake the Church, and invocate Angels.—If any Man therefore be found to give himſelf to this privy Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, let him be Anathema; becauſe he hath forſaken our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, and betaken himſelf to Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which we are taught what to conceive of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath innumerable Mediators beſides Chriſt, and by whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Interceſſion they promiſe themſelves the more effectual Audience and Succeſs in the Court of Heaven. For if there be but one Mediator betwixt God and Man, then that one Mediator doth exclude any other Mediators, as well as one God doth exclude other Gods. A plurality of Mediators being no more conſiſtent with one Mediator, than a plurality of Gods is with one God. And we may as well conclude, that though there be that are called Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, yet to us Chriſtians there is but one Mediator; as <hi>though there be that are called Gods, yet to us there is but one God:</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6. Such a Mediator as <hi>is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them.</hi> Heb. 7. 25.

WE do honour the bleſſed Virgin as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Holy Jeſus, and as ſhe was a Perſon of eminent Piety while on Earth, and a glorious Saint now in Heaven; but we do not think it lawful to give that Honour to Her, which belongs not to a Creature, and doth equalize Her with her Redeemer, as they do in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For, is Chriſt an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate?

But becauſe theſe things are diſperſed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books, I ſhall direct the Reader to a Compendium of this kind, in a Book printed lately in <hi>London,</hi> where the Author ſaith, That <hi>whatever Gifts are beſtowed upon us by Ieſus, we receive them by the Mediation of</hi> Mary. <hi>No one being gracious to Ieſus that is not devoted to</hi> Mary. <hi>That the Power of</hi> Mary <hi>in the Kingdom of Ieſus, is ſutable to her Maternity.</hi>—And <hi>tho the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſome great Sinners may be ſo deplorable, that the limited Excellency and Merits cannot ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually bend the Mercies of Ieſus to relieve them; yet ſuch is the acceptableneſs of the Mother of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to Ieſus, that whoſoever is under the verge of her Protection, may confide in her Interceſſion to Ieſus.</hi> That the Perſon devoted to her, is to beg of her to accompany him as his <hi>Sacred Guide, Advocate, and Champion, againſt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of Sin and Senſuality.</hi>

When we read ſo much of the Bleſſed Virgin in Books of this kind, and ſo little of her in the Divine Writings, we cannot but reflect upon what is ſaid by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> of a certain Sect of Women that in his Time offered Cakes to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which he calls an <hi>Impious Thing,</hi> and ſaith is altogether <hi>contrary to the Doctrine of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Haereſ. 78. p. 1054. Par. 1622.</note>. And he further adds; <hi>This the Holy Ghoſt doth warn us of, in which Chriſt ſaith, Woman, What have I to do with thee?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Where he calls her Woman, and as it were propheſying, to refute thoſe Schiſms and Hereſies which he knew would ariſe in the World; and that no one being moved by a certain admiration of the Bleſſed Virgin, might turn himſelf to thoſe dotages of Hereſies,</hi> &amp;c. And he adds; <hi>Let the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>be honoured, but the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt be adored</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Haereſ. 79. N. 4, 7, &amp;c.</note>. And much more hath that Father there to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But what would this good Father have ſaid, if inſtead of a Chair adorned and ſet forth in honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (as thoſe Women did) he had found her advanced to a Throne of a Mediatrix in Heaven? What if inſtead of Cakes, there had been Litanies and Prayers offered to her, and that in more abundance than to Chriſt himſelf? What if he had found them praying, <hi>O holy Mother, ſuccour the Miſerable, help the Weak, comfort thoſe that mourn?</hi> (Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viar. Rom. Aeſtiv. Suffragia.) I doubt not but he would have ſaid of this, what he doth of the other, That <hi>they would obtrude her upon us for God,</hi> and have call'd it <hi>Hereſy</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

                     <hi>R.</hi> 69, 70, 71. THE Scripture when it extols the perfection and infinite value of Chriſt's Sacrifice, doth infer from it, that there needed not therefore any repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. <hi>Heb. 7. 27. He needed not daily, as thoſe high Prieſts, to offer up ſacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for this he did once, when he offered up himſelf.</hi> But if the ſame Chriſt is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Maſs as was on the Croſs, and that unbloody ſacrifice is alike propitiatory as the bloody, there is then a repetition of the ſame ſacrifice, and he is daily offered. And what is it to ſay the one was bloody and the other is unbloody, when the unbloody is of the ſame virtue, and is applied to the ſame end as the bloody? So that as if Chriſt had again been bloodily offer'd up, there had been a repetition of that Sacrifice; ſo there is a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of it when he is offered up unbloodily. To have then a perfect Sacrifice daily repeated, and a ſacrifice without ſuffering, and a propitiation and remiſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blood, are alike irreconcilable to the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22, 25.

            <head>The CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>I Might have added a 5th Section about the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> challenges over Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and about their Canonization of Saints, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> and Beads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the uſe theſe and the like are applied to. I might have further conſidered their Notes of a Church, and ſhew'd how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are not true, or however do not belong to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but that would be too large a Subject to enter upon: And what has been ſaid will be ſufficient to ſhew how far that Church hath err'd from Truth and Reaſon. For if we ſet their <hi>Councils, Miſſals, Breviaries, Rituals</hi> and <hi>Catechiſms</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Antiquity</hi> on the other; we ſhall find their Doctrines and Practices as well oppoſite to thoſe, as they are oppoſite to ours: And may be aſſured that Perſons may ſooner loſe their Eyes, than find there ſuch a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as they contend for, or the Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Pope, the Invocation of Saints, the Worſhip of Images, Service in an Unknown Tongue, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, Purgatory, and the reſt that we contend againſt. Scripture and indubitable Antiquity, are the Authority we appeal to, thither we refer our caſe; and can heartily conclude with that of <hi>Vincentius Lyrin. That is to be held, which hath been believed every where, always, and by all,</hi> Contr. Haer. c. 3.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>A Late Author having ſome days <note place="margin">A Reply to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Accomodation. <hi>pag.</hi> 19.</note> ſince thought fit to ſingle out a Paſſage of the foregoing <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi> to help out his Charge which he produces againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for Miſrepreſenting the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I ſhall take the advantage of this new Edition, of ſhewing on which ſide (ſo far as this <hi>Catechiſm</hi> is concerned) the Miſrepreſentation lies. Thus he begins.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Another way of Miſrepreſenting the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is in pretending to deliver their Doctrine, and then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſomething which is notoriouſly falſe, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deteſted by them: This is what is done by the Author of a <hi>Catechiſm</hi> lately publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who undertakes to give a Syſteme <note place="margin">A Catechiſm truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 56.</note> of Popiſh Doctrines <hi>truly Repreſented,</hi> according to their own moſt received Authors, and Councils; and coming to ſpeak of Images, he ſays the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> PRAY TO THEM; which is ſo foul a Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, that the Author of the Anſwer to <hi>The Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns <note place="margin">Page 17.</note> me, for making it a part of my Miſrepreſentations, as if 'twere never charged againſt the <hi>Papiſts. This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>would inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, as tho WE did directly charge them</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>with PRAYING to their Images, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further reſpect; which we are ſo far from charging them with, that I do not know of any people in the World liable to that charge.</hi> Thus what one <hi>Proteſtant</hi> aſſerts poſitively, as the Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> another <hi>Proteſtant</hi> rejects as a Miſrepreſentation ſo <hi>foul,</hi> as not to be imputed to the worſt of Infidels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But if after all this clamour, the aforeſaid <hi>Anſwer</hi> doth charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Praying to Images,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106659:43"/>
with a Farther Reſpect; and the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> doth not charge them with <hi>Praying to Images,</hi> without a Farther Reſpect; Then wherein doth <hi>one Proteſtant aſſert poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, what another rejects as a Miſrepreſentation?</hi> And if this Charge, of thus <hi>Praying to Images,</hi> be alike maintain'd and prov'd by both, Where is the Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation? And here to do right to the aboveſaid <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> to the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and to Truth in both, I ſhall ſet down the words at full, as they are in the one and the other; and which our Author, for Reaſons beſt known to himſelf, hath forborn to do. To begin with the <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It ſaith,</p>
            <p>
               <q>It doth not look fairly, to put the <note place="margin">The Doctrine and Practiſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in Anſwer to the Papiſt Miſrepreſent. <hi>c. 1. p.</hi> 17.</note> Title of <hi>Praying to Images; for the Queſtion is about The Worſhip of Images: Whereas this Title would inſinuate</hi>
               </q> [So as it is in the <hi>Reply,</hi> but then immediately follows] <q>I do therefore grant what our Author ſaith, <hi>viz. That all the veneration they expreſs before Images, whether by Kneeling, Praying, lifting up the Eyes, burning Candles, Incenſe, &amp;c.</hi> is not at all done for the Image, but is wholly referr'd to the things repreſented, which he intends to honour by theſe Actions. But I hope now it is no Miſrepreſenting for us to ſay, That <hi>they do Kneel, Pray, Lift up their Eyes, burn Candles, Incenſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>before their Images;</hi> WHICH IS ALL I CHARGE THEM WITH AT PRESENT. This <hi>Charge at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>
               </q> would have diſcovered too much, and have put a wary Reader upon looking farther, and therefore it was not fit to be inſerted: And if he had, then the Miſrepreſentation had been ſpoil'd: For the Anſwerer a little after returns to the point, after this manner:</p>
            <p>
               <q>To come now to our Author's Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Miſrepreſentation he ſaith has <note place="margin">P. 21, 22.</note> been as to this point [of Praying to Images]. <hi>A Papiſt Repreſented believes it damnable to worſhip Stocks and Stones for Gods; or to Pray to Pictures or Images of Chriſt, the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or any other Saints.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106659:44"/>
What ſaith the Anſwerer to this?</p>
            <q>
               <p>Theſe Expreſſions are capable of a double ſenſe; and therefore this is not fair Repreſenting.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>To worſhip Stocks or Stones for Gods,</hi> may ſignify two things: 1. To believe the very Stocks or Stones to be Gods. And this we do not charge them with. 2. To give to Images made of Wood and Stone, the Worſhip due only to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if they will clear themſelves of this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>To Pray to Images of Chriſt, or the Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> may likewiſe be taken in two ſenſes. 1. To Pray to them, ſo as to expect to be heard by the meer Images, and ſo we do not charge them with it. 2. To Pray to them, ſo as to expect rather to be heard by themſelves, for praying to them by their Images. And if this be not ſo, To what end are the Prayers made in the Conſecration of Images, for thoſe that ſhall pray before them? To what purpoſe do ſo many go in long Pilgrimages to certain Images, if they do not hope to be better heard for Praying there?</p>
            </q>
            <p>A little after, the Anſwerer farther Replies, <q>He [the Miſrepreſenter, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> is come at <note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> laſt to <hi>Veneration before Images.</hi> And is this all? Dares he deny <hi>Veneration to Images?</hi> When the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath determined it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                     </expan> venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem impertiendam.</hi> What is this Veneration <hi>before Images</hi> only? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath a Chapter on purpoſe to prove, That <hi>true and proper Worſhip is to be given to Images.</hi> And was he a <hi>Miſrepreſenter? Suarez</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is an Article of Faith, That Worſhip is to be given to them.</hi> But if the Veneration be only before them, Why are they Conſecrated, and ſet up in places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Adoration?</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that what more evident, than that the Anſwerer doth not only charge, but prove it upon them, that they do <hi>pray to Images,</hi> but with a <hi>further reſpect,</hi> and that 1. from the conſecration of them; 2. from the places they are ſet up in; 3. from Pilgrimages to them.</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to the Catechiſm, which thus propounds the caſe:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106659:44"/>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 44. <q>What kind of Reverence, or Worſhip is required to be given to <note place="margin">Catechiſm Q. 44. p. 42.</note> Images and Pictures in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 
               <q>They kiſs them, uncover the Head, and fall down before them; offer Incenſe, and pray to them, and uſe all ſuch poſtures of Worſhip as they would do to the perſon or perſons thereby repreſented, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 45. <q>What do they profeſs is their intention in the Reverence they give to Images and Pictures?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 
               <q>They declare, that the Honour given to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Pictures, is referred to the Prototypes, or the Perſons repreſented by them, whether God the Father, Chriſt, Angels or Saints: And when they do fall down before the Image or Picture, they do worſhip God, or Chriſt, the Angel or Saint.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From which Anſwers laid together, or either of them intire, it manifeſtly appears, that they are therein ſaid to <hi>pray to Images,</hi> as thoſe Images repreſent the Perſon whom by thoſe Images they direct their Worſhip to. For the Prayer is to the Object to which the Veneration is to be given, but the Veneration is to be given (ſaith the Council of <hi>Trent)</hi> to the Image, as thus repreſenting; and ſo is the Prayer.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, the Anſwer and the Catechiſm both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;</p>
            <p>1. That there is in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a praying to Images.</p>
            <p>2. That they pray to them after the ſame manner as they bow and burn Incenſe to them, which is with reſpect to the Prototypes, or Perſons repreſented.</p>
            <p>3. That praying to Images, with reſpect to the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types, is a praying to Images.</p>
            <p>So that our Author hath been very unfortunate in the diſcoveries he hath made of a direct oppoſition betwixt Proteſtant and Proteſtant in this matter. And if he hath been alike partial in his other Collections from Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Authors as in this, he will gain no Credit to the Cauſe he labours to defend, nor do any injury to that he doth oppoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106659:45"/>
But perhaps though the Anſwer and the Catechiſm are at laſt found to agree, yet what they agree in, is a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation; and that to charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>praying to Images,</hi> is to charge them with what is <hi>notoriouſly falſe, and abſolutely deteſted by them</hi> (as the Author ſuggeſts). To this there needs no other Reply than what is above tranſcribed from the <hi>Anſwer; viz.</hi> That <hi>to pray to Images,</hi> may be taken in two ſenſes: 1. To pray to them, ſo as to expect to be heard by the meer Images, without any further reſpect; which we are ſo far from charging them with, that we know not of any People in the World, who are not like Stones and Stocks themſelves, who are liable to that charge. 2. To pray to them with a farther reſpect to the Perſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by repreſented, and ſo as to expect to be rather heard by themſelves, for praying to them by their Images. And if this be not ſo, to what end are the Prayers made in the Conſecration of Images, for thoſe that ſhall pray before them? To what purpoſe do ſo many go in long Pilgrimages to certain Images, if they do not hope to be better heard for praying there? Or why are they ſet up in places proper for Adoration? Why are the people required to give Veneration and Worſhip to them? And laſtly, Why do they direct their Prayers to them? As they do to the Croſs, which they ſalute after this manner, <hi>Hail, O Croſs, our only Hope, in this time of the paſſion. Increaſe grace in the godly; and blot out the ſins of the guilty;</hi> as the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> hath ſhewed, Q. 46.</p>
            <p>Theſe things require a little conſideration; and when our Author hath proved them not to be held or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

               </gap>h to call what has been charged upon them, <hi>A.foul Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and notorious falſhood;</hi> but till then, I muſt beg his pardon if I continue of the ſame mind, and conclude as before, That a part of the Worſhip given to Images in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is, in the ſenſe before ſpoken of, <hi>To burn Incenſe, and to pray to them.</hi>
