            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But in short time the reputation of this undertaking grew so high, and the government of <hi>Virginia</hi> was thought so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, as it must bee confirmed upon some Peere of the Realm, and the <hi>L. de la Warr</hi> was nominated thereunto, and went Governour by Patent from the Company for three years.

And hee by the ability of his body as well as mind, through much indurance, by want in the miscarriage of supplies, brought home, as a great instance of his labours and value of the Countrey, at least sixteen severall sorts of staple commodities, to be raised and propagated in this Plantation.</p>

            <p>At private meetings of the E. of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Sir <hi>Edwin San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Danvers,</hi> &amp;c. severall observations and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls occasioned this result, that nothing would serve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the honour and reputation of the design for <hi>Virginia,</hi> and re-advance the prosperity thereof, so much as an entire and reall account published, the better to discover former negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences or corruptions, and to beget a better care for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p>Against any good effect by such Audit much endeavour and backwardnesse appeared in all kind of Accountants, but most in Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>'s Creatures or dependents; whereby great difficulty, or at least dilatorinesse was found, which Sir <hi>M.

They desiring and forcing to be excused, left the whole care and pains to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63856:6"/>
Sir <hi>E. Sandys,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Danvers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wroth,</hi> who finding a multiplication of difficulties and interruptions from day to day, were forced after two or three moneths time; first, to suppositate a new and direct method for accounting for the future, which in a book of Account exposed weekly at every Court on the Table, might the better satisfie; whilst a larger time was taken to rake up the more ancient obstruction or concealment. In which pursuit Sir <hi>E. Sandys,</hi> Sir <hi>I. Danvers,</hi> and most times Mr. <hi>I. Wroth</hi> were together five dayes of the week, from between nine and ten of the clock in the morning, till five or six in the evening, for the space of nine moneths; not without retryving and possibility of gaining in a very considerable sum, to be charged on Sir <hi>Th. Smith,</hi> as was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally beleeved.</p>
            <p>Mean while much industry was used by Bed-chamber-men, and other super-intendent great persons to beget a disrelish in K. <hi>Iames</hi> against the proceedings of the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the score that he was to uphold Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>'s honour and reputation, so prevalent in Companies, and amongst the most wealthy Citizens, to procure him loans for supplying his most necessary 'occasions: which by meanes of Sir <hi>Iohn Danvers</hi> familiar correspondence with some of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that did serve P. <hi>Henry,</hi> was prevented, by inculcating the consideration of palpable injustice, in obstructing the power granted to the Company: as others in like manner were carefull, whereby the businesse of <hi>Virginia</hi> forced (as it were) a passage through opposition, both forain and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick; for the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador (whose power was great in the Court Counsells) was very sedulous, and spared no money to hinder the same.</p>
            <p>The good hope of this Plantation bringing on the ancient Adventurers, and their moneys, encouraged also the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and attaining the grant of a Lottery over all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which seconded with respective private Letters to the generous and well affected persons in every County, caused great sums of money to be brought in, and imployed for the Plantation, which brought on the casting out Sir <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> and establishing Sir <hi>Ed. Sandys</hi> Treasurer and Governour of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63856:6"/>
the Company, by whose great care and abilities <hi>Virginia's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and plenty seemed a very hopeful addition to the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mean-whiles the care and circumspection of the now Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour drew all sorts of experienced persons of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Minerall men from <hi>Germany,</hi> Vignerons from <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> to present themselves, who were in numbers entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to assist the industry of the Planters, which with many other concurrent circumstances of encouragement appeared in one years time advantagious to the design beyond expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, as by Sir <hi>E. Sandys</hi> account of his Transactions was made manifest unto hundreds of Lords and Gentlemen assembled at their Quarter Court in <hi>Easter</hi> term, the time for the new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Treasurer or Governour. At which time when the Court prepared to make a new election, most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to choose Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> for another year, Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Kirkham</hi> one of the Clerks of the Signet, with Mr. Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Hammersley,</hi> presented themselves as Messengers from K. <hi>Iames,</hi> congratulating the hopefull progresse of the <hi>Virginia</hi> Plantation, but withall professing his Majesties great care, where so many of his subjects were concerned. And therefore the Countrey being so remote, and wherein the greatest Merchants might be most knowing through their experience and interest, his Majesty recommended six persons, whereof he expected one should be that day chosen their Governour; which struck a silence into the whole Court for a time, but in conclusion declared (as beleeved) by <hi>Will.</hi> E. of <hi>Pembrooke, Henry</hi> E. of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and others, to bee against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies just freedome of election granted by Letters Patents, and caused by some mis-information given the King, whereof they would speak with him. In the mean time an order was entred for continuance of that Quarter Court on a day the week after.</p>
            <p>The same Court again assembled, and those Lords desired a preparatve meeting of the Councell for <hi>Virginia,</hi> where it was freely recounted, how K. <hi>Iames</hi> remained obstinately excepting against the person of Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> declaring him his greatest enemy, and that hee could hardly think well

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63856:9"/>
as was confessed. When by way of congratulation it was proposed, that now there was so great numbers and Trade like to follow in that Plantation, some care might be taken for their safety by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial fortifications, &amp; an account thereof made to the King. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was ordered at the Bord, that <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrooke, Southampton</hi> and other Lords of the Councell and Company for <hi>Virginia,</hi> should make enquiry and acquaint his Majesty of what was, and would be done in that point, for preservation of the lives of his subjects against enemies, either Natives of <hi>Virginia,</hi> or others, since hee had vowed, that if he had not satisfaction therein, he would think himself bound to take the whole government and the appointing of Governours into his own hands. Which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the calling together of a Councell for <hi>Virginia</hi> of all that were neer, who as they cleerly saw the desperate malignity of the Secret-Court-Spanish party, so often appearing in persecution of this Plantation; so had they a great apprehension the King could not be easily satisfied, since the Companies treasure was exhausted, and there was little hopes of more contribution or Adventurers, whilst they lay under such discouragement. Sir <hi>Iohn Danvers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring some notion of hope, and looking over the books of Letters from <hi>Virginia,</hi> hee observed that throughout the year past there was never lesse then 17 saile of shipping in <hi>Iames</hi> River, the heart of the Plantation, inferring, that if the Kings fairer comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance should keep the Company in the same encouragement, the strength of so many floting Forts in that flat scituation, would be equivalent to, if not exceeding any possible speedy fortification; which the E. of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> &amp;c. conceived fully sufficient to satisfie the King, if he had not an inveterate disaffection to the work: and this proved an answer appearingly well received by the King.</p>
            <p>Now had the Company a little leasure from the stormes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition of the Councell Bord, whilst neverthelesse particular persons of all ranks, and divers under the countenance of those disaffected Lords &amp; others, were faln from the true sense and justice of the work chiefly intended. But it was not long before Sir <hi>Lionel Cranfield,</hi> presently after E. of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> about the time of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to be L.

acts of Sir <hi>Iohn Danvers,</hi> wherein he took opportunity faithfully and kindly to serve his worthy friends. One whereof was this, That shortly after the judgment against the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company, one Mr. <hi>Collingwood</hi> came unto him, recounting his acknowledgement of great obligations for recommending him to the place of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company, which was growing every day more valuable, in case it had been happily continued: and at the same time acquainted him, that three Merchant men, one after another had been with him at his house, commending his parts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for imployment, and much pittying his case to be now desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of means for the maintenance of him and his family, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in a subtil &amp; soothing way, that as he might perceive the Kings displeasure against the E. of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and Sir <hi>E. Sandys,</hi> so would he gain imployment and great benefit to himself for all the days of his life, by saying or discovering ought of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, or otherwise, that should bring any ill reflection upon their persons. When his answer was, That he knew nothing but honor and justice in their ways, nor upon any terms would bee drawn to such unthankfulnesse, as to offer the least matter against them. It is true (said he) they mentioned nothing relating to your self (which he thought was forborn in regard of the particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and obligation he had to him.) Nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ould Mr. <hi>Collingwood</hi> think it possible openly to detect and convince those Merchants of this wickedness, because they came singly unto him, and by the same knavery would deny their attempts, but that this only was to be taken as a caution against such kind of base insinuation. Sir <hi>Iohn Danvers</hi> asking further, where there was any of relation to those affairs that might be te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>

Sandys,</hi> and he being of unsetled or loose life, might possibly be drawn to serve the turns of Malevolents, &amp;c. Sir <hi>I.

countrey to see his friends, giving him a part of reward for his pains, &amp; obliging him to come to him again for the remainder, by which means he kept him wholly out of the way, and from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And assoon after as he could speak with my Lord of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> carryed him the said authenticall copies, declaring the information of <hi>Collingwood,</hi> and that having sometimes heard of a great governing court Lady, who was desirous to dispossess a femal Heir that had married a young Gentleman, as to make her rather a wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e to a creature or attendant of her owne, and after working somewhat in diverting their affections each from other, a legall prosecution was had to disprove the marriage, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was affirmed by all sorts of circumstance &amp; witnesses, yet by corrupting a Register, who in his Entries put a negative for an affirmative, He that was Judge of the cause <hi>secundum allegata &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata</hi> expressed on the Registry, declared a nullity of the former marriage, whereby the heir was remarried to a second person. This said Sir <hi>Iohn Danvers</hi> gave him to consider, how the malice against the Earl, &amp;c. failing in all other inventions, might possibly in like manner corrupt the records of the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company, getting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m, as they did not long after into their custody and power. Wherefore he presented his Lordship with those true copies to be alwaies ready for iustification. The Earl was so affected therewith that he took Sir <hi>I. Danvers</hi> into his arms with very great thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, saying, Who could have thought of such a friendship but <hi>Charles Danvers</hi> his brother, who was the truest friend that ever man had? and thereupon calling his kinsman Mr. <hi>Wriothsley</hi> chiefly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

time to enquire of the King, what might bee the ground of his distast and hatred against him: to whom the King gave this answer, that he knew Sir <hi>Ed. Sandys</hi> to be a man of exorbitant Ambition, upon the esteem he had of his own abilities, and that because by his incessant importunity he could not prevail to be made Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State he had used his utmost endeavour to cross the Kings best intentions both ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>erall and particular; and this considered, the King said, he could not think well of any that would hold friendship with him. Mr. <hi>Carr</hi> communicating this to Sir <hi>I. Danvers,</hi> he told him, there was but one tryall more to be made, that since possibly, according to the usuall stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems practised in Court, some might have unseasonably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned the King in his behalf, and under the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ence of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship done him some great prejudice in incensing the Kings hatred against him, he would be pleased to venture so far, as to presse the King to know who they were that sollicited his Majesty for him, without his concurrence in a businesse that had brought so much of his displeasure upon him. Which Mr. <hi>Carr</hi> as nobly undertook, when the King was fain to take on him the whole matter and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, saying, <hi>Sandys</hi> was too crafty to put his own ambitious design into any other hand, or move it otherwise then by his own mouth, from whom he had received such encroaching importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities as had utterly destroyed any interest hee might ever expect in his good opinion: and so the King fell off in so great a fury, and with such imprecations from Mr. <hi>Carr,</hi> that hee meeting with Sir <hi>I. Danvers</hi> bewailed the case with a very great doubtfulnesse what to think, moving questions about the integrity of Sir <hi>Edw. Sandys,</hi> which had been so much declared and beleeved. and so Sir <hi>I. Danvers</hi> and Mr. <hi>Carr</hi> parted, much wondring at this.</p>
            <p>Not long after the Court being removed to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> Sir <hi>Edw. Sandys</hi> having some businesse with my Lord Privy-S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him. Whereupon Sir <hi>Iohn Danvers</hi> told him he would warrant to stand so before him in the throng that he might have full view of the King without being discovered by him; which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly performed for about a quarter of an hour, and so both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired out of that room. And afterwards Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> wondring that the King was so much altered in body and countenance since he had seen him last, which was when he came first out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he was with him. Is it possible, said Sir <hi>Iohn Danvers,</hi> (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the passage Mr. <hi>Carr</hi> had told him) that you having been so much in Parliament, and about <hi>London,</hi> should never have seen the King in so long a time? it seems almost past beleef. Sir <hi>Edwin</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly affirmed it, adding that from some apprehension given the King from his being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when he had discourse with him, but of nothing that might give any offence, he had been warned by entire friends, and had observed by many passages in his owne particular, that it would neither be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
