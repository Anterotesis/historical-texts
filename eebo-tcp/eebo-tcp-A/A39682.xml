            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three sad sights with
which our eyes should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
affect our hearts. The
(1) Is to behold in every
place, so many prophane and
dissolute ones who bear the
very image of Sathan: the face of whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
plainly discovers, what they are,
and whither they are going, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 18.
19. These look like themselves, the Children
of wrath: The (2) is to see so many cursed
hypocrites artificially disguising themselves,
and with marvellous dexterity acting the
parts of Saints, so that even a judicious
eye may sometimes mistake the <hi>Similar
Workings</hi> of the Spirit on them, for his
<pb facs="tcp:34349:3"/>
               <hi>saveing</hi> workings on others: to hear such a
person conferring, praying; bewailing his
corruptions, and talking of his experiences;
would easily perswade a man to believe, that
he hath the heart as well as the face of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Christian: For
<q>Sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat.</q>
So the people of God doe speak, so they pray,
and even so they open their conditions: these
look like Saints, but are none. The (3) Is to see
so many real Saints in whom the Spirit of
truth is, who get through the impetuous work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of their corruptions, and neglecting of the
watch over their hearts, doe often fall into
such scandalous practises, that they look like
hy pocrits though they are not so.</p>
            <p>These are 3 sad sights indeed, and oh that
my head were waters and mine eyes fountains
of tears, that I might weep abundantly over
them all!</p>
            <p>For the first I would mourn heartily, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that they (so continsing) must be
damned eternally, 2 <hi>Thes. 1. 8, 9. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
            <p>For the second, I would both weep and
tremble, considering that they (so abideing)
must be damned doubly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 51</p>
            <p>And for the third, no less than any of the
rest because, though they themselves may and
shall be saved, yet their examples make fast
<pb facs="tcp:34349:3"/>
the bonds of death upon both the former;
<hi>Matth. 18. 7. 2 Sam.</hi> 12. 13. 14.</p>
            <p>Alas! that ever they should shed the blood
of others souls, for whom Christ shed his own
blood! that ever they should be <hi>cruel</hi> to
others, who have found Christ so <hi>kind</hi> to
them! I know they dare not doe it directly
and intentionally, but so it proves occasionally
and eventually: suffer me here to digress a
little, and expostulate with these prejudiced
and hardned Souls, I will presently return to
you again. O why doe you mischief your own
Souls by other mens examples? because they
stumble and break their shins, will you fall and
break your necks? I desire all such as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
themselves by these things, and take up a
good opinion of their own deplorable condition;
would soberly consider and answer these three
Queries.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth religion any way counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
or patronize the sinful practises of its
professors, or doth it not rather impartially
and severely condemn them? it is the glory
of the Christian Religion that it is pure and
undefiled, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 27. no doctrine so holy
<hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 8. nor doth any make more provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for an holy life, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11, 12. Indeed
there is a case wherein we may charge the
evil practices of men upon their principles, but
that is when their practices naturally flow
<pb facs="tcp:34349:4"/>
from, and necessarily follow their principles:
as for example, if I see a <hi>Papist</hi> sin boldly,
I may charge it upon his principles, for they
set pardons to sale, and so make way for loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
If I see an <hi>Arminian</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light the grace
of God, and proudly advance himself, I may
cry shame upon his principles, which directly
lead to it: but can I doe so where such practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are condemned and provided against by
their own avowed principles that commit
them?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Qu.</hi> Is it not a most irrational thing to let
fly at religion because of the scandalous ways
of some, whilst in the mean time you wholy
slight and overlook the holy and heavenly
conversations of many others? are all that
profess godliness loose and careless in their
lives? no, some are an ornament to their
profession, and the glory of Christ: and why
must the innocent be condemned with the
guilty? why the eleven for one Iudas?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Qu.</hi> If you condemn religion because
of the scandalous lives of some that profess
it: must you not then cast off all religion in
the world and turn down-right <hi>Atheists?</hi>
surely this is the consequent of it: for what
religion is there, but some that profess it walk
contrary to that their profession: and then as
<hi>Constantine</hi> told the <hi>Novatian,</hi> you must
set up your ladder and goe to heaven by your
self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34349:4"/>
But alas! it is not our printed apologies
for religion, but the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible reformations of
its professors that must both salve its honour
and remove those fatal stumbling blocks at
which the blind world strikes and falls into
eternal perdition.</p>
            <p>Now there are two ways by which this may
be effected. First, by convincing the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of professors of their miscarriages, and
the evil and agravations of them. Secondly
by medicateing the heart, and cleansing the
fountain whence they proceed: in the first of
these a worthy and eminent servant of Christ
bath lately laboured, holding a clear Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
glasse before the faces of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
which truly represents their
spots and blemishes.<note place="margin">See Gospel Glasse.</note> If he that
reads it, will consider, apply, and practise,
it shall doubtless turn to his salvation, but if
it turn to no good account to him that reads it;
I know it shall turn to a testimony for him
that wrote it. The second is a principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of this small treatise, the subject whereof
is exceeding weighty and of daily use to the
people of God: though the manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it be attended with many defects and
weaknesses: every one cannot be excellent
who yet may be useful.</p>
            <p>I will exercise your patience no longer than
whilst I tell you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34349:5"/>
1. Why I published it to the view of the
world.</p>
            <p>2. Why I direct it particularly to you.</p>
            <p>First for the publication of it, take this
sincere and brief account, that as I was led to
this subject by a special providence, so to the
publication of it by a kind of necessity: the
providence at first leading me to it was this,
A dear and choyce friend of my intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
being under much inward trouble
upon the account of some special heart disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
opened the case to me, and earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
some rules and helps in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
whilst I was bending my thoughts to
that special case, divers other cases of like
importance (some of which were dependent
upon that under consideration) occurred to my
thoughts, and this scripture which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon, presented it self asa fit founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the whole discourse, which being
lengthned out to what you see: divers friends
requested me to transcribe for their use; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the cases here handled: and some others
begd me to publish the whole, to which I was
in a manner necessitated to save the pains of
transcribing, which to me is a very tedious
and tiresome work: and just as I had almost
finished the copy an opportunity presented (and
that somewhat strangely) to make it publick.
So that from first to last I have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb facs="tcp:34349:5"/>
beyond my first intentions in this thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If any say the world is even cloyed
with books, and therefore though the discourse
be necessary, yet the publication is needless.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. I answer, there are multitudes of
books indeed, and of them many concern not
themselves about root truths, and practical
godliness, but spend their strength upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
notions, and frivolous controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies:
many also strike at root truths, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to undermine the power of godliness:
and some there are that nourish the root, and
tend to clear and confirm, to prepare and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the geart truths of the gospel that they may
be bread for souls to live and feed on: now,
though I could wish, that those that have
handled the pen of the scribe, had better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
their time and pains then to obtrude
such useless discourses upon the world, yet
for books of the latter rank, I say, that when
husbandmen complain of too much corn, let
Christians complain of too many such books.</p>
            <p>2. And if you be so highly conceited of
your own furniture and ability, that such
books are needless to you: if you let them alone
they will doe you no hurt, and other poor hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
souls will be glad of them, and bless God
for what you despise and leave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If it be said that several of the cases
here handled touch not your condition, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34349:6"/>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. That which is not your condition
may be anothers condition. If you be placed
in an easie, full, and prosperous state, and so
have no need of the helps here offered to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
your heart under pinching wants, others
are forced to live by faith for every daies
provision: If you be dandled upon the knee
of providence, some of your Brethren are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its feat. If you have inward peace, and
tranquility of Spirit, and so need not the
Councels here given to ward off those despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
conclusions that poor afflicted souls are
ready to draw upon themselves at such a time;
yet it may be a word in season to them, and
they may say as <hi>David to Abigail,</hi> blessed be
thou of the Lord, and blessed be thy advice.</p>
            <p>2. That may be your condition shortly,
which is not your condition for present: say
not thy Mountain stands strong, thou shalt
never be moved: there are changes in the
right hand of the most High, and then those
truths which are little more esteemed than
Hedge—fruits, will be as Aples of Gold in
Pictures of Silver: In <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 11. The
Prophet there teaches the <hi>Jews</hi> (who then
divelt in their own Houses) how to defend
their Religion in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and what they
should say to the <hi>Caldeans</hi> there, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that verse is written in <hi>Caldee:</hi> So much
for the reasons of its Publication: Next for

the Dedication of it to you, I was induced
thereto by the Consideration. (1.) Of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
I have to you above all the people in the
world: I look upon my gifts as yours; my
time as yours, and all the Talents I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with as yours: It is not with you as
with a woman whose Husband is dead, and so
is freed from the Law of her Husband, the
relation still continues, and so do all the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
duties of it. (2.) By the consideration of
my necessitated absence from you, I would not
that personal absence should by insensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
untwist (as usually it doth) the cord of
friendship, and therefore have endeavoured (as
absent friends use to do) to preserve and
strengthen it by this small remembrance. It
was <hi>Vespatian's</hi> answer to <hi>Apollonius</hi> when
be desired access for two <hi>Philosophers:</hi> My
Doors (said <hi>Vespatian</hi>) are alwaies open to
Philosophers, but my very Breast is open to
thee. I cannot say with him, my Doors are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
for the free access of friends, being by a
sad Providence shut against my self; But
this I can say, my very breast is still open to
you; you are as dear to me as ever. (3.) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
inducement (and indeed the main) was
the perpetual usefulness and necessity of these
truths for you, which you will have continual
need of: and I know few of you have such
happy memories to retain, and I cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb facs="tcp:34349:7"/>
with you to inculcate these things, but
<hi>litera scripta manet;</hi> I was willing to leave
this with you as a Legacy, as a testimony of
sincere love for, and care over you: This may
councel and direct you when I cannot: I may
be rendred useless to you by a civil or natural
Death; but this will out—live me, and Oh that
it may serve your souls when I am silent in
the Dust!</p>
            <p>To hasten now to a conclusion, I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these three requests to you, which I carnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beseech you not to deny me; Yea, I charge
you, as ever you hope to appear with comfort
before the great Shepherd, do not dare to
slight these requests. (1.) Above all other
studies in the world, study your own hearts:
waste not a minute more of your precious
time about frivolous and sapless controversies:
it is repoted even of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (how truely
I examine not) <hi>quod à stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis

               </gap>e
turned with loathing from the study of School
Divinity, because it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the sweet juice of piety:
I had rather it should be said
of you as one said of
<note place="margin">Caput regulatum illi defuit, cor bonum non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuit.</note> 
               <hi>Swinckfeedius (He wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:34349:7"/>
a regular head, but not an honest
heart)</hi> then that you should have regular heads,
and irregular hearts: My dear Flock, I
have according to the grace given me, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the course of my ministry among you, to
feed you with the heart—strengthening bread
of practical doctrine, and I do assure you, it
is far better you should have the sweet and
saving impressions of Gospel-Truths, feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and powerfully conveighed to your hearts;
then only to understand them by a bare ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination,
or a dry syllogistical inference:
Leavetrifling studies to such as have time
lying on their hands, and know not how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it: Remember you are at the door of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
and have other work to do; those
hours you spend upon heart-work in your clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,
are the golden spots of all your time, and
will have the sweetest influence into your last
hour: Never forget those Sermons I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you upon that subject, from 2. <hi>Kings
20.</hi> 2. 3. Heart work is weighty and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
work, an error there may cost you your
souls: I may say of it, as <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks
of the Doctrine of the Trinity, <hi>Nihilo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius
aut periculosius erratur;</hi> a man can
erre in nothing more easily, or more dangerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
O then, study your hearts. (2.) My
next request is, that you will carefully look to
your Conversations, and be accurate in all your
<pb facs="tcp:34349:8"/>
waies, hold forth the Word of life: be sure
by the strictness and holiness of your lives, to
settle your selves in the very consciences of
your enemies. Remember that your lives
must be produced in the great day, to judge
the world. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. Oh then what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of persons ought you to be! You have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
eyes over you, the Omniscient eye of God,
that searches the heart and reins, <hi>Rev. 2.
23.</hi> The vigilant eye of Satan, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 7, 8.
The envious eyes of enemies, that curiously
observe you, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 8. The quick and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant
eye of Conscience, which none of your
actions escape, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
            <p>Oh then be precise, and accurate in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of conversation: keep up the power of
godliness in your <hi>Closets</hi> and <hi>Families,</hi> and
then you will not let it fall in your more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
imployments, and converses in the world:
I have often told you, that it is the honour of
the Gospel, that it makes the best Parents
and Children; the best Masters and Servants;
the best Husbands and Wives in the world.</p>
            <p>My third and last request is, that you pray
for me: I hope I can say, and I am sure
some of you have acknowledged, that I came
at first among you, as the return and answer
of your Prayers: And indeed so it should be,
see <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 2. I am perswaded also, I
<pb facs="tcp:34349:8"/>
have been carried on in my work by your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
'tis sweet when 'tis so, see <hi>Ephes. 6. 18,
19.</hi> And I hope by your prayers to receive
yet a farther benefit, even that which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>Heb. 13. 18, 19. Philem.</hi> 22. And
truely 'tis but equal you should pray for me,
I have often prayed for you: Let the Pulpit,
Family, and Closet witness for me: and God
forbid I should sin against the Lord in ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to pray for you.</p>
            <p>Yea, Friends, your own interest may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
to it: what mercies you obtain for me,
redound to your own advantage, if God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
me, it is for your use and service: the
more gifts and graces a Minister hath, the
better for them that shall wait on his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry:
the more God gives in to me, the
more I shall be able to give out to you. I will
detain you no longer, but to entreat you to
accept this smal testification of my great love,
and have recourse to it, according as the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of your condition shall require: Read
it consideringly, and obediently; Iudge it
not by the dress and stile, but by the weight
and savour of what you read. 'Tis a good
rule of <hi>Bernard, in legendis libris, non
quaeramus scientiam sed saporem, (i. e.)</hi>
in reading Books, regard not so much the
science, as the savour: That it may prove
<pb facs="tcp:34349:9"/>
the savour of life unto life to you, and all those
into whose hands it shall come, is the hearty
desire of</p>

<hi>For out of it are the issues of Life.</hi>

1. The Matter of the Duty.</p>
            <p>2. The manner of performing it.</p>
            <p>1. The Matter of the Duty; <hi>Keep thy
Heart.</hi> Heart is not here taken properly
for that noble part of the Body which
Philosophers call the <hi>primum vivens, &amp;
ultimum moriens;</hi> the first that lives, and
the last that dies; but by Heart in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,
the Scripture sometimes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
some particular noble facultie of
the Soul, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. it is put for the
understanding part, their foolish Heart
(i. e.) <hi>their foolish understanding was
darkened.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 11. It is put
for the Memory, <hi>Thy Word have I hid in
my Heart.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 3. 20 It is put for
the Conscience, which hath in it both the
light of the Understanding, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions
of the Memory: If our heart
Condemn us, (i. e.) if our Conscience;
whose proper Office it is to condemn.
But here we are to take it more generally
for the whole Soul or inner Man; for
look what the Heart is to the Body, that
the Soul is to the Man: and what Health
is to the Heart; that Holiness is to the
Soul: <hi>Quod sanit as in corport, id sanct it as
in corde.</hi> The state of the whole Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the soundness and vigour of
the Heart, and the everlasting state of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34349:10"/>
whole man upon the good or ill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Soul.</p>
            <p>And by keeping the Heart understand,
the <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>constant use</hi> and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all holy Means and Duties to
preserve the Soul from sin, and maintain
its sweet and free communion with God.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">I say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, for the reason added in the Text, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the duty to all the states and conditions of a Christians life, and makes it bind <hi>ad sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi> If the heart must be kept because out of it are the issues of life, then as long as these is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues of life do flow out of it, we are obliged to keep it.</note> 
               <hi>Lavater</hi> in loc. will have
the word taken from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
Garrison, begirt by
many Enemies without,
and in danger of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by treacherous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
within, in which
danger the Souldiers upon
pain of death are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to watch: and
whereas the expression,
(keep thy heart) seems to
put it upon us as ourwork;
yet it doth not imply a
sufficiency or ability in us
to do it; we are as able to
stop the Sun in its course,
or make the Rivers run
backward, as by our own skill and power
to rule and order our hearts: we may as
well be our own <hi>Saviours,</hi> as our own
<hi>Keepers,</hi> and yet <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
enough, when he saith, <hi>keep thy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34349:11"/>
Heart,</hi> because the duty is ours, though
the power be Gods. A Natural man hath
no power, a gracious man hath some;
though not sufficient, and that power he
hath depends upon the exciting and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
strength of Christ; <hi>Gratia gratiam
postulat,</hi> Grace within us is beholding to
Grace without us, <hi>Iohn 15. 5. Without me
ve can do nothing.</hi> So much of the matter
of the Duty.</p>
            <p>2. The Minner of performing it, is
<hi>With all diligence;</hi> the Hebrew is very Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>cum omni custodia,</hi>
keep with all keeping; <hi>q. d.</hi> keep, keep;
set double Guards, your hearts will be
gone else: And this vehemency of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
with which the duty is urged,
plainly implies how difficult it is to keep
our Hearts, and how dangerous to let
them go.</p>
            <p>2. The Reason or Motive quickning
to this Duty is very forcible and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>For out of it are the issues of life.</hi> That
is, it is the Source and Fountain of all
vital actions and operations; <hi>Hinc Fons
boni &amp; peccandi or go,</hi> saith <hi>Ierom;</hi> it is the
Spring and Original both of good and
evil-as the spring in a Watch that sets all
the Wheels in motion. The Heart is
the Treasury, the Hand and Tongue but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34349:11"/>
the Shops, what is in these came from
thense; the hand and tongue alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
where the heart ends. The heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives,
and the members execute, <hi>Luke
6. 46. A good man out of the good treasury
of his heart bringeth forth good things, and
an evil man out of the evil treasury of his
heart bringeth forth evil things; for out of
the abundance of his heart his mouth speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
So then, if the heart erre in its work,
these must needs miscarry in theirs; for
heart-errors are like the errors of the
first concoction which cannot be rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
afterwards: Or like the mis-placing
and inverting of the stamps and letters
in the Press, which must needs cause so
many errata's in all the Copies that are
printed off. O then! how important a
Duty is that which is contained in the
following Proposition?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That the keeping and right ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of the heart in every condition, is the
great business of a Christians life.</p>
            <p>What the Philosopher saith of waters
is as properly applicable to hearts, <hi>suis
terminis difficilé continentur;</hi> 'tis hard to
keep them within any bounds: God hath
set bounds and limits to them, yet how
frequently do they transgress. not only
the bounds of Grace and Religion, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34349:12"/>
even of Reason and common Honesty;
<hi>Hic labor hoc opus est,</hi> this is that which
affords the Christian matter of labour,
fear and trembling to his dying day. 'Tis
not the cleansing of the hand that makes
a Christian, for many a Hypocrite can
shew as fair a hand as he, but the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
watching, and right ordering of
the heart; this is the thing that provokes
so many sad complaints, and costs so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deep groans and brinish tears. 'Twas
the pride of <hi>Hizekiah</hi>'s heart that made
him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ye in the dust mourning before the
Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 26. 'Twas the fear
of Hypocrisie invading the heart, that
made <hi>David</hi> cry, <hi>Let my heart be sound in
thy Statutes that I be not ashamed, Psal. 119.
80.</hi> 'Twas the sad experience he had of
the Divisions and Distractions of his
own heart in the Service of God, that
made him pour out that Prayer, <hi>Psal. 86.
11. Unite my heart to fear thy Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Method in which I shall improve
the Point, shall be this.</p>
            <p>1. First I shall inquire what the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the heart supposes and imports.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Assign divers Reasons,
why Christians must make this the great
work and business of their lives.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Point at those special sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34349:12"/>
which especially call for this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in keeping the heart.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly and fastly, apply the
whole in several uses.</p>
            <p>1. What the keeping of the Heart sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
and imports.</p>
            <p>To keep the heart necessarily supposes
a previous work of Sanctification; which
hath set the heart right by giving it a
new Spiritual bent and inclination, for as
long as the heart is not <hi>set right</hi> by Grace,
as to its habitual frame, no Duties or
Means can <hi>keep it right</hi> with God. Self
is the Poise of the unsanctified heart,
which By asses and moves it in all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
and actions; and as long as it is so,
it is impossible that any external means
should keep it with God.</p>
            <p>Man by Creation was of one constant
uniform frame and tenour of Spirit, held
one straight and even course; not one
thought or faculty ravell'd or disorder'd,
his minde had a perfect illumination to
understand and know the will of God,
his will a perfect compliance therewith,
his sensitive appetite and other inferiour
powers, stood in a most obedient subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
            <p>Man by degeneration is become a
most disordered and rebellious Creature,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34349:13"/>
contesting with, and opposing his Maker,
as the <hi>first cause,</hi> by self dependance; as
the <hi>chiefest good,</hi> by self-love; as the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Lord,</hi> by self will; and as the <hi>last end,</hi>
by self-seeking; and so is quite disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all his acts irregular: His illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
understanding is clouded with
ignorance, his complying will, full of
rebellion and stubbornnesse; his subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
powers, casting off the dominion and
government of the superiour faculties.</p>
            <p>But by Regeneration, this disordered
Soul is set right again; Sanctification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rectifying, and due framing, or as
the Scripture phrases it, the renovation
of the Soul after the Image of God, <hi>Eph.
4.</hi> 24. in which, <hi>self dependance</hi> is removed
by Faith; self-love, by the love of God;
<hi>self will,</hi> by subjection and obedience to
the Will of God; and <hi>self-seeking,</hi> by self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal.
The darkned understanding is
again illuminated, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. the refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
will sweetly subdued, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3.
the rebellious appetite, or concupiscence,
gradually conquered, <hi>Rom. 6. 7. per tot.</hi>
And thus the Soul which sin had univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
depraved, is again by grace restored
and rectified.</p>
            <p>This being presupposed, it will not be
difficult to apprehend, what it is to keep
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34349:13"/>
the heart, which is nothing else but the
<hi>constant care and diligence of such a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, to preserve his soul in that holy frame
to which Grace hath reduced it, and daily
strives to hold it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though grace hath in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
rectified the Soul, and given it an
habitual and heavenly temper; yet Sin
often actually discomposes it again; so
that even a gracious heart is like a musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Instrument, which though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so exactly tuned, a small matter
brings it out of tune again; yea hang it
aside but a little and it will need setting
again, before you can play another Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
on it: even so stands the case with
gracious hearts; if they are in frame in
one duty, yet how dull, dead and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
when they come to another: and
therefore every duty needs a particular
preparation of the heart, <hi>Iob 11. 13. If
thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thy
hands towards him:</hi> Well then, to keep
the hear, is carefully to preserve it from
sin which disorders it; and maintain that
spiritual and gracious frame which fits it
for a life of communion with God: and
this includes these fix acts in it.</p>
            <p>1. First, frequent observation of the
frame of the heart, turning in and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34349:14"/>
how the case stands with it, this
is one part of the work. Carnal and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
persons take no heed to this, they
cannot be brought to confer with their
own hearts; there are some men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that have lived forty or fifty years
in the world, and have scarce had one
hours discourse with their own hearts all
that while: 'tis an hard thing to bring a
man and himself together upon such an
account; but Saints know those Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies
and self-conferences to be of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
use and advantage. The Heathen
could say, <hi>anima sedendo &amp; quiescendo fit
sapiens,</hi> the Soul is made wise by fitting
still in quietness; though Bankrupts care
not to look into their Books of accompt,
yet upright hearts will know whether
they go backward or forward, <hi>Psal. 77.
6. I commune with mine own heart;</hi> The
heart can never be kept, until its case be
examined and understood.</p>
            <p>2. It includes deep humiliations for
heart evils and disorders; thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
humbled himself for the pride of his
heart, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 26. Thus the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were ordered to spread forth their
hands to God in Prayer in a sense of the
Plague of their own hearts, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 38.
Upon this account many an upright
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34349:14"/>
heart hath been laid low before God: O
What an heart have I? they have in their
confessions pointed at the heart, the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
place, Lord here is the wounds, here
is the Plague-sore, it is with the heart
Well kept, as it is with the eye, which is a
fit emblem of it, if a small dust get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the eye, it will never leave twinkling
and watering, till it have wept it out: So
the upright heart cannot be at rest till it
have wept out its troubles, and poured
out its complaints before the Lord.</p>
            <p>3. It includes earnest Supplications
and instant Prayer for heart-purifying
and rectifying Grace, when sin hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
and disordered it, <hi>so Psal. 19. 12.
Cleanse thou me from secret faults,</hi> and
<hi>Psal. 86. 11. Unite my heart to fear thy
Name.</hi> Saints have always many such
Petitions depending before the Throne
of Grace; this is the thing which is most
pleaded by them with God: when they
are praying for outward mercies, happily
their spirits may be more remiss, but
when it comes to the heart-case, then
they intend their spirits to the utmost,
fill their mouths with Arguments, weep
and make supplication; Oh, for a better
heart! Oh, for a heart to love God
more! To hate Sin more, to walk more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34349:15"/>
evenly with God; Lord deny not to me
such a heart, what ever thou deny me;
Give me an heart to fear thee, love and
delight in thee, if I beg my bread in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
places. 'Tis observed of holy Mr.
<hi>Bradford,</hi> that when he was confessing
sin, he would never give over confessing
until he had felt some brokeness of heart
for that sin, and when praying for any
Spiritual mercy, would never give over
that suite, till he had got some relish of
that mercy; that's the third thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in keeping the heart.</p>
            <p>4. It includes the imposing of strong
ingagements and bonds upon our selves
to walk more accurately with God, and
avoid the occasions whereby the heart
may be induced to sin: Well composed,
advised and deliberate Vows are in some
cases of excellent use to guard the heart
against some special sin, So <hi>Iob 31. 1.
I made a covenant with mine eyes;</hi> by this
means, holy ones have over-awed their
souls, and preserved themselves from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silement
by some special heart-corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>5. It includes a constant holy jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
over our own hearts, quick-sighted
self-jealousie is an excellent preservative
from sin, he that will keep his heart,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34349:15"/>
must have the eyes of his soul awake and
open upon all the disorderly, and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
stirrings of his affections, if the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
break loose, and the passions be
stirred, the Soul must discover and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them before they get to an height:
O my Soul, dost thou well in this? My
tumultuous thoughts and passions where
is your Commission? <hi>State viri, quae cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
viae? quive est is in armis. Virg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happy is the man that thus ieareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 14. By this fear of the
Lord it is that men depart from evil,
shake off security, and preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from iniquity, he that will keep
his heart must feed with fear, rejoyce
with fear, and pass the whole time of
his sojourning here in fear, and all little
enough to keep the heart from Sin.</p>
            <p>6. And lastly, To add no more, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the realizing of Gods Presence
with us, and setting the Lord alwaies
before us: this the people of God have
found a singular means O keep their
hearts upright, and awe them from sin:
when the eye of our Faith is fixed upon
the eye of Gods Omniscience, we dare
not let out our thoughts and affections to
vanity: Holy <hi>Iob</hi> durst not suffer his
heartto yeild to an impure, vain thought,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34349:16"/>
and what was it that moved him to so
great a Circumspection? Why he tells
you, <hi>Iob 31. 4. Doth he not see my waies
and count all my steps? Walk before me</hi>
(saith God to <hi>Abraham) and be thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Even as Parents use to
set their Children in the Congregation
before them, knowing that else they will
be toying and playing; so would the
heart of the best man too, were it not for
the eye of God.</p>
            <p>In these and such like particulars, do
gracious sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s express the care they have
of their hearts; they are as careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the breaking loose of their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in times of temptation, as Sea-men
are to binde fast the Guns that they break
not loose in a storm; as careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the sweetness and comfort they
have got from God in any duty, as one
that comes out of an hot Bath, or great
sweat is of taking cold, by going forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the chill aire; this is the work, and of
all works in Religion it is the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
consta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, and important work.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis the hardest work; Heart-work
is hard work indeed: To shuffle over Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious-Duties
with a loose and heedless
Spirit, will cost no great pains, but to set
thy self before the Lord, and tye up thy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34349:16"/>
loose and vain thoughts to a constant and
serious attendance upon him; this will
cost thee something: to attain a facility
and dexterity of language in Prayer,
and put thy meaning into apt and decent
expressions is easie, but to get thy heart
broken for sin whilst thou art confessing
it; melted with free grace, whilst thou
art blessing God for it; to be really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
and humbled through the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of Gods infinite holiness, and
to keep thy heart in this frame, not onely
in, but after Duty; will surely cost thee
some groans, and travelling pains of soul:
to represse the outward acts of sin, and
compose the external part of thy life in
a laudable and comely manner is no
great matter, even carnal persons by the
force of common principles can do this;
but to kill the root of corruption within,
to set and keep up an holy Government
over thy thoughts, to have all things lye
straight and orderly in the heart, this is
not easie.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis a Constant work, the keeping
of the heart is such a work, as is never
done till life be done; this labour and
our life end together: It is with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in this business as it is with Sea-men,
that have sprung a Leake at Sea, if they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34349:17"/>
tug not constantly at the Pump, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
encreases upon them and will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sink them: 'tis in vain for them to say
the work is hard, and we are weary:
There is no time or condition in the life
of a Christian, which will suffer an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssion
of this work: It is in the keeping
watch over our hearts, as it was in the
keeping up of <hi>Moses</hi> his hands, whilst
<hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Amalek</hi> were fighting below,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 12. No sooner do <hi>Moses</hi> his
hands grow heavy and sink down, but
<hi>Amalek</hi> prevails: You know it cost <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> many a sad day and night
for intermitting the watch over their
own hearts but a few minutes.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis the most important business
of a Christians life; without this we are
but Formalists in Religion: all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
Gifts and Duties, signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<hi>My Son give me thine Heart, Pro.
23.</hi> 26. God is pleased to call that a gift,
which is indeed a debt; he will put this
honour upon the Creature to receive it
from him in the way of a gift, but if this
be not given him he regards not what
ever else you bring to him: there is so
much only of worth and value in what
we do, as there is of Heart in it: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Heart, God seems to say as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34349:17"/>
               <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Benjamin, If you bring not</hi> Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
<hi>with you, you shall not see my face.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Heathens</hi> when the Beast was
cut up for sacrifice, the first thing the
<hi>Priest</hi> lookt upon was the Heart, and if
that were unsound and naught, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
was rejected. God rejects all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
(how glorious soever in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects)
offered him without a heart:
He that performs duty without a heart,
<hi>viz.</hi> heedlesly, is no more accepted with
God then he that performs it with a
double heart, <hi>viz.</hi> hypocritically, <hi>Isa.
66.</hi> 3. And thus I have briefly opened
the nature of the Duty, what is imported
in this phrase, <hi>Keep thy heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Next, I shall give you some rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
account, why Christians should
make this the great business of their
lives, to keep their hearts?</p>
            <p>The importance and necessity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this our great and main business,
will manifestly appear in that, 1. The
honour of God. 2. The sincerity of our
profession. 3. The beauty of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
4. The comfort of our Souls.
5. The improvement of our graces:
and 6. Our stability in the hour of
temptation, are all wrapt up in, and
dependent on our sincerity and care
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34349:18"/>
in the management of this work.</p>
            <p>1. The Glory of God is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
therein; heart-evils are very
provoking evils to the Lord. The Schools
do well observe, that outward sins are
<hi>majoris infamiae,</hi> sins of greater infamy,
but heart-sins are <hi>majoris reatus,</hi> sins of
deeper guilt. How severely hath the
Great God declared his wrath from
Heaven against heart-wickedness? The
great Crime for which the old World
stands indicted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7. is heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickedness;
<hi>God saw that every imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
(or fiction) <hi>of their heart was onely
evil, and that continualiy:</hi> for which he
sent the dreadfullest Judgment that was
ever executed since the World began:
<hi>And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom
I have created from the face of the earth,
both man and beast, and the creeping things,
and the fowls of heaven, for it repenteth me
that I have made man, v.</hi> 7. We find not
their murders, adulteries; blasphemies,
(though they were defiled with these)
particularly alledged against them; but
the evils of their hearts: yea, that which
God was so provoked by, as to give up
his peculiar Inheritance into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
hand, was the evil of their hearts,
<hi>Ier. 4. 14. O Ierusalem, wash thine heart
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34349:18"/>
from wickedness that thou maist be saved,
how long shall vain thoughts lodge within
thee?</hi> The wickedness and vanity of
their thoughts God took special notice
of; and because of this the <hi>Caldean</hi> must
come upon them as a <hi>Lion from his thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
v. 7. and tear them to pieces.</hi> For the
very sin of thoughts it was that God
threw down the faln Angels from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and keeps them still in everlasting
chains to the judgment of the great day;
by which expression is not obscurely
intimated some extraordinary judgment
to which they are reserved, as prisoners
that have most irons laid upon them, may
be supposed to be the greatest Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors:
and what was their sin? Why,
onely spiritual wickedness, for they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no bodily Organs could act no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
externally against God. Yea,
meer heart-evils are so provoking, that
for them he r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jects with indignation all
the duties that some men perform unto
him, <hi>Isa. 66. 3. He that killeth an Oxe, is
as if he flew a man, he that sacrificeth a
lamb, as if he cut off a dogs neck, he that
offereth an oblation, as if he offered swines
blood, he that burneth incense, as if he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
an Idol.</hi> In what words could the
abhorrence of a Creatures actions be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34349:19"/>
more fully expressed by the holy God;
Murder and Idolatry are not more vile
in his account than their Sacrifices,
though materially such as himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed:
and what made them so? the
following words inform us, <hi>Their soul
delighteth in their abominations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, such is the vileness of
meer heart-sins, that the Scriptures some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
intimate the difficulty of pardon
for them. So in the case of <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,
Acts</hi> 8. 21. his heart was not right,
he had vile thoughts of God, and the
things of God, the Apostle bids him <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and pray, if perhaps the thoughts of his
heart might he forgiven him.</hi> O then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
slight heart-evils! for by these God
is highly wronged and provoked, and
for this reason, let every Christian make
it his work to keep his heart with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
            <p>2. The sincerity of our profession
much depends upon the care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
we have in keeping our hearts;
for it's most certain, that a man is but an
hypocrite in his profession how curious
soever he be in the externals of Religion,
that is heedless and careless of the frame
of his heart: you have a pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this in the case of <hi>Iehu, 2 King.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:34349:19"/>
10. 31. But Jehu <hi>took no heed to walk in the
ways of the Lord God of Israel with his
heart.</hi> That Context gives us an account
of the great service perform'd by <hi>Iehu</hi>
against the house of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> as
also of a great temporal reward given
him by God for that service, even that
his Children to the fourth Generation
should sit upon the Throne of <hi>Israel.</hi>
And yet in these words <hi>Iehu</hi> is censured
for an hypocrite; though God approved
and rewarded the work, yet he abhorted
and rejected the person that did it as hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical:
and wherein lay his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie?
but in this, that he took no heed to
walk in the ways of the Lord with his
heart, <hi>(i. e)</hi> he did all insincerely and
for self-ends; and though the work he
did were materially good, yet he not
purging his heart from those unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
self-designs in doing it, was an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite:
And <hi>Simon</hi> of whom we spake
before, though he appeared such a person
that the Apostle could not regularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
him, yet his hypocrisie was quickly
discovered: and what discovered it? but
this, that though he professed and asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
himself with the Saints, yet he
was a stranger to the mortification of
heart sins; <hi>Thy heart is not right with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34349:20"/>
God, Acts</hi> 8. 21.—'Tis true, there is a
great difference among Christians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in their diligence and dexterity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
heart-work; some are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
and succesful in it then others
are, but he that takes no heed to his
heart, he that is not careful to order it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
before God, is but a hypocrite,
<hi>Ezek. 33. 31, 32. And they come unto thee
as the people cometh, and sit before thee [as
my people] and they hear thy words, but they
will not do them; for with their mouth they
shew much love, but their heart goes after
their covetousness.</hi> Here were a company
of formal hypocrits, as is evident by that
expression [<hi>as my people</hi>] like them, but
not of them: and what made them so?
their out-side was fair, here were reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
postures, high professions, much
seeming joy and delight in Ordinances,
thou art to them as a lovely Song; yea,
but for all that, they kept not their hearts
with God in those duties, their hearts
were commanded by their lusts, they
went after their covetousness; had they
kept their hearts with God all had been
well, but not regarding which way their
heart went in duty; there lay the coare
of their hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object,</hi> If any upright Soul should
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34349:20"/>
hence infer, then I am an hypocrite too,
for many times my heart departs from
God in duty, do what I can, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hold it close with God.</p>
            <p>Sol. To this I answer, the very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
carries in it, its own Solution:
Thou sayest, do what I can, yet I cannot
keep my heart with God. Soul, if thou
dost what thou canst, thou hast the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of an upright, though God sees
good to exercise thee under the affliction
of a discomposed heart. There remains
still some wildness in the thoughts and
fancies of the best to humble them; but
if you find a care before to prevent
them, and opposition against them when
they come, grief and sorrow afterwards;
you will find enough to clear you from
raigning hypocrisie. (1) This fore-care
is seen partly in laying up the word in
thine heart to prevent them, <hi>Psal. 119. 11.
Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I
might not sin against thee:</hi> partly in our
indeavours to ingage our hearts to God,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 21. and partly in begging pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
grace from God in our on-sets
upon duty, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119, 36. 37. 'tis a good
sign where this care goes before a duty,
And (2) 'tis a sweet sign of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to oppose them in their first rise,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34349:21"/>
               <hi>Psal. 119. 113. I hate vain thoughts.</hi> Gal.
5. 17. <hi>The spirit lusteth against the flesh.</hi>
And (3) Thy after-grief discovers thy
upright heart; if with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> thou art
humbled for the evils of thy heart, thou
hast no reason from these disorders to
question the integrity of it; but to suffer
sin to lodge quictly in the heart, to let
thy heart habitually and uncontrolledly
wander from God, is a sad and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
symptom indeed.</p>
            <p>3. The beauty of our Conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
from the heavenly frames, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
order of our spirits; there is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
lustre and beauty in the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints, <hi>The righteous is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
than his Neighbour,</hi> they shine as
the lights of the world; but whatever
lustre and beauty is in their lives, comes
from the excellency of their spirits; as
the Candle within, puts a lustre upon the
Lanthorn in which it shines. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that a disordered and neglected
heart, should ever produce a well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conversation; and since (as the Text
observes) the issues or streams of life
flow out of the heart as their fountain, it
must needs follow, that such as the heart
is, the life will be: hence 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 11, 12.
Abstain from fleshly lusts—having your
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34349:21"/>
conversation ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est,</hi> * or beautiful * <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
as the Greek word imports. So</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isa. 55. 7. Let the wicked forsake his way,
and the unrighteous man his thoughts.</hi>
His way notes the course of his life, his
thoughts the frame of his heart; and
therefore since the way and course of
his life flows from his thoughts, or the
frame of his heart, both or neither will
be forsaken: the heart is the womb of
all actions, these actions are virtually
and seminally contained in our thoughts,
these thoughts being once made up into
affections, are quickly made out into
suitable actions and practises. If the
heart be wicked, then as Christ saith,
<hi>Matth. 15. 19. Out of the heart proceed
evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, &amp;c.</hi>
Mark the order, first, wanton or revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thoughts, then unclean or murderous
practises.</p>
            <p>And if the heart be holy and spiritual,
then as <hi>David</hi> speaks from sweet expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
in <hi>Psal. 45. 1. My heart is [indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting]
a good matter, I speak of the things
which [I have made] my tongue is as the
pen of a ready writer.</hi> Here's a life richly
beautified with good works; some ready
made; <hi>I will speak of the things which I
have made:</hi> Others upon the wheel ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34349:22"/>
king, my heart is inditing, but both
proceeding from the heavenly frame of
his heart.</p>
            <p>Put but the heart in frame, and the
life will quickly discover that it is so. I
think it is not very difficult to discern by
the duties and converses of Christians,
what frames their spirits are under; take
a Christian in a good frame, and how se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
heavenly, and profitable will his
converses and duties be! what a lovely
companion is he, during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it! 'twould do any ones heart
good to be with him at such a time, <hi>Psal.
37. 30. 31. The mouth of the righteous
speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of
judgment, the law of his God is in his
heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the heart is up with God, and
full of God, how dexterously and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously
will he winde in spiritual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
improving every occasion and
advantage to some heavenly purpose,
few words run then at the wast Spout.</p>
            <p>And what else can be the reason, why
the discourses and duties of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are become so frothy and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
their communion both with
God, and one another become as a dry
stalk, but because their hearts are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34349:22"/>
Surely this must be the reason
of it, and verily it is an evil greatly to be
bewailed, for as by this Christian-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is become a sapless thing, so the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
beauty that was wont to shine
from the Conversations of the Saints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the faces and consciences of the
world, (which if it did not allure and
bring them in love with the ways of
God; yet at least left a testimony in their
consciences of the excellency of those
men and their way) this is in a great
measure lost, to the unspeakable detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion.</p>
            <p>Time was, when Christians did carry
it at such a rate, that the world stood at
gaze at them, as that word,

and fruitless controversies
have so much obtained, and heart-work,

among Professors, the case is sadly alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
their discourse is become like other
mens: if they come among you now, they
may (to allude to that, <hi>Acts 2. 6.) Hear
every man speak in his own language.</hi> And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34349:23"/>
truly I have little hope to see this evil
redressed, and the credit of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
repaired; till Christians fall again
to their old work, till they ply heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
closer: when the salt of heavenly
mindedness is again cast into the Spring,
the <hi>streams</hi> will run clearer and sweeter.</p>
            <p>4. The comfort of our Souls doth
much depend upon the keeping of our
hearts, for he that is negligent in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own heart, is (ordinarily) a great
stranger to assurance, and the sweet
comforts flowing from it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Doctrin
were true, which teaches you to reject
all marks and signs for the trial of your
conditions, telling you it is onely the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that immediately assures you by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
your adoption directly without
them, then you might be careless of your
hearts, yea, strangers to them, and yet
no strangers to comfort: but since both
Scripture and experience do confute this
dotage, I hope you will never look for
comfort in that unscriptural way. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not but it is the work and office of the
Spirit to assure you, and yet do confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
affirm, that if ever you attain as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
in the ordinary way wherein
God dispences it, you must take pains
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34349:23"/>
with your own hearts, you may expect
your comforts upon easier terms; but I
am mistaken, if ever you enjoy them
upon any other: <hi>Give all diligence;
prove your selves:</hi> this is the Scripture
way. I remember Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> in his
Treatise of the Covenant, tells us, That
he knew a Christian who in the infancy
of his Christianity, so vehemently pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after the infallible assurance of God's
love, that for a long time together he
earnestly desired some voyce from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
yea, sometimes walking in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
fields, earnestly desired some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
voyce from the Trees and stones
there; this, after many desires and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
was denied him; but in time, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was afforded in the ordinary way of
searching the word, and his own heart.
An instance of the like nature the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Gerson</hi> gives us, Of one that was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by temptation upon the very bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of desperation, at last being sweetly
settled and assured, one asked him, How
he attained it? He answered, <hi>Non ex
nova aliqua revelatione, &amp;c.</hi> Not by any
extraordinary revelation, but by subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
his understanding to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and comparing his own heart with
them. The Spirit indeed assures by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34349:24"/>
our adoption, and he witnesseth
two ways. (1) Objectively, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) by
working those Graces in our Souls which
are the Conditions of the Promise, and
so the Spirit and his Graces in us are all
one; the Spirit of God dwelling in us, is
a mark of our Adoption. Now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
cannot be discerned in his essence, but
in his operations; and to discern these is
to discern the Spirit; and how these
should be discerned without serious
searching and diligent watching of the
heart, I cannot imagine. (2) The other
way of the Spirits witnessing is effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) by irradiating the Soul
with a grace-discovering light, shining
upon his own work; and this in order
of nature follows the former work: he
first infuses the grace, and then opens
the eye of the Soul to see it. Now since
the heart is the subject of that infused
grace, even this way of the Spirits wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
also includes the necessity of
keeping carefully our own hearts: for
(1) A neglected heart is so confused and
dark, that the little grace which is in it
is not ordinarily discernable: the most
accurate and laborious Christians, that
take most pains, and spend most time
about their hearts, do yet finde it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34349:24"/>
very difficult to discover the pure
and genuine workings of the Spirit
there: how then shall the Christian
which is (comparatively) negligent and
remiss about heart-work, be ever able
to discover it? Sincerity which is the
<hi>quaesitum,</hi> the thing sought for, lies
in the heart like a small piece of Gold in
the bottom of a River, he that will find
it must stay till the water be clear and
settled, and then he shall see it sparkling
at the bottom; and that the heart may
be clear and setled, how much pains and
watching care and diligence will it
cost?</p>
            <p>2. God doth not usually indulge la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
and negligent Souls with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of Assurance, he will not so much
as seem to patronize sloth and careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he will give it, but it shall be in his
own way: his Command hath united
our care and comfort together; they are
mistaken that think the beautiful Child
of Assurance may be born without
pangs: Ah, how many solitary hours
have the people of God spent in heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination?
How many times have
they looked into the Word, and then
into their hearts? Sometime they
thought they discovered sinceri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34349:25"/>
were even ready to draw forth the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
conclusion of Assurance, then
comes a doubt they cannot resolve, and
dashes all again; many hopes and fears,
doubtings and reasonings they have had
in their own breasts, before they arrived
at a comfortable settlement.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Suppose it possible for
a careless Christian to attain Assurance,
yet it's impossible he should long retain
it; for it is with those whose hearts are
big with the joys of Assura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce, as with
a pregnant woman subject to miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages;
if extraordinary care be not used,
it is a thousand to one if ever she imbrace
a living Child: So 'tis here, a little pride,
vanity, carelessness, dashes all that for
which thou hast been labouring a long
time in many a weary duty. Since then
the joy of our life, the comfort of our
souls, rises and falls with our diligence in
this work; keep your hearts with all
diligence.</p>
            <p>5. The improvement of our Graces
depends on the keeping of our hearts;
I never knew Grace thrive in a negligent
and careless Soul; the habits and roots of
grace are planted in the heart; and the
deeper they are radicated there, the more
thriving and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urishing grace is: in <hi>Eph.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:34349:25"/>
3. 17. we read of <hi>being rooted in Grace:</hi>
Grace in the heart is the root of every
gracious word in the mouth, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
holy work in the hand, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.
10. 2 Cor. 4. 13. 'tis true, Christ is the
root of a Christian; but Christ is <hi>Origo
originans,</hi> the originating root and grace,
<hi>Origo originata,</hi> a root originated, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and influenced by Christ, according
as this thrives under divine influences, so
the acts of grace are more or less fruitful
and vigorous: Now in a heart not kept
with care and diligence, these fructify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng
influences are stopt and cut off, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of vanities break in upon it, and
devour its strength; the heart is as it
were the pasture, in which multitudes of
thoughts are fed every day; a gracious
heart diligently kept, feeds many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thoughts of God in a day, <hi>Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>39.
17. How precious are thy thoughts to me O
God! how great is the sum of them! if I
should count them, they are more in number
than the sand; and when I awake, I am still
with thee.</hi> And as the gracious heart
seeds and nourishes them, so they refresh
and feast the heart, <hi>Psal. 63. 5, 6. My soul
is filled as with marrow and fatness whilest
I think upon thee, &amp;c.</hi> But in the dis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
heart, swarms of vain and foolish
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34349:26"/>
thoughts are perpetually working, and
justle out those spiritual Idea's and
thoughts of God, by which the Soul
should be refreshed.</p>
            <p>Besides, the careless heart makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of any Duty or Ordinance it
performs or attends on, and yet these
are the Conduits of Heaven from
whence Grace is watred and made fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
a man may go with an heedless spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
from Ordinance to Ordinance, abide
all his dayes under the choicest teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and yet never be improved by
them; for heart neglect is a leak in the
bottom, no heavenly influences how rich
soever, abide in that Soul, <hi>Matth. 13.</hi> 3, 4. The heart that lies open and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
like the high-way, free for all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers;
when the Seed fell on it, the
fowls came and devoured it. Alas! it
is not enough to hear, unless we take
heed how we hear: a man may pray,
and never the better, unless he watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
prayer. In a word, all Ordinances,
Means and Duties are blessed unto the
improvement of Grace, according to the
care and strictness we use in keeping our
hearts in them.</p>
            <p>6. Lastly, The stability of our Souls
in the hour of temptation, will be much
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34349:26"/>
according to the care and Conscience we
have of keeping our hearts; the careless
heart is an easy prey to Satan in the hour
of temptation, his main Batteries are
raised against that Fort-royal, the Heart;
if he win that, he wins all, for it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the whole man; and alas, how
easy a Conquest is a neglected heart?
'tis no more difficult to surprise it, than
for an enemy to enter that City, whose
Gates are open and unguarded: 'tis the
watchful heart that discovers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
the temptation before it come to
its strength. Divines observe this to be
the method in which temptations are
ripened and brought to their full
strength;<note place="margin">

Soul are quick, and soon ended: when
it comes thus far, then the heart is won,
Satan hath entred victoriously, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
his Colours upon the Walls of
that Royal Fort; but had the Heart
been well guarded at first, it had never
come to this height; the temptation had
been stopt in the first or second act; and
indeed there it's stopt easily, for it is in
the motions of a tempted Soul to sin;
as in the motion of a stone falling from
the brow of an Hill, it's easily stopt at
first, but when once it's set a going <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

greatest wisdom in the world to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the first motions of the heart, to
check and stop sin there: the motions
of sin are weakest at first; a little care
and watchfulness may prevent much
mischief now, which the careless heart
not heeding, is brought within the power
of temptation; as the <hi>Syrians</hi> were

before they knew where they

            <p>By this time Reader, I hope thou art
fully satisfied how consequential and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
a work the keeping of thy heart
is, it being a duty that wraps up so many
dear interests of the Soul in it.</p>
            <p>3. Next, according to the method
propounded, I proceed to point out
those special Seasons in the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
which require and call for our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
diligence in keeping the heart: for
though (as was observed before) the
Duty binds <hi>ad semper,</hi> and there be no
time or condition of life in which we
may be excused from this work; yet
there are some signal seasons, critical
hours, requiring more than a common
vigilance over the heart.</p>
            <p>And the first,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Season.</hi> 
               <q>Is the time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
when Providence smiles
upon us, and dandles us upon her
knee. Now Christian, keep thy
heart with all diligence; for now
'twill be exceeding apt to grow secure,
proud and earthly, <hi>Rara virtus est hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militas

make us tremble when the Scripture tells

much more when it tells us, that of that
rank and sort of which we are, but few
shall be saved. When <hi>Ioshuah</hi> called all

feared; when the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> was

time then to tremble. So when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

me, but to get this wealth, I have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
my soul for thee, and must burn
body and soul in Hell for thy sake, thy
pains would have been but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but mine will be unquenchable
fire.</p>
            <p>5. The Heart may be kept humble by
considering <hi>of what a clogging nature
earthly things are to a soul heartily engaged
in the way to Heaven,</hi> they shut out much
of Heaven from us at present, though
they may not shut us out of Heaven at
last. If thou consider thy self under the
notion of a stranger in this world, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34349:30"/>
for Heaven, and seeking a better
Country, thou hast then as much reason
to be taken and delighted with these
things, as a weary Horse hath with a
heavy Cloakbag: there was a serious
truth in that Atheistical scoff of <hi>Iulian,</hi>
when he took away the Christians estates
and told them, it was to make them fitter
for the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
            <p>6. Is thy Spirit for all this flatulent
and lofty, then urge upon it <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of that awful day of reckoning,
wherein according to our receipts of Mercies
shall be our accompts for them:</hi> And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
this should awe, and humble the
vainest heart that ever was in the breast
of a Saint. Know for certain, that the
Lord records all the mercies that ever
he gave thee, from the beginning, to the
end of thy life, <hi>Micah 6. 5. Remember
O my people, from Shittim unto Gilgal,</hi> &amp;c.
Yea, they are exactly numbred, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
in order to an account; and thy
account will be suitable, <hi>Luke 12. 48. To
whomsoever much is given, of him much
shall be required.</hi> You are but Stewards,
and your Lord will come to take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of you; and what a great account
have you to make who have much of
this world in your hands; what swift
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34349:31"/>
witnesses will your mercies be against
you, if this be the best fruit of them?</p>
            <p>7. It is a very humbling considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>That the Mercies of God should work
otherwise upon my Spirits than they use to do
upon the Spirits of others, to whom they
come as sanctified Mercies from the love of
God.</hi> Ah Lord! what a sad considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is this? enough to lay me in the
dust: when I consider (1) that their
mercies have greatly humbled them; the
higher God hath raised them, the lower
they have laid themselves before God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Thus did <hi>Iacob</hi> when God had given
him much substance, <hi>Gen. 32. 5, 10, And
Iacob said, I am not worthy of the least of
all thy mercies, and all the truth which thou
hast shewed thy servant; for with my staff <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
passed over this Iordan, and now am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
two Bands.</hi> And thus it was with
holy <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 7. 18. When God
had confirmed the Promise to him, to
build him an house, and not reject him
as he did <hi>Saul,</hi> he goes in before the Lord
and saith, <hi>who am I? and what is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, that than hast brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto?</hi>
and so indeed God required
<hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 5. when <hi>Israel</hi> was to bring to
God the first fruits of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were
to say, <hi>A Syrian ready to perish was my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34349:31"/>
&amp;c.</hi> Do others raise God the higher
for raising them? and the more God
raises me, the more shall I abuse him
and exalt my self? Oh what a sad thing
is this! (2) others have freely ascribed
the glory of all their injoyments to God,
and magnified not themselves but him,
for their mercies: So <hi>David 2 Sam. 26.
26. Let thy name be magnified, and the house
of thy servant be established.</hi> He doth not
fly upon the mercy, and suck out the
sweetness of it, looking no farther than
his own comfort; no, he cares for no
mercy except God be magnified in it.
So <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 2. when God had delivered
him from all his enemies, <hi>the Lord</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is my strength, and my rock, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
my salvation.</hi> They did not put the
Crown upon their own heads as I do.
(3) The mercies of God have been melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercies unto others, melting their
Souls in love to the God of their mercies.
So <hi>Hannah, 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 1. when she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the mercy of a Son, my soul (saith
she) rejoyceth in the Lord, not in the
mercy, but in the God of the mercy:
And so <hi>Mary, Luke 1. 46. My soul doth
magnify the Lord, my spirit rejoyceth in
God my Saviour;</hi> the word signifies, to
make more room for God: Their hearts
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34349:32"/>
were not contracted, but the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
to God; (4) the mercies of God
have been migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y restraints to keep
others from sin. So <hi>Ezra 9. 13. Seeing
thou our God hast given us such a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
as this, should we again break thy
Commandments?</hi> ingenious Souls have
felt the force of the obligations of love
and mercy upon them; (5) to conclude,
the mercies of God to others have been
as oyle to the wheels of their obedience,
and made them fitter for service, 2 <hi>Chro.
17.</hi> 5. Now if mercies work contrarily
upon my heart, what cause have I to
be afraid that they come not to me in
love? I tell you, this is enough to damp
the Spirit of any Saint, to see what sweet
effects they have had on others, and
what sad effects on him.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Season.</hi> 
               <q>The second special Season
in the life of a Christian requiring
more than a common diligence to keep
his heart is <hi>the time of adversity;</hi> when
providence frowns upon you, and
blasts your outward comforts, then
look to your hearts, keep them with
all diligence from repining against
God, or fainting under his hand; for
troubles, though sanctified, are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
still; even sweet bryar, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34349:32"/>
thistle have their prickeles. <hi>Ionah</hi>
was a good man, and yet how pettish
was his heart under affliction? <hi>Iob</hi>
was the Mirrour of patience, yet how
was his heart discomposed by trouble?
you will find it as hard to get a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
spirit under great afflictions, as it
is to fix Quicksilver: Oh the hurries
and tumults which they occasion even
in the best hearts! well then, the second
Case will be this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. Case. <hi>How a Christian under great
afflictions may keep his heart from repining
or desponding under the hand of God?</hi> Now
there are nine special helps I shall here
offer, to keep thy heart in this condition;
and the first shall be this, To work upon
your hearts this great truth.</p>
            <p>1. That by these cross Providences, God
is faithfully pursuing the great design of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
love upon the Souls of his people, and
orders all these afflictions as means sanctified
to that end.</p>
            <p>Afflictions fall not out by <hi>Casualty,</hi> but
by <hi>Counsel. Iob 5. 6. Eph.</hi> 1. 11. by this
Counsel of God they are ordained as
means of much spiritual good to Saints,
<hi>Isai. 27 9. By this shall the iniquity of Iacob
be purged, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 12. 10. <hi>But he for our
profit, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 8. 28. <hi>all things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34349:33"/>
for good,</hi> they are Gods workmen
upon our hearts, to pull down the pride
and carnal security of them; and being
so, their nature is changed; they are

               </gap>gs and benefits, <hi>Psal.
119 71 It is good for me that I have been
afflicted.</hi> And sure then, thou hast no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to quarrel with, but rather to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
that God should concern himself
so much in thy good, to use any means
for the accomplishing of it, <hi>Philip. 3. 11.
Paul could bless God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if by any means he
might attain the resurrection of the dead,</hi> my
brethren (saith <hi>Iames, count it all joy when
you fall into divers temptations, 1 Iam.</hi> 2. 3.
My father is about a design of love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my soul, and do I well to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with him? all that he doth is in
pursuance of, and reference to some
eternal glorious ends upon my Soul. O
'tis my ignorance of Gods design, that
makes me quarrel with him! he saith
to thee in this case, as to <hi>Peter, What I do
thou knowest not now, but hereafter thou shalt
know it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Help. <hi>Though God hath reserved to
himself a liberty of afflicting his people, yet
he hath tyed up his own hands by promise,
never to take away his loving kindness from
them.</hi> Can I look that Scripture in the

my mercy shall not depart away from him.</hi>
O my heart, my naughty he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hath given thee, the whole tree with all
the clusters of comfort growing on it;
because he suffers the wind to blow down

of goods, the goods of the throne, and
the goods of the foot stoole; moveables
and immoveables; if God have secured
these, never let my heart be troubled at
the loss of those: indeed, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I had reason to be cast down; but this
he hath not, he cannot do.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Help.</hi> It is of marvellous efficacy to
keep the heart from sinking under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
<hi>to call to mind; that thine own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath the ordering of them:</hi> not a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

and yet you have his word too, <hi>Ier. 25.

near his heart to hurt you, nothing

O when will you be ingenious!</p>
            <p>4. Help. <hi>God respects you as much in a

need not so much trouble you to be made low;</hi>
nay, to speak home, he manifests more
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34349:34"/>
of his love, grace, and tenderness, in the
time of affliction than prosperity: as God
did not at first chuse you because you
were high, so he will not forsake you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are low: men may look shie
upon you, and alter their respects as your
condition is altered: when providence
hath blasted your estates, your summer
friends may grow strange, as fearing you
may be troublesom to them, but will
God doe so? No, no, <hi>I will never leave
thee nor forsake thee, Heb.</hi> 13. 5. indeed if
adversity and poverty could bar you

hear me, Micah</hi> 7. poore <hi>David,</hi> when
stript out of all earthly comforts, could

your husband or child had lost all at Sea,
and should come to you in raggs; could
you deny the relation? or refuse to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain

less will God: Why then are you so

and tender hearts may be relieved and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
when they are even overweighed with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34349:39"/>
the burdensom sence of Sions troubles?</hi> 
               <q>I
grant, it is hard for him that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<hi>Sion</hi> to his chief joy, to keep
his heart that it sink not below the
due sence of its troubles; and yet this
ought and may be done by the use
of such heart establishing directions as
these.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Direct.</hi> Settle this great truth in your
hearts, that no trouble befalls Sion, but by
the permission of Sions God; and he permits
nothing out of which he will not bring much
good at last to his people.</p>
            <p>There is as truly a principle of quietness
in the <hi>permitting,</hi> as in the <hi>commanding</hi>
will of God. See it in <hi>David 2 Sam. 16.
10. let him alone, it may be God hath bidden
him, and in Christ, John 19. 11. thou couldst
have no power against me, except it were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thee from above,</hi> it should much calm
our spirits, that it is the will of God to
suffer it; and had not he suffered it, it
could never have been as it is.</p>
            <p>This very consideration quieted <hi>Iob,
Eli, David,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that the Lord did
it, was enough to them: and why should
it not be so to us? if the Lord will have
Sion plowed as a field, and her goodly
stones lye in the dust; if it be his pleasure
that <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall rage yet longer, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34349:39"/>
wear out the Saints of the most high; if
it be his will, that a day of trouble and
of treading down, and of perplexity by
the Lord God of hosts shall be upon the
valley of vision, that the wicked shall
devour the man that is more righteous
than he, what are we that we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
with God? fit it is, that we should
be resigned up to that will whence we
proceeded; and he that made us should
dispose of us as he pleaseth: he may doe
what seemeth him good without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
doth poor man stand upon equal
ground, that he should capitulate with
his Creator, or that God should render
him an account of any of his matters?
it's every way as reasonable we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
however God dispose of us, as that
we be obedient to what ever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us.</p>
            <p>But then, if we persue this argument
further, by considering that Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
do all meet at last in the real
good of his people, this will much more
quiet our spirits. Do the enemies carry
away the good figgs, even the best a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people into captivity? this
looks like a sad providence: but yet,
God sends them thither for their good
<hi>Ier.</hi> 24. 5. doth God take the <hi>Assyrian</hi> as a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34349:40"/>
staffe in his hand to beat his people with?
those blows are smart, and make them
cry; but the end of his so doing is, <hi>that
he may accomplish his whole work upon
Mount Sion, Isa.</hi> 10. 12. If God can bring
much good out of the worst, and greatest
evil of sin; much more out of temporal
afflictions, and it is as evident that he will,
as that he can do so. For it is inconsistent
with the wisdome of a common Agent,
to permit any thing (which he might
prevent if he pleased) to cross his great
design and end; and can it be imagined
that the most wise God should do so.</p>
            <p>Well then, as <hi>Luther</hi> told <hi>Melancthon,
desinat Philippus esse rector mundi:</hi> so say
I to you, let infinite wisdom, power and
love alone; for by these, all Creatures are
swayed, and actions guided, in reference
to the Church. Its none of our work to
rule the World, but to submit to him
that doth, <hi>non caeco impetu volvuntur rotae,</hi>
the motions of Providence are all judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
the Wheels are full of eyes: it is
enough, that the affairs of Sion are in a
good hand.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Direct.</hi> Ponder this heart-support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truth, in reference to Sions trouble.
<hi>That how many troubles soever are upon her,
yet her King is in her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:34349:40"/>
What? Hath the Lord forsaken his
Churches? hath he sold them into the
enemies hand? Doth he not regard what
evil befals them? that our hearts sink at
this rate? Is it not too shameful an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
of the great God? and too
much magnifying of poor impotent man
to fear and tremble at Creatures, whilest
God is in the midst of us? The Churches
enemies are many and mighty, let that
be granted; yet that Argument with
which <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> strove to raise
their own hearts, is of as much force now
as it was then: <hi>The Lord is with us, fear
them not, Numb.</hi> 14. 9. The <hi>Historian</hi> tels

he suddenly steps in among
them with this Question, <hi>and how many</hi>
(said he) <hi>do you reckon me for?</hi> discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
souls? how many do you reckon
the Lord for? is he not an over-match
for all his enemies? is not one Almighty
more than many mighties? doth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
stand for nothing with us? <hi>If

the heart in times of danger, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts,

            </p>
            <p>Now there are fourteen excellent
Rules or helps for the keeping of the
heart from sinful fear when eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
threaten us: and the first is this,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Rule.</hi> Look upon all the Creatures as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34349:45"/>
in the hand of God, who manages them in all
their motions; limiting, restraining, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
them all at his pleasure.</p>

               </gap>rd
them against slavish fears, the I. of <hi>Ezek.</hi>
contains an admirable <hi>scheam</hi> or <hi>draught</hi>
of Providence; there you may see the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creatures who move the wheels,
<hi>viz.</hi> the great Affairs and turnings of
things here below, coming unto Christ,
who sits upon the throne to receive new
orders and instructions from him, v. 24.
25, 26. and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. you read of white,
black, and red Horses, which are nothing
else but the Instruments which God em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
in executing his judgments in the
World, as Wars, Pestilence and Death,
but when these Horses are pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sing and
trampling up and down the World; here
is that may quiet our hearts, that God
hath the reins in his hand. Wicked men
are sometimes like mad Horses, they
would stamp the people of God under
their feet, but that the bridle of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is in their lips, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19, 11, 12. A
Lion at liberty is terrible to meet, but
who is afraid of the Lion in the <hi>Keepers
hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Rule. <hi>Remember that this God in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34349:46"/>
whose hand all the Creatures are, is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and is much more tender over you than
you are or can be over your selves: He that
toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye,
Zech.</hi> 2. 8. Let me ask the most time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
woman, whether there be not a vast
difference betwixt the sight of a drawn
sword in the hand of a bloudy Russian,
and the same sword in the hand of her
own tender Husband? as great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
there is in looking upon Creatures
by an eye of sense, and looking on them
as in the hand of your God by an eye of
Faith; that is a sweet Scripture to this
purpose, <hi>Isa. 54. 5. The Maker is thine
Husband, the Lord of Hosts is His Name,</hi>
He is Lord of all the Hosts of Creatures
in the world: who would be afraid to
pass through an Army, though all the
Souldiers should turn their Swords and
Guns towards him, if the General of
that Army were his friend or Father? I
have met with an excellent Story of a
religious young man, who being at Sea
with many other Passengers in a great
storm, and they being half dead with
fear, he only was observed to be very
chearful, as if he had been but little
concerned in that danger; one of them
demanding a reason of his chearfulness,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34349:46"/>
               <hi>Oh, said he, 'tis because the Pilot of the ship
is my Father.</hi> Consider Christ, first as the
King and Supream Lord over the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Kingdome, and then as your
Head, Husband and Friend, and thou
wilt quickly say, <hi>Return unto thy rest, O
my soul.</hi> This truth will make you
cease trembling, and fall a singing in the
midst of dangers, <hi>Psalm 47. 7. The Lord
is King of all the earth, sing ye praise with
understanding,</hi> or as the Hebrew word is,
<hi>every one that hath understanding,</hi> viz. of
this heart reviving and establishing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Dominion of our Father o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the Creatures.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Rule.</hi> Urge upon your hearts the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
prohibitions of Christ in this Case; and
let your hearts stand in awe of the violations
of them.</p>
            <p>He hath charged you not to fear, <hi>Luke
21. 9. When ye shall hear of Wars and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
see that ye be not terrified.</hi> And
<hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>il. 1. 28. In nothing be terrified by your
adversaries:</hi> yea in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 26. 28, 31.
and within the compass of six verses, our
Saviour commands us thrice, <hi>not to fear
men.</hi> Doth every big word of proud
dust and ashes make thee afraid? doth
the voice of a man make thee tremble?
and shall not the voice of God? If thou
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34349:47"/>
art of such a fearful and timerous spirit,
how is it that thou fearest not to disobey
the flat commands of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sus Christ? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
the command of Christ should
have as much power to calm, as the voice
of a poor worm to terrify thy heart, <hi>Isa.
51. 12, 13. I, even I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e that comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
you, who art thou that thou shouldest be
afraid of a man that shall dye? and of the
son of man that shall be made as the grass,
and forgettest the Lord thy maker?</hi> We
cannot fear Creatures sinfully till we
have forgotten God; did we remember
what he is, and what he hath said, we
should not be of such feeble spirits: bring
thy heart then to this <hi>Dilemma</hi> in timfs
of danger; if I let into my heart the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
fear of man, I must let out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential
awe and fear of God: and
dare I cast off the fear of the Almighty
for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rowns of a man? Shall I lift up
proud dust above the great God? Shall I
run upon a certain sin, to shun a probable
danger? Oh keep thy heart by that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Rule.</hi> Remember how much needless
trouble your vain fears have brought upon
you formerly, and how you have disquieted
your selves to no purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isa. 51. 13. And hast feared continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34349:47"/>
because of the oppressor, as if he were ready
to devour, and where is the fury of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor?</hi>
He seem'd ready to devour, but
yet you are not devoured; I have not
brought upon you the thing that ye fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
You have wasted your spirits, disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
your souls, and weakened your
hands, and all this to no purpose. You
might have all this while enjoyed your
peace, and possessed your souls in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And here I cannot but observe a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deep policy of Satan managing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against the soul by these vain fears:
I call them vain in regard of the frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them by Providence, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are not in vain as to the end Satan
aims at in ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sing them, for herein he acts
as Souldiers use to do in the Siege of a
Garrison, who on purpose to wear out
the besieged by constant watchings, and
thereby unfit them to make resistance
when they storm it in earnest, do every
night give them false Allarms, which
though they come to nothing, yet do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
serve this further design of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
O when will you beware of Sathans
devices?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Rule.</hi> Consider solemnly, That
though the things you fear should really fall
out, yet there is more evil in your own fear
than in the thing feared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:34349:48"/>
And that not only as the least evil of
sin, is worse than the greatest evil of
suffering; but as this sinful fear hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
more torment and trouble in it than
is in that condition you are so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of, fear is both a multiplying and a
tormenting passion; it represents trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
much greater than they are, and so
tortures and wracks the Soul much worse
than when the suffering it self comes.
So it was with <hi>Israel</hi> at the red Sea, they
cryed out, and were sore afraid till they
put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

which they thought would have drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. Thus it is with us, we look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the waters of trouble, the swellings
of <hi>Iordan,</hi> cry out, Oh they are unfoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable!
we must needs perish in them:

when he would make a tryal by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his finger to the Candle, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

go chearfully into the flames with that
Scripture in his mouth, <hi>Isa. 43. 1, 2, 3.
Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have

            <p>This is a cure by diversion: 'tis a rare

into spiritual Channels, to turn
natural anger into spiritual zeal, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
mirth into holy chearfulness, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
fear into an holy dread and awe of

10. like to which is that in <hi>Isa. 8. 12, 13.
Fear not their fear:</hi> But how shall we help

and let him be your fear and your

but it the fear of God extinguish it, then
'tis like a Candle quencht in water, which
cannot easily be re-kindled.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Rule. Lastly,</hi> Pour out those fears
to God in Prayer, which the Devil and your
own unbelief, pour in upon you in times of
danger.</p>
            <p>Prayer is the best out-let to fear; where

spent too: Now 'tis difficult to keep
down the proud and unbelieving
heart in an holy quietude and sweet
submission at the foot of God. 'Tis an

            <p>Your condition is not singular, though
you have hitherto been strangers to

and been familiarly acquainted
with them. Hear what blessed <hi>Paul</hi>

names of other Saints reduced to like

house to put his head in, one that was so
far above thee in Grace and Holiness, one
that did more service for God in a day,
than perhaps thou hast done him all thy
dayes, and yet thou repine as if hardly
dealt with! Have you forgot what neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
and straits even a <hi>David</hi> hath suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

have no reason to repine or despond under it.</p>
            <p>That is a sad condition indeed, to
which no promise belongs. I remember
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon those words, <hi>Isa. 9. 1.
Nevertheless, the dimnesse shall not be such
as was in her vexation,</hi> &amp;c. Salves the
doubt, in what sense the darkness of the
Captivity was not so great, as the lesser
incursions made by <hi>Tiglath Pileser.</hi> In
the Captivity the City was destroyed and
the Temple burnt with fire; there was
no comparison in the affliction; but yet
the darkness should not be such, and the
reason (saith he) is this, <hi>huic certam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionem

Even the darkness of Hell it self would

poor and the needy seek water and there is
none, and their tongue faileth for thirst; I the

not forsake them.</hi> Here you see, first their
extream wants, water being put even for
the necessaries of life, (2) their certain
relief, <hi>I the Lord will hear them;</hi> in which
it is supposed, that they cry unto him in

            <p>Having therefore these Promises, why

if they were absolute they would afford
more satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> What are those tacite conditions
you speak of, but these. (1) That either
he will supply, or sanctifie your wants;
(2) That you shall have so much as God
sees fit for you, and doth this trouble
you? would you have the mercy whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <q>The sixth Season of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
this diligence in keeping the
heart is the Season of Duty; when
we draw nigh to God in publick, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
or secret Duties, then 'tis time to
look to the heart; for the vanity of the
heart seldome discovers it self more
than at such times. How oft doth the
poor soul cry out, O Lord how fain
would I serve thee, but vain thoughts
will not let me; I came to open my
heart to thee, to delight my soul in
communion with thee, but my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
have set upon me: Lord rare
off these vain thoughts, and suffer them
not to prostitute the soul, which is
espoused to thee, before thy face. The

            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>Case.</hi> How the heart may be kept
from distractions by vain thoughts, in the
time of Duty.</p>
            <p>There is a two-fold distraction or
wandring of the heart in Duty: (1) vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and habitual, <hi>Psalm 78. 8. They
set not their hearts aright, and their spirit
was not stedfast with God.</hi> This is the case
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34349:62"/>
of Formalists, and it proceeds from the
want of an holy bent, and inclination of
the heart to God; their hearts are under
the power of their lusts, and therefore 'tis
no wonder they go after their lusts, even
when they are about holy things, <hi>Ezek,</hi>
33. 31. (2) Involuntary and lamented
distractions, <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a law, that when I would do good, evil is
present with me, O wretched man that I
am, &amp;c.</hi> This proceeds not from the want
of a holy bent and aim, but from the

O when thou goest to God in any duty,
take thy heart aside and say, O my Soul,

heart in the intervals of duty;</hi> What is the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34349:65"/>
reason our hearts are so dull, careless and
wandring, when we come to hear or
pray, but because there have been such
long intermissions in our communion
with God; by reason whereof the heart
is out of a praying frame: if that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
warmth, those holy impressions we
carry from God in one duty, were but
preserved to kindle another duty; it
would be of marvellous advantage, to
keep the heart intent, and serious with
God.</p>
            <p>To this purpose those intermediate
ejaculations, betwixt stated and solemn
duties, are of most sweet and excellent
use; by these, one duty is as it were
linked to another, and so the Soul as it
were wraps up it self in a chain of duties.
That Christian seldome misses his mark
in solemn duty, that shoots up many of
these darts in the intervals of duty, 'tis
an excellent commendation Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
upon the spouse, <hi>Cant. 4. 11. Thy
lips O my spouse drop as the hony combe:</hi>
upon which text one gives this sweet
note, the hony comb drops actually but
sometimes, but it always hangs full of
sweet drops ready to fall: if our ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
were more, our lamentations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account would be fewer.</p>

6. <hi>Help.</hi> Endeavour to ingage and raise
thy affections to God in duty, if thou wouldst
have thy distractions cured.</p>
            <p>A dropping eye, and a melting heart,
are seldom troubled as others upon this
account: When the Soul is intent about
any work, it gathers in its strength, and
bends all the thoughts about it; and
when its deeply affected, it will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
the affections command the

deadness; could you but look upon du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as the galleries of communion in
which you walk with God, where your
Souls may be filled with those ravishing,
and matchless delights that are in his
presence; your Soul would not offer to
stir from thence.</p>
            <p>It is with the heart in duty, as it is
with those that dig for gold oare;
they try here, and finding none, try
there; and so go from place to place till
at last they hit upon the rich vein, and
there they sit down. If thy heart could
but once hit the rich vein in duty, it
would dwell and abide there with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and constancy. <hi>O how I love thy
law, it is my meditation day and night!
Psal.</hi> 119. 97. The Soul could dwell
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34349:66"/>
day and night upon its knees, when once
its delights, loves, and desires are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.
What's the reason your hearts
are so shufling, especially in secret duties?
why are you ready to be gone almost as
soon as you are come into the presence
of God? but because your affections are
not ingaged.</p>

fruit, how pleasing and luscious soever
it be to our vitiated appetites, O saith
nature, revenge is sweet; O but saith
God, the effects thereof shall be bitter:
how plainly hath God interdicted this
flesh pleasing sin, <hi>Prov. 20. 22. Say not I

Rom. 12. 17. <hi>Recompense to no man evil

but rather give place to wrath:</hi> nay that's
not all, but Prov. 25. 21. <hi>If thine enemy

The word feed him, as <hi>Criticks</hi> observe,
signifies to feed cheerfully and tenderly,
as birds doe their young ones: The
Scripture is a great friend to the peace
and tranquillity of humane societies,
which can never be preserved, if revenge
be not deposed; it was wont to be an
argument urged by the Christians to
prove their religion to be supernatural
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34349:69"/>
and pure, that it forbids revenge which
is so sweet to nature; and verily 'tis a
thousand pities such an argument should
be lost. Well then awe your hearts with
the authority of God in these Scriptures:
and when carnal reason saith, mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
deserves to be hated, let Conscience
reply, but doth God deserve to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed?
thus, and thus he hath done,
and so he hath wronged me: but what
hath God done that I should wrong him?
if he dare be so bold to break the <hi>peace,</hi>
shall I be so wicked to break the <hi>precept?</hi>

            <p>This is the way to cut off those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
pleas of the flesh for revenge: as
thus, no man would bear such an affront,
yes, such and such have born as bad and
worse, I shall be reckoned a coward, a
fool, if I pass by this: no matter, as long
as I follow the examples of the wisest and

injuries than these, and why shouldest

meek and patient under great crosses and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations?</p>
            <p>There are three sorts of anger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> natural,
holy and sinfull anger. (1) Natural
which is nothing else but the motion of
the irascible appetite towards an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
object: an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this in it self is no sin,
they are propassions rather than passions;
the infelicities, rather than the sins of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as <hi>Ierome</hi> calls them: reason (saith
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34349:75"/>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi>) is the <hi>driver,</hi> the Soul is the
<hi>Chariot,</hi> and the two horses that draw it
on in all its motions, are the concupisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and irascible appetites; whilst these
are rightly managed by reason, they are
not only lawful, but very useful to the
Soul. God would not have us to be stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
and insensate, though he would have
us to be meek and patient: in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26.
He allows the natural motion, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
the sinful exorbitancy. (2) Holy
anger wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch is a pure flame, kindled by
an heavenly spark of Love to God, and
in Scripture is called zeal, which is (as
one saith) the dagger which love draws
in Gods quarrel. Such was <hi>Lots</hi> against
the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and that of <hi>Moses</hi> against
the Idolatrons <hi>Israelites:</hi> when <hi>Servetus</hi>
condemned <hi>Zwinglius</hi> for his harshness,
his answer was, <hi>in aliis mansuetus ero, in
blasphemiis in Christum, non ita;</hi> in other
cases I will be mild, but in the cause of
Christ, not so. That which the World
calls moderation and mildness here, is
in Gods account stupidity and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
neither of these are that which I
am now perswading you to keep your
hearts against. But (3) There is sinfull
passion, that's the thing which endangers
you. Now anger becomes sinful when
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34349:76"/>
'tis either <hi>Causeless,</hi> Matth. 5. 22. <hi>or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive,</hi>
and that either in measure or
time, exceeding the value of the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
cause, be it more transient or abide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet 'tis a sin and is matter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
before God. Now the means
to keep the heart from it under provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
are these.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Means.</hi> Get low and humble thoughts
of your selves, and then you will have meek
Spirits, and peaceable deportments towards
others.</p>
            <p>The humble is ever the patient man,
pride is the root of passion, a lofty, will be
a surly spirit: bladders blown up with
wind, will not lye close together: but
prick them, and you may pack a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
in a small room, <hi>only by pride com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
contention,</hi> Prov. 13. 10. When we
over-rate our selves, then we think we
are unworthily treated by others, and
that provokes: and here (by the way)
take notice of one great benefit of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with your own hearts, even
the meekning and calming of our Spirits.
Christian, methinks thou shouldst know
so much by thy self, that 'tis impossible
any should lay thee lower, or have baser
thoughts of thee than thou hast of thy
self. Some render the original of that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34349:76"/>

more humility, and that will bring you
more peace.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Means.</hi> Be often sweetning your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

not easily be imbittered with wrath towards

and strife are hugely opposite to the
frame and temper of a spiritual heart,
because inconsistent with the delight and
contentment of that Dove-like spirit,
which loves a sedate and quiet breast. O
saith a Soul that feeds upon the sweet
Communion of the Spirit, shall the

Soul as will offend and drive away the
comforter from me? this is so effectual
a remedy against passion, that I durst
almost venture in a Christian of an hasty

Communion with God. Seest thou such

            <p>Season 9. <q>The ninth Season of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

layes close Siege to the Fort-Royal

it for want of watchfulness: to

than a Duty; few Christians are so well

the arguments by which Satan
uses to draw them to sin, as to come

time as this. The ninth Case therefore
shall be this,</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Case</hi> 9. How a Christian when strongly
sollicited by the Devil to sin, may keep his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34349:79"/>
heart from yielding to the temptation?</p>
            <p>Now there are six special Arguments
by which Satan subtilly insinuates and
winds in the temptation; in all which
I shall offer thee some help for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thy heart, and the first is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The first Argument is drawn
from the pleasure of sin: O (saith Satan)
here is pleasure to be enjoyed; the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
comes with a smiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and charming Voice: What, art
thou so flegmatick and dull a soul, as
not to feel the powerful charms of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?
who can with-hold himself from
such delights?</p>
            <p>Now thine heart may be kept from
the danger of this temptation, by retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Argument of pleasure upon the
Tempter; which is done two waies.</p>
            <p>1. Thou tellest me Satan that sin is
pleasant; be it so: but are the gripes of
Conscience, and the flames of Hell so
too? Is it pleasant to feel the wounds
and throbs of Conscience? if so, Why
did <hi>Peter</hi> weep so bitterly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 75.
Why did <hi>David</hi> cry out of broken
bones, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. I hear what thou sayest
of the pleasure of sin, and I have read
what <hi>David</hi> hath said of the terrible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of sin in his Psalm, to bring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34349:80"/>
               <hi>Psal. 38. verse 2. Thine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
stick fast in me, and thy Hand pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
me sore:</hi> ver. 3. <hi>There is no soundness
in my flesh because of thine anger; neither
is there any rest in my bones because of my
sin:</hi> verse 4. <hi>For mine iniquities are gone
over mine head as an heavy burden; they
are too heavy for me:</hi> verse 5. <hi>My wounds
stink and are corrupt, because of my foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
verse 6. <hi>I am troubled, I am bowed
down greatly, I go mourning all the day long:</hi>
verse 7. <hi>My loyns are filled with a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
Disease, and there is no soundness in
my flesh:</hi> Verse 8. <hi>I am feeble and sore
broken, I have roared by reason of the disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness
of my heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I see the true face of sin, if I yield
to thy temptation, I must either feel
these pangs of Conscience, or the flames
of Hell.</p>
            <p>2. What talkest thou of the pleasure
of sin, when by experience I know
there is more true pleasure in the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
than can be in the commission
of sin. O how sweet is it to please God,
to obey Conscience, to preserve inward
Peace, to be able to say, in this tryal I
have disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vered the sincerity of my
heart; now I know I fear the Lord, now
I see that I truly hate sin. Hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in any
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34349:80"/>
such delight as this? this will choak that
temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The second Argument is
drawn from the Secresy of sin: O (saith
Satan, this sin will never disgrace thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oad,
none shall know it.</p>
            <p>This Argument may be retorted, and
the heart secured thus: Thou sayest, none
shall know it; but Satan, canst thou find
a place void of the Divine Presence for
me to sin in? Thus <hi>Iob</hi> secured his heart
from this temptation, <hi>Iob 31. 4. Doth he
not see my waies, and count all my steps?</hi>
therefore he makes a Covenant with his
eyes, <hi>verse</hi> 1. After the same manner <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaches us to retort this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Prov. 5. 20. 21. And why my Son wilt
thou be ravished with a strange Woman, and
embrace the bosome of a stranger? For the
waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord,
and he pondereth all his goings.</hi> What if I
hide it from the eyes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all the world for
the present, I cannot hide it from God;
and the time is at hand, when all the
world shall know it too; for the Word
assures me, <hi>Luke 8. 17. That what is done
now in secret, shall be proclaimed as upon the
house top.</hi> Besides, is not my Conscience
as a thousand witnesses? Do I owe no
reverence to my self? could t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Heathen

man say, <hi>turpe quid assurus, te sine teste
time,</hi> when thou art tempted to commit
sin, fear thy self without any other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
and shall not I be afraid to sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mine own Conscience, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
hath a reproof in its mouth, or a
pen in its hand, to record my most secret
actions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The third Argument by which
Satan tempteth to sin, is taken from the
gain and profit arising out of it: Why
so nice and scrupulous? 'tis but stretch
Conscience a little, and thou maist make
thy self; Now is thy opportunity.</p>
            <p>The heart may be kept from falling
into this dangerous snare, by retorting
the temptation thus: But what profit
will it be if a man should gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul? or what
shall a man give in exchange for his
soul? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26. O my soul, my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
soul! shall I hazard thee for all
the good that is in this world? There is

            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The fourth Argument is
drawn from the smalness of the sin; 'Tis
but a little one, a small matter, a trifle;
who would stand upon such niceties?</p>
            <p>This Argument may be retorted three
waies.</p>
            <p>1. But is the Majesty of Heaven a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
one too? If I commit this sin, I must
offend and wrong a great God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.
15, 16, 17, 22.</p>
            <p>2. Is there any little Hell to torment
little sinners in? Are not the least sinners
there filled with the fulness of wrath? O
there is great wrath treasured up for such
as the world counts little sinners.</p>
            <p>3. The less the sin, the less the induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to commit it: What, shall I break
with God for a trifle? destroy my peace,
wound my Conscience, grieve the Spirit,
and all this for nothing? Oh what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is this?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:34349:82"/>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. A fifth Argument is drawn
from the Grace of God, and hopes of
pardon: Come, God will pass by this as
an infirmity, he will not be extream to
mark it.</p>
            <p>But stay my heart,</p>
            <p>1. Where do I find a promise of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to presumptuous sinners? indeed for
involuntary surprisals, unavoidable and
lamented infirmities, there is a pardon
of course, but where is the promise to a
daring sinner, that sins upon a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of pardon? Pause a while my soul
upon that Scripture, <hi>Numb. 15. 27, 30.
And if a Soul sin through ignorance, then he
shall bring a She-Goat, of the first year for a
Sin-offering, &amp;c. But the Soul that doth ought
presumptuously, the same reproacheth the
Lord, and that soul shall be cut off from among
his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If God be a God of so much mercy,
how can I abuse so good a G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d? Shall I
take so glorious an attribute as the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God is, and abuse it unto sin? shall
I wrong him because he is good? or
should not rather the goodness of God
lead me to repentance, <hi>Rom. 2. 4. There
is mercy with thee, that thou maiest be feared,
Psal.</hi> 130. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Lastly, Sometimes Satan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34349:82"/>
to sin from the examples of
good and holy men, thus, and thus they
have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nned, and been restored, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this may consist with grace; and
thou be saved nevertheless. The danger
of this temptation is avoided, and the
heart secured; by retorting the argument
these three ways.</p>
            <p>1. Though good men may commit
the same sin materially, which I am
tempted to, yet did ever any good man
venture to sin, upon such a ground and
incouragement as this?</p>
            <p>2. Did God record these examples for
my imi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation, or for my warning? are
they not set up as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ea marks, that I might
avoid the rocks upon which they split?
1 <hi>Cor. 10. 6. now these were our examples,
to the intent we should not lust after evil
things, as they also lusted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Am I willing to feel what they felt
for sin? O I dare not follow them in
the ways of sin! <hi>quia me vestigia terrent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Least God plunge me into the deeps of
horrour, into which he cast them.</p>
            <p>Thus learn to keep your hearts in the
hour of temptation to sin.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Season.</hi> 
               <q>The tenth special season
to keep the heart with all diligence,
is the time of spiritual darkness and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34349:83"/>
doubting when it is with the Soul, as
it was with <hi>Paul</hi> in his dangerous voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
neither sun, nor moon, nor star
appears for many days: when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the hidings of Gods face, the
prevalency of corruption, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidence
of grace; the Soul is even
ready to give up all its hopes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
for lost; to draw sad and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
conclusions upon it self; to call
its former comforts vain delusions;
its grace hypocrisie. When the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
and clear Heavens are overcast
with dark clouds, yea filled with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and horrible tempests; when
the poor pensive Soul sits down and
weeps forth this sad lamentation, <hi>my
hope is perished from the Lord!</hi> now to
keep the heart from sinking in such a
day as this, to enable it to maintain
its own sincerity, is a matter of great
difficulty. The tenth Case then will
be this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Case</hi> 10. How the people of God in dark
and doubting seasons, may keep their hearts
from entertaining such sad conclusions about
their estates, as destroy their peace, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
them for their Duty.</p>
            <p>There are two general heads, to which
the grounds of doubting our sincerity
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34349:83"/>
may be reduced. (1) Gods carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Soul, either in the time of
some <hi>extraordinary affliction,</hi> or of some
long and <hi>sad desertion.</hi> Or, (2) The souls
carriage towards God: And here it usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
argues against the truth of its own
graces, either (1) From its relapses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same sins, from which it hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
risen, with shame and sorrow. Or,
(2) From the sensible declining of its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
from God. Or, (3) From the
excess of the affections towards crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts
and enjoyments. Or,
(4) From its enlargements in publick,
and often straitnings in private Duties.
Or, (5) From some horrid injections of
Satan, with which the soul is greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed.
Or, Lastly, From Gods silence,
and seeming denial of its long depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Suits and Prayers.</p>
            <p>These are the common grounds of
those sad conclusions: Now in order to
the establishment and support of the
heart in this condition it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>1. That you be acquainted with some
general Truths, which have a tendency
to the settlement of a trembling and
doubting Soul.</p>
            <p>2. That you be rightly instructed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34349:84"/>
the forementioned Particulars,
which are the grounds of your doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The general truths requisite for poor
doubting souls to be acquainted with,
are these:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That every working and appearance of
hypocrisie doth not presently prove the person
in whom it is to be an hypocrite.</hi> You must
carefully distinguish between the <hi>presence</hi>
and <hi>predominancy</hi> of hypocrisie: there are
remains of deceitfulness in the best hearts.
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had sad experience of it,
yet the standing frame and general bent
of the heart being upright; it did not
denominate them hypocrites.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That we ought as well to hear what
can be said for us, as against us:</hi> It is the
sin of upright hearts sometimes to use
an over rigid, and merciless severity
against themselves: they do not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
consider the case of their own
souls: it is in this case, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks
in another, <hi>Prov. 13. 7. There is that
maketh himself rich, and yet hath nothing;
and there is that maketh himself poor, and
yet hath great riches.</hi> 'Tis the damning sin
of the self flattering hypocrite, to make
his condition better then 'tis: and
it is the sin and folly of some upright
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34349:84"/>
ones to make their condition worse then
indeed it is. Why should you be such
enemies to your own peace? to read
over the evidences of Gods love to your
Souls, as a man doth a book which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to confute? why doe you study to
find evasions, to turn off those comforts
which are due to you? 'tis said of <hi>Ioseph</hi>
that he was minded to put away his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoused
<hi>Mary,</hi> not knowing that that
holy thing which was conceived in her,
was by the holy ghost: and this may be
your case. A third truth is this.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That many a Saint hath charged and
condemned himself for that, which God will
never charge him with, nor condemn him for.</hi>
Why hast thou hardned our heart from
thy fear (saith the Church, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 17.
and yet the verse before manifests, that
their hearts were not so hardned: godly
<hi>Bradford</hi> wrote himself an hypocrite, a
painted sepulchre; yet doubtless God
acquitted him of that charge.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Every thing which is a ground of grief
to the people of God, is not a sufficient ground
of questioning their sincerity.</hi> There are
many more things to <hi>trouble</hi> you then
there are to <hi>stumble</hi> you: if upon every
slip and failing through infirmity, you
should question all that ever was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34349:85"/>
wrought upon you your life must be
made up of doubtings and fears: you can
never attain a setled peace, nor live that
life of praise and thankfulness, the gospel
calls for.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>The Soul is not at all times fit to pass
judgment upon its own condition:</hi> To be
sure in the dark day of desertion, when
the Soul is benighted; and in the stormy
day of temptation, when the Soul is in
a hurry; 'tis utterly unfit to judge its
estate: examine your hearts upon your
beds, and be still, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. This is rather
a season for watching and resisting, then
for judging, and determining.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>That every breach of peace with God,
is not a breach of Covenant with God:</hi> The
wife hath many weaknesses and failings,
often grieves and displeases her husband;
yet in the main is faithful, and truly loves
him: these failings may cause him to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his carriage, but not to withdraw his
love, or deny his relation. <hi>Return O back-sliding
Israel for I am married unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>Lastly, what ever our sin, or trouble
be, it should rather drive us to God, then
from God.</hi> Pardon my sin for it is great,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 11. Suppose it be true, that thou
hast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o, and so sinned, that thou art thus
long and sadly deserted; yet 'tis a false
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34349:85"/>
inference, that therefore thou shouldest
be discouraged, as if there were no help
for thee in thy God. When you have
well digested these seven establishing
truths, if still the doubt remain; then
consider, what may be replyed to the
particular grounds of those doubts. As,</p>
            <p>1. You doubt, and are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Lord hath no regard or love
for your Souls, because of some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
affliction which is come upon
you: but I would not have thy Soul so
to conclude till thou be able satisfactori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to answer those three questions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> If great troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
be marks of Gods hatred, why
should not impunity and constant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
be tokens of his love? for <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum
contraria est ratio &amp; consequentia:</hi>
of contrary things, there is a contrary
reason and consequence: but is this so
indeed? or saith not the scripture quite
otherwise? <hi>Prov. 1. 32. The prosperity of
fools destroy them.</hi> So <hi>Psal. 73. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Dare I draw the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
upon all others that have been as
much, yea more afflicted then my self? if
this argument conclude against thee,
then so it doth against every one in thy
condition; yea, the greater the affliction
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34349:86"/>
of any Child of God hath been, the
more strongly the argument still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes:
and then wo to <hi>David, Iob,
Heman, Paul,</hi> and all that have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
as they were.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> Had God exempted you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from those troubles, which all other
his people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eel, would not that have been
a greater ground of doubting to you then
this? especially since the scripture saith,
<hi>Heb. 12. 8. If ye be without chastnings
whereof all are partakers, then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ye ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards;
and not sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O how is our Father put to it by frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Children! if he afflicts, then one
crys he loves me not: if he exempt from
affliction, others question his love upon
that ground. Surely you have other
work to do under the rod then thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>2. Or do you rashly infer the Lord
hath no love for you, because he hides
his face from you, that your condition
is miserable because dark and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
before you draw such rash con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
see what answer you can give
to these 4. following queries.</p>
            <p>1. Quer. <hi>If any action of God towards
his people will bear a favourable, as well as
an harsh and severe construction, why should
not his people interpret it in the best sense?</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:34349:86"/>
And is not this such? may he not have a
design of love as well as of hatred in this
dispensation? may he not depart for a
season, and not for ever, yea, that he
might not depart for ever? you are not
the first that have mistaken Gods ends
in desertion, <hi>Isai. 49. 14. Sion said the
Lord hath forsaken me, my God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
me:</hi> was it so indeed? nothing less
<hi>v.</hi> 15. can a mother forget, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er. <hi>Do you find the marks of an
absolute total and final desertion upon your
own Spirits, that you are so apt to conclude
yours to be such?</hi> Do you find your heart
inclined to forsake God? have you lost
your conscientious tenderness in point of
sin? if so, Sad characters appear upon you
indeed: but if in this dark hour you are
as tender of sin as ever, as much resolved
to cleave to God as ever; I cannot, I
will not forsake God, let him do what
he will with me, oh no I cannot, If
your hearts work thus, it can be but a
partial, limited and temporary desertion;
by this he still keeps his interest in your
hearts, a sure sign he will return and
visit you again.</p>
            <p>3. Quer. <hi>Is sence and feeling a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
judge of Gods actions and designs.</hi> Or
may a man safely rely upon its testimony
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34349:87"/>
after so many discoveries of the fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of it? is this a sound argument? if
God had any love for my Soul, if it
were not quite gone, I should feel it
now as well as in former times; but I
cannot feel it, therefore its quite gone.
Do not you know the Sun still keeps
on his course in the Heavens even in full
and closs weather, when you cannot see
it? and may it not be so with the love
of God? read <hi>Isai.</hi> 50. 10. may I not
as well conclude in winter when the
flowers have hid their beautiful heads
under ground, they are quite dead and
gone, because I cannot find them in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
where I saw them in <hi>May?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Quer.</hi> Think you the Lord cares
not to break his childrens hearts, and
his own promise too? hath he no more
regard to either? if he return no more,
these must be the consequents, <hi>Isai. 57.
16, 17. Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
            <p>Well then, from Gods carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you either in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffliction or desertion,
no such discouraging, heart sinking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
can be inferr'd. Next let us see
whether they may not be inferr'd from
our carriage towards God: and here
the principal grounds of doubting are
such as these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:34349:87"/>
1. I have fallen again into the same
sin from which I have formerly risen with
repentance and resolution, therefore my
sinning is customary sinning, a spot that
is not the spot of Gods children: hence
the upright Soul trembles, upon this tis
ready to affirm that all its former humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations
for, and oppositions unto sin,
were but acts of hypocrisie. But stay poor
trembling heart.</p>
            <p>1. Quer. <hi>If this be so, how comes it to
pass that Christ put such a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
upon the Disciples sleeping the third
time, when he had as often reproved them for
it? Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h.</hi> 26. 40, 41. And how is it that
we find in Scripture so many promises
made not only to the first sins, but also
to the backslidings of Gods people, <hi>Ier.
3. 22. Hose.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
            <p>2. Quer. <hi>Is not your repentance and care
renued, as often as your guilt is renued?</hi> Yea
the oftner you sin the more you are
troubled? it is not so in customary sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the rise whereof <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
excellently discovers <hi>Lib. de Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
(1) (saith he) when a man <hi>p.</hi> 1109.
accustomed to good sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
grieviously, it seems importable, yea
he seems to descend alive into hell. (2)
In process of time it seems not importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34349:88"/>
but heavy; and betwixt importable
and heavy there is no small descent.
(3) Next it becomes light, his conscience
smites but faintly, and he feels not the
stripes of it. (4) Then there is not only
a total insensibleness of it, but that which
was bitter and displeasing, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
sweet and pleasing in some degree.
(5) Then tis turned into custom, and
not only pleases, but daily pleases. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
custom is turned into nature, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be pull'd away from it; but defends
and pleads for it: this is customary sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this is the way of the wicked; but
the quite contrary is our condition.</p>
            <p>3. Quer. <hi>Are you sure from Scripture
grounds that a good man may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not relapse
again and again into the same sin?</hi> 'Tis
true, as for gross sins, they do not use
to relapse into them. <hi>David</hi> committed
adultery no more, <hi>Paul</hi> persecuted the
Church no more, <hi>Peter</hi> denyed Christ no
more, but I speak of ordinary infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
<hi>Iobs</hi> friends were good men, yet
(saith he) <hi>Chap. 19. 3. These ten times
have ye reproached me.</hi> So then no such
conclusions follow from this first ground
of doubting.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The second ground is, the declining
and withering of our affections to spiritual
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34349:88"/>
things,</hi> O saith the upright Soul, if ever
I had been planted a right seed, I should
have been as a green olive tree in the
house of my God: but my branches
wither, therefore my root is naught. But
stay,</p>

               </gap>er. <hi>May you not be mistaken about
the decay of grace, and fading of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections?</hi>
What if they be not so quick
and ravishing as at first? may not that be
recompensed in the spirituality and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow? 1 <hi>Phil. 9. I pray God
your love may abound more and more in all
judgment:</hi> it may be more <hi>solid,</hi> though
not so <hi>ferverous:</hi> or do you not mistake
by looking forward to what you would
be, rather then backward to what once
you were? 'tis a good note of <hi>Ames:</hi>
we discern the growth of grace, as the
growth of plants, which we perceive ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>crevisse quam crescere,</hi> to have grown,
then to grow.</p>
            <p>(2. <hi>Quer.)</hi> But grant it be so indeed
as you affirm, must it needs follow, that
the root of the matter is not in you? <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
last waies are distinguished from his
first, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 17. 3. and yet both first and
last, a holy man. The Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
is charged by Christ for leaving her
first love; and yet a golden Candlestick,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34349:89"/>
many precious Saints in that Church,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>3. A third ground of these sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
is, the excess of our affections
to some creature injoyments. I fear I
love the creature more than God, and
if so, my love is but hypocritical. I
sometimes feel stronger, and more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
motions of my heart to some earthly
comforts, then I do to heavenly objects:
therefore my Soul is not upright in me.
But stay Soul,</p>
            <p>(1. Quer.) <hi>May not a man love God
more solidly and strongly, then the Creature,
and yet his affections to the creatures be
sometimes moved more violently and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
then toward God?</hi> as rooted malice
argues a stronger hatred, then a sudden,
though more violent passion; so we
must measure our love, not by a violent
motion of it, now and then, but by the
depth of the root, and constancy of its
actings: because <hi>David</hi> was so passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moved for <hi>Absalom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> concludes
that if he had lived, and all the people
dyed; <hi>it would have pleased him well
2 Sam.</hi> 19. 7. but that was argued more
like a <hi>Souldier</hi> then a <hi>Logician.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2. Quer.) <hi>If you indeed love the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for its self, if you make it your end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34349:89"/>
religion but a means, then the conclusion is
rightly drawn upon you.</hi> But if you love
the creature in reference to God, and see
nothing in it seperated from him, though
sometimes your affections offend in the
excess: this is consistent with sincere love
to God. To love the creature inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
(i. e.) to put it in Gods room,
and make it a mans end; this is the love
of a carnal heart: to love it immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
that is, to let out more affection
to it then we ought, is sometimes the sin
of the best hearts.</p>
            <p>(3. Quer.) <hi>Have not many Souls feared
as you do, that when Christ and creatures
should stand as competitors in some eminent
tryal they should forsake Christ rather then
the creature, and yet when brought to that
Dilemma have been able to cast all the world
at their heels for Christ?</hi> Many of the
<hi>Martyrs</hi> had such fears, and thus they
were satisfied: the prevalency of love is
best seen at parting: there may be more
love to Christ in thy Soul then thou art
now aware of; and if God bring thee to
such a pinch thou mayest see it.</p>
            <p>4. A fourth ground of these sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
is from hence, that we find our
hearts sometimes more straitned in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
then in publick duties. Oh if my
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34349:90"/>
Soul were sincere, its actings in duty
would be uniform. I fear I am but a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee</hi>
upon this ground: 'tis sad indeed
we should at any time find our hearts
straitned in private. But,</p>
            <p>1. Quer. <hi>Do not all thine inlargements
in duty whether publick, or private depend
upon the Spirit, who is the Lord of influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and according as he gives out, or holds
back those influences, so art thou inlarged or
straitned?</hi> And what if sometimes he
please to give that in a publick, which he
with-holds in a private duty, as long as
thy Soul is satisfied in neither without
Communion with God, and the strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of thy heart is indeed its burden;
doth that argue thee to be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite?</p>
            <p>(2. Quer.) <hi>Dost thou not make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of private duties, and set thy self as
before the Lord in them?</hi> Indeed, if thou
live in the constant neglect, or careless
performance of them, if thou art <hi>curious</hi>
about publick, and <hi>careless</hi> about pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
duties, that would be a sad sign:
but when you have conscientiously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and often met with God in them,
it will not follow you are insincere,
because that communion is sometimes
interrupted. Besides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:34349:90"/>
(3. Quer.) <hi>May there not be something
at sometimes in a publick, which is wanting
in a private duty to raise and advantage
thine affections.</hi> God m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y sometimes make
use of the melting affections of them
with whom thou hearest or prayest, as
petty instruments to move thy affections;
this advantage is wanting in private,
therefore from hence (the case so stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
no such inferrence can be drawn.</p>
            <p>5. Another ground is from those hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
injections of Satan, with which the
Soul is greatly perplexed; by these I
may see what an heart I have: can grace
be where these are?</p>
            <p>Yes, grace may be where such thoughts
are, though not where they are lodged
and consented to: dost thou cry out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the burden, enter thy protest in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
against them, strive to keep up holy
and reverend thoughts of God? then tis
a <hi>rape,</hi> not a voluntary <hi>prostitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The last ground of these sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
is the Lords long silence, and
seeming denyal of our long depending
suits and prayers. O if God had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to my Soul, he would have heard
my cryes before now! but I have no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from him, therefore no interest in
him. But stay doubting Soul,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:34349:91"/>
(1. Quer.) <hi>Have not many Saints stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
upon this stone before thee?</hi> Psal. 31. 22.
<hi>I said in my hast, I am cut off from before
thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the
voice of my supplication.</hi> So the Church
<hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 44. Thou coverest thy self with
a cloud, that our prayers should not pass
through. <hi>Ionah</hi> 2. 4. Then said I, I am
cast out of thy sight, and may not you
be mistaken in this mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er as well as
they?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Quer.</hi> Though Gods abhorring,
and final rejecting prayer be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his abhorring the person that
prayes; yet dare we conclude so from a
meere suspension of the answer? <hi>God
may bear long with his own elect, that cry
unto him day and night,</hi> Luk. 18. 7.</p>
            <p>3. Quer. <hi>Can you deny but that there
are some signs appearing in your Souls, even
whilest God suspends his answer that argue
your prayers are not rejected by him?</hi> as (1)
Though no answer come, yet you are
still resolved to wait: you dare not say
as that prophane wretch did, 2 <hi>Kings 6.
33. This evil is of the Lord, why should I
wait for him any longer?</hi> (2) You can
clear and justifie God still, and lay the
reason and cause of his silence upon your
selves. So did <hi>David, Psal. 22. 2, 3. O
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34349:91"/>
my God, I cry in the day time, and thou
hearest not; and in the night, and am not
silent, but thou art holy,</hi> &amp;c. (3) The su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension
of Gods answer makes you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
into your own hearts, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
are there that obstruct your prayers?
So the Church, <hi>Lam. 3. 8. He shutteth
out my prayer:</hi> and how doth this work?
you may see, <hi>v. 40. Let us search and try
our ways:</hi> well then, neither from hence
may you conclude that God hath no love
for your Souls.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewn you, how to
keep your hearts in a dark and doubting
season from those desperate conclusions
of unbelief. God forbid any false heart
should incourage it self from
these things,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> tis our unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that when we give Saints
and sinners their proper portions, that
each of them are so prone to take up the
others part.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Season.</hi> 
               <q>The eleventh special sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
calling for this diligence to keep
our hearts is, when sufferings for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
come to an height; then look to
your hearts: <hi>Matth. 24. 8, 9, 10. All
these are the beginning of sorrows, and
they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and
shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34349:92"/>
nations for my names sake: and THEN
shall many be offended.</hi> When sufferings
for religion grow hot, then blessed is he
that is not offended in Christ, troubles
are then at an height. (1) When a
mans neerest friends and relations for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
and leave him, <hi>Micah 7. 5, 6.
2 Tim.</hi> 4. 16. When a man is ingaged
alone (2) When it comes to resisting
to blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 4.(3) When tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are presented to us in our suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 37.(4) When eminent
persons for profession turn aside, and
desert the cause of Christ, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.
(5) When God hides his face in a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
hour, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 17. (6) When
Satan falls upon us with strong tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
to question the grounds of our
sufferings, or the Souls interest in
Christ: Now tis heard to keep the heart
from turning back, and the steps from
declining Gods ways. The eleventh
question then shall be this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>11. Case. <hi>How the heart may be kept
from relapsing under the greatest sufferings
for religion?</hi> If the bitterness of sufferings
at any time cause thy Soul to distaste the
way of God and take up thoughts of
forsaking it, stay thine heart under that
temptation by propounding these 8. que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
solemnly to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:34349:92"/>
1. Quest. <hi>What reproach and dishonour
shall I pour upon Christ and religion by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
him at such a time as this?</hi> This
will proclaim to all the world that how
much soever I have boasted of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
yet when it comes to the tryal, I
dare hazard nothing upon the credit of
them: and how will this open the mouths
of Christs enemies to blaspheme? O
better I had never been born then that
worthy name should be blasphemed
through me! shall I furnish the triumphs
of the uncircumcised? shall I make mirth
in Hell? O if I did but value the name
of Christ as much as many a wicked man
values his own name! I would never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to see it exposed to such contempt
will proud dust and ashes venture death,
yea Hell, rather then a blot upon their
name? and shall I venture nothing to
salve the honour and reputation of
Christ?</p>
            <p>2. Quest. <hi>Dare I violate my conscience
to save my flesh? who shall comfort me when
conscience wounds me?</hi> What comfort is
there in life, liberty, or friends, when
peace is taken away from the inner man?
when <hi>Constantius</hi> threatned to cut off
<hi>Samosatenus</hi> his right hand if he would
not subscribe somewhat that was against
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34349:93"/>
his conscience, he held up both his hands
to the messenger that was sent, saying,
he shall cut off both rather then I will
do it: farewel all peace, joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
from that day forward; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

say I here, had <hi>Iudas</hi> peace? had <hi>Spira</hi>
peace? and shall you have peace if you
tread in their steps? O consider what
you do!</p>
            <p>3. Quest. <hi>Is not the publick interest of
Christ and religion infinitely more, then any
private interest of my own?</hi> Tis a famous
passage that of <hi>Terentius</hi> Captain to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>
the <hi>Emperour,</hi> he presented a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Adrian</hi> that the Christians might
have a temple by themselves to worship
God apart from the <hi>Arrians:</hi> the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
tore his petition and threw it away,
bidding him to aske somewhat for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and it should be granted: but he
modestly gathered up the pieces of his
petition again and told him, <hi>if he could
not be heard in Gods ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se, he would never
ask any thing for himself:</hi> Yea even <hi>Tully,</hi>
though an <hi>Heathen</hi> could say, <hi>ne immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitatem

would not accept even of immortality it
self against the Common-wealth. O if
we had more publick, we should not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34349:93"/>
have such cowardly spirits.</p>
            <p>4. Qu. <hi>Did Iesus Christ serve me so?
when for my sake he exposed himself to far
greater sufferings than can be before me?</hi> His
sufferings were great indeed, he suffered
from all <hi>hands,</hi> in all his <hi>offices</hi> in every

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rings of his Soul,
were the very Soul of his sufferings:
witness the bloody sweat in the garden,
witness the heart melting and heaven
rending outcry upon the cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ss, <hi>My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> and yet
he flinched not, <hi>he endured the cross, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising

one of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> was asked, why he
was so merry at his death? Oh said he!
it is because the Soul of Christ was so
heavy at his death: did Christ bear such
a burden for me, with unbroken patience,
and constancy? and shall I shrink back
for momentary and light affictions for
him?</p>
            <p>5. Qu. <hi>Is not eternal life worth the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of a moments pain?</hi> If I suffer with
him, I shall raign with him. O how will
men venture life and limb for a fading

death? What loathness to depart?
may sometimes (indeed too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
be observed in the people of God:
How loath are some of them to take
Death by the cold hand? If such a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
were indulged to us, not to be
dissolved till we dissolve our selves;
when should we say with S. <hi>Paul, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be dissolved?</hi> Well then, the last
Case shall be this:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Case</hi> 12. How the people of God in times
of sickness may get their hearts loose from
all earthly ingagements, and perswade them
into a willingness to dye.</p>
            <p>And there are seven arguments which
I shall urge upon the people of God at
such a time as this to make them cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
entertain the messengers of death,
and dye as well as live like Saints; and
the first is this.</p>
            <p>1. Argu. <hi>First the harmlesness of death
to the people of God.</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ough it keep its
<hi>dart,</hi> it hath lost its sting: a Saint (to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34349:96"/>
allude to that, <hi>Isai.</hi> 11. 8.) <hi>May play upon
the hole of this aspe, and put his hand into the
Cockatrices den.</hi> Death is the Cockatrice,
or Aspe; the grave is his hole or den:
a Saint need not fear to put his hand
boldly into it: it hath left and lost its
sting in the sides of Christ; 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55.
O death! where is thy sting?</hi> why art thou
afraid? O Saint! that this sickness may
be thy death, as long as thou knowest
that the death of Christ is the death of
death? indeed, if thou didst dye in thy
sins as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 21. If death as a King did
reign over thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. if it could

               </gap>eed upon thee, as the Lyon doth upon
the prey he hath taken, as <hi>Psal. 49. 14.
If hell followed the pale horse as it is, Rev.</hi>
6. 8. Then thou mightest well startle
and shrink back from it; but when God
hath put away thy sins from thee, <hi>as far
as the East is from the West, Psal.</hi> 103. 12.
As long as there is no other evil left in
death, for thee to encounter with; but
bodily pain: as long as the Scriptures
represent it to thee under such harmless
and easy notions, as the putting off thy
cloaths, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 2. And lying down to
sleep upon thy bed, Isai.</hi> 57. 2. Why should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou be afraid? there is as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt death to the people of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34349:97"/>
God, and others; as betwixt the <hi>Unicorns</hi>
horn when it is upon the head of that
fierce beast, and when it is in the <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries</hi>
shops; where it is made salubrious
and medicinal.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Arg.</hi> Thy heart may he kept from
shrinking back at such a time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as this, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the necessity of death; in order to
the full fruition of God.</p>
            <p>Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her thou art willing to dye or
no I assure thee, there is no other way
to obtain the full satisfaction of thy
Soul; and compleat its happiness: till
the hand of death do thee the kind offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
to draw aside the curtain of flesh, thy
Soul cannot see God: this animal life
stan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s betwixt him and thee, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 6.
Whilest we are at home in the body, we are
absent from the Lord.</hi> Thy body must be
refined and cast into a new mould, else
that new wine of heavenly glory would
break it. <hi>Paul</hi> in his highest rapture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 4. when he heard things unutterable,
was then but as a stander by, a looker on;
not admitted into the company, as one
of them; but as the Angels are in our
assemblies, so was <hi>Paul</hi> in that glorious
assembly above and no otherwise; and
yet even for this he must as it were be
taken out of the body, uncloathed for a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34349:97"/>
little time; to have a glimpse of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and then put on his cloathes again.
O then! Who would not be willing to
dye for a full sight and enjoyment of
God? Methinks, thy soul should look
and sigh like a Prisoner through the
Grates of this Mortality; <hi>O that I had
wings like a Dove, then would I fly away,
and be at rest:</hi> Most men need patience
to dye, but a Saint that understands what
death admits him to, should rather need
patience to live; methinks, he should
often look out, and listen on a death-bed
for his Lords coming; and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the news of his approaching
change, should say; <hi>The voice of my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
behold he cometh leaping over the
Mountains, skipping over the Hills,</hi> Cant.
2. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Another Argument perswading
to this willingness is, the immediate succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a more excellent and glorious life.</p>
            <p>'Tis but wink, and you shall see God:
your happiness shall not be deferred till
the Resurrection; but as soon as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is dead, the gracious soul is swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10, 11. When
once you have loosed from this shore, in
a few moments, your souls will be waft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over upon the wings of Angels, to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34349:98"/>
other shore of a glorious eternity. <hi>Phil.
1. 23. I desire to be dissolved and to be with
Christ:</hi> Did the Soul and body dye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as <hi>Beryllus</hi> taught? or did they
sleep till the resurrection as others have
groundlessly fancied? it had been a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for <hi>Paul</hi> to desire a dissolution for
the injoyment of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ist. For if this were
so, he injoyed more of Christ whilst his
Soul dwelt in its fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shly Tabernacle, then
he should out of it.</p>
            <p>There are but two waies of the Souls
living known in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> the life
of <hi>faith,</hi> and the life of <hi>vision, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 5.
those two divide all time both present
and future betwixt them, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 13. 12.
If when faith fails, Sight should not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
succeed, what should become
of the unbodied Soul? but blessed be
God, this great, heart-establishing truth
is evidently revealed in Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi>
23. 43. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ou have Christs promise <hi>Iohn
14. 3. I will come and receive you to my self.</hi>
O what a change will a few moments
make upon your condition? rouse up
dying Saint, when thy Soul is come out
a little farther; when it shall stand like
<hi>Abraham</hi> in its tent door, the Angels of
God shall soon be with it: the Souls of
the elect are as it were put out to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34349:98"/>
to nurse, and when they dye, these
Angels carry them home again to their
fathers house: if an Angel were caused
to fly swiftly to bring a Saint the answer
of his prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. How much
more will the Angels come post from
Heaven to receive and transfer the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul it self?</p>
            <p>4. Arg. Farther, <hi>It may much conduce
to thy willingness to dye, to consider; that by
death God oft times hides his people out of
the way of all temptations and troubles upon
earth.</hi> Rev. 14. 13. <hi>Write, from henceforth
blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord.</hi>
Tis Gods usual way, when some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
calamities are coming upon the
world, to set his people out of harms way
before hand, <hi>Isai. 57. 1. Merciful men
are taken away from the evil to come.</hi> So
<hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 1, 2. When such an evil time
comes as is there described: <hi>That they all
lye in wait for blood, and every man hunts
his brother with a net:</hi> before that, God by
an act of favour houses his people before
hand, dost thou know what evil may be
in the earth, which thou art so loath to
leave? thy God removes thee for thy great
advantage, thou art disbanded by death,
and called off the field; other poor Saints
must stand to it, and endure a great fight
of afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:34349:99"/>
Tis observed that <hi>Methusala</hi> dyed the
very year before the flood, <hi>Augustin</hi> a
little before the sacking of <hi>Hippo. Paereus</hi>
just before the taking of <hi>Heidelberg: Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
observes that all the Apostles dyed
before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and
<hi>Luther</hi> himself before the wars brake out
in <hi>Germany:</hi> it may be the Lord sees thy
tender heart cannot endure to see the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
or bear the temptations that are
coming, and therefore will now gather
thee to thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in peace: and yet wilt
thou cry, O spare me a little longer?</p>
            <p>5. Arg. <hi>If yet thy heart hang back, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the great advantage you will have by
death, above all that ever you enjoyed on
earth.</hi> And that (1) As to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God. (2) As to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Saints.</p>
            <p>1. For your communion with God,
the time of perfecting that is now come;
thy Soul shall shortly stand before the
face of God, and have the immediate
emanations and beamings forth of his
glory upon it, here thy Soul is remote
from God, the beams of his glory strike
it but obliquely and feebly, but shortly
it will be under the line; and there the
sun shall stand still as it did in <hi>Gibeon,</hi>
there shall be no cloudings, nor decline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34349:99"/>
of it. O how should this wrap thy
Soul with desires of being uncloathed.</p>
            <p>2. As for the injoyment of Saints,
here indeed we have fellowship with
them of the lower form; but that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
is so dissweetened by remaining
corruptions, that there is no satisfaction
in it: as it is the greatest plague that
can befall an hypocrite to live in a pure
Church, so tis the greatest vexation to
the Spirit of a Saint to live in a corrupt
and disordered Church: But when death
hath admitted you into that glorious
assembly of the Spirits of just men made
perfect, you shall have the desire of your
hearts: here you cannot fully close one
with another, yea, you cannot fully
close with your own Souls. O what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
jarrings, censurings, are here?
what perfect blessed harmony there?
in Heaven each Saint loves another as
himself, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y are altogether lovely. O

dens, from the mountains of <hi>Bether;</hi>

what heavy burdens death will ease thy

            </p>
            <p>In this Tabernacle we groan, being

how true do we find that of <hi>Theophrastue,</hi>
the Soul pays a dear rent for the tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it now lives in: but glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are clogged with no indispositions,
death is the best <hi>Physician,</hi> it will cure thee
of all diseases at once. (2) With the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
of sin, this makes us groan from
the very bowels, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. But he that
is dead is free from sin, Rom.</hi> 6. 7. Hath
justification destroyed its <hi>damning power,</hi>
and sanctification its <hi>Raigning power;</hi>
so glorification destroyes its very being
and existence. (3) We groan under temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations

nothing to leave them, but I commit
them unto thee. O Father of the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

art thou troubled for their Souls? thou

for thee to doe here, why shouldst
thou not say with <hi>David:</hi> if he have no
delight to use me any farther, here am I,
let him doe what seemeth him good: in
this world thou hast no more to doe, but
he is calling thee to an higher service
and imployment in Heaven; and what
thou wouldest doe for him here, he can
doe that by other hands.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Obj.</hi> I am not yet fully ready, I
am not as a bride compleatly adorned

            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Thy justification is compleat
already, though thy sanctification be not
so; and the way to make it so is to dye,
for till then, it will have its defects and
wants.</p>

had that, I could dye presently!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Yea, there it sticks indeed; but
then consider, that an hearty willingness
to leave all the world to be freed from
sin, and be with God, is the next way to
that desired assurance: no carnal person
was ever willing to dye upon this ground.</p>
            <p>And thus I have finished those cases
which so nearly concern the people of
God, in the several conditions of their
life, and taught them how to keep their
hearts in all. I shall next apply the
whole.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:34349:101"/>
               <head>I. Vse of Information.</head>
               <p>YOU have heard that the keeping
of the heart is the great work of a
Christian in which the very Soul and
life of Religion consists, and without
which all other duties are of no value
with God: hence then I shall infer to the
<hi>consternation</hi> of hypocrites, and formal
Professors.</p>
               <p>1. That the pains and labours which many
persons have taken in religion, is but lost la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and pains to no purpose, such as will
never turn to account.</p>
               <p>Many great services have been perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
many glorious works are wrought
by men, which yet are utterly rejected
by God, and shall never stand upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in order to an eternal acceptation,
because they took no heed to keep their
hearts with God in those duties: this is
that fatal rock upon which thousands of
vain professors split themselves eternally,
they are curious about the externals of
religion, but regardless of their hearts.
O how many hours have some Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
spent in hearing, praying, reading,
conferring? and yet as to the main end
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34349:102"/>
of religion, as good they had sate still
and done nothing: for all this signifies
nothing, the great work, I mean heart
work; being all the while neglected:
tell me thou vain professor, when didst
thou shed a teare for the deadness, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
unbelief, or earthliness of thy heart?
thinkst thou, such an easie religion can
save thee? if so, we may invert Christs
words, and say, wide is the gate, and
broad is the way, that leadeth to life; and
many there be that goe in thereat: hear
me thou self deluding hypocrit, thou that
hast put of God with hartless duties, thou
that hast acted in religion as if thou hadst
been blessing an Idol, that could not
search, and discover thy heart: thou that
hast offered to God but the skin of the
sacrifice, not the marrow, fat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of it; how wilt thou abide the
coming of the Lord? how wilt thou hold
up thy head before him when he shall
say, O thou dissembling false hearted
man? how couldst thou profess religion?
with what face couldst thou so often tell
me, thou lovedst me, when thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

that thine heart was not with me? O
tremble to think, what a fearful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is to be given over to a heedless
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34349:102"/>
and careless heart: and then to have
religious duties in stead of a rattle to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and still the Conscience!</p>
               <p>2. Hence I also infer for the <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
even of upright hearts, <hi>that unless
the people of God spend more time and pains
about their hearts then generally and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
they do, they are never like to do God
much service, or be owners of much comfort
in this World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may say of that Christian that is
remiss and careless in keeping his heart,
as <hi>Iacob</hi> said of <hi>Reuben, Thou shalt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel:</hi>
It grieves me to see how many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
there are that go up and down
dejected and complaining, that live at a
poor low rate; both of service and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and how can they expect it should
be otherwise as long as they live at such
a careless rate? O how little of their
time is spent in the closet, in searching,
humbling, and quickning their hearts?</p>
               <p>You say, your hearts are dead; and
doe you wonder they are so as long as
you keep them not with the fountain
of life? if your bodies had been diated as
your Souls have been, they would have

things have eaten up the time and

these unfruitful questions, how
have they rendred the Churches? wasted
time and spirits, and called Christians off
from their main business, from looking
to their own vineyard? what think you
Sirs? had it not been better if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34349:103"/>
ventilated among the people of
God of late days, had been such as these?
how shall a man discern the special, from
the common operations of the Spirit?
how may a Soul discern its first decline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
from God? how may a backsliding
Christian recover his first love? how
may the heart be preserved from unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
thoughts in duty? how may a
bosome sin be discovered and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
&amp;c. Would not this have tended
more to the credit of religion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of your Souls? O tis time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and be ashamed of this folly! when
I read what <hi>Suarez</hi> a <hi>Papist</hi> said, who
wrote many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tomes of disputations, that
he prised the time he set apart for the
searching and examining of his heart,
in reference to God, above all the time
that ever he spent in other studies: I am
ashamed to find the professors of this age
yet insensible of their folly: shall the
Conscience of a <hi>Suarez</hi> feel a relenting
pang for strength and time so ill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
and shall not yours? this is it your
Ministers long since warned you of:
your spiritual nurses were afraid of the

contentions, into practical godliness.
(2) Another cause of neglecting our
heart hath been earthly incumbrances:
the heads and hearts of many have been
filled with such a crowd and noise of
worldly business, that they have sadly
and sensibly declined and withered in
their zeal, love and delight in God, in
their heavenly, serious, and profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>O how hath this wilderness intangled

I have lost, how many sweet
motions, and admonitions of the Spirit
I have posted over unfruitfully, and
made the Lord to speak in vain, in the
secret illapses of his Spirit, the Lord hath
called upon me, but my worldly thoughts
did still lodge within me, and there was
no place in my heart for such calls of
God. surely there is a way of injoying
God, even in our worldly imployments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

yet be filling both our heads and hearts
with trifles.</p>
               <p>3. Hence also I infer for the <hi>awakening</hi>
of all, <hi>that if the keeping of the heart be the
great work of a Christian, then there are but
few real Christians in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, if every one that hath learned
the dialect of Christianity, and can talke

then is great.</p>
               <p>But alas! to what a small number will
they shrink, if you judge them by this
rule! how few are there, that make
Conscience of keeping their hearts,
watching their thoughts, judging their
ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O there be but few closet men
among professors! tis far easier for men
to be reconciled to any duties in religion
then to these: the prophane part of the
world will not so much as touch with
the outside of religious duties, much less
to this: and for the hypocrit though he
be polite and curious about those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals,
yet you can never perswade him
to this inward work, this difficult work:
this work to which there is no induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by humane applause, this work
that would quickly discover what the

a general consent, this heart work is left
to the hands of a few secret ones and I

thee; all that I beg for is but this, that
thou wouldst step aside a little oftner to
talk with God, and thine own heart,
that thou wouldst not suffer every trifle
to divert thee, that thou wouldest keep

thoughts and affections: that thou
wouldst but seriously demand of thine

heart where hast thou been to day? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hast thou made a rode to day? if all
that hath been said by way of inducc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

motives to offer you: and the first is
this.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Motive.</hi> The studying, observing, and

help your understanding in the deep

               <p>An honest well experienced heart is a

will serve you in stead of a <hi>Commentary</hi>
upon a great part of the Scriptures: by

a man may discourse orthodoxly and

profoundly of the nature and effects of
faith, the troubles and comforts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
the sweetness of Communion
with God, that never felt the efficacy and
sweet impressions of these things upon
his own spirit: but O how dark and dry
are these notions, compared with his, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whose heart they have been acted?
when such a man reads <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms,
or <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, there he finds his own
objections made and answered: O saith

in ordinances and more secret du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
is the indisposedness of the heart: a

gets the start of all others that come with
him in that duty: they are tugging hard
to get up their hearts to God, now try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this argument upon them and then
that, to quicken and affect them, and
sometimes goe away as bad as they
came. Sometimes the duty is almost
ended before their hearts begin to stirr
to feel any warmth, quickning, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from it: but all this while the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
heart is at its work; this is he that
ordinarily gets the first sight of Christ
in a Sermon: the first seal from Christ in
a Sacrament: the first kiss from Christ
in secret prayer. I tell you, and I tell
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34349:108"/>
you but what I have felt, that Prayers
and Sermons would appear to you other
manner of things then they doe, did you
but bring better ordered hearts unto
them, you would not goe away dejected
and drooping, O this hath been a lost
day, a lost duty to me, if you had not
lost your hearts it might not be so: if then
the comfort of ordinances be sweet, look
to your hearts, keep your hearts.</p>

hearts would be a Fountain of matter to you in

               <p>A man that is diligent in heart work,
and knows the state of his own Soul;
will have a fountain fulness of matter
to supply him richly in all his addresses
to God: his tongue shall not faulter, and
make pauses for want of matter, <hi>Psal.
45. 1. my heart is enditing a good matter:</hi>
or as <hi>Montanus</hi> renders the original, my
heart is boyling up good matter, like a
living spring that is still bubling up fresh
water; and then my tongue is as the
pen of a ready writer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others must pump
their memories, rack their inventions,

with thee (as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks in another case)
like bottles full of new wine, that want
vent, which are ready to burst: as holy
matter flows plentifully, so more feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
and sweetly from such a heart:
when a heart experienced Christian is
mourning before God over some special
heart corruption, wrastling with God
for the supply of some special inward
want, he speaks not as other men doe,
that have learned to pray by rote, their
confessions and petitions are squeezed
out, his drop freely like pure honey from
the combe, tis a happiness then to be
with or neer such a Christian. I remember
<hi>Bernard</hi> having given rules to prepare
the heart for prayer concludes them thus,

then remember me.</p>

no more with a name to live, being spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually

of frothy, vain, and unserious
persons, but the majestick beams of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
shining from their heavenly, and
serious conversations shall awe the world,
and command reverence from all that
are about them: when they shall warm
the hearts of those that come nigh them,
so that men shall say, God is in these
men of a truth.</p>
               <p>Well, such a time may again be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected

O professors! if ever you will keep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
sweet, if ever you hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the credit of it in the world, keep
your hearts: either keep your hearts, or
lose your credit: keep your hearts or
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34349:111"/>
lose your comforts: keep your hearts,
least ye shed Soul bloud: what words
can express the deep concernments, the
wonderful consequences of this work!
every thing puts a necessity, a solemnity,
a beauty upon it.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Mot.</hi> An heart well kept will fit you
for any condition God casts you into, or any
service he hath to use you in.</p>
               <p>He that hath learnt how to keep his
heart lowly, is fit for prosperity: and he
that knows how to use and apply to it
Scripture promises, and supports, is fit
to pass through any adversity: he that
can deny the pride and selfishness of his
heart is fit to be imployed in any service
for God: such a man was <hi>Paul,</hi> he did
not only spend his time in preaching to
others, in keeping others vineyards, but
he lookt to himself, kept his own vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
1 <hi>Cor. 9. 27. Least when I have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to others, I my self should be a cast away:</hi>
and what an eminent instrument was he
for God, he could turn his hand to any
work, he could dexterously manage
both an adverse and prosperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
I know how to abound, and how
to suffer want; let the people deifie him,
it moves him not, unless to indignation:
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34349:111"/>
Let them stone him, he can bear it: <hi>if
a man purge himself from these</hi> (saith he
2 <hi>Tim. 2. 21.) He shall be a Vessel unto
honour, sanctified and meet for the masters
use, and prepared unto every good work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First the heart must be purged; and
then tis prepared for any service of God:
when the heart of <hi>Isaiah</hi> was purified,
which was the thing signified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the
touching of his lips with a coal from the
Altar, <hi>Isai.</hi> 6. 7. then he was fit for Gods
work: <hi>here am I, send me,</hi> v. 8. a man
that hath not learned to keep his heart,
put him upon any service for God, and
if it be attended with honour, it shall
swell up and overtop his spirit: if with
suffering it will exanimate and sink
him.</p>
               <p>Jesus Christ had an instrumental fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for his fathers work above all the
servants that ever God imployed, he
was zealous in publick work for God, so
zealous, that sometimes he forgat to eat
bread, yea, that his friends thought he
had been besides himself: but yet he so
carried on his publick work, as not to
forget his own private communion with
God; and therefore you read in <hi>Matth.</hi>
14. 23. that when he had been labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34349:112"/>
all day yet after that, he went up to a
mountain apart to pray, and was there
alone. O let the keepers of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
look to their own vineyard! we
shall never be so instrumental to the
good of others, as when we are most
diligent about our own Souls.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Mot.</hi> If the people of God would more
diligently keep their hearts, how exceedingly
would the communion of Saints be thereby
sweetned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>How goodly then would be thy tents
O <hi>Iacob,</hi> and thy tabernacles O <hi>Israel!</hi>
then as tis prophesied of the Jews, <hi>Zech.
8. 23. Men would say, we will go with you,
for we have heard that God is among you.</hi>
Tis the fellowship your Souls have with
the Father and with the Son, that draws
out the desires of others after fellowship
with you. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 3. I tell you if Saints
would be perswaded to take more pains,
and spend more time about their hearts;
there would quickly be such a divine
lustre upon the face of their coversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that men would account it no
small priviledge, to be with or near
them.</p>
               <p>Tis the pride, passion, and earthliness
of our hearts that hath spoiled Christian
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34349:112"/>
fellowship: whence is it? that when
Christians meet, they are often jarring
and contending, but only their unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
passions: whence are their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
censures of their brethren, but
only from self ignorance? why are they
so rigid, and unmerciful towards those
that are fallen? but because they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not themselves, as the Apostle speaks
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. why is their discourse so fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and unprofitable when they meet?
is not this from the earthliness and vanity
of their hearts?</p>
               <p>My brethren, these be the things that
have spoiled Christian fellowship, and
made it become a dry and sapless thing;
so that many Christians are even weary
of it, and are ready to say with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ier. 9. 2. O that I had a Cottage in
the wilderness, &amp;c. That I might leave my
people and go from them!</hi> and with <hi>David</hi>
Psal. 120. 6. <hi>My soul hath long dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them that hate peace:</hi> This hath made them
long for the grave, that they might goe
from them that are not their own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to them that are their own people,
as the original of that text imports,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
               <p>But now, if professors would study
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34349:113"/>
their own hearts more, watch and keep
them better, all this would be prevented;
and the beauty and glory of communion
again restored: they would divide no
more, contend no more, censure rashly
no more; when their hearts are in tune
their tongues will not jarre, how chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
pitiful and tender will they be one
of another, when every one is daily
humbled under the evil of his own heart;
Lord hasten those much desired daies,
and bless these counsels in order to
them.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Mot.</hi> Lastly, By this the comforts
of the Spirit, and precious influences of all
Ordinances would be fixed, and much longer
preserved in your Souls than now they are.</p>
               <p>Ah! what would I give, that my Soul
might be preserved in that frame I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
find it after an Ordinance! <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quandò
intromittis me domine in affectium

(saith one of the fathers sweetly) thou
admittest me into the most inward, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
and sweet delights, to I know not
what sweetness, which were it perfected
in me, I know not what it would be;
or rather, what it would not be. But
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34349:113"/>
alas! the heart grows careless <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and quickly returns, like water removed
from the fire to its native coldness:
could you but keep those things for ever
in your hearts, what Christians would
you be! what lives would you live! and
how is it that these things remain no
longer with us? doubtless it is because
we suffer our hearts to take cold again:
we should be as careful after an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
or duty to prevent this, as one that
comes out of an hot bath, or great sweat
is; of going out into the chill air: we
have our hot and cold fits by turns, and
what is the reason but our unskilfulness
and carelesness in keeping the heart.</p>
               <p>Tis a thousand pities, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God, as to their quickning
and comforting effects, should be like
those humane ordinances the Apostle
speaks of, that perish in the using. O
then, let me say to you, as <hi>Iob. 15. 11.
Doe the consolations of God seem small to
you?</hi> Look over these ten special benefits,
weigh them in a just ballance; are they
small matters? is it a small matter to
have thy weak understanding assisted?
thine endangered Soul antidoted, thy
sincerity cleered, thy communion with
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34349:114"/>
God sweetned, thy sails filled in prayer,
is it a small thing to have the decayed

               <head>IV. Vse for Consolation.</head>
               <p>I Shall now close the whole with a
word or two of consolation to all
dilligent and serious Christians, that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and closely ply heart work; that
are groaning and weeping in secret over
the hardness, pride, earthliness and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of their hearts, that are fearing and
trembling over the experienced deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
and falsness of them, whilest
other vain professors eyes are abroad,
their time and strength eaten up by fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
disputes, and earthly imployments;
or at best by a cold and formal perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of some heartless and empty du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
poor Christian, I have three things
to offer thee in order to thy support and
comfort, and doubtless either of them
alone mixed with faith is sufficient to
comfort thee over all the trouble thou
hast with thine own heart.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Comfort.</hi> This argues thy heart to
be upright and honest, what ever thy other
gifts and abillities are.</p>
               <p>Tis uprightness of heart will comfort
thee upon a death-bed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 2, 3.

Then he turned his face to the wall and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Lord, saying, remember now O
Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth,
and with a perfect heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I am really of his mind who said, <hi>si

would prefer the most despicable and
sordid work of a rustick Christian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the victories and triumphs of
<hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Cesar.</hi> Yea, let me adde,
before all the elaborated duties and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
gifts of vain professors: before
the tongues of men and Angels: it will
signifie more to my comfort to spend one
solitary hour in mourning before the
Lord over heart corruption, then many
hours in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a seeming zealous, but really
dead performance of common duties
with the greatest inlargements and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
embellishments of parts and gifts.</p>
               <p>By this very thing Christ distinguishes
the formal and serious Christian, <hi>Matth.</hi>
6. 5. The one is for the street and Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
for the observation and applause
of men, but the other is a closet man:
he drives on a home trade, a heart trade:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34349:119"/>
never be troubled then for the want of
those things that a man may have and be
eternally damned, but rather bless God
for that which none but the favorites,
and darlings of heaven have: many a
one is now in hell that had a better head
then thine, and many a one now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that complained of as bad an heart
as thine.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Com.</hi> Know farther for thy comfort,
that God would never leave thee under so
many heart troubles and burdens, if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not thy real benefit thereby.</p>
               <p>Thou art often crying out, Lord why
is it thus, why goe I mourning all the day,
having sorrow in my heart, thus long I
have been exercised with hardness of
heart, and to this day have not obtained
a broken heart; many years have I
been praying and striving against vain
thoughts, yet am still infested and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with them. O when shall I get
a better heart! I have been in travel, and
brought forth but wind, I have obtained
no deliverance, neither have the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of my heart fallen. I have brought
this heart many times to prayers, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Sacraments, expecting and hoping
for a cure from them, and still my sore
runneth and ceaseth not.</p>

Pensive Soul, let this comfort thee,
thy God designs thy benefit, even by
these occasions of thy sad complaints;
For (1.) Hereby he would let thee see
what thy heart by Nature is and was,
and therein take notice how much thou
art beholding to free-Grace: He leaves
thee under these exercises of Spirit, that
thou mayest lye as with thy face upon
the ground, admiring that ever the Lord
of Glory should take such a Toad; so vile
a Creature into his bosome: thy base
heart, if it be good for nothing else; yet
serves to commend and set off, the
unsearchable riches of Free-Grace. (2.)
This serves to beat thee off continually
from resting, yea, or but glancing upon
thine own righteousness, or excellency:
the corruption of thy heart, working in
all thy duties, makes thee sensible to
feel that the bed is too short, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
too narrow: Were it not for
those reflections thou hast after duties,
upon the dulness and distractions of
thine heart in them; how apt wouldst
thou be to fall in love with, and admire
thy own Performances, and Inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
For if notwithstanding these, thou
hast much to do with the pride of thy
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34349:120"/>
heart; how much more, if such humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and self-abasing considerations were
wanting. And lastly this tends to make
thee the more compassionate and tender
towards others, Perhaps thou wouldst
have little pity for the distresses, and soul
troubles of others, if thou hadst less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of thine own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Com.</hi> 3. To conclude, God will shortly
put a blessed end to all these troubles, cares,
and watchings.</p>
               <p>The time is coming when thy heart
shall be as thou wouldst have it, when
thou shalt be discharged of these cares,
fears and sorrows, and never cry out:
Oh my hard, my proud, my vain, my
earthly heart any more: when all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall be banished from thine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and thou shalt clearly discover
all truths in God, that chrystal Ocean
of truth: when all vanity shall be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
perfectly out of thy thoughts, and
they be everlastingly, ravishingly, and
delightfully entertained and exercised
upon that supream Goodness, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
excellency of God, from whom
they shall never start any more like a

for ever: when thou shalt lay down thy
weapons, of prayers, tears, and groans,
and put on the Armour of light, not to
fight, but to triumph in.</p>
               <p>Lord, when shall this blessed day
come? How long? How long? Holy
and True; My soul waiteth for thee;
