            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To all that truly wish <hi>Jeruſalem's</hi> Proſperity and <hi>Babylons</hi> Deſtruction; <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding</hi> be multiplyed upon you.</head>
            <p>IN theſe dayes, if ever, that is true which the Wiſeman ſaid, <hi>Eccl. 12.12. There is no end in making many books, and much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is a wearineſs to the fleſh:</hi> yet conſidering how heinous it is in the ſight of the Lord to force men and women by cruel Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, to bring their bodies to a Worſhip whereunto they cannot bring their ſpirits; we thought it our duty for Gods Glory, and the reformation thereof in this our own Nation, to publiſh this little Writing following, wherein is manifeſtly proved <hi>by the Law of God, the Law of our Land,</hi> and <hi>his Majeſties own divers Teſtimonies,</hi> That no man ought to be perſecuted for his Religion, be it true of falſe, ſo he teſtifie his faithful Allegiance to the King. What ſhall men do ſtriving about matters of Religion till this be ended? For, if this be a truth, that the Kings of the Earth have power from God to compel by Perſecution all their Subjects to believe as they believe, then wicked is it to reſiſt, and the Perſecutions of ſuch is juſtly upon them, and the Magiſtrates that execute the ſame are clear from their blood, and it is upon their own heads: but if the Kings of the Earth have not power from God to compel by Perſecution any of their Subjects to believe as they believe <hi>(ſeeing Faith is the work of God)</hi> then no leſſe wicked is it in the ſight of God to diſobey, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of ſuch are upon the Magiſtrates, and the blood of the Perſecuted cryeth unto the Lord, and will be required at the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates hands.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in all humility, reverence and loyalty we do humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of our Sovereign Lord the King, and all Gods Miniſters under him, as Judges, Juſtices of Peace, &amp;c. by whom this Perſecution is executed, themſelves to conſider, not whether herein they pleaſe Lord Biſhops, but whether they pleaſe the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who after a little while ſhall judge all Judges according to their works, without respect of perſons, and therefore are commanded to <hi>kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and they periſh in the way,</hi> Pſal. <hi>2.</hi> Our
<pb facs="tcp:47807:3"/>humble deſire is, that they would conſider what is teſtified in the Scriptures; That <hi>the Kings of the Earth ſhall give their power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Beaſt, till the words of God be fulfilled; then ſhall they take their power from her.</hi> If it be granted (as it is) that the Kings of this Nation formerly have given their power unto that Romiſh Beaſt, it ſhall evidently appear that our Lord the King, and all Magiſtrates under him, do give their power to the ſame Beaſt, though the Beaſt be in another ſhape: For, as that ſpiritual Power or Beaſt of <hi>Rome</hi> ſets up a Worſhip (as they pretend) for God, and force all thereto by cruel Perſecutions, the Kings of the Earth giving their Power thereunto; So this ſpiritual Power, or Beaſt of <hi>England,</hi> ſets up a Worſhip (as they pretend) for God, and force all thereto by cruel Perſecutions, the Kings Majeſty giving his Power hereunto. Oh that all that are in Authority would but conſider by the Word of God (which ſhall judge them at the laſt day) what they do, when they force men againſt their ſouls and conſciences to diſſemble to believe as they believe, or as the King and State believe, they would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their hands and hearts therefrom, and never do as they have done, partly through inconſideration, and partly to pleaſe Lord Biſhops being in favour with the King.</p>
            <p>It cannot but with high thankfulneſs to God, and to the King, be acknowledged of all, that the Kings Majeſty is no blood-thirſty man, for if he were, bodily deſtruction ſhould be the portion of all that fear God, and endeavour to walk in his wayes, as may be ſeen in the primitive time of this ſpiritual Power, or Beaſt of <hi>England,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that K. <hi>Henry the eight</hi> had cast off the Romiſt Beaſt and ſince (ſo far as leave hath been granted them) by hanging, burning, baniſhing, impriſoning, and what not, as the particulars might be named. Yet our moſt humble deſire of our Lord the King, is, That he would not give his Power to force his faithful Subjects to diſſemble to believe as he believes, in the leaſt meaſure of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; though it is no ſmall Perſecution to lye many years in filthy Priſons, in hunger, cold, idleneſs, divided from Wife, Family, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, left in continual miſeries and temptations, ſo as Death would be to many leſs Perſecution; ſeeing his Majeſty confeſſeth, that <hi>to change the mind muſt be the work of God.</hi> And of the Lord Biſhops we deſire, that they would a little leave off perſecuting thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:47807:3"/>that cannot believe as they, till they have proved that God is well-pleaſed therewith, and the ſouls of ſuch as ſubmit are in ſafety from Condemnation; let them prove this, and we proteſt we will for ever ſubmit unto them, and ſo will thouſands: and therefore if there be any ſpark of grace in them, let them ſet themſelves to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either by word or writing, or both. But if they will not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their cruel-courſes as they have done, let them yet remember that they muſt come to Judgment, and have their Abominations ſet in order before them, and be torn in pieces when none ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
            <p>And whereas they have no other colour of ground out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, than that they have canonized a Law, viz. <hi>That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall affirm that the Kings Majeſty hath not the ſame power over the Church that the godly Kings of</hi> Iſrael <hi>had under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let him be excommunicate</hi> ipſo facto. The unſoundneſs of which ground is manifeſted in this Dialogue following, wherein is ſhewed their palpable ignorance, in that they know not the Myſtery of God; and therefore have they made this Canon in flattery to the King, only to ſupport their Pride and Cruelty: For, if the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or <hi>Canaan</hi> now under the Gospel, be an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom or Land, or <hi>Iſrael</hi> now a worldly or fleſhly <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as both were under the Law, Then we would confeſs there ſhould be an earthly King thereof: But if the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> now be not earthly, but heavenly, <hi>Joh. 18.36.</hi> and the Iſraelites now not of this world, <hi>Joh. 15.19.</hi> Then the King thereof is not of this world, as they are not of this world, <hi>Joh. 17.16.</hi> And if theſe ſpiritual Lords confeſs that Chriſt is King now of the Land and People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but yet he hath left our Lord the King his Deputy, to make ſuch Laws and Lords over the Church as pleaſeth him; the Word of the Lord is againſt them, <hi>There is but one Lord,</hi> (<hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>12.5.</hi>) and <hi>one Law-giver</hi> (Jam. <hi>4.12.</hi>) <hi>over his Church.</hi> Nay, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty himſelf is againſt them, who ſaith, <hi>There is no earthly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch over the Church, whoſe word muſt be a Law.</hi> And ſaith further, <hi>Chriſt is his Churches Monarch, and the holy Ghoſt his Deputy,</hi> alledging Luk. <hi>22.25. The Kings of the Gentiles bear rule one over another, &amp;c. but it ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further, <hi>Chriſt when he aſcended, left not</hi> Peter <hi>with them to
<pb facs="tcp:47807:4"/>direct them in all truth, but promiſed to ſend the holy Ghoſt to them for that end, &amp;c.</hi> If any will be rebellious againſt the Word of the Lord herein, yet let them not be rebellious againſt the word of the King. Oh that any thing would prevail with them to make them leave off theſe cruel courſes, of perſecuting poor ſouls that deſire truly to fear God, and are moſt faithful Subjects to the King, and deſire alſo the ſalvation of the ſouls of theſe their cruel Perſecrutors, who do ſeek their utter undoing by all the fore-named Perſecutions, only becauſe they cannot of faith offer up ſuch Worſhip to God as theſe ſpiritual Lords command; and the rather let them leave off perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, ſeeing the Kings Majeſty acknowledgeth, <hi>It is a ſure Rule in Divinity, That God loves not to plant his Church by Violence and Bloodſhed.</hi> And if it be a Law for all Chriſtians, That in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things one must not offend another, but the ſtrong to forbear rather than offend his weak brother; otherwiſe he <hi>wounds the weak conſcience, and ſins againſt Chriſt, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>8.</hi> Then how much leſs hath any man power to be Lord over the weak conſcience, forcing it to practiſe that it hath not faith in, bringing it thereby unto ſin, and unto condemnation, <hi>Rom. 14.</hi> We do unfainedly acknowledge the Authority of earthly Magiſtrates, God's bleſſed Ordinance, and that all earthly Authority and Command appeartains unto them; let them command what they will, we muſt obey, either to do or ſuffer upon pain of Gods displeaſure, beſides their puniſhment: But all men must let God alone with his Right, which is to be Lord and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to the ſoul, and not command obedience for God where he commandeth none. And this is onely that which we dare not but maintain upon the peril of our ſouls, which is greater than bodily affliction: And only for the maintenance of Chriſts right herein, do falſe Prophets and Deceivers (who by that craft are cloathed in fine apparrel, and fare deliciouſly every day) labour to make us odious in the ears and eyes of Prince and People, knowing well that if they had not power by Perſecution to force men to diſſemble to believe as they, their kingdom and gain would ſoon come to nought; the wickedneſs of which courſe is diſcovered in this Writing following.</p>
            <p>For the manner, being Dialogue-wiſe, we thought it the fitteſt in two respects: Firſt, for the underſtanding of the ſimple, to whom eſpecially Gods Myſteries appertain, more than to the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb facs="tcp:47807:4"/>of the world. Secondly, Becauſe all the Objections that we have met with, might be ſet down, and the plainlyer anſwered. And becauſe we have faith and aſſurance that many will ſee and acknowledge the unlawfulneſs of tyrannizing over the Conſcience, by perſecuting the bodies of ſuch as cannot be ſubject, We have alſo though it meet to manifeſt the fearful eſtate of ſuch ſubjection, that they may deliver their ſouls, if they will be ſaved: and alſo have ſet down the beginning of that old and good way, that <hi>John Baptiſt, Chriſt Jeſus</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have left unto all that will be ſaved unto the end of the world. Beſeeching that Almighty worker, that he would work in the hearts and conſciences of men, that they may enquire for it, and that out of the Scriptures, and walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; then ſhall they find Rest unto their ſouls, although Afflictions to their bodies. Oh it is time for the Lord to work, for they have deſtroyed his Law, and have ſet up in many Nations ſuch Worſhip for God as beſt pleaſeth them that are in Authority, and have power to perſecute the contrary-minded. Let all Gods People cry, How long Lord? when wilt thou come to deſtroy Antichrists cruel King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and eſtabliſh Christs meek and peaceable Kingdom? As thou hast begun, even come Lord Jeſus by the Spirit of thy Mouth, and the Brightneſs of thy Coming, even come quickly. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>Then this is your Argument, The Learned do not erre, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be obeyed. The Biſhops and the reſt of that rank are learned, and do not erre, and therefore they muſt be obeyed. Another Argument as vain as they may be collected from this ground: The Learned do not erre, and therefore muſt be obeyed. The Pope and the reſt of that rank are learned, (yea, as learned as yours) and do not erre, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt be obeyed. The one is as true as the other, but both abominable. If you prove, that they that want this Learning, muſt not meddle with the wayes of God but as theſe learned men teach them, then indeed you ſay ſomething; but if you cannot, as moſt certain it is

               <p>Would God all men could ſee your dealing herein. This is your uſual courſe when your mouth is ſtopped by the power of Gods Word that you know not what to anſwer, then you run to the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſo make your matters good, like unto your predeceſſors the wicked Scribes and Phariſees, who when our Lord and Maſter had ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their mouthes that they had no word of anſwer, then they ſought to make him a treſpaſſer againſt Caeſar; but I have learned in ſome weak meaſure, that as there is a Caeſar unto whom in conſcience I muſt be obedient, So there is another King, <hi>one JESUS,</hi> that is King of kings; unto whom if you will not be obedient, in <hi>giving unto God that which is Gods, He will tear you in pieces, when there ſhall be none that can deliver you, and cast you into the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for evermore, where there ſhall be no reſt day nor night;</hi> and therefore <hi>agree with this your adverſary quickly, whilſt you are in the way with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Power and Authority of the King is earthly, and God hath commanded me <hi>to ſubmit to every Ordinance of man,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. and therefore I have faith to ſubmit to what Ordinance of Man ſoever the King commands, if it be an humane Ordinance, and not againſt the manifeſt Word of God, let him require what he will, I muſt in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence obey him, with my body, goods, and all that I have: But my ſoul, wherewith I am to worſhip God, that belongeth to another King, <hi>whoſe Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> Joh. 18.36. <hi>Whoſe People muſt come wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Whoſe weapons are not carnal, but ſpiritual,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>VVhat Authority can any mortal man require more, than of body, goods, life, and all that appertaineth to the outward man? The <hi>heart God requireth,</hi> Prov. 23.26. He commanded <hi>to give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and to Himſelf the things that are His,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47807:7"/>Luk. 20.25. Now if all the outward man be Caeſars, and the inward man too, ſo that he muſt be obeyed is his own matters, and in God's matters alſo, then tell us what ſhall be given to God? If you, or any man, will give him more Power or Authority than I give him, then you give him more than his Majeſty requireth, as ſhall be ſhewed.</p>

Let it well be here obſerved, that you make the King a commander of ſuch worſhip as is not to God, contrary to his Majeſties own mind, manifeſt in his Writings. But this you do, not to advance Gods Glory, nor the Kings Honour, but your own curſed kingdom of darkneſs, which you hold by flattery and falſhood.

All that any mortal man can be, is to be a ſubject of his Kingdom; for there is but <hi>one Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.5. and <hi>one Law-giver,</hi> Jam. 3.12. And that this is ſo, his Majeſty confirmeth by his own teſtimony, in his Apology for the Oath of Allegiance, pag. 46, 47. <hi>But as I well allow of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy of the Church for diſtinction of Orders, (for ſo I underſtand it) ſo I utterly deny that there is any earthly Monarch thereof, whoſe word muſt be a Law, and who cannot erre in his ſentence by an infallibility of ſpirit: becauſe earthly Kingdoms muſt have earthly Monarchs, it doth not follow that the Church muſt have a viſible Monarch top: For the World hath not one earthly temporal Monarch; Chriſt is his Churches Monarch, and the Holy Ghoſt his Deputy. The Kings of the Gentiles reign over them, but ye ſhall not be ſo,</hi> Luk. 22.25. <hi>Chriſt did not promiſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47807:7"/>before his Aſcenſion to leave</hi> Peter <hi>with them, to direct and inſtruct them in all things; but he promiſed to ſend the Holy Ghoſt unto them for that end.</hi> Theſe are his Highneſs own words, whereby it evidently appeareth his Majeſty challengeth no ſupremacy over the Church, but laboureth to overthrow that abominable exaltation of that Man of Sin in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Profeſſion;</hi> for Chriſt hath given no Supremacy in, or over his Church to any mortal man, but expreſly commanded the contrary, as that place of <hi>Luke,</hi> mentioned by his Majeſty, plainly declareth. His Highneſs is ſupream Head and Governour over all his Subjects Bodies and Goods within his Dominions, and therein I deteſt and abhor all forreign Powers whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But now for the thing in controverſie betwixt you and me, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling men by Perſecutions to do ſervice to God (as is pretended) wherein they have not Faith: it ſhall be manifeſt not to be of God, in that Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, the only Lord and Law-giver to the ſoul, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had any ſuch Power and Authority, neither taught any ſuch thing to his Diſciples, but the contrary. Firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. <hi>All Power is given me in Heaven and in Earth; Go therefore and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> And 2 Cor. 10.4. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to caſt down ſtrong Holds, &amp;c.</hi> Here we ſee Chriſt hath no worldly power, nor worldly weapons. Secondly, He practiſed and taught the contrary. When the <hi>Samaritans</hi> would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him going to <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 9. his Diſciples would have had Fire come down from Heaven and devoured them, but Chriſt rebuked them, and ſaid, <hi>Ye know not of what ſpirit ye are of: for the Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> And the Apoſtle by the Spirit of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. commandeth the Servants of the Lord, <hi>not to ſtrive; but to be gentle towards all men, apt to teach, ſuffering the evil-men patiently; inſtructing them with meekneſs that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary-minded; proving, if God at any time will give them repentance, that they may know the truth, and come to amendment out of the Devils ſnare, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe Scriptures need no explanation for this moſt evident Truth.</p>

                  <hi>Well, yet notwithstanding all this, it is manifeſt in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the Example of the Apoſtle</hi> Peter <hi>ſmiting</hi> Ananias <hi>and</hi> Saphira <hi>to death,</hi> Act. 5. <hi>and of the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>ſtriking</hi> Elymas <hi>the Sorcerer blind,</hi> Act. 13.11. <hi>and alſo by delivering</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Alexander <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh; that puniſhment upon the body
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47807:8"/>may be uſed, and the fleſh destroyed: For if it were lawful for them to ſmite to death, and the like, though by extraordinary means, then it muſt be lawful for us by ordinary means, ſince extraordinary means now fail: If you ſay it be not lawful for us, then you muſt ſay it was not lawful for them, and that were to accuſe them of laying a falſe foundation, which none fearing God will affirm.</hi>

               <p>I dare not once admit of ſuch a thought, as to diſallow the truth of that Foundation which the Apoſtles, as skilfull Maſter-builders, have laid: But for your Argument of <hi>Peters</hi> extraordinary ſmiting of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> he neither laid hand upon them, nor threatned them by word, only declared what ſhould befall them from God; and therefore ſerveth nothing to your purpoſe. Alſo that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Elymas,</hi> he laid no hands upon him, but only declared the Lords hand upon him, and the judgment that ſhould follow. If you can ſo pronounce, and it ſo come to paſs upon any, do it, and then it may be you may be accounted Maſter-builders, and layers of a new foundation, or another Goſpel.

And this was not extraordinary, but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to continue in all Churches to the end; and not to deſtroy the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, as you teach and practiſe, but to deſtroy thoſe luſtful affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which dwell in the fleſh, that ſo the fleſh being mortified, the Spirit may be quickned, and the Soul ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus. And whereas you ſay, that as they did it by extraordinary means ſo you may do it by ordirary means: If you would uſe only thoſe weapons which Chriſt commanded his Diſciples to uſe in this buſineſs, which are not carnal, we would agree with you herein; but if your ordinary means be ſuch as Chriſt never had, nor any of his Diſciples, then it is a means of your own deviſing, for Chriſt hath all means whatſoever for bringing men to the obedience of the Truth.</p>

But that this is moſt falſe, Chriſt and his Apoſtles in his Teſtament do manifeſtly declare, as is before ſhewed. Was not <hi>Paul</hi> a Blaſphemer? yet received to mercy. But this the holy Ghoſt teacheth from Blaſphemy under the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28. <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes Law, died without mercy, under two or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47807:12"/>three Witneſſes: Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, that treadeth under foot the Son of God, and counteth the Blood of the Teſtament as an unholy thing, wherewith he was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and doth deſpite to the Spirit of Grace?</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch as had received and acknowledged the Truth, ver. 26. This is now the due proportion, an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> according to the fleſh, in the time of the Law preſumptuouſly ſinning againſt Gods Commandment, by his Command muſt die by the worldly Sword, no Sacrifice was to be offered for him: So in the New Teſtament, or time of the Goſpel, a ſpiritual <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Faith, contemptuouſly or deſpitefully ſinning againſt Chriſts Commands, which he hath formerly acknowledged, deſpiting and contemning them, by his Command muſt die by the ſpiritual Sword, no repentance to be admitted, ſeeing <hi>he crucifieth again to himſelf the Son of God, and makes a mock of him,</hi> Heb. 6.6. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> came not within this compaſs; though they ſinned of knowledge, yet they did it not contemptuouſly or deſpitefully, but through frailty. If an <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> under the Law did ought through <hi>ignorance,</hi> as <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. or through <hi>frailty,</hi> as <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. there was Sacrifice for him: So under the Goſpel, an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> doing ought through ignorance, or through frailty, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with the reſt of the Jews, mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. or the <hi>Inceſtuous Perſon,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. there is Repentance for him.

               <p>Firſt, I anſwer you: That the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had never power from God to ſet up any thing in or for the the ſervice of God, but that only which was commanded by God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. no, not ſo much as the manner of any Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.16. and 9.14. and therefore this will not ſerve your purpoſe, that Kings may ſet up within their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuch ſpiritual Lords and Laws for the ſerving of God; no, nor the manner thereof, as may beſt pleaſe themſelves, under what pretence ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; thereby making God for his Worſhip ſubject to their pleaſures. And his Majeſty acknowledgeth that <hi>Chriſts Church after the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by miracles in the primitive time, was ever after to be governed within the limits of his revealed will.</hi> Speech at Parliam. <hi>Anno</hi> 1609.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47807:12"/>Secondly, the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might compel men to the Sacrifices and Ordinances of the Old Teſtament, all which were carnal, and purged not the conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9, 10. as Circumciſion, the Paſſeover, &amp;c. But no mortal man, whatſoever he be, can compel any man to offer the Sacrifices of the New Teſtament, which are ſpiritual, and purge the conſcience, except he can beget Faith in him, and convert his ſoul. The Ordinances of the Old Teſtament were to be performed by the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, that thereby they might be taught Chriſt: but the Ordinances of the New Teſtament are to be performed only by the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to Faith, that have learned Chriſt, and have put on Chriſt, and ſo <hi>having Him, all things elſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain unto them.</hi> But one thing I demand of you, Who now is King of <hi>Iſrael?</hi>

               <p>Yes, CHRIST alone is King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſits upon <hi>Davids</hi> Throne, and therefore mark the true proportion: In the time of the Old Teſtament the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had power from God to compel all to the Ordinances of God, or to cut them off by their Sword from the earthly Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Promiſes thereof: So in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, hath power from the Father to compel all to the Ordinances of God, or to cut them off by his Sword from the heavenly Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Promiſes thereof. The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only had this power <hi>under the Law,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only hath this power under the <hi>Gospel:</hi> And therefore whoſoever will challenge this power under the Goſpel, he muſt be the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time of the Goſpel, which is peculiar only to Jeſus Chriſt, unto whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is given.</p>
               <p>And let it be here well obſerved, that by this opinion of yours you make the Kingdom and Ordinances of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Law, and the Kingdom &amp; Ordinances of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Goſpel all one; directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole Scripture: for the Kingdom and Ordinances of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Law were of this world, but the Kingdom and Ordinances of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Goſpel are not of this world, as Chriſt the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of himſelf teſtifieth, <hi>John</hi> 28. And therefore you ſetting up a worldly King over this Heavenly Kingdom and Ordinances, you and all of your Profeſſion declare your ſelves to be of that worldly Kingdom, and ſo to look for that Heavenly and Spiritual King yet to come in the fleſh; being of the number of thoſe that deny Him to be come in the fleſh, and ſo

               <p>I pray let me demand this Queſtion; Doth the King require my coming to Church to worſhip and ſerve God, or to worſhip and ſerve the King? If to worſhip and ſerve the King, I am ready to obey; if to worſhip and ſerve God, which none can do but of conſcience, the King himſelf ſaith he never intended to lay any thing to the charge of any for the cauſe of conſcience; and this coming to Church being a cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if not he, why do you lay any thing to my charge for the ſame? And therefore you wrong his Majeſty in thus affirming; for his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs requireth only my faithful allegiance to be teſtified by the aforeſaid Oath, and therefore hath ordained it, as I ſhall ſhew by his Highneſs own teſtimony. If I ſhould come to Church, and not in conſcience, but for other reſpects, as many Papiſts and other Hypocrites do, to God it were moſt abominable; and what faithfulneſs can be hoped for in ſuch towards, his Majeſties Perſon and State? Can any godly wiſe man think that he that playeth the diſſembling Hypocrite with God, that he will do leſs with men, and will not work any villany, if it were in his power? and therefore herein you compelling me by tyranny, to bring my body whereunto my ſpirit cannot be brought, you compel me to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie with God and man: for if my heart were not faithfull in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to his Majeſties Crown and Dignity, as I take God to witneſs (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I muſt be condemned or juſtified) it is, theſe courſes would rather harden my heart to work villany than otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Now for his Majeſties many Teſtimonies in his Writings, they are worthy to be recorded with thankfulneſs to the Higheſt for guiding his heart and pen to write ſuch things.</p>
               <p>In his apology for the Oath of Allegiance pag 4, he ſaith (ſpeaking of ſuch Papiſts as took the Oath of Allegiance) <hi>And I gave a good proof that I intended no Perſecution againſt them for conſcience cauſe, but only deſired to be ſecured of them for evil obedience, which for conſcience cauſe they were bound to perform.</hi> And pag. 60. (ſpeaking of <hi>Blackwel</hi> the Arch-Prieſt) he ſaith, <hi>I never intended to lay any thing to the ſaid Arch-Prieſts charge (as I have never done to any) for cauſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And pag. 127. he ſaith, <hi>Firſt, for the cauſe of their puniſhment, I do conſtantly maintain that which I ſaid in my</hi> Apology, <hi>That no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47807:17"/>man, either in my time, or in the late Queens, ever dyed here for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: for, let him be never ſo devout a Papiſt; nay, though he profeſs the ſame never ſo conſtantly, his life is in no danger by the Law, if he break not out into ſome outward act expreſly againſt the words of the Law; or plot not ſome dangerous or unlawful practice or attempt, &amp;c.</hi> Where we may ſee in ſhort what is the whole ſum that he requireth.</p>
               <p>And in his Majeſties Speech at the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1609. where he ſaith he ſheweth his Subjects his heart, he ſaith thus; <hi>I never found, that blood, and too much ſeverity, did good in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion: for, beſides, it is a ſure Rule in Divinity, that</hi> God never loves to plant his Church by violence and bloodſhed, <hi>natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may even perſwade us, and daily experience proves it true, that when men are ſeverely perſecuted for Religion, the gallantneſs of many mens ſpirits, and the wilfulneſs of their humours, rather than the juſtneſs of their cauſe makes them take a pride boldly to endure any torments, or death it ſelf, to gain thereby the reputation of Martyrdom, though but in a falſe ſhadow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A moſt undoubted Truth; which if be, (as moſt manifeſt it is by the Teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt throughout Chriſts Teſtament, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is proved) then how curſed are all the rank of you that continually break this ſure Rule of God, thus confidently acknowledge by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, planting your Church by violence and bloodſhed, forcing many thouſands againſt their conſciences to be of your Church, and to receive your Sacraments, by all the perſecutions that would follow if they do not yeeld; and thoſe that fear God more than men, and dare not yeeld, caſting them into noiſom Priſons, amongſt moſt wicked Blaſphemers of God, to the wounding of their ſouls, dividing them from their Wives, Children and Families, and from their Callings, ſome an hundred miles and more, utterly conſuming that ſubſtance they have, which ſuſtaineth the blood of them, their Wives and Children; ſeldom or never afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Releaſe, but either by yeelding to you againſt their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or elſe by conſuming their bodies to death in Priſon, Baniſhment, or the like, leaving them and their Wives to horrible temptations of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, by parting them and their Wives, and to all manner of evil, in taking them from their Callivgs, and ſo leaving them in continual Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

               <p>The Romiſh Power doth give Titles to his Miniſters, which are the Titles of God and Chriſt, as ſpiritual Lords, great Biſhop, and many more. This ſpiritual Power doth the like, as all know.</p>
               <p>The Romiſh Power doth ſet up Lords over their Brethren in ſpiritual things, unto whom they command Honour, and great Livings to be given, great Pomp and Pride. This Power doth the like, as all know.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to ſpeak of this, in that all Books are full, and all Conſciences (except thoſe that are ſeared with hot irons) convinced hereof.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47807:18"/>Lord ſaith, <hi>If I be your Maſter, where is my fear? if a Father, where is mine honour or worſhip?</hi> Mal. 1.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the Scripture ſpeaketh ſometimes of cruel men in power and authority; as <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.31, 32. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. Sometimes of a blaſphemous Spiritual Power exerciſed by men, received of the Dragon exalting it ſelf above God, making war with the Saints, and overcoming them; and that hath power over every Kindred, and Tongue, and Nation, ſo that all that dwell upon the Earth worſhip him, &amp;c. And this is the Beaſt here ſpoken of, even that Spiritual Power of Juriſdiction of <hi>Rome,</hi> which firſt wrought in a myſtery, and by degrees was exalted, till at laſt it was exalted to this cruel Beaſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.1, &amp;c. which Beaſt openeth his mouth to Blaſphemy againſt God, ſaying and practizing, that the Commandments that God hath given for his Service, are not to be regarded, but inſtead thereof, ſetteth up Commands of his own, unto which whoſoever will not be ſubject, Excommunication and all cruelty, even unto Death, will enſue, yea even with Gunpowder ere it fail: and for this his cruelty he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By <hi>Image</hi> is meant any form, ſhape ſimilitude, or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the thing ſpoken of, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.15, 16, <hi>&amp;c. Exod.</hi> 20.4. ſo that whereſoever ſuch a ſpiritual power is, as this above deſcribed, there is the Beaſts Image, <hi>as in England:</hi> the like Power or Beaſt to the firſt, is not to be found under the Heavens, in exaltation and cruelty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By <hi>Mark,</hi> is meant Profeſſion or Practice, whereby we are know from others, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.20.1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. As Badges of Marks do put difference between this mans and that mans, in cattel or ſervants, as by ſuch a mans Mark we know theſe are his Sheep, and by ſuch a mans Badg we know this man belongeth to ſuch a great man: ſo they are ſaid to have put on Chriſt, that have received his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. even as a ſervant is known by putting on his Livery.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Forehead</hi> or <hi>Hand;</hi> the holy Ghoſt uſeth that phraſe from the Old Teſtament, where Gods People were commanded, not only to lay up his Commands in their hearts and in their ſouls, but to <hi>bind them for a ſign upon their hands, that they might be as frontlets between their eyes,</hi> Deut. 11.18. and 6.6, 8. the Wiſdom of God therein teaching, that the Forehead and Hand are the apparanteſt parts of the body, to the view of all men: ſo that to receive the Mark in the <hi>Forehead</hi> or <hi>Hand,</hi> is to make manifeſt Profeſſion of him we obey. The ſum of all which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47807:19"/>is, that whoſoever openly profeſſeth obedience and ſubjection to that ſpiritual cruel power of <hi>Rome, the Beaſt,</hi> or to that ſpiritual cruel pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>England, his Image,</hi> (whereſoever they or either of them are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted) ſuch a one, and ſuch perſons <hi>ſhall drink of the Wine of Gods wrath, and be tormented in fire and brimstone, and ſhall have no reſt day nor night for evermore.</hi>

               <p>Thoſe Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt are moſt of them not worth information, becauſe for the moſt part they are ſuch as do with an high hand ſin after enlightning, having forſaken the way wherein they walked, becauſe they would not bear Chriſts Croſs; but in that ſome ſimple ſouls may be ſeduced by them, let us a little in general compare their Opinion with the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>True it is, that Religion ſtandeth not only in outward things, for God requireth the heart, and truth in the inward parts: but that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not our ſubjection (upon fearful puniſhments) to thoſe outward Ordinances which he requireth, is a doctrine of Devils, as I ſhall prove.</p>
               <p>And firſt, for the outward Ordinances of the Old Teſtament, which were meerly ſhadows, and now are <hi>beggerly rudiments,</hi> Gal. 4.16. what indignation the Lord had towards them that tranſgreſſed. <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> offering ſtrange fire, which the Lord hath not commanded, <hi>a fire went out from the Lord and deſtroyed them,</hi> Levit. 10.1, 2.

King <hi>Saul</hi> likewiſe offering up Incenſe (in time of need as he thought) the Lord rent his Kingdom from him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47807:19"/>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. as alſo for his diſobedience afterwards, touching the fat of the Amalecks Cattel, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. How often was the wrath of the Lord poured down upon them Iſraelites, becauſe of their tranſgreſſion of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances, in place, perſon, and things? for it was a Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.3, 4. <hi>That who ſo brought not his Sacrifice to the place,</hi> viz. <hi>to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, but offered it up other where, blood ſhould be imputed to that man, and he ſhould be cut off from among his People:</hi> yea, <hi>ſuch Sacrifices were eſteemed of God, as offered to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> ver. 7. And the Lord cauſed them to pronounce, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26.) <hi>Curſed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this Law, to do them: and all the people muſt ſay, So be it.</hi> Was God thus jealous of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Ordinances, and is he leſs jealous of <hi>Chriſts?</hi> Muſt he dye that deſpiſeth <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and ſhall he eſcape that deſpiſeth Chriſts, upon what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſoever? And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It becometh him, and all his, to fulfil all Righteouſneſs in outward Ordinances, as waſhing with water,</hi> Mat. 3.15. And, <hi>whoſoever ſaith, he knoweth God, and keepeth not his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> (which are outward, aſwell as inward) <hi>he is a lyar,</hi> 1 Job. 2.4. And <hi>whoſoever breaks the leaſt Commandment, and teacheth men ſo, he ſhall be, called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.19. And <hi>whoſoever will not hear that Prophet</hi> (Chriſt Jeſus) <hi>in all things that he ſhall ſay unto them, ſhall be deſtroyed out of his People,</hi> Acts 3.22, 23. The affections of the ſoul are to be manifeſted by the actions of the body, according to Gods Word, and all other good intents or affections are abominable. We may not, neither can we worſhip God with our ſpirits, and the Devil with our bodies; for, <hi>we are bought with a price, and therefore muſt not be the ſervants of men; but muſt glorifie God with our bodies, and with our ſpirits, for they are his,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. and 7.23. And this may ſuffice to ſatisfie any concerning the overthrow of this curſed Conceit, knowing alſo that Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and all his Diſciples to the end of the world, might, and may live peaceably enough from Perſecution, if this Doctrine might be obſerved, <hi>viz.

                  <hi>It cannot be denied, but that the Miniſters preach many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Truths, and do bring people to much reformation in many things.</hi>

               <p>True, it cannot be denied. For, if the Devil ſhould come in his own likeneſs, men would reſiſt him; but becauſe he transformeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light, therefore he deceiveth. So his miniſters, if they ſhould teach all lyes, man would not be deceived by them, nor plead for them; but becauſe they teach many Truths, people receive them.</p>
               <p>But firſt, for whatſoever they teach, they neither could nor ſhould teach publickly, their mouths ſhould be ſtopped, if they received not that their power to teach ſuch Truths from thoſe the Dragon ſends; and therefore none can receive thoſe Truths from them, but they receive the Devil by whoſe power they teach: for, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.40. <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me.</hi> So, he that receiveth thoſe the Beaſt ſends, receiveth the Beaſt; and he that receiveth the Beaſt, receiveth him that ſent him, that is the Devil. Further. Did not that Southſayer <hi>Balaam</hi> teach ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Truths? <hi>Numb.</hi> 23 &amp; 24 chapters. Yea, the Southſayers of the Philiſtims the like, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. Yea, Thoſe in the Goſpel preach in Chriſts Name, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. As many moe teſtimonies might be manifeſted.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, For their bringing of people to Reformation, and therein doing great works. Did not the Southſayers, before recited,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47807:20"/>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. ſhew the Princes their ſin in detaining Gods Ark, and the judgments againſt them for the ſame, exhorting them to ſend it away, and not to harden their hearts, as <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the Egyptians hardned their hearts? And was not Reformation wrought hereby? And did not they that preached in Chriſts Name caſt out Devils, and do many and great works? of whom our Saviour teſtifieth, <hi>he never acknowledged them.</hi> But let us a little conſider wherein the Reformation conſiſtech, procured by their preaching, in Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, Swearing, &amp;c. moral duties, which things whoſoever is not reformed in, ſhall never ſee Gods Kingdom; yet which things many of the Philoſophers (that knew not God) abounded in, as they that know the Stories cannot deny. But do they teach their hearers to hate vain inventions, and love God's Law? In a general manner of teaching they may, but if it come to particular practice, you ſhall ſee what they will do. Do they teach any to ſubmit to that one Law-giver, Chriſt Jeſus, for the guidance of his Church, and not to Antichriſts Abominations? No, they will tell you, you muſt ſigh and groan, till the Magiſtrate will reform; for you are a private perſon, and muſt be ſubject: And if the powerful working of Gods Word and Spirit prevail in you, to let you ſee, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates not reforming will not excuſe you at the day of account, but that <hi>that ſoul that committeth abomination ſhall dye,</hi> and that rather than you will worſhip the Beaſt or his Image, you will ſuffer with Chriſt peaceably, ſeparating your ſelf from ſuch open prophanation as neither can nor will be reformed; endeavouring to ſquare your ſelf both in your entrance, and walking in Chriſts way, unto that golden Rule that he hath left for direction: then the beſt of all thoſe Preachers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers will be hot and bitter, labouring with all the turning of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to turn you, and withhold you from Reformation: And if they cannot prevail hereby, then publiſh you in their priviledged Pulpits, where none may anſwer them, You are a <hi>Schiſmatick, Brownist, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſt,</hi> and what not? to make the multitude abhor your doings, and not to follow you therein; and ſome of them (if not all) under a colour, procure your Impriſonment and trouble by their Canonized Lords, or ſome of their helliſh Purſevants.

               <p>This opinion proceedeth not from Gods Word, but from man's vain heart, by the ſuggeſtion of the Devil: which, that it may evidently appear, let us a little conſider of it. In truth it is to ſay, that in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they have Gods Promiſes appertaining to them: in another reſpect they have Gods moſt fearful Torments (pronounced againſt that Beaſt, and that falſe Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20.) appertaining to them: In one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they are Gods People, ſerving Him their Maſter: in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Devils people, ſerving him their maſter: In one reſpect they ſhall be ſaved, in another reſpect they ſhall be damned. But what falſe doctrine this is, Gods holy Word doth diſcover. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters; ye cannot ſerve God and Riches,</hi> Mat. 6.25. And can any ſerve Chriſt and the Beaſt, God and the Dragon? When Chriſt ſhall come at the laſt day to give to every man according to his works, will he ſay to any one, In reſpect of thy perſonal graces I will ſave thee, Come thou bleſſed, (as he will ſay to all his Children:) But in reſpect of thy being a member of Antichriſts body, I will damn thee, Go thou curſed, as he will to all that worſhip or obey the Beaſt? Will not Chriſt Jeſus pronounce abſolutely either Salvation or Condemnation to every one? and that according to this word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. ſo as God in his Righteouſneſs will either juſtifie or condemn every man: So hath He taught us to know, that no Fountain can make ſalt water and ſweet, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.12. And therefore, that by mens fruits we ſhould know and judge them to be not both good and evil trees at one time, as this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on teacheth, but either <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evil:</hi> alwayes taking heed, <hi>we juſtifie not the wicked,</hi> nor <hi>condemn the innocent, both which are abominable to the Lord:</hi> And for any communion whatſoever with them; <hi>What fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip hath Chriſt with Antichriſt, the Righteous with the Wicked, the

If any ſay they have right and title to it by Gods Promiſe. I anſwer, God hath promiſed Life and Salvation by Chriſt to none that are under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but only by Repentance and Faith: let any ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary if they be able. If any ſay, as ſome fooliſhly have done, being urged, That it is the Covenant of the viſible Church: what Covenant is that but the Covenant of Life and Salvation made to the Faithfull, Chriſt Body and Church? And therefore, ſeeing they are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded herein, ſome teaching one thing, and ſome another; ſome that Infants have neither Faith nor Repentance, but by vertue of the Covenant made to their Parents: Others teach, that Repentance and Faith is to be performed of every one that is to be baptiſed, and that Infants may repent and believe by their Sureties till they come to age themſelves: Seeing, I ſay, they are thus confounded herein, having nothing in Chriſts perfect Teſtament, only ſome ſhew of a forged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and alſo that they agree not amongſt themſelves; Let us take heed of prophaning the Lords holy Ordinance, adminiſtring it where he hath not commanded.

               <p>Oh! that hath been the overthrow of Religion in this Land, the beſt able and greater part being gone, and leaving behind them ſome few, who by the others departure have had their afflictions and contempt increaſed, which hath been the cauſe of many falling back and of the adverſaries exalting: But they will tell us, we are not to judge things by the effects, therefore we muſt prove that their flight unlawful, or we ſay nothing.</p>
               <p>And friſt Whereas it is ſaid by ſome of theſe flyers, that many of the People of God fled into forreign Countries, and that God gave ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation thereof, as <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his infancy, and other, thinking hereby to juſtifie this their flight. I anſwer, God preſerved <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt in their flight, till the time was come that he imployed them in his ſervice, then in no caſe he would ſuffer them to flie; as when <hi>Moſes</hi> manifeſted his exceeding backwardneſs to the Lords work, in helping his People out of Bondage, uſing many excuſes, the Lord <hi>was very angry with him,</hi> Exod. 4.10—15. And whither out Saviour flie when the time came that he was to <hi>ſhew himſelf to Iſrael?</hi> Luk. 1.80. If any of theſe men can prove the Lord requireth no work at their hands to be done for his Glory, and the Salvation of thouſands of ignorant ſouls in their own Nation, let them ſtay in foreign Countries. But I truſt Gods People have learned, not to ſay, the time is not yet come that <hi>Babel</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, and the Lords Houſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that <hi>the time is come to build the Lords Houſe, and not to dwell in ceiled houſes,</hi> Hag. 1. or any way to ſeek our outward promotion; which if it be granted, that the time is come, not only <hi>to come out of Babel,</hi> but <hi>to deſtroy her,</hi> all theſe objections are nothing; except they prove, that when God called any of his People to his Work, they left it for fear of trouble. This doctrine was not approved of God when the time came that his Adverſaries were to be rooted out, and that his People had gotten ſome victory. The <hi>Rubenites</hi> and the <hi>Gadites</hi> could
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47807:27"/>have been content to have remained to their moſt peace and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, <hi>Num</hi> 32. but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Shall your Brethren go to war, and ye tarry here? where fore now diſcourage ye the hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> ſharply reproving them, <hi>as an increaſe of ſinful men, riſen upon their fathers ſteads ſtill to augment the fierce wrath of the Lord;</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> would not be ſatisfied until they had promiſed that they would go with their Brethren to the Lords work, and would not return to their houſes till they had accompliſhed the ſame. And the Angel of the Lord doth ſay, <hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz, <hi>curſe the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not to the help of the Lord, to help the Lord againsſt the Mighty,</hi> Judg. 5.23. Alſo, becauſe the men of <hi>Jabeſh Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead</hi> came not up to the Lord, to help their Brethren againſt the wicked men of <hi>Gibeath, all the men were deſtroyed, and all the women that had lien by men,</hi> Judg. 21.11, no excuſe whatſoever could ſerve. Did God thus reſpect his Work and People then, as all muſt put to their helping hand, and none muſt withdraw their ſhoulder leſt others were diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; and is there no regard to be had thereof now, but any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as fear of a little Impriſonments, or the like, may excuſe any, both from the Lords work, and the help of their Brethren, that for want of their ſociety and comfort are exceedingly weakned, if not overcome? If anſwer be made, They perform their duty in both, that they do the Lords work; the paſtor feeding his flock, and the People walking in fellowſhip one towards another. I demand, Doth the Lord require no more work of them? doth he not require that they ſhould help to caſt down <hi>Babel?</hi> If reply be made, They do it by their Books. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That may be done, and their Lights ſhine by their mouthes and converſations alſo among the wicked, which is the greateſt means of converting them, and deſtroying Antichriſts Kingdom: <hi>They over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came</hi> (not by flying away, but) <hi>by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of their Teſtimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death, Rev.</hi> 12.11. Gods People are the Lights of the World, a City ſet on a hill, a Candle ſet on the candleſtick, giving light to all that come in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 and therefore muſt ſhine by their Perſons, more than by their Books. And great help and encouragement would it be to Gods People in affliction of Impriſonment and the like, to have their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns preſernce to adminiſter to their ſouls or bodies, and for which cauſe Chriſt will ſay, <hi>I was in Priſon, and ye viſited me; in Diſtreſs, and ye comforted me;</hi> and unto thoſe that do not ſo according to their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47807:28"/>ability, <hi>Go ye curſed, Mat.</hi> 25.

            <p>If we were in error herein, theſe courſes of afflicting our bodies for Conſcience cauſe, are not of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as hereafter is moſt plainly ſhewed; And if no <hi>Church</hi> be the Rule of Faith, <hi>but only the holy Scriptures;</hi> as the learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do truly confeſs, and that therefore the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (that all muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the Church believes, and ſo practiſe, or elſe be cruelly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted) be moſt ungodly, as it is: then how can they avoid the like cenſure that practiſe the ſame thing, contrary to their own Judgement? For the learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do ſay, it is high cruelty for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to conſtrain them to practiſe thoſe things in Gods Worſhip which they have not Faith in, nay, which they know to be evil, with Impriſonment, Fire and Faggot: and therefore why may not we ſay, it is great cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the learned <hi>Proreſtants</hi> to constrain us to practiſe ſuch things in Gods Worſhip, which we have not Faith in? Nay, which we certainly know to be evil, with lingring Impriſonment, loſs of Goods, and what other cruelties they can procure againſt us of your Majeſty and the Civil State. If your Learned ſay, they have the Truth, and we are in Errour; that reſteth to be tryed by the true Touchſtone, the holy Scriptures. <hi>If they be our Judges, the Verdict muſt needs go againſt us.</hi> If their ſayings be a ſafe Rule for us to be ſaved by, we will rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; And then why may not the ſaying of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> be ſure alſo, and they be the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Judges? and ſo bring us all to believe as the <hi>Church believes.</hi> The iniquity of which we have diſcovered as briefty as we could; beſeeching your Majeſty and all that are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to hear us. <hi>It concerneth our eternal Salvation, or Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is therefore of great importance; for what can a man give for the ranfom of his Soul?</hi>

            <p>Our prayers are, and ſhall be for you day and night, to that <hi>God of glory,</hi> by whom you reign and are advanced, that He will pat it into your hearts to let theſe things enter into your thoughts, and then we doubt not (the evidence of them being ſuch) that you will be moved to repeal and make void all thoſe cruel Laws (which we moſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech) which persecute poor men only for matters of conſcience; not that we any way deſire for our ſelves or others, any the leaſt liberty from the ſtrict obſervation of any Civil, Temporal, or Humane Law, made or to be made, for the preſervation of your Majesties Perſon, Crown, State or Dignity; for, <hi>all that give not to Caeſar that which is his,</hi> let them bear their burden: but we only deſire, <hi>that God might have that which is his,</hi> which is the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> in that Worſhip that He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, over which <hi>there is but one Lord,</hi> Eph. <hi>4.5.</hi> and <hi>one Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, who is able to ſave it, or to deſtroy it,</hi> Jam <hi>4.12,</hi> which no mortal man can do.

            <p>The vileneſs of perſecuting the body of any man only for cauſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is againſt the <hi>Word of God</hi> and <hi>Law of Chriſt:</hi> It is againſt the profeſſion of <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> againſt the profeſſion and practice of <hi>famous Princes;</hi> The <hi>antient and later approved Writers witneſs againſt it;</hi> ſo do the <hi>Puritans;</hi> yea, the eſtabliſhers of it, the <hi>Papiſts themſelves</hi> inveigh againſt it: ſo that God and all men do deteſt it, as is herein ſhewed.

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Rule of Faith is the Doctrine of the Holy Ghoſt contained in the Sacred Scriptures, and not any Church, Council, Prince or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, nor any mortal man whatſoever.</head>
               <p>PRoved, by the Scriptures themſelves, which are the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophers, the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles; theſe are a ſufficient Rule alone to try all Faith and Religion by: our Reaſons are, 1. <hi>They are inſpired of God, and are able to make us wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perfect to every good work,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Becauſe theſe Writings are written, <hi>that we might have certainly of the things whereof we are inſtructed,</hi> Luke 1.4. <hi>That our joy might be full,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.4. And <hi>that we might believe, and in believing might have life,</hi> John 20.31.3. We are commanded <hi>not to preſame (or be wiſe) above what is written,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.6. For, with this weapon <hi>Chriſt put to flight the Devil,</hi> Mat. 4.4. And <hi>taught his Diſciples,</hi> Luke 24.27, 46. And <hi>Paul taught Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Acts 17.2. The Godly are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>for ſearching the Scriptures,</hi> Acts 17.11. All are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to ſearch them,</hi> John 5.39. And <hi>they that will not believe theſe Writings, will not believe Chriſts Words,</hi> John 5.47. <hi>nor one that ſhould come from the Dead,</hi> Luke 16.31. If any ask how we know all, or any of theſe Scriptures to be inſpired of God? We anſwer, <hi>The ear</hi> (ſaith Job 12.11) <hi>diſcerneth words, and the mouth taſteth meat for it ſelf;</hi> And as the eye diſcerneth the light of the Sun, ſo doth our Spirit diſcern theſe Scriptures to be inſpired of God, and that for theſe Reaſons: 1. In regard of the Majeſty, Wiſdom and Grace of them from all other Writings; for there is a great Glory in theſe Scriptures, as in the making of this <hi>wonderful World,</hi> which is moſt evidently diſcerned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.2. By their Teachings, which excel all humane teachings, leading us from Satan, from this world and our ſelves, to God, to holineſs, faith, love, fear, obedience, humility. 3. The true events of them, or fulfilling of the Propheſies contained in them. 4. The conſent and agreement of all the parts of them, the like whereof cannot be ſhewed of ſo many ſeveral Writers ſince the world began. 5. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable preſervation thereof againſt Time and Tyrants; all which could not extinguiſh them. 6. The Devil and his Inſtruments rage againſt thoſe that practiſe the Doctrines contained in them. 7. The Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thouſands to God, by the power of their Doctrine. 8. The Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47807:30"/>that hath come upon ſuch as have not obeyed them. 9. The Acknowledgment of them by the very profeſſed Adverſaries thereof. 10. The Miracles confirming them from Heaven. 11. The fight of a Saviour to man is only by and from them. And laſtly, the ſimplicity of the Writers and plainneſs of the Writings; for God hath choſen the mean, contemptible and deſpiſed, to manifeſt unto the world his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Theſe are ſufficient to perſwade, that thoſe holy Writings are inſpired of God, and ſo able to make wiſe unto Salvation, and perfect to every good work, Theſe Scriptures contain the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> and if any Church, Council, Prince or Potentate <hi>ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is not light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8.20. And we are <hi>commanded to hold them accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1.8, 9. For, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall adde unto theſe things, God ſhall adde the plagues written herein;</hi> and <hi>whoſoever ſhall take away from theſe things, God ſhall take his name out of the Book of life, and out of the holy City, and from thoſe things that are written,</hi> Revel, 22.</p>
               <p>Much by us ſhall not need to be written on this Subject, the thing is ſo evident, and ſo generally acknowledged, at leaſt in words, (excepting the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> with whom we have not here to do) only we will adde ſome humane Teſtimonies.</p>

                  <hi>Whites Way to the Church,</hi> dedicated to two Biſhops, pag. 12. The learned Proteſtants affirm and prove, that it is the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Artic. 6 chap. <hi>That the Scripture comprehended in the Old and New Teſtament, is the Rule of Faith ſo far, that whatſoever is not read therein, or cannot be proved thereby, is not to be accepted as any point of Faith, or needful to be followed;</hi> but <hi>by it all Doctrines taught, and the Churches Practice muſt be examined,</hi> and <hi>that rejected which is contrary to it, under what title or pretence ſoever it come unto us.</hi> And further they ſay, p. 1. <hi>That the Pope, or any mortal man ſhould be the Rule that muſt reſolve in queſtions and controverſies of Faith, is an unreaſonable Poſition, void of all indifferency; when common ſenſe teacheth, That he that is a party, cannot be Judge.</hi> And again, pag. 17. <hi>—Which is the Church is controverſal, which is the Scriptures is not; therefore let that be the Rule which is out of doubt.</hi> And again, <hi>The Scriptures contain the Principles of our Faith,</hi> and <hi>ſhall we not believe them?</hi> Or, <hi>cannot we know them infallibly of themſelves, without we let in the authority of the Church?</hi> This, and much more, the learned Proteſtants have written, and ſufficiently confirms, that no Church nor
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47807:31"/>man whatſoever may be the Judge, Rule or Umpier in matters of Faith, but only the holy Scriptures; and whoſoever teacheth and practiſeth otherwiſe, they muſt hold and maintain the Papiſts, Creed, or Colliers Faith, which the Proteſtants ſo much in words deteſt, <hi>pag.</hi> 6. and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our of <hi>Staphilus</hi> his Apology, thus: <hi>The Collier being at the point of death, and tempted of the Devil what his Faith was? anſwered: I believe, and dye in the Faith of Christs Church:</hi> Being again deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what the Faith of Chriſts Church was? <hi>That Faith (ſaid he) that I believe in. Thus the Devil getting no other Anſwer, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and put to flight. By this Paith of the Collier every unlearned man may try the ſpirits of men, whether they be of God or no: by this Faith he may reſiſt the Devil, and judge the true interpretation from the falſe, and diſcern the Catholick from the heretical Miniſter, the true Doctrine from the forged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Anſwer of the Collier, and the Papiſts Concluſion upon it be not ſound, but deteſtable, as the Proteſtants confeſs, and cry wo unto the Papiſts for the ſame, and that juſtly; Then is it no leſs deteſtable in the Proteſtants or any other to require, or any to yeeld ſo far in Religion and Faith, that upon ſuch a temptation he hath no better anſwer to make than as the Collier, to ſay, <hi>I believe and dye in the Faith of the Church;</hi> or <hi>of the Prince,</hi> or <hi>of the Learned;</hi> for, being demanded what that Faith is? if he be not able to prove it by Gods Word, contained in the Scriptures, it is no better nor other than the anſwer of the Collier, <hi>The Faith that I believe in.</hi> Oh how many millions of ſouls in this Nation, not Papiſts but Proteſtants, live and dye, and have never other Faith than this, whereunto they are conſtrained and compelled by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, without either Faith or Knowledge.</p>

               <p>THe next thing, as the immediate Queſtion from this former, is, Who muſt interpret this Rule, becauſe, as is objected, <hi>There are many dark places in it</hi> (2 Pet. 3) <hi>hard to be underſtood.</hi> Unto which we anſwer: The two Witneſſes of God ſhall be the onely Interpreters therof; which are, The Word of God contained in the ſame Scriptures, and the Spirit of God, ſo are they called, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26, 27. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.32. Firſt, for the Scriptures themſelves, though ſome Doctrines in ſome
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47807:31"/>places be dark and obſcure, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, yet the ſelf-ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in other places are plain and manifeſt: For, <hi>all the words of the Lord are plain to him that will underſtand,</hi> and <hi>ſtreight to them that would find knowledge,</hi> Pro. 8.9. And <hi>knowledge is eaſie to him that will underſtand,</hi> Prov. 14.6. Secondly, the Spirit of God; So ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. <hi>It is the Spirit that beareth witneſs: for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is Truth.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 14.26. But <hi>the Comforter, which is the holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance which I have told you.</hi> And Joh, 16.13. <hi>Howbeit when he is come, which is the Spirit of truth, he will lead you into all truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, ſhall he ſpeak, and he will ſhew you of things to come.</hi> And 1 Cor. 2.10. <hi>For the Spirit ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God.</hi> And ver. 11. <hi>For the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> And 1 Joh. 2.27. <hi>But the Anointing that ye have received of Him, dwelleth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame Anointing teacheth you of all things, and it is true, and is no lye; and even as it hath taught you, you ſhall abide in Him.</hi> And 1 Joh. 3.24. <hi>Hereby we know that He abideth in us, even by the Spirit that He hath given us.</hi> And 1 Cor. 12.8. <hi>For to one is given by the Spirit, the word of Wiſdom; and to another the word of Knowledge, by the ſame Spirit.</hi>

               <p>THe next thing in order is, ſeeing the Lord revealeth his ſecrets to the humble, though wanting humane Learning, that we now prove on the contrary; That God uſually and for the moſt part hideth his ſecrets from the Learned, and ſuffereth them to erre and reſiſt the Truth, yea ſo far, as to perſecute it and the Profeſſors of it.</p>
               <p>And firſt, let us begin with the Learned Heathen, who were behind none in humane Learning: the wiſe-men of <hi>Egypt,</hi> how did they reſiſt the glorious and powerful Truth of God delivered by <hi>Moſes?</hi> yea, they reſiſted it with ſuch ſigns and lying wonders, that the heart of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and all his people were hardned againſt it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.11, 12, 13. and 8.7.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47807:34"/>Southſayers, and make them that conjecture fools, and turn the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men backward, and make their knowledge folliſhneſs.</hi> The things of Gods dealing none of the Learned of <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Babel</hi> could interpret, but <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next come to the learned Prieſts and Prophets of the Jews, <hi>Whoſe lips ſhould have preſerved Knowledge, and at whoſe mouth the people ſhould have ſought the Law:</hi> But ſaith the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>They are gone out of the way, they have cauſed many to fall by the Law, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. <hi>Stay your ſelves and wonder; they are blind, and make you blind; they are drunken, but not with Wine; they ſtagger, but not with ſtrong drink: for the Lord hath convered you with a ſpirit of ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and hath ſhut up your eyes, the Prophets, and your chief Seers, &amp;c: Therefore the Lord ſaid, Becauſe this people come near to me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me was taught by the precepts of men: Therefore, behold, I will again do a marvallous work in this people, a marvellous work and a wonder; for the wiſdom of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of the prudent ſhall be hid, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10, &amp;c. <hi>Their watchmen are all blind, they have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>theſe Shepherds cannot underſtand, for they all look to their own way, every one for his own advantage, and for his own purpoſe.</hi> Alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.9, &amp;c. <hi>The wiſe-men are aſhamed; they are afraid and taken: lo, they have rejected the Word of the Lord, and what wiſdom is in them, &amp;c.</hi> And Jer. 14.14, &amp;c. and 50.6. <hi>My People have been as loſt ſheep, their Shepherds have cauſed them to go aſtray, and have turned them away to the mountains, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Micah</hi> 3. <hi>Night ſhall be unto them for a viſion, and Darkneſs for a divination: the Sun ſhall go down over the Prophets, and the Day ſhall be dark over them, &amp;c. For they have no anſwer of God: they build up Zion with blood, and Jeruſalem with iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Her Prophets are light and wicked perſons; her Prieſts have polluted the Sanctuary, they have wreſted the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the time of our Saviour, <hi>How had they made the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God of no authority by their Traditions,</hi> Mat. 15.6. And <hi>Act.</hi> 13.27. <hi>The Rulers of Jeruſalem</hi> (the High-Prieſts, Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees) <hi>knew not Christ, nor yet the words of the Prophets, which they heard read every Sabbath, but fulfilled them in condemning him.</hi> And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>I thank thee Father, Lord of Heaven and

And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Where is the Wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the Disputer of this world? Hath not God made the wiſdom of this world folliſhneſs?</hi> And ver. 26. <hi>Not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the Learned ſince the time of our Saviour; The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were where 132 Biſhops: Of <hi>Seleucia</hi> where were 160 Bps, related by the Proteſtants: How grievouſly did they erre, in decreeing the deteſtable Error of <hi>Arrianiſm?</hi> Who is ignorant (knowing the Hiſtories) that from time to time, both particular Popes and general Councils, have groſly erred in many things? only one we will menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, paſſing by <hi>Trent</hi> and others; The Council <hi>Lateren</hi> we mean (Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> 1215.) which for univerſality was behind none, where were preſent 2 Patriarchs, 70 Archbiſhops Metropolitans 400 Biſhops, 12 Abbot, 800 Conventual Priors, the Legats of the <hi>Greck</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, beſides the Ambaſſadors and Orators of the Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem, France, Spain, England,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus.</hi> In this Council it was decreed, That all Hereticks, and ſo many as do in any point reſiſt the Catholick Faith, ſhould be condemned, &amp;c. And alſo that the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Powers, of what degree ſoever they be, ſhall be compelled openly to ſwear for the defence of the Faith, that they will to the uttermoſt of their power root out and deſtroy in all their Kingdoms, all ſuch perſons as the Catholick Church hath condemned for Hereticks: and if they do not, they ſhall be excommunicated. And if they do not reform within one whole year, then the <hi>Pope</hi> may denounce all their Subjects abſolved, and utterly delivered from ſhewing or owing any fidelity or obedience towards them. Again, that the <hi>Pope</hi> may give that Land, to be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied and enjoyed of the Catholicks to poſſeſs it, (all Hereticks being rooted out) quietly and without any contradiction. <hi>Tho. Beacon</hi> in his <hi>Reliques of Rome,</hi> printed 1563. And the Proteſtands confeſs, that this imperfection hath hung ſo faſt upon all Councils and Churches, that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith, <hi>He never ſaw any Council have a good end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus are here ſufficient Teſtimonies proved from Scriptures and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, That the Learned may, and have uſually erred; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Scriptures often warn us, <hi>To beware of falſe Prophets, for many are gone out into the world,</hi> Mat. 24. and 1 Joh. 4.</p>

               <p>And will not your Majeſty, your Highneſs, your Honours, your Worſhips, be pleaſed to conſider of theſe things? but will your ſelves ſubmit the guidance of your Souls to the learned Spirituality, (as they are called) without due examination by the Scriptures? which if you will ſtil do, we can but bewail with the ſorrows of our hearts; and not ſo only, <hi>But will you with your Power which God hath given you to uſe well, compel and constrain your Subjects and Underlings, to believe as the Learned believe, not ſuffering us to reade or ſearch the Scriptures?</hi> Which if you abhor, as being the <hi>Romiſh</hi> practice; <hi>Will you do that which is worſe, letting us reade the Scriptures, whereby we may know the Will of our Heavenly Maſter, and have our Conſciences enlightned and convinced; but not ſuffer us to practiſe that we learn and know? whereby our Sin and Condemnation is made greater than the blind Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> as is proved, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47.

               <p>May it pleaſe you to obſerve, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeeth and acknowledgeth in words, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi> and hath aboliſhed the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the legal Sacrifieces; but the <hi>Jews</hi> ſee it not to this day, nay, the <hi>High-Prieſts, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaw it not, but for the publiſhing thereof perſecuted <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Lord, and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> unto the Death; calling their Doctrine <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and them <hi>ſeditious</hi> Enemies to <hi>Caeſar, &amp;c.</hi> For the which we all juſtly condemn them for their wickedneſs, ſo often as we reade the holy Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>And the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſeeth and acknowledgeth divers dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> this among many, That the <hi>Scriptures are not the only Rule of Faith,</hi> but that <hi>men ought to be conſtrained to believe as the Church believes.</hi> The Proteſtants ſee the iniquity of this, becauſe they ſee and acknowledge all Churches <hi>are ſubject to erre.</hi> But the learned Papiſts ſee it not, but have decreed, That whoſoever reſiſteth in any point ſhall be judged as an Heretick, and ſuffer fire and faggot: and every Temporal Magiſtrate that doth not root ſuch Hereticks out of their Dominions, ſhall be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated; and if he do not reform, he ſhall be expelled his earthly

For the which height of iniquity, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and we juſtly cry out againſt them for all the innocent blood that they have ſhed.</p>
               <p>And we ſee moſt manifeſtly, that <hi>what ſoever is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. And <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. And therefore that <hi>no mortal man may make a Law to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and force unto it by Perſecutions, and conſequently may not compel unto any Religion where Faith is wanting,</hi> as hereafter more largely we prove. But the Learned of this Land ſee it not (or rather will not practiſe it) but for our not ſubmitting herein, procure your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sword to perſecute us, by caſting us in Priſons, where many of us have remained divers years in lingring Impriſonment, deprived of all earthly comforts, as Wives, Children Callings, &amp;c. without hope of Releaſe, till our God (for the practice of whoſe Commandments we are thus perſecuted) perſwade the hearts of your-Majeſty, your Highneſs, your Honours, your Worſhips, to take pitty upon us, our poor Wives and Children, or His heavenly Majeſty releaſe us by Death. Will not ſucceeding Ages cry out againſt the Cruelty of the learned Proteſtants herein, aſwell as they cry out againſt the Cruelty of the learned Jews and Papiſts? yes, we are aſſured they will, as many millions do in other Nations at this day.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures declare, the cauſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> blindneſs was, not the obſcurity of the Scriptures, but that they winked with their eyes, leſt they ſhould ſee that which would deprive them of their honours and profits, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.48. And becauſe, their fear towards God was taught by mens precepts, and becauſe they looked to their own way, and to their own advantage, and had rejected the Word of the Lord; and becauſe they builded their <hi>Zion</hi> with blood, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and ſought their own honour, and not Gods, as before is proved. So the cauſe of the blindneſs of the learned <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in denying the Scriptures the only Rule of Faith, is not the obſcurity of the Scriptures, but their winding with their eyes, leſt they ſhould ſee that, that would bring them from their honours and profits, and all the forenamed in the <hi>Jews.</hi> And alſo as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> well obſerve, <hi>Whit.</hi> pag. 18. Firſt, <hi>That they might make themſelves Judges in their own cauſe; For who ſeeth not that if the Church be the Rule of Faith, and their be the Church, which way the verdict will go?</hi> Next, <hi>for that the greateſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47807:36"/>points of their Religion have no foundation on the Scriptures, &amp;c.</hi> So that take away the Scriptures, and eſtabliſh their Religion; but eſtabliſh the Scriptures, and their Religion vaniſheth; and that Mother of Whoredoms that glorified her ſelf <hi>as a Queen,</hi> Rev. 18. ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; and her Merchants that were waxed rich through her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and profits, ſhall wail and weep, the which they now ſeeing, ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſhould ſee that which would bring them from theſe honours, profits and pleaſures.</p>
               <p>In like manner it may eaſily be judged by every indifferent man, that the cauſe why the Learned of this Land will not ſee, or at leaſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, (that ſeeing <hi>there is but one Lord,</hi> Eph. 4.5. and <hi>one Law-giver over the Conſcience,</hi> Jam. 4.12. Therefore no man ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by perſecution, to a worſhip wherein he hath not Faith) is not the obſcurity of the Scriptures, but their winking with their eyes, leſt they ſhould ſee that that would take away their honours and profits? For, if <hi>Bribes blind the eyes of the Wiſe,</hi> Deut. 16.19. then Honours and Profits much more: For, who ſeeth not, if none ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by perſecution to worſhip God in Spirit and Truth (<hi>ſuch only worſhip Him,</hi> and none but ſuch <hi>are required to worſhip Him,</hi> Joh. 4.23.) that theſe Learned would loſe their Honours &amp; Profits, in being Lords and Law-makers over the conſcience &amp; ſouls of men: although your Majeſty might lawfully give them what temporal Honours and Profits your Highneſs liked of. Theſe are the true cauſes of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Learned: For ſo Chriſt ſaith,: <hi>How can ye believe when ye ſeek honour one of another, and ſeek not the Honour that cometh from God alone?</hi> Joh. 5.44. And how can men but be blind in gods My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, when they look <hi>to their own way,</hi> for their <hi>own advantage,</hi> and for their <hi>own purpoſe;</hi> for, <hi>having rejected the Word of the Lord, what wiſdom is in them?</hi> they have <hi>no anſwer of God,</hi> that <hi>build up their Sion</hi> (for ſo they account their Churches and Profeſſions) <hi>with blood, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with iniquity,</hi> as before is proved.</p>
               <p>If theſe Learned could free us from the Lords wrath; or, if they might anſwer for us, and we be free; it were ſafe for us to ſubmit our ſelves, and captivate our judgments and practice to them; but ſeeing they cannot ſo much as deliver their own ſouls, And that <hi>if the blind lead the blind, both muſt fall into the Ditch,</hi> Mat. 15.14. and, <hi>Every one must give account of himſelf to God,</hi> and <hi>be judged by his own
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47807:36"/>works done in the fleſh,</hi> and that <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall dye,</hi> We dare not follow any mortal man in matters of ſalvation further than we know him to agree with the meaning of God in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> the holy Apoſtle of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> taught, <hi>That we ſhould follow him no otherwiſe than he followed Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1. Yea, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſent men to the Scriptures to try his Doctrine. The Apoſtles ſuffered their Doctrine to be tryed, and commend them that try it. And the Proteſtants confeſs, <hi>Whit. pag.</hi> 127. <hi>This Doctrine was never miſliked, till a Church roſe up, whoſe Silver being Droſs, and whoſe Milk, Poyſon, could not endure the tryal:</hi> which being true, that we may try, why may we not alſo judge and practiſe according as Gods Spirit ſhall direct us in our tryal? If a man ſhould drink poiſon, and know it to be poiſon, were he not in a worſe eſtate than he that ſhould drink it ignorantly not knowing thereof? even a murderer of himſelf in the higheſt degree: So he that drinketh ſpiritual poiſon, knowing it, (for according unto mens faith it is unto them) he is in a worſe eſtate, and a murderer of his own ſoul in the higheſt degree. And therefore that Church, or thoſe Learned, that will ſuffer their Doctrine to be tryed, and yet conſtrain men to receive and practiſe it, when upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination their conſciences are convinced of the falſhood thereof, are worſe, and do more highly ſin, than they that conſtrain a blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, though both be evil.</p>
               <p>We deſpiſe not Learning, nor Learned men, but do reverence it and them, according to their worthineſs; only when it is advanced into the ſeat of God, and that given to it which appertaineth unto the holy Ghoſt, which is to lead into all Truth, than ought all, as <hi>Ezekiah</hi> did unto the brazen Serpent, deteſt it and contemn it.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt, we beſeech your Majeſty we may relate your own worthy Sayings, in your Majeſties Speech at Parliament, 1609. Your Highneſs ſaith,</hi> It is a ſure Rule in Divinity, that God never loves to plant his Church by violence and bloodſhed, &amp;c. <hi>And in your Highneſs</hi> Apol. <hi>pag. 4. ſpeaking of ſuch Papiſts as took the Oath, thus:</hi> I gave a good proof that I intended no perſecution againſt them for Conſcience cauſe, but only deſired to ſecured for civil obedience, which for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cauſe they were bound to perform. <hi>And pag. 60. ſpeaking of</hi> Blackwel <hi>the Arch-Prieſt, your Majeſty ſaith,</hi> It was never my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lay any thing to the ſaid Arch-Prieſts charge, as I have never done to any for cauſe of Conſcience, &amp;c. <hi>And in your Highneſs Expoſ. on</hi> Revel. <hi>20. printed 1588, and after 1603. your Majeſty truly writeth thus: Sixtly,</hi> The compaſſing of the Saints, and beſieging of the beloved City, declareth unto us a certain note of a falſe Church to be <hi>Perſecution;</hi> For they come to ſeek the Faithful, the Faithful are thoſe that are ſought: the Wicked are the <hi>beſiegers,</hi> the Faithful be <hi>beſieged.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>HIllary <hi>againſt</hi> Anxentius, <hi>ſaith thus:</hi> The Chriſtian Church doth not perſecute, but is perſecuted; and lamentable it is to ſee the great folly of theſe times, and to ſigh at the fooliſh opinion of this world, in that men think by humane aid to help God, and with worldly pomp and power to undertake to defend the Chriſtian Church. I ask of you Biſhops, what help uſed the Apoſtles in the publiſhing of the Gospel? With the aid of what Power did they preach <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and converted the Heathen from their Idolatry to God? When they were Impriſoned and lay in Chains, did they praiſe and give thanks to God for any dignities, graces and favours received from the Court? Or, do you think that <hi>Paul</hi> went about with Regal Mandates, or Kingly Authority to gather and eſtabliſh the Church of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Sought he Protection from <hi>Nero Veſpatian? &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtles wrought with their hands for their own maintenance, travelling by land and water from Town to City to preach <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yea, the more they were forbidden, the more they taught and preached <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But now alas, humane help must aſſist and protect the Faith, and give the ſame countenance; To, and by vain and worldly honours do men ſeek to defend the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as if He by his Power were unable to perform it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame, againſt the</hi> Arians: <hi>The</hi> Church now which formerly by enduring Miſery and Impriſonment, was known to be a true Church, doth now terrific others, by Impriſonment, Baniſhment, and Miſery, and boaſteth that ſhe is highly eſteemed of the world; whereas the true Church cannot but be hated of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertul. ad Scapul.</hi> It agreeth both with humane Equity and natural Reaſon, that every man worſhip God uncompelled, and believe what he will; for, another mans Religion or Blief neither hurteth nor profiteth any man: neither beſeemeth it any Religion, to compel another to be of their Religion, which willingly and freely ſhould be imbraced, and not by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47807:38"/>conſtraint: for aſmuch as the Offerings were required of thoſe that freely and with a good will offered, and not from the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jerom.</hi> in <hi>Proaem lib. 4.</hi> in <hi>Jeremiam.</hi> Hereſie must be cut off with the ſword of the Spirit; Let us ſtrike through with the arrows of the Spirit all ſons and diſciples of miſled Hereticks, that is with teſtimonies of holy Scriptures: The ſlaughter of Hereticks is by the Word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brentius</hi> on <hi>1 Cor. 3.</hi> No man hath power to make (or give) Laws to Chriſtians, whereby to bind their Conſciences: For willingly, freely, and uncompelled, with a ready deſire and chearful mind muſt thoſe that come, run unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Luther <hi>in his Book of the Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> The Laws of the Civil Government extends no further than over the body or goods, and to that which is external: for, over the Soul God will not ſuffer any man to rule, only He himſelf will rule there: Therefore whereſoever the Civil Magiſtrate doth undertake to give Laws unto the Soul and Conſciences of men, he uſurpeth that Government to himſelf which appertaineth to God, &amp;c. <hi>The ſame upon 1</hi> King. <hi>6.</hi> In building of the Temple there was no ſound of Iron heard, to ſignifie that Chriſt will have in his Church a free and willing People, not compelled and constrained by Laws and statutes. <hi>Again, he ſaith upon</hi> Luke <hi>22.</hi> It is not the true Catholick Church which is defended by the Seculare arm or Humane power, but the falſe and feigned Church; which although it carries the <hi>name of</hi> a Church, yet it denyes the <hi>power</hi> thereof. <hi>And upon</hi> Pſal. <hi>17. he ſaith,</hi> For the true Church of Chriſt knoweth not <hi>Brachium Seculare,</hi> which the Biſhops now a dayes chiefly uſe. <hi>Again, in</hi> Poſtil. Dom. <hi>1. poſt.</hi> Epiph. <hi>he ſaith,</hi> Let not Chriſtians be commanded, but exhorted; for he that will not willingly do that whereunto he is friendly exhorted, he is no Chriſtian: Therefore thoſe that do compel them that are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhew thereby that they are not Chriſtian Preachers, but worldly Beadles. <hi>Again, upon 1</hi> Pet. <hi>3. he ſaith,</hi> If the Civil Magiſtrate would command me to believe thus or thus, I ſhould anſwer him after this manner; Lord, or Sir, look you to your Civil or worldly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your Power extends not ſo far, to command any thing in Gods Kingdom, therefore herein I may not hear you: For if you cannot ſuffer that any man ſhould uſurp Authority where you have to command, how do you think that God ſhould ſuffer you to thruſt him from his ſeat, and to ſeat your ſelf therein?</p>

He did not ſay,</hi> I ſend you as wolves among ſheep, to kill, impriſon, ſpoil and devour thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom they were ſent. <hi>Again, ver. 7. he ſaith,</hi> They to whom I ſend you will deliver you up in Councils, and in their Synagogues they will ſcourge you; <hi>and</hi> to Preſidents and to Kings ſhall you be led for my ſake: <hi>He doth not ſay,</hi> You whom I ſend ſhall deliver the people (whom you ought to convert) into Councils, and put them in Priſons, and lead them to Preſidents and Tribunal Seats, and make their Religion Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony and Treaſon. <hi>Again, he ſaith, ver. 12.</hi> When ye enter into the houſe, ſalute it, ſaying, Peace be to this houſe: <hi>He doth not ſay,</hi> You ſhall ſend Purſevants to ſanſack and ſpoyl the houſe. <hi>Again, lie ſaith,</hi> Joh. <hi>10.</hi> The good Paſtor giveth his life for his ſheep; the Thief cometh not, but to ſteal, kill and deſtroy: <hi>He doth not ſay,</hi> the Thief giveth his life for his ſheep, and the good Paſtor cometh not but to ſteal, kill and deſtroy, &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:47807:39"/>
               <p>Come to the time of Chriſt, where <hi>Iſrael</hi> was under the <hi>Romans,</hi> where lived divers ſects of Religions, as <hi>Herodians, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifees, Saduces, Libertines, Theudaeans, Samaritans,</hi> beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Religion of the <hi>Jews, Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> all which differed from the common Religion of the State, which (is like) was the <hi>Worſhip of Diana,</hi> which almoſt <hi>the whole world then worſhipped,</hi> Act. 19.20.

                  <hi>CHAP. 10.</hi> King are not deprived of any Power given them of God, when they maintain Freedom for cauſe of Conſcience.</head>
               <p>WE know the Learned do perſwade that Kings have power from God to maintain the Worſhip and Service of God, as they have power to maintain Right and Juſtice between man and man; For Chriſtian Kings (ſay they) have the ſame power, that the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had under the Law. For anſwer to which, Firſt, let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had never power from God to make new Laws, or ſet up new Worſhips which Gods Word required not; nor
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47807:40"/>to ſet high Prieſts, or Spiritual Lords for the performance of the Services, other than ſuch as God by <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly had commanded; and therefore the power of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will warrant to Kings to make or confirm <hi>Canons,</hi> ſet up new Worſhips, and appoint Spiritual Lords and Law givers to the Conſcience, and perſecute all that ſubmit not to them, 2. Let it be well obſerved, only the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had this power, but no other Kings, whoſe Commonwealths did flouriſh to them and their ſeeds after them to many generations: and it muſt be granted that he that is King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> now, which is Jeſus Chriſt, (the truth of thoſe typical Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) he hath the power according to the proportion; the temporal Kings had temporal power to compel all to the obſervation of thoſe carnal or temporal Commandments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. and 9.10. So Chriſt the Spiritual King, hath Spiritual Power to compel all to the obſervation of his Spiritual Commandments; For when he came, himſelf ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. <hi>The hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth; for the Father requireth even ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> If Chriſt be only King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſits upon <hi>Davids</hi> Throne for ever, as he is, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. far be it from any King to take Chriſts ſeat from him. The Wiſdom of God foreſaw, that ſeeing the Miſteries of the Goſpel are ſuch ſpiritual things, as no natural men (though they be Princes of this world) can know them; he left not Kings and Princes to be Lords and Judges thereof, ſeeing they are ſubject to erre, but he left that Power to his beloved Son, who could not erre; and the Son left his only Deputy the holy Ghoſt, and no moral man whatſoever, as your Highneſs worthily acknowledgeth, in <hi>Apol.</hi> pag. 46. <hi>I utterly deny that there is any earthly Monarch over the Church whoſe word muſt be a Law, and who cannot erre by an infallibility of ſpirit. Becauſe earthly Kingdoms muſt have earthly Monarchs, it doth not follow the Church muſt have a viſible Monarch too. Chriſt is the Churches Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and the holy Ghoſt his Deputy. The Kings of the Gentiles reign over them; but you ſhall not be ſo, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 22. <hi>Chriſt when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended left not</hi> Peter <hi>with them to direct them into all truth, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend the holy Ghoſt unto them for that end, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, theſe Learned alledge the Commandments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.33. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. where <hi>Iſrael</hi> are commanded <hi>to deſtroy all the Inhabitants of the Land, leſt they intice them to ſerve their gods;</hi> and to <hi>ſlay all falſe prophets, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe they collect from the time of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47807:40"/>the <hi>Law,</hi> for in the time of the <hi>Gospel</hi> they have nothing to alledge; for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. maketh nothing for their purpoſe, <hi>Caeſar</hi> being a Heathen King. For anſwer unto the places of <hi>Moſes:</hi> firſt, <hi>The ſins of this people the</hi> Canaanites <hi>were full, and the Lord would deſtroy them, and give their poſſeſſions unto the</hi> Iſraelites; but the ſins of the refuſers of Chriſt, are not full until the end, or laſt hour, as before is proved. 2. <hi>The Children of Iſrael had a ſpecial Commandment from the Lord to destroy them;</hi> but the Kings of the Nations have no Command at all to deſtroy the bodies of the contrary-minded; nay, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.29.3. <hi>The</hi> Canaanites <hi>would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and have des;troyed them;</hi> but the contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded will not rebell againſt their Kings, but give unto them the things that belong unto them; not ſo much for fear, as of conſcience: and of this the GOD of Gods is Witneſs. 4. <hi>The Heads and Rulers of Iſrael could command and compel the people to obſerve thoſe carnal Rites and Ordinances of the Law; even as</hi> CHRIST <hi>the Head and Ruler of</hi> Iſrael <hi>can compel to the obſervations of his ſpiritual Ordinances of the Gospel;</hi> but the Heads of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot compel their Subjects to believe the Goſpel; for <hi>Faith is the gift of God;</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> if they want, all they do in Gods Worſhip <hi>is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Therefore they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel any <hi>to worſhip,</hi> becauſe they cannot give them <hi>Faith;</hi> for which cauſe the Lord in wiſdom ſaw it not meet to charge Kings with a duty which they cannot perform, God will never require it at their hands; the blood of the faithleſs and unbelieving ſhall be on their own heads; <hi>He that will not believe ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16.16.</p>
               <p>Again, Seeing it is true, as your Majeſty well obſerveth in your Highneſs ſpeech at Parl. 1609. <hi>That the Judicials of</hi> Moſes <hi>were only fit for that time, and thoſe perſons:</hi> And alſo it is confeſſed, the Law for Adultery, Theft, and the like, is not now to be executed according to the Judicials of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor directions for the Magiſtrates of the Earth to walk by; Why ſhould theſe be any directions for them, ſeing alſo our Savior and his Apoſtles have taught the contrary, as before hath been proved? If all falſe Prophets ſhould be now executed, according to <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. the Kings of the Earth would not onely be deprived of many of their Subjects; but the <hi>Cities of their habitation, with all the Inhabitants of the Cities, muſt be deſtroyed with the edge of the ſword; the cattel thereof, and all the ſpoyl thereof muſt be brought into the
