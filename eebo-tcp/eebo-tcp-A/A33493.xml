            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> CASE <hi>of ſeveral</hi> Hackney-Coachmen <hi>in and about the Cities of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>and</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>and the Suburbs, occaſioned by one</hi> Robert Murrey, <hi>and his Adherents, to the utter Ruin of many Families, for his and his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices private Intereſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. THE ſaid <hi>Robert Murrey,</hi> a common Projector, in the Year 1682 obtained an Act of Common Council in <hi>London,</hi> to reſtrain all but 400 Hackney Coachmen to ply in and about the City of <hi>London</hi> and Suburbs thereof, under the Penalty of Forty Shillings each Coach for every Offence: By which Project the ſaid <hi>Murry</hi> did get clear to himſelf Four hundred and fifty Pounds, beſides all Bribes and other Incomes; but the Coachmen that were oppreſs'd by the ſaid <hi>Murrey</hi>'s Project, having obtained the then Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny General's Opinion, That the ſaid Act was againſt Law, ſtaid ſeveral Suits, and caſt the ſaid <hi>Murrey,</hi> or thoſe imployed to put the ſaid Act in Execution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That then the ſaid <hi>Murrey</hi> and his Accomplices did obtain an Order from Sir <hi>Edmand Villers,</hi> then Knight-Marſhal for the Liberty of the Verge <hi>(viz. Weſtminſter, Whitehall,</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi>'s) to ſuppreſs the Hundred Hackney Coachmen from plying with their Coaches within the Liberties aforeſaid, and did with Money hire Men and keep them from their ſaid Imployment, until one <hi>Thomas Cadman</hi> did ſend his Servant with his Hackney-Coach to ply within the ſaid Verge, after having ſuffered Nine Weeks Reſtraint, by means of the aforeſaid Order, reſolving to ſee by what Right they held their Power; whereupon the Knight-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals Men immediately ſeized upon the ſaid <hi>Cadman</hi>'s Servant, and kept him Priſoner at <hi>White-Hall</hi> for above Six Houres, until he gave a Note under his Hand of Forty Pounds penalty to appear before the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward Villers</hi> the next Day by Nine of the Clock: And the ſaid <hi>Thomas Cadman</hi> appeared accordingly on his ſaid Servants behalf before his Honour, and made him ſenſible of the Oppreſſion, who was thereupon pleaſed to take it off, and never put it upon the ſaid Coachmen after.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the ſaid <hi>Murrey</hi> and his Accomplices afterwards Sollicited his Honour Capt. <hi>Cheek,</hi> then Governour of the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to keep the ſaid One hundred Hackney Coachmen from taking up any Fare upon the Bulwark Wharfe before the <hi>Tower Gate,</hi> under the Penalty of Five ſhillings for each Coach ſo offending, ſo that many poor men ſuffered thereby, until the ſaid <hi>Thomas Cadman</hi> Petitioned his Honour, and made him ſenſible of the Abuſe put upon them by the aforeſaid <hi>Murrey</hi> and his Accomplices, ſo that now the ſaid <hi>Robert Murrey,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made what Mony he could of the ſaid 400 Hackney Coachmen, came to thoſe he had formerly ruined, and by his deluding Speeches prevailed upon ſome poor Hackney-Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others not qualified for that Imploy, to aſſiſt him with Money to ſollicit the then Popiſh Commiſſioners to Licence 600 Hackney-Coachmen, and to pay more Money in one Year for working their Coaches in the ſtreets, to the Commiſſioners and the ſaid <hi>Murray</hi> and his Accomplices than all the ſaid Hackney-Coachmen were worth, and if the Rich Men ſhould pay the Poor Mens Debts; the Commiſſion was Sealed and Security given in to the Lords of the Treaſury in <hi>November,</hi> 1688. (as the ſaid Coachmen are credably inform'd,) And if it had not pleaſed Almighty God to ſend His Highneſs, the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to their Relief at that very time, the ſaid Hackney-Coachmen had been all ruined and undone by the unjuſt and wicked Contrivance aforeſaid.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That when the ſaid <hi>Murrey</hi> ſaw the late King <hi>James</hi> was gone out of this Kingdom, and his Popiſh Commiſſion of no effect, Did with the aſſiſtance of a Friend or Two in <hi>London,</hi> for his own By-Ends ſince <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, get the Act of <hi>Common-Councel</hi> revived. And the ſaid Coachmen being informed, that the ſaid <hi>Murrey,</hi> and ſeveral others, are endeavouring, for their own private Intereſt, and to the Prejudice of your Petitioners, to procure one or more Bills, of their own framing, to be brought into this Honourable Houſe, for the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of Hackney-Coaches. The ſaid Coachmen therefore humbly deſire that the Act made for Regulating of Hackney-Coaches in the <hi>13th</hi> and <hi>14th</hi> Years of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. may be vived, with the Addition only of One Hundred Coaches. And that they may be ſettled at the ſame Yearly Rent that was Limitted by the ſaid Act.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Wherefore we moſt humbly beſeech Your Honours to take the Premiſes into Your Serious Conſideration; And we and all the reſt, as in Duty bound, ſhall ever Pray,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
