            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it is a dutie incumbent to all <hi>Men,</hi> as <hi>Men;</hi> and to all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to love Mankinde, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> loved us; and to imitate the <hi>God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, who cauſeth his Sun to ſhine upon the good and the bad;</hi> and although there is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial delight, to do that which is good and commendable, onely for the love of Goodneſs it ſelf, and the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Virtue; Yet, when wee meet with ſpecial and powerful <hi>encouragements</hi> to ſet us on, and <hi>provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> to draw forth our affections to laudable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, wee must needs add ſom more effectual zeal to the performance of theſe duties. For mine own part I
<pb facs="tcp:29776:3"/>
may ſay it without vanitie, that the firſt of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the delight to do good, in love to the <hi>Publick,</hi> hath ſupported mee hitherto, notwithſtanding manifold deſtructions in the waie wherein I have walked. And as it hath been one of my Aims, to have the honor (if poſsibly I could attain unto it) of ſerving the Publick. <hi>gratìs,</hi> and at mine own coſt, in the beſt things: So I have made it a part of my <hi>Agencie,</hi> to provoke others to do the like, by offering unto everie one, the things which might bee moſt advantagious unto themſelvs, by doing ſervice unto others. And how far my <hi>affections</hi> have carried mee beyond my <hi>abilities</hi> in this courſ, I need not to mention: this hath onely been my <hi>comfort,</hi> that having ſerved my Generation generouſly and freely, I never had cauſ to repent of what I had don, whether it were reſented by others, or not. But now of late, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath pleaſed God, not onely by the ſettlement of this <hi>State</hi> in the waie of a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> to give to all men a more open door then ever heretofore, to enter upon a concurrence to ſerv the <hi>Publick,</hi> that thereby they might both preſerv and encreaſ their own welfare; but that I have found unexſpectedly from your Honors ſom peculiar expreſsion of favor towards my ſelf, upon the account of my publick-heartedneſs; I muſt confeſs, that I am thereby not ſo much refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:29776:3"/>
by reaſon of that which befalleth to <hi>my ſelf,</hi> as delighted in the hopeful apprehenſion of that which befalleth to the <hi>Publick,</hi> whiles in this particular I am able to perceiv, that the good hand of God hath put the management of his Cauſ and Work in the hands of Men, whom hee hath endued with a publick ſpirit, which is a clear testimonie to mee, that hee will build thereon a ſuperstructure, which by his grace upon your waies will redound to his glorie and evince unto the world, that it is not anie private Intereſt, but his Glorie and the <hi>Publick</hi> Happineſs, which hath acted and doth act, both the Parliament and your ſelvs in all your undertakings. And verily the conſideration of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing, that God hath ſet in publick places Men that minde the Publick for it ſelf, and ſeek out thoſe that are ſo-inclined, although they make no ſpecial application unto them (which hitherto I have not don) is more worth to mee then the private advantage, which your Honors favor can bring unto mee. For although the ſtraits, wherewith the times, and my own forwardneſs to ſerv others have caſt mee, might induce mee to rejoice at the fruit of your Honors bountie towards my ſelf; Yet that is no waies comparable to the ſenſ of joie, which I have at the clear Character, which this hath given mee of the ſpirit by which you are led; for herein I
<pb facs="tcp:29776:4"/>
perceiv that henceforth the labors of impartial love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Publick,</hi> are not like to bee in vain, as for the moſt part they have been heretofore, and that there will bee ſom real encouragement for the making of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional overtures, tending to reſolv that grand question, which is propoſed by the Pſalmiſt in the name of all men, who, with one and the ſame accent, ſay; <hi>Pſal. 4.6. Who will ſhew us anie good?</hi> Therefore ſince the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Parlament</hi> hath enacted a waie to anſwer the <hi>Quere,</hi> as to the Trade of this Nation (which is a manifest demonſtration of their eminent care for the <hi>Publick</hi>) it hath raiſed with joie both mine own, and the thoughts of ſom others to a forwardneſs of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that which might bee ſubſervient and uſeful to that deſign; that as Bees belonging to t'e ſame hive, wee ſhould bring our honie together, to bee preſerved and encreaſed in one ſtock for the good of all. In order to this reſolution, and as a teſtimonie of gratitude, I thought it might bee ſeaſonable to off<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r to your Honors, and under your name to the <hi>Publick,</hi> this following Epiſtolarie <hi>Diſcourſ,</hi> which relate's unto the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Agriculture, <hi>beeing one of the Nobleſt and moſt neceſſarie parts of Induſtrie belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Common-wealth, the firſt ground of mutual trading amongſt men, and the well-ſpring

of wealth in all well ordered Societies.</hi> And if concerning this ſubject (as beeing a main Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of State) ſom courſ in due time were thought upon to ſet forward the Judicial, and regulate the Practical waie of Husbandrie, ſuch overtures could bee made in that kinde, as would ſenſibly (even to the meanest capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie) demonſtrate a very <hi>Cornu-Copia</hi> and fulneſs to bee atteined of the choiſeſt temporal bleſsings to ſupplie all men's wants. And although I cannot ſay much of mine own experience in this matter, yet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence having directed mee by the improvement of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral relations unto the <hi>Experiences</hi> and <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of others, I finde my ſelf obliged to becom a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-pipe thereof towards the <hi>Publick,</hi> chiefly now, where there is ſo favorable an aſpect of Patronage from thoſe that are in eminent places towards thoſe that minde publick advantages. <hi>Prov. 11.25.</hi> It is ſaid in the Proverbs, <hi>that hee who doth withhold Corn the people ſhall curſ him; but a bleſſing ſhall bee upon the head of him that ſelleth it.</hi> If not to impart the means of livelihood to thoſe that ſtand in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> need thereof, when it is in our power to ſupplie them therewith, bee to withhold the ſame; and this deſerves a curſ: then no man can blame mee for the largeneſs of this communication, from which all

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a certain thing, that the chiefeſt and fundamentalleſt point in <hi>Husbandrie,</hi> is, to underſtand the nature and condition of the Lands that one would Till; &amp; to Sow it with ſuch Seeds, as it will produce ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Naturally, or by Art, that which may turn to a man's greateſt profit and advantage. I did think I had underſtood that point (when I went out of <hi>England</hi>) after thirtie years experience in <hi>Husbandrie,</hi> and having improved my Land, as much as anie man in this Kingdom hath don both by Water and Fire. But, after I had been a while in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> I found I was to learn a new Leſſon, in point of <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie</hi>; for that the barrenneſt, Heathie and Sandie Lands in thoſe Countries did produce richer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, by an ordinarie waie of <hi>Husbandrie</hi> there in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29776:6"/>
practice, then the ſtrongeſt and richeſt grounds that were in both thoſe Countries. When I firſt arrived at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and went to <hi>Bridges,</hi> (which was near fortie miles) I ſaw as rich a Countrie as ever my Eies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, ſtockt with goodlie <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Barlie,</hi> and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Meadows and Paſtures. The ſoil began to alter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to worſ, midwaie between <hi>Bridges</hi> and <hi>Gaunt,</hi> which were twentie four <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles aſunder; and ſo ſoon as I was paſt <hi>Gaunt,</hi> in my journie towards <hi>Antwerp,</hi> I did ſee ſuch Land, for about twentie miles together, that I cannot compare anie ground more like, then the Land by <hi>Sandie Chappel,</hi> three miles diſtance from <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames.</hi> A great part of the Highwaies, out of the Road and Track of Horſes and Carts, did bear Heath; and ſuch Incloſures, on the inſide of the Waies, which were not kept in Tillage, did either produce <hi>Heath</hi> or <hi>Broom</hi> of their own natures. The ſoil did not much amend until I came within two miles of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> which was thirtie <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Gaunt.</hi> There I ſaw a goodlie Marſh or feeding ground for Cattel, which was kept with a ſtrong Banck for beeing overflowed by the River of <hi>Sceld,</hi> under which notwithſtanding there lay Sluces to let in the Water when they pleaſed, and Ditches were made in the Marſh to convey it back into the River at low Tides when they thought fit. On the other ſide of <hi>Antwerp</hi> was Contribution-land lying in <hi>Brabant,</hi> which naturally was as barren and apt to Heath as anie land betwixt that Citie, and <hi>Gaunt.</hi> I ſtaied not long at <hi>Antwerp</hi> before I returned to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently reviewing the Countrie as I went back, I could finde no other Corn to grow there, then <hi>Rie, Oats,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29776:6"/>
               <hi>French Wheat</hi>; which ſeemed a ſufficient Teſtimonie to mee of the barrenneſs of the ſoil, which would neither bear <hi>Wheat, Barlie,</hi> or <hi>Peaſ</hi>; and for that the former Grains did uſually grow in <hi>England</hi> upon the edg of Forreſts and Heathie grounds. A few daies after my return, I fell into diſcourſ with a Dutch <hi>Merchant,</hi> then living at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> but had lived ſom years in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and told him that I did not think that all <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> had yielded ſo much barren ground as I had ſeen between <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Antwerp.</hi> Hee anſwered mee that that Land was the richeſt part of all <hi>Flanders.</hi> I ſmiled to hear him ſay ſo, thinking at firſt hee had jeſted, and I replied, that I believed, that one Acre of Land between <hi>Bridges</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> was worth ten Acres of anie Land I ſaw there between <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerp</hi> (excepting the Marſh-land and ſom little ſtraps of Meadow by the River ſide): for one did bear goodlie <hi>Wheat, Barlie,</hi> and <hi>Peaſ,</hi> and was in manie places naturally excellent Meadow and Paſture; and the other would carrie no other Corn, but <hi>Rie, French Wheat,</hi> and <hi>Oats,</hi> and would never bear anie conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able graſs, but turn'd preſently after it was laid down, to Heath or Broom. The Merchant told mee again, that their beſt Commodities were pul'd and cut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went that waie; but hee would prove that the Land did yield more profit yearly then the beſt Land in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that the <hi>Bores</hi> (for ſo they term their <hi>Farmers</hi>) were richer then in anie part of the Countrie. I muſt confeſs at firſt I thought his diſcourſ to bee ſom kind of Riddle, but ſeeing him earneſt in affirming that, which ſeem'd ſtrange to mee; I deſired him to explain himſelf, how it was poſſible, that, that Land

ſhould yield more profit then the other. I will tell you (ſaid hee) the reaſon, why it yeildeth more profit, is, becauſ that Land is natural to bear <hi>Flax,</hi> which is called the <hi>Wealth</hi> of <hi>Flanders</hi>; and one Acre of good <hi>Flax</hi> is worth four or five Acres of the beſt <hi>Corn,</hi> which groweth between <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Bridges</hi>; and after the <hi>Flax</hi> is pull'd, it will bear a Crop of <hi>Turneps</hi>; which may bee better worth, Acre for Acre, then the beſt Corn in the Countrie. After that Crop is off, about April following you may ſow the ſame Land with <hi>Oats</hi>; and upon them <hi>Clover-graſs</hi> ſeed onelie harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with buſhes, which will com up after the <hi>Oats</hi> are mowed, and that year yield you a verie great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture till Chriſtmas; and the next year following you may cut that graſs three times, and it will everie time bear ſuch a burden, and ſo good to feed all ſorts of Cattel, as the beſt Meadows in the Countrie do not yield the like; and will continue good four or five years together without ſowing it. After this wee parted. At firſt I wondered much at his diſcourſ; but much more at the ignorance and ſloathfulneſs of our Countrie which beeing near to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and manie Merchants and Gentlemen travelling thither daily, none ſhould underſtand, or at leaſt put in practice theſe <hi>Husbandries,</hi> there beeing ſo much Barren and Heathie Land in <hi>England</hi> of verie little value, which might by following their Example in theſe <hi>Husbandries</hi> bee made more profitable, then the beſt Land in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I after pondered what the Merchant ſaid all that daie and the next, and then began to imagine with my ſelf, what an huge <hi>Improvement</hi> I might make of my own Eſtate, if theſe things were true which hee had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29776:7"/>
told mee; and if God Almightie pleaſed to permit mee quietly to enjoie it. And to bee further ſatisfied, I ſent another <hi>Dutchman</hi> in the Town that had been in <hi>England,</hi> with whom I was grown acquainted, and deſired him to inform himſelf from ſom of the <hi>Bores</hi> in the Countrie, whether thoſe things the Merchant had affirmed to mee were true. Hee returned mee an Anſwer from three or four, whom hee ſaid hee knew to bee honeſt men and underſtanding thoſe <hi>Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries,</hi> that a <hi>Gammet</hi> of <hi>Flax,</hi> (which was their Acre, but ſomwhat more in quantitie then ours) might well produce fourtie or fiftie pounds worth of <hi>Flax,</hi> if the Land were well dung'd and Husbanded, and ſowed with good Eaſt-Countrie ſeed, and that it pleas'd God to ſend convenient rain after it was ſowed, and a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time till Harveſt. Theſe were no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, then I conceived all other ſeeds and grain to bee ſubject to, either to prove good or bad. And for the other queſtions wherein I deſired to bee ſatisfied, concerning the <hi>Turneps</hi> and <hi>Clover-graſs,</hi> hee told mee they did concur in all with the Merchant, without anie other condition or limitation. The Winter after I did examine divers perſons upon the like queſtions, who I thought did underſtand that buſineſs, and found very little difference in their relations. And in April fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which was the chiefeſt time for ſowing of <hi>Flax</hi> and <hi>Clover-graſs,</hi> I did often walk into the Fields a mile or more out of the Town, and expoſtulated the buſineſs with the <hi>Bores,</hi> when they were ſowing of <hi>Flax</hi> and <hi>Clover-graſs</hi>-ſeed, and afterwards obſerv'd that theſe things did proſper verie well, on ſuch ground as I conceiv'd to bee extreme barren of its own Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29776:8"/>But further to inform my ſelf more fully what an Acre of <hi>Flax</hi> might bee worth, I bought an <hi>Engliſh</hi> rod of <hi>Flax,</hi> when it was grown up, neither the beſt nor worſt, and cauſed it to bee pull'd, water'd, and dreſs'd by it ſelf; then valued it as <hi>Flax</hi> was ſold the week following in the market at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and the ſeed likewiſe afterwards. I caſt up what eightie rod, which was an Acre, would riſe unto, according to that valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I found that it came to thirtie ſix pound, fourteen ſhillings, ſix pence, and though by that rate an Acre did not com to fortie pound, yet it made mee believ, that an Acre of good <hi>Flax</hi> might bee worth fortie pound and more; for that which I tried was but indifferent <hi>Flax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I went preſently afterwards to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and ſaw almoſt everie third or fourth field by the highwaie ſide for twentie five miles together, ſtocked with goodlie <hi>Flax,</hi> far beyond that which I bought to make my Trial off; Whereof ſom was pull'd, and the reſt was ready to pull. The ſimilitude of a great quantitie of Land I had in <hi>England</hi> unto theirs in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> which I ſaw did bear their richeſt Commodities: and my Loſs in <hi>England</hi> both of perſonal and real Eſtate, made mee enquire after all <hi>Husbandries</hi> of thoſe Countries, of ſuch as I conceiv'd could anie way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct mee, that I might learn ſomthing, or other, whereby to repair my fortunes, if hereafter it pleas'd Almightie God to give mee leav to enjoie my own Eſtate in Peace again. And beeing one daie in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of ſom Merchants, It happen'd that <hi>diſcourſ</hi> fell out about <hi>Improvement</hi> of their barren ground. I ſaid that I had a great quantitie of Barren and Heathie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29776:8"/>
Land in <hi>England,</hi> that I thought might bee eaſily brought to bear <hi>Flax, Turneps,</hi> and <hi>Clover-graſs</hi> as well as their barren Lands did in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant.</hi> To which a Merchant anſwered, that hee would carrie mee to a man within three miles of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who had taken a <hi>Farm upon Improvement,</hi> which was juſt ſuch Heathie Land as I deſcrib'd mine to bee. For hee was about five years ſince to have bought it, and when hee ſaw it all Heath, hee would not meddle with it; but the <hi>Farmer</hi> had ſo improv'd it alreadie, that hee had now growing upon it, a Nurſerie of twelv Acres of all ſorts of Trees, as <hi>Pear</hi>-Trees, <hi>Apple</hi>-Trees, <hi>Cherrie</hi>-Trees, <hi>Cheſnut</hi> and <hi>Walnut</hi>-Trees, <hi>Oaks, Aſhes, Elms,</hi> and the like; hee had there alſo growing, both <hi>Flax, Turneps, Clover-graſs, Roman Beans</hi> and moſt ſorts of Corn, and hee had planted a <hi>Hop</hi>-ground and an <hi>Orchard</hi>; hee ſaid hee would tell mee what <hi>Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie</hi> hee uſed to make ſuch a ſtrange Converſion, and that I could not pleaſ him better then to com to ſee it: and hee did aſſure mee, that it was worth my Journie to bee inform'd from him: for never a man in that Countrie could better inſtruct mee, then hee; and I will (ſaid hee) go thither with you, when you pleaſ. I thanked him verie kindly for his offer, and told him I would wait upon him thither to morrow morning. It was agreed between us both to ſee this wonder. But I asked him before wee parted, what that taking of a <hi>Farm upon Improvement</hi> was, which hee before did ſpeak of. Hee anſwered, that when another had bought the Land, this man offered more Rent then hee could make of it at that time, to have a Leaſ for one &amp; twentie years, upon condition, that whatſoever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29776:9"/>
four indifferent perſons (whereof two to bee choſen by the one, and two by the other) ſhould judg the Farm to bee improved above the Rent at the end of his Leaſ, the <hi>Owner</hi> was to pay ſo much in value to the Tenant for his improving it. I told him it was a waie of letting land I never knew of before: Hee anſwered it was an ordinarie waie with them of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch barren Land, as men could not tell how to manage themſelvs.</p>
            <p>The next daie, wee went thither, and the firſt thing wee ſaw was his <hi>Nurſerie of trees,</hi> which did grow and proſper verie well, and hee made accompt they would yield him ten thouſand pounds before his Leaſ was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired and as I remember hee valued them one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other but at two ſhillings a tree. Then I ſaw a little <hi>Cloſe of flax,</hi> which I eſteemed to bee about three eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh acres: of which flax hee told mee, the Merchant that brought mee thither before I came from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> that hee had made a hundred and fiftie pounds, which was by computation fiftie pounds an Acre. I alſo ſaw growing there verie good <hi>Turneps,</hi> and excellent <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-graſs,</hi> which hee valued to bee then worth twelv pound an acre. I after ſaw it cutting the firſt daie of <hi>June</hi> 1644, beeing then two foot long, and very thick, and went thither again the nine and twentieth daie of the ſame moneth, and ſaw the ſame graſs grown up, and then cutting again, beeing twentie Inches long, I ſaw it cutting again in <hi>August</hi> following, beeing then eighteen inches long. I viewed the grounds round about, and found the skirts of the Cloſes left unploughed to bee heath: and both hee and the Merchant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, all the reſt, where his <hi>flax</hi> and <hi>Clover-graſs</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:29776:9"/>
grew, was heath but three years before. I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie inquiſitive of him to know what husbandrie hee uſed to the land, for to convert it from heath to bear ſuch rich Commodities. Hee told mee, firſt hee broke it up with a ſtrong Team of horſes, then ploughed it croſs, afterwards tore off the heath with a great harrow, then gathered it up and burnt it, and laid about twentie loads of dung upon an acre, and ſpread it upon the Land; then ploughed it again, and ſowed the firſt crop with <hi>Rye,</hi> the next with <hi>Oats</hi>; and when hee had harrowed his <hi>oats,</hi> hee ſowed <hi>Clovergraſs</hi> ſeed upon them, which hee harrowed with a bundle of buſhes under his harrow, and that came, after the Oats was off, to bee of a verie good paſture before <hi>Michaëlmas</hi>; and this third year hee had mowed the <hi>Clover-graſs</hi> thrice, as I had ſeen, and it would com to a verie good paſture quickly, to feed till <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>; and the ſame hee thought hee ſhould do for three years more; but afterwards the ground would turn to an ordinarie graſs. Hee ſaid, hee uſed his ground where his flax grew, as his other; but firſt again, about half the quantitie of dung hee did at firſt; and then ſowed it with <hi>flax,</hi> and upon the flax <hi>Clovergraſs</hi>-ſeed, as hee had don before upon the <hi>Oats.</hi> his <hi>Roman-beans,</hi> his Hops, and <hi>Orchard</hi> thrived verie well, and all with the ſame quantitie of dung, proportionably uſed; for there they know no other <hi>Manure.</hi> I askt him how hee could make 12 l an acre of this <hi>Clover-graſs</hi>: hee ſaid, either dy feeding <hi>Cattle,</hi> or keeping <hi>Kine,</hi> or laying it for ſeed after the firſt cutt. For an Acre of it beeing made part into haie, and the reſt fed green, would
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29776:10"/>
keep four Kine, winter and ſummer; and an Acre laid for ſeed might carrrie five buſhels, which valued at 6 d. a pound, come's to 8 l. Sterling; beſides the firſt and ſecond cuts of graſs and hay, and the after-paſture. Hee ſaid the beſt time for ſowing <hi>flax</hi> and <hi>Clovergraſs</hi>-ſeeds was about the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> preſently after a ſhour of rain. Som conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſowing of <hi>flax</hi> untill the end of <hi>Maie,</hi> and ſom ſow after; though I know no cauſ to commend their ſlowneſs, in ſowing of it ſo late. I was not verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive after his other Commodities. I ſaw by his <hi>Turneps</hi> which hee had ſowed upon his heathie land, at his firſt breaking up, that hee differed in that point from all other husband-men in thoſe Countries, who ſowed them immediately after <hi>Rye</hi> or <hi>flax</hi>; but thoſe things are left to everie ones ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to proceed therein as hee think's beſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Obſervation. Now what I had obſerved here, and between <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> my Reaſon told mee, grounded upon ſom former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that there was no land that naturally bore heath, beeing either of a ſandie, or loamie mould, but might by <hi>devonſhiring</hi> firſt (which I prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Husbandrie in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereunto adding ſom <hi>Dung,</hi> or <hi>Lime,</hi> or <hi>Marle,</hi> in fit proportion as ſhall bee hereafter expreſſed) may bee made better then the beſt land, that <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>England</hi> doth afford. For no man with reaſon can denie, but that <hi>Land is beſt, which will bring forth ſuch Commodities as will yield moſt monie to make one wealthie and rich</hi>; for though wealth and Riches may conſiſt either in Cattle, Corn, houſholdſtuff, Plate, Jewels; yet,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29776:10"/>
when thoſe things are valued, wee commonly ſay, they are worth ſo much <hi>monie.</hi> So <hi>Regina Pecunia, Monie</hi> is the <hi>Queen</hi> that commands all. Now if the ſame quantitie of Acres of poor heathie Land, by producing <hi>Flax, Turneps,</hi> and <hi>Clovergraſs,</hi> will yield more monie then the rich Land, which beareth wheat, barlie, meadow, and good paſture: then by conſequence it followeth, that the <hi>poor</hi> Land is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the <hi>Rich.</hi> And I ſuppoſe that they finde by experience in <hi>Flanders</hi> that their rich land will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bear thoſe Commodities; otherwiſe they could not bee ignorant that they do ſo far exceed their beſt Corn and Meadows in matter of profit, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth clearly by their own valuations: for they value an Acre of <hi>flax</hi> may bee worth fortie or fiftie pound. An Acre of <hi>Turneps</hi> worth eight pound, or ten pound; an Acre of <hi>Clovergraſs</hi> worth ten or twelv pound, whereas they value their beſt <hi>barlie</hi> may bee worth ten or twelv pound, their beſt <hi>wheat</hi> may bee worth five or ſix pound an Acre, and their beſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow worth four or five pound an Acre: Now if yee compare the value of theſe Commodities together, ſuppoſing the rich Land will not bear the other, which are the richer Commodities, ſo well as the poor; you muſt needs conclude the poorer Land to bee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And it is a ſtrong Argument to mee, that their rich land will not bear thoſe rich Commodities ſo naturally as the heathie and ſandie Land doth; for though I went often between <hi>Bridges</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which is thirtie nine miles, beeing the richeſt Land in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and where there is goodlie <hi>wheat, barlie,</hi> and <hi>meadows,</hi> as ever my eyes beheld; yet I never
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29776:11"/>
ſaw in all that ground, to my remembrance, one Acre of <hi>Flax,</hi> or <hi>Clover-graſs</hi>: whereas, on the contrarie, between <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> (which is thirtie miles, and the pooreſt Land in all the Countrie, much like <hi>Sandie</hi>-Chappel in <hi>Surreie,</hi> or ſom part of the Heathie Land in <hi>Windſor Forrest</hi>) I have ſeen manie hundreds of Acres of goodly <hi>Flax, Turneps,</hi> and <hi>Clover-graſs,</hi> cloſe by the Highwaie ſide, and their Corn there not anie thing but <hi>Rie, French Wheat,</hi> and <hi>Oats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not onelie dung, which cauſeth the fertilitie in thoſe Barren, Heathie, and ſandie Lands for to bring forth thoſe rich Commodities; but partly the nature of thoſe ſeeds, which do delight to grow rather in a light and gentle Land, then in one too ſtiff and heavie. Though it is true, that dung is of that virtue, that it heat's, fatten's, ſweeten's, and reclaim's all Barren grounds: and unſlakt <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Marl</hi> are of as great an Efficacie, beeing proportionably tempered with <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Aſhes,</hi> and of longer continuance to enrich Land, as I will ſhew hereafter. But becauſ ſom will ſay, that the <hi>burning of the Turff</hi> (which wee call <hi>Devonſhiring</hi>) will make the ground the worſ after three years, I do moſt confidently affirm, upon my own experience, that, with the addition of <hi>Dung,</hi> or <hi>Lime,</hi> or <hi>Marl,</hi> in fit proportions, there is no ſuch <hi>Husbandrie</hi> in the World, perfectly to prepare anie Heathie Land and make it nouriſh, receiv and ripen ſeeds. For the Earth is, as it were, renued by the Fire, having no other Roots in the entrails of it, produceth nothing for manie years but what one ſow's upon it; and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main vigorous enough to ſerv as long as one of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and underſtanding will deſire it. And therefore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29776:11"/>
I ſhall advize you to prefer this <hi>Husbandrie</hi> upon your Heathie Land before anie other.</p>
            <p>Though they have no other manure to mend their Land, but Dung in the Barren and Heathie Land in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi>: yet they have a verie fine way in <hi>Brabant</hi> to raiſ a great quantitie of Dung; the practice whereof may much advance the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Leonard's</hi> Forreſt. They that keep ſheep there, upon the Heaths, houſ them everie night, and in the Summer, at noon, firſt having lai'd three or four Inches of Sand at the bottom of the Floor, wherein they lodg their ſheep for a night or two, which tread their Dung and Piſs into the Sand, and ſo they daily uſe more Sand to bee uſed in the ſame manner, until the quantitie bee grown ſo great, that the ſheep cannot conveniently go in or out. Then they caſt that out of the Houſ, and put in more Sand, and ſo proceed throughout the year, and by that means three or four hundred ſheep will raiſ one thouſand Loads of Dung in a year: and eight hundred ſheep two thouſand Loads, which, allowing twentie Loads to an Acre, will Dung an hundred Acres yearly: and this Dung by experience doth mightily improve ſuch Heathie Land as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Leonard's</hi> is. Beſides there is <hi>Marl</hi> in moſt part of the <hi>Forrests.</hi> I account anie <hi>mine</hi> that is free from ſtones, and lieth ſo thick, as it is worth the digging, and near and convenient to carrie to your Land, and of clammie ſubſtance, when it is wet, though it ſeem onely <hi>Clay</hi> or <hi>Loam,</hi> yet to bee <hi>Marl,</hi> and verie good Manure for Sandie and Heathie Land, bee it of what Color it will; as either Graie, Yellow, or Blue; and fortie Loads of it laid upon an Acre in Summer, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29776:12"/>
preſently ſpread, and ſo let lie all Winter to incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the earth, then <hi>Devonſhired</hi> the next <hi>March,</hi> and ſpread upon the Land and Sow'd, will mightily improve it. I did uſe ſix Acres thus, that was nothing but <hi>Heath,</hi> and had two Crops of Corn from it; and the third year it came of it ſelf to bee as good Graſs, as ever I ſaw grow in anie Meadow in <hi>England.</hi> I ſaw another great Improvement in Clement <hi>Stoke's</hi> Farm adjoyning to the Forreſt; hee had Land, that hee let out, two years together, for twelv pence an Acre: at laſt hee <hi>Devonſhired</hi> it, and cauſed his hills, before they were burnt, to bee ſet a juſt rod ſquare one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when they were burnt, hee put a peck of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlackt <hi>Lime,</hi> which was fortie Buſhels, this <hi>Lime</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlackt in the hills, with the firſt Rain was mingled together with the Aſhes, and then ſpread upon the Land, and after Sow'd with <hi>Wheat</hi>; and brought as good as anie was in the Countrie: brought next year a verie good Crop of <hi>Oats,</hi> and the year following com to as good Graſs as anie hee had to his Farm. This I hold to bee the cheapeſt <hi>Husbandrie</hi>: becauſ four or five Load of <hi>Fern,</hi> of which there is ſtore in the Forreſt, beeing cut from the beginning of <hi>July</hi> to the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> will burn off twelv Loads of <hi>Chalk Lime</hi>; and though your <hi>Chalk</hi> coſt dear the bringing thither; yet the <hi>Lime</hi> will not ſtand you in twelv ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a Load, and by this waie you ſave much carriage, and ſo by conſequence may compaſs to manure year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much more Land. As for Example, you carrie but one Load of <hi>Lime</hi> to your Land, whereas by the other waies you muſt carrie twentie Loads of Dung; and fortie Loads of Marl. So as by the <hi>Lime,</hi> if that will
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29776:12"/>
do as well, you may <hi>Lime</hi> twentie Acres as ſoon as you can Dung one Acre, and fortie Acres for one with <hi>Marl</hi>; But I advize you to make Trial your ſelv's of all theſe ſeveral <hi>Husbandries,</hi> and then to follow that which you finde cheapeſt and beſt.</p>
            <p>I have ſet down at large, how I came firſt to know the <hi>Husbandries,</hi> and how I was ſatisfied in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. I have alſo ſet down three ſeveral waies to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your Land; now I will lay down the charge in ſeveraltie; then caſt up the profit from one Acre to five and twentie Acres; then to fiftie, and ſo to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Acres; by which it ſhall appear, that by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie waie of <hi>Husbandrie,</hi> according to the valew, which they make of like Commodities in <hi>Flanders,</hi> how that by improving a hundred Acres of Heathie Land everie year, as namely of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Leonard's</hi> Forreſt, and Sowing the Seeds of <hi>Flax, Turneps,</hi> and <hi>Clover-graſs,</hi> you may in five years improve five hundred Acres to bee worth abov ſeven thouſand pounds a year. The particular charge of an Acre of <hi>Flax</hi> is as followeth.</p>

Money will com in for <hi>Flax</hi> continually, ſo as indeed you ſhall not go out abov ſeven hundred pound at all in ſtock, and after the firſt years profit is com in, you cannot Account that you are out anie thing from your purſ, becauſ you have your full ſtock again, and three thouſand pound more.</p>
            <p>But this is not all the profit you are to exſpect from your hundred Acres the firſt year; for after the <hi>Flax</hi> is pull'd, which will bee either in <hi>Julie</hi> or <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the ſame Land may bee ſowed with <hi>Turneps,</hi> and, prove ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Flanders</hi> Account, worth eight pound an Acre, over and abov all charges: ſo twentie five Acres cometh to two hundred pound; fiftie Acres to four hundred pound, and an hundred Acres to eight hundred pound. They ſow in <hi>Flanders</hi> but two Buſhels and a half of <hi>Turnep</hi> ſeed upon an Acre, which was worth, when I was there, but twelv pound, and plough it once after the <hi>Flax</hi> is pull'd, they harrow it, and weed it, if there bee cauſ, and that is all their charge concerning that buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Both theſe Crops are ſow'd, ripe and readie to bee pull'd within eight moneths; that is, between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>April</hi> and the end of <hi>November</hi>: ſo the profit of an hundred Acres, the firſt year, cometh to, beſides all charges on this Account, unto three thouſand eight hundred pound. And the hundred pound al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd for charges, may very well com into your purſ again within the other four Months.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Turneps</hi> are pull'd, I would have the ſame hundred Acres made readie again to bee ſow'd with <hi>Clover-graſs</hi> ſeed alone, about the beginning of <hi>April</hi> then next following, therein altering the cuſtom

            <p>Thus have I plainly ſhewed what I promiſed in my Preface, that was, how an induſtrious man in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> would convert five hundred Acres of barren and heathie Land from little value in five years to bee worth above ſeven thouſand pounds a year.</p>
            <p>You ſee, you have better means to mend your Land then they have; your Land lieth in a manner under the ſame Climate; for <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>Mecklin</hi> are in one degree; the Soil is much alike, as I have ſhewed, you may have as good a vent for your Commodities, as they have for theirs, if you pleaſ; and therefore I do not know what Reaſon can hinder you from putting thoſe things into practice.</p>
            <p>You may continue this yearlie profit of ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eight hundred a year upon this five hundred Acres. If you will by <hi>Liming, dunging,</hi> or <hi>marling,</hi> and <hi>devonſhiring</hi> again the firſt hundred Acres, laid down with <hi>Clover-graſs,</hi> and ſowing it with <hi>flax,</hi> and <hi>Turneps</hi> as before, and ſo go round with everie hundred acres, as formerly in its courſ; but having great ſtore of barren and heathie ground, you were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29776:16"/>
better improve that, and let the <hi>Clover-graſs</hi> continue as long as it will. And if after five years continuance it turneth to a mingled Graſs; yet that will bee as good as moſt Meadows and Paſtures, that I know in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>; for it turn's commonly from a red honie ſuckle to a white, which wee repute the ſweeteſt Graſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it doth not carrie the greateſt burthen. And I am perſwaded it will continue longer if it bee kept for Seed and cut but twice, whereas they commonly cut it thrice a year in <hi>Flanders</hi> alwaies in the Sap, which will kill Fern.</p>
            <p>Now I will ſhew you how they vent theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, that you may learn the better, how to vent yours. Firſt, they make great ſtore of Linnen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, and ſend it moſt for <hi>London,</hi> what they make not in Cloth; they have a Market every Thurſdaie at a place call'd St <hi>Nicolas,</hi> almoſt midwaie between <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Gaunt,</hi> whither Merchants com on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to buy it, and ſend it into <hi>Holland,</hi> and there ſell it at dear rates. I met with a Linnen Draper of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> when I was at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and queſtioning him what vent there was for <hi>Flax</hi> at <hi>London</hi>: hee told mee that before theſe troubleſom times, if I had had a verie great quantitie, hee could have helped mee to Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to have bought it off at dearer rates at <hi>London,</hi> then uſually they ſold it at in <hi>Flanders</hi>; for hee ſaid hee did believ there was not leſs then a hundred thouſand pounds worth of <hi>Flax</hi> brought yearly into <hi>England</hi> from forreign parts; a great part whereof to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg was ſent from <hi>London</hi> into Lancaſhier; there made into Cloth, and afterwards brought back in Cloth, and ſold in <hi>London</hi>; and if times grew peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29776:17"/>
again in <hi>England,</hi> hee told mee I need not doubt the venting of more <hi>Flax</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> then ever I would have to ſell; and two honeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants of my Acquaintance did aſſure mee, that if I could not ſell my <hi>Flax</hi> at <hi>London</hi> to my content, they would tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport it for mee into <hi>Holland,</hi> where I might fell it dearer, then they ſold their <hi>Flax</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi>: for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants uſually ſent for <hi>Flax</hi> out of <hi>Flanders</hi> and ſold it again in <hi>Holland,</hi> at dearer rates then they paied for it there.</p>
            <p>But if you finde that theſe Commodities thrive with you, and you grow rich by them; I would adviſe you to ſend for ſom workmen out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Manufacture of Linnen Cloath, and make your <hi>Flax</hi> into Linnen Cloath, you cannot chooſ but gain by it exceedingly, when you are aforehand with the World, if they live by it who fetch it firſt from <hi>London</hi> into Lancaſhire by Land; beeing made in Cloth, recarrie it up; and beſides you ſhall do a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable deed by bringing in that Manufacture into the Kingdom. For it keep's a very great number of poor Women and Children at Work in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> that otherwiſe would not have means to live. So by this waie you ſhould bee ſure to vent your <hi>Flax,</hi> and withall procure a publick benefit to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Husbandrie</hi> of <hi>Turneps</hi> is as Common between <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as that of <hi>Flax</hi>; for, as there is more <hi>Flax</hi> ſowed there, then of anie other <hi>Grain</hi> or Corn; ſo Commonly, after the <hi>Flax</hi> is pull'd, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately they ſow <hi>Turneps,</hi> and preſently after their <hi>Rie</hi>; what they do not eat themſelvs they give unto their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29776:17"/>
Cattel; they will feed Oxen and Kine as fat, as Hay or Oats; the Roots beeing clean Waſhed, and then Roots and Leavs beeing put into a Trough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there ſtampt together with a Spitter, and after boil'd in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and given to Kine will make them abound in Milk, yet grow ſo fat withall, that you would wonder at it. The onely difficultie is to make you Cattel eat them at firſt; but breed them up by hand, as they do there. Others do the ſame alreadie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in manie parts of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> they will take <hi>Turneps</hi> and eat, or anie other thing you will give them.</p>
            <p>To encourage you the more to ſow <hi>Turneps,</hi> I will demonſtrate unto you what an Acre of them tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted may bee worth by Calculation as they are ſold in <hi>London.</hi> They commonly there ſell four or five <hi>Turneps</hi> in a bunch for a pennie. A rod ſquare bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſixteen foot and a half may bear a thouſand eight hundred and nine <hi>Turneps,</hi> beeing ſet at half a foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the one from the other. Now ſuppoſe that a thouſand cometh to good, and five ſold for a pennie, then a Rod of them amount's to ſixteen ſhillings eight pence, and an Acre of them beeing eightſcore Rod by the ſame Account, com's to abov thirtie pound, and therefore certainly an hundred Acres ſow'd, may bee very well valu'd at eight pound an Acre one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, when you have brought your Cattel to eat them as theirs do.</p>
            <p>I told you before how in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> they made twelv pound an Acre of their <hi>Clover-graſs,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by feeding Cattle, keeping Kine, or by the ſeed; which, commonly encreaſing to five Buſhels upon an Acre, was worth eight pound when it was ſold, but at
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29776:18"/>
ſixpence a pound; but beeing ſold for two ſhillings a pound (which price I my ſelf now paid for it) the value of the Seed quadruple's from eight pound to thirtie two pound an Acre; and the man that ſold mee ſeed this year for two ſhillings a pound, deſir's all that I can ſpare, the next year at the ſame price, if you get but into the beſt kind of thoſe they uſe in <hi>Flanders.</hi> For when your Neighbors ſee your Labors thrive and proſper ſo far as to convert your Land which bore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Heath, for manie Ages, <hi>First</hi> into excellent <hi>Flax, then</hi> into ſuch delicate <hi>Turneps,</hi> as they never ſaw before or taſted, and to end with ſuch <hi>Clover-graſs,</hi> as they will admire, when they once ſee your Crops, and ſomwhat underſtand, that you do reap ſom benefit by them, they will com to you as to an <hi>Oracle</hi> to ask your Counſel, and bee inſtructed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it from you as a favor, at firſt to buy your Seed at anie reaſonable price.</p>
            <p>But if you finde that you have more Seed of <hi>Flax</hi> and <hi>Turneps</hi> (if you will let them grow to Seed) then you can vent, you muſt then ſet up either a <hi>Water-Mill,</hi> or <hi>Wind-Mill,</hi> as they do in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and make them into <hi>Oil</hi>; both which Seeds mak's good <hi>Oil,</hi> which you may bee ſure to ſell in <hi>London</hi> at good Rates.</p>
            <p>And for your <hi>Clover-graſs</hi>-ſeed, if you finde you cannot ſell it to your content, you may chooſ whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will let it grow to Seed or not; and if you do not let it grow to Seed, you may cut it once more in a year, then otherwiſe you could do.</p>
            <p>You muſt change your <hi>Flax</hi> Seed, though never ſo good at firſt after four years, the other Seeds do not ſo much require it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:29776:18"/>I doubt not but theſe things will ſeem as ſtrange to you at firſt, as they did to mee; and therefore I deſire you but to try what I propoſe, upon ſuch profitable Terms, as no man, that is well in his wits, but will venture at them, beeing laid down ſo plainly to you, as a childe may underſtand them.</p>
            <p>You may obſerv, that <hi>Flax, Turneps</hi> and <hi>Clover-graſs,</hi> alreadie grow in <hi>England</hi>; but there is as much difference between what groweth there, and here, as is between the ſame thing, which groweth in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and that which groweth wilde in the Fields.</p>
            <p>To prevent what may bee ſtrange or troubleſom to you at Firſt for want of knowledg, I would adviſe you to ſend to <hi>Tom</hi> or <hi>Robin</hi> to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> where by means of ſom of their old Acquaintance there, they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide you a ſervant, who underſtand's theſe ſeveral Husbandries as well as anie of ours do the <hi>Husbandrie</hi> in getting Corn; and by obſerving of his practice, you your ſelv's, or whom you will appoint may bee ſufficiently inſtructed in a year or two ſo far, as to Command ſuch things to bee don by others as are not fit and neceſſarie to bee don by your ſelv's.</p>
            <p>Beſides the exceſſive profit you will reap by Sowing theſe Commodities, imagine what a pleaſure it will bee to your Eies and Sent, to ſee the Ruſſet Heath turn'd into greeneſt Graſs; which doth produce moſt ſweet and pleaſing Honie-Suckles; and what Praiſ and Reputation you will gain by your Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, firſt introducing that into your Countrie, which beeing followed by others, muſt need's redound to the general benefit of the whole Common-wealth. I do by my <hi>Will</hi> Command you for to execute no more,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29776:19"/>
then what I would my ſelf to morrow put in practice, if I had Libertie: you ſhould learn theſe things I have ſet down by <hi>Examples,</hi> which I am enforc'd to leav you as a Father's <hi>Precepts,</hi> and with a Father's bleſſing to you all, deſiring God Almightie to guide you and direct you in all your Actions, I will leav you to his divine protection and providence.</p>
