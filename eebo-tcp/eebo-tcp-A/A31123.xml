            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE of the Bayliffs and Burgeſſes Of the BOROUGH of DROYTWICH In the County of <hi>WORCESTER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>ING <hi>John</hi> by Charter in the 17th. year of his Reign, granted to the Burgeſſes of <hi>Wych,</hi> and their Heirs, all he had in <hi>Wych,</hi> together with the Salt Springs, Liberties, Cuſtoms, and Apurtinances under a Fee-Farm Rent of 100 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling <hi>per annum,</hi> by virtue of which Grant, the Burgeſſes became ſeized of the Salt Springs in Fee.</p>
            <p>There have all along been Three Salt Springs or Pits, two in <hi>Nether-Wych,</hi> and one in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p-Wych,</hi> within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of <hi>Droytwich;</hi> and the ſalt Water ſpringing in the two Pits in <hi>Nether-Wych</hi> hath been divided into Thirty two Shares or Parts, called Bullaries or Phats; and the Water ſpringing in the Pit in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p-Wych</hi> into about 372.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Burgeſſes have always been a Body Politick, and ſent Members to Parliament, 26 <hi>Edv. primi</hi> (before any other Charter was granted to them) and have made By-Laws for the Regulation and Government of the Salt Works, and two of them were yearly elected Bayliffs for collecting the Fee-Farm Rent, and putting the By-Laws in execution: For the payment of which Rent, and for the maintenance of the Rights and Cuſtoms of the Corporation, they give 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Security when they enter into Office.</p>
            <p>The Burgeſsſhip hath deſcended from Anceſtor to Heir, and for ſupportation of the Corporation, it hath been the uſuage and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of making Burgeſſes two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> A Burgeſs by Birth hath had power to make his younger Children, Brothers or Siſters Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, by granting to each a quarter of a Bullary or Phat of inheritance, which is called Adoption; and the Burgeſſes at their general Aſſemblies have had power, by unanimous conſent, to elect any Perſon having a quarter of a Bullary or Phat of Inheritance a Burgeſs, and without ſuch ſhare of Inheritance none could be made or continue a Burgeſs.</p>
            <p>The Burgeſſes have granted ſeveral of the ſaid Shares of Salt Water to other Perſons, but no part of the Soil of the ſaid Pits, which ſtill remains in the Burgeſſes, and the Purchaſers have right only to Proportions of the Salt Water, in the ſame manner as Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants have to Harbage where the Soil is the Lords, and were never eſteemed Burgeſſes, or admitted to Vote in their Aſſemblies, but were always diſtinguiſhed from the Burgeſſes, and are called Commoners; and when any Commoner purchaſed or aliened Poſſeſſion was delivered and received by a Burgeſs by Letter of Attorny, and no Commoner has any Poſſeſſion in the Pits, nor can call any Brine his own before it be delivered to him by the Bailiffs.</p>
            <p>The Burgeſſes are now about Fifty five, who have about 150 Shares or Phats; there are about Sixty Commoners, who have about 100 Shares, and are ſatisfied with the preſent Government; and the Commoners who complain are about Thirty five, and have about 150 Shares.</p>
            <p>The Bayliffs deſray all publick Charges relating to the Salt Works, and a Month before the expiration of their Office, deliver their Accounts to the Town-Clerk, where all Perſons concerned in the Salt Works may have Copies, and liberty to object againſt them at the general Aſſembly or great Houſe before they are paſſed, which is always held upon a day certain. And all Orders made at the leſſer Aſſemblies are controulable at the next General Aſſembly or great Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Bayliffs have an Allowance in Salt Water for ſatisfaction of their Disburſtments.</p>
            <p>That ſeveral of the Commoners exhibited a Bill in Chancery complaining of miſ-management of the Salt Works by the Bayliffs and Burgeſſes, and 8 <hi>Car. prim.</hi> the Cauſe came to hearing before the late Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> who (as a Purchaſer) had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Eſtate of Inheritance; and a Decree was then made by conſent of all Parties, whereby the Cuſtoms of the Corporation were affirmed, and the Right of Government of the Salt Works declared to be in the Burgeſſes, and hath been ſo adjudged upon ſeveral Tryals at the Bar, and no Judgment hath ever been given to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Commoners, who are now Proſecutors, and would have the Government, exhibited a Bill in Chancery about Four Years ſince, ſetting forth, That every Perſon who hath a quarter of a Phat of Inheritance, ought to be admitted to Vote as a Burgeſs; and complaining of the like miſ-management of the Salt Works, upon hearing of which Cauſe 7 <hi>Junii</hi> 1687. the Bill, as to the pretence of Burgeſship, was diſmiſs'd, and it was referred to a Maſter of the Court, to examin into the matter of the other Complaints, who has certified the Bayliffs and Burgeſſes have acted purſuant to the Cuſtoms, and the Matter is at this time before that Court: And if the Burgeſſes do any injury in the management of the Salt Works, the Commoners may have redreſs either at the Law, or in Equity.</p>
            <p>That ſome of the Plantiffs in that Suit, the Second of <hi>July</hi> 1687. petitioned the late King for a <hi>Quo warranto</hi> againſt the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who vigorouſly proſecuted the ſame; and alſo Informations againſt ſeveral of the Burgeſſes in their private Capacities, who for making their lawful Defence, were petitioned againſt to the late King, by thoſe who obtained the <hi>Quo warranto;</hi> by which means the Corporation was at laſt forced to ſurrender, not only the Charter granted by King <hi>John,</hi> by which they held their Eſtates, but alſo their other Charters of Incorporations.</p>
            <p>There have been ſeveral Phats and parts of Phats given and allowed to the School-Maſters of the Free-School, in lieu whereof, they have time out of mind had Salaries paid by the Bayliffs, and if the Government be changed, that Charity may be defeated.</p>
            <p>As the Corporation had its Original from, and is founded upon the Salt Works, and purely ſupported by them, out of which the Bayliffs, Recorder, Town Clerk, Serjeants at Mace, and other Officers, have always had Allowances or Salaries; and if thoſe Allowances and this Uſuage or Cuſtom of making Burgeſſes be taken away, the Corporation muſt conſequently diſſolve.</p>
