            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF ROBERT HASTINGS, <hi>Of the Pariſh of St.</hi> PAULS SHADWEL, <hi>in the County of</hi> MIDLESEX.</head>
            <p>THat he is <hi>Prothonotor</hi> of a Court of <hi>Record,</hi> within the Manours of <hi>Stepney</hi> and <hi>Hackney,</hi> in the County of <hi>Midleſex;</hi> and hath been ſo for this Eight Years, laſt paſt; which Court holds <hi>Plea</hi> only in Perſonal Actions, under the Value of Five Pounds.</p>
            <p>That he hath a <hi>Free-hold</hi> Eſtate therein, for his own Life and his Sons Life, worth about 200<hi>l.</hi> Per An. <hi>Communibus Annis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he depended thereon, as a good Proviſion for him and his Son. And therefore upon coming into the ſaid Place, left of his Practice as an Attorney, and hath diſcontinued the ſame ever ſince.</p>
            <p>That the reſidue of his Eſtate, lyes moſt in new Ground-Rents, and new Foundations, propoſed to be taxed, towards the defraying the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Charge of the Navy.</p>
            <p>That he hath been always ready to Serve the Publick, and hath ſerved in ſeveral <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> both of the <hi>Peace, Militia,</hi> and others; from the Year 1680, until diſmiſt, for Refuſing to Conſent, to take of the <hi>PENAL LAWS</hi> and <hi>TEST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in Caſe the Bill paſs, for Erecting <hi>A Court of Concience</hi> in the <hi>Tower Hamlets.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Prothonotor</hi>'s Place, will be of little or no Value, by Reaſon the Court holds <hi>Plea,</hi> but for ſo ſmall a Sum; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſaid <hi>Robert Haſtings,</hi> will be left Deſtitute of a reaſonable In-come, for the Maintainance and Proviſion of himſelf, his Wife, and Children.</p>
            <p>He therefore Refers himſelf to the Honour and Juſtice of this <hi>Honourable Houſe,</hi> where he cannot but hope, towards ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the Loſſes he is likely to ſuſtain (for the Reaſons aforeſaid) to have his Name incerted in the ſaid Bill, for <hi>The Tower Hamlets,</hi> as <hi>Regiſter</hi> and <hi>Clerk,</hi> with the Powers thereunto belonging, preferable to any others; he having lived there, ever ſince he was Burnt out, by the Great Fire of <hi>London:</hi> And therefore well known to the Inhabitants, and the Inhabitants well known to him.</p>
