         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ANd further, I have this to communicate to my

by the Spirit of the Lord: <hi>Love hath been quenched in many,
that Offences hath entred,</hi> and Separation followed; which

such <hi>Proceedings;</hi> and so have I done in many years past,
in <hi>preventing</hi> Papers ready to be <hi>Printed</hi> from being <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,</hi>
that were of a tendency to quench the Love of one
towards another: And when <hi>Ieffery Bullocks</hi> Papers were
published in Print, which would appear to the Reader of
a tendancy as to the <hi>Breach of Vnity;</hi> (which would cause
the <hi>Enemies</hi> of God to <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> it did so wound my
Spirit, that for <hi>many Weeks,</hi> they that <hi>saw</hi> me did not
<hi>expect</hi> that I would <hi>continue long</hi> in the Body: But God
in his <hi>Mercy</hi> Restored <hi>Strength</hi> in his <hi>Appointed</hi> time.</p>
               <p>And when I did hear that some in the <hi>West,</hi> did intend
to <hi>Publish in Print</hi> some Friends Weaknesses: I <hi>Bore</hi> my
<hi>Testimony</hi> against such <hi>Proceedings,</hi> and told <hi>one that did
Favour what was intended, <hi>That I would have my
Hand Cut off, before I would Exercise it in such
Undertakings</hi> (as the state of Friends was at that time.)</hi>
And desired him, <hi>To speak to</hi> W. R. <hi>that he would
not proceed in Publishing any thing of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for if he did, it would be a prejudice to Truth,
and would produce very sad Consequences that
would follow, and my Spirit would be deeply
wounded, as it is this day, through these Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
that voluntarily through want of Love, casts
away the Iudgment, that is given to the people of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99519:6"/>
the Saints of the most High God (to keep all sweet
and savoury amongst us) into the Hands of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God, as an inlet for them to come into
the midst of us, to sit as Iudges and trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So to <hi>Clear</hi> my <hi>Conscience</hi> of all <hi>False Reports Cast</hi> upon
me, as that I have <hi>Encouraged</hi> what is <hi>Brought forth</hi> as
before written; and to <hi>Satisfie all Friends</hi> in God, I have
<hi>Laboured</hi> according to the <hi>Ability</hi> God hath given me,
to <hi>Prevent</hi> the <hi>Publishing</hi> all things of that <hi>Nature,</hi> as afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said;
and have <hi>Endeavoured</hi> with all <hi>concerned,</hi> that I
could meet with: to have a care of <hi>watching for Evil,</hi> lest
they <hi>Provoke</hi> one another to <hi>Wrath,</hi> and so <hi>Quench</hi> the
<hi>Love:</hi> But rather <hi>Look</hi> at the <hi>Good</hi> one in another, and in
the <hi>Love</hi> of God, Minister, to <hi>Preserve</hi> them forth of any
<hi>Weakness</hi> they did see lay <hi>near</hi> to attend them; that so
the <hi>Pure Holy Spirit of Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> that first
<hi>Gathered</hi> us into it self, to be a <hi>People in God,</hi> and in his
<hi>Blessed</hi> Authority to <hi>reign over</hi> what was, and is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his <hi>Blessed Nature,</hi> may again <hi>Restore,</hi> (where it is
wanting) in the <hi>Vniversality</hi> of its <hi>Blessed Power,</hi> to make
up the <hi>Breaches,</hi> and to <hi>Restore</hi> the <hi>Desolate ones,</hi> in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
every one that <hi>Professeth</hi> the <hi>Biessed Truth of God,
to love their Neighbour as themselves;</hi> and so <hi>to do unto all,
as they would have others to do unto them;</hi> that so all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned</hi>
in the <hi>Exercise,</hi> in the <hi>Measure</hi> of the <hi>Grace of
God in Christ,</hi> (that seeks the <hi>Peace</hi> of his <hi>People)</hi> may
Stand as <hi>Saviours upon mount</hi> Sion, to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the
<hi>Name</hi> of the Lord our God, and the Eternal <hi>Comfort</hi> of
all that <hi>Love not their Lives unto Death,</hi> to serve the Lord,
and his <hi>Dear</hi> and <hi>Chosen People,</hi> in the <hi>Meek, Patient,</hi>
and <hi>Peaceable Spirit</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
