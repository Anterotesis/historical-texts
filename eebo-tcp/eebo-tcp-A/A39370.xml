            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to be a thing of Uncommon difficulty, and the Study
of it a Work fit only for sublimer Wits; the more Elevated,
and Awakned part of Mankind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Purity of Heart,</hi> is that which doth <hi>Principally</hi> conduce to

            </q>
            <p>Sect. 37. <q>A thing may deserve to be known, not as Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No Man can have any True, or Real Interest, but
what has some Reference to the Enjoyment of the SOVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REIGN
GOOD: Therefore any thing that deserves to be
Known because it touches upon our Interest; deserves to be
known as Perfecting the Understanding: The Perfection of the
Understanding consisting in the Apprehension of the <hi>Truth,</hi> for
the satisfaction of the <hi>Will,</hi> in the Possession of the <hi>True Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I agree with this Ingenious Author in that he says, <hi>No
Truth is Perfective of the Understanding, but only necessary Truth.</hi>
By necessary Truth I understand the DIVINE ESSENCE,
and all those EFFECTS of infinite Wisdom, Power, and
Goodness, which it is <hi>Our Duty</hi> to Contemplate.</p>
            <p>Reflection 2. Sect. 10. <q>If now it be further demanded how
this may be done; (<hi>viz.</hi> to apply our selves to the Divine
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to consult the <hi>Ideal World</hi>) I Answer that there are
Three ways of doing it, and I can think of no more: The
First is by Attention; The Second by Purity of Heart, and
Life; and the Third by Prayer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I do not Charge these Words with Falshood, but the Reader
will fall into an Error, if he conceit that he may apply himself
to the <hi>Divine</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by any other <hi>Attention</hi> of the Mind, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31292:2"/>
what proceeds from such a Temper, or Disposition of <hi>Will,</hi>
which implies an Aversion from any other <hi>Speculation,</hi> but what
may be <hi>Vseful</hi> unto him, in <hi>doing the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This holy Disposition of the <hi>Will,</hi> is the only true Purity
of Heart, and the Exercising of it is an Effectual Prayer, a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
of GOD <hi>in Spirit, and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words <hi>Sect.</hi> 29. are most perfectly agreeable to my
Conceptions: <q>We ought to prosecute Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
no further than as 'tis conducieve to the great ends
of Piety, and Virtue. And consequently whenever we Study
to any other Purpose, or in any other Degree than this;
we are Unaccountably, Impertinently, I may add, <hi>Sinfully</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd.</q>
But, then, say I, it must be consider'd, that no
<hi>Sinful</hi> Exercise or Employment of our <hi>Intellective Faculties,</hi> can
ever tend to the <hi>Improvement of the Brightness of the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
or Intellectual perfection.</hi> Nothing can properly be call'd
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> but <hi>the Practical Vnderstanding of true Goodness.</hi> Such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions as I find in the 27 and 28 Sections, seem to come short
of that <hi>Accuracy</hi> which is requisite for a <hi>Christian Philosopher,</hi>
that has the Confidence to pass so severe a Censure upon our
<hi>Academical Education, and Learning.</hi> 
               <q>Certainly Rectitude of
Will is a greater Ornament and Perfection, than Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Understanding; and to be good is more Divine
than to be Wise and Knowing. The Question is, whether
we ought to be more Solicitous for that Intellectual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which we cant have here, and shall have hereafter,
or for that Moral perfection, which we may have here, and
cannot hereafter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Lover of this present World is a <hi>Fool</hi> and an <hi>Ignorant
Wretch:</hi> They that Love the LORD JESUS in Sincerity,
are the only <hi>Wise and Knowing</hi> Men. 'Tis one and the same thing
<hi>to be Good, or to partake of the Divine Nature, and to be Wise
and Knowing.</hi> I think it my Duty to Declare to the World,
that it seems to me, that this Author deals most Incuriously with
the People call'd QUAKERS in speaking so Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
of their Notion of the LIGHT WITHIN.
I pray GOD that He, and I, and They, and all those that
Profess themselves to be <hi>Followers of</hi> JESUS CHRIST,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31292:3"/>
may have our Hearts duly Affected with the Sense of these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Words, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 4. 18, 19. <q>The path of the just is as
the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the
perfect day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not
at what they stumble.</q>
