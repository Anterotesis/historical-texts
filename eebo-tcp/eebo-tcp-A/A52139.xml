            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But however, I hoped he had been a Clergy-man of Honour, and that when herein the World and he himself were now so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>It will not be unpleasant to hear him begin his Story. <hi>The ensuing Treatise of Bishop</hi> Bramhall's <hi>being somewhat superannuated, the</hi> Bookseller <hi>was very sollicitous to have it set off with some Preface that might recommend it to the Genius os the Age, and reconcile it to the present juncture of Affairs.</hi> A pretty task indeed: That is as much as to say, to trick up the good old Bishop in a yellow Coif and a Bulls-head, that he may be fit for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and appear in fashion. In the mean time 'tis
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93801:3"/>
what I always presgaed: From a Writer of Book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, our Author is already dwinled to a Preface-monger, and from Prefaces I am confident he may in a short time be improved to endite Tickets for the Bear-Garden. But the Bookseller I see was a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fellow, and knew his Man. For who so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as a young Priest to sacrifice to the Genius of the Age; yea, though his Conscience were the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? And none more ready to nick a juncture of Affairs than a malapart Chaplain; though not one indeed of a hundred but dislocates them in the handling. And yet our Author is very maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and condescends to his Bookseller not without some reluctance, as being, forsooth, first of all <hi>none of the most zealous Patrons of the Press.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though he hath so lately forfeited his Credit, yet herein I dare believe him: For the Press hath ought him a shame a long time, and is but now beginning to pay of the Debt. The Press (that <hi>villanous</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) invented much about the same time with the Reformation, that hath done more mischief to the Discipline of our Church, than all the Doctrine can make amends for, 'Twas an happy time when all Learning was in Manuscript, and some little Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, like out Author, did keep the Keys of the Library. When the Clergy needed no more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than to read the Liturgy, and the Laity no more Clerkship than to save them from Hanging. But now since Printing came into the World, such is the mischief that a Man cannot write a Book but presently he is answered. Could the Press but once be conjured to obey only an <hi>Imprimatur,</hi> our Author might not disdain <hi>perhaps</hi> to be one of its most zealous Patrons. There have been wayes found out to banish Ministers, to fine not only the People, but even the Grounds and Fields where they assembled in Conventicles, But no

and Mighty Burgomasters, in matters of a closer and more comfortable importance to himself and his own Affairs.</hi> And yet whoever shall take the pains to read over his Preface, will find that it intermeddles with the King, the Succession, the Privy-Council, Popery, Atheism, Bishops, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Government, and above all with Nonconformity, and <hi>J. O.</hi> A man would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what this thing should be of a <hi>closer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,</hi> But being <hi>more comfortable</hi> too, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it must be one of these three things; either his Salvation, or a Benefice, or a Female. Now as to Salvation he could not be so much concern'd for that care was over; there hath been a course taken to insure all thar are on his bottom, And he is yet surer of a Benefice; or else his Patrons must be very ungrateful. He cannot have deserved less than a Prebend for his first Book, a <hi>Sine-cure</hi> for his second, and for this third a Rectorship, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were that of <hi>Malmsbury.</hi> Why, then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of necessity it must be a Female. For that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess might have been a sufficient excuse from wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Prefaces, and against the importunity of the Book-seller. 'Twas fit that all business should have given place to the work of Propagation. Nor was there any thing that could more closely import him, than that the Race &amp; Family of the Railers should be perpetuared among Mankind. Who could in Reason expect that a Man should in the same moments undertake the labour of an Author and a Father? <hi>Nevertheless, he saith, he could not but yeild so far as to improve every fragment of time that he could get into his own disposal, to gratifie the Importunity of the Bookseller.</hi> Was ever Civility graduated up and inhanc'd to such a value! His Mistris her self could not have endeared a Favour so nicely, nor grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with more sweetness.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And so, not being able to shake him off, <hi>this,</hi> he saith, <hi>hath brought forth this Preface, such an one as it is; for how it will prove, he himself neither is, nor (till 'tis too late) ever shall be a competent Judge, in that it must be ravish'd out of his hands before his thoughts can possibly be cool enough to revive or correct the Indecencies either of its stile or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</hi> He is now growing a very Enthusiast himself.

Some Man that had Iess right to be fastidious and confident, would, before he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himself in publick, both have cool'd his Thoughts, and corrected his Indecencies: or should have considered whether it were necessary or wholsome that he should write at all.

Thus it must be, and no better, when a man's Fancy is up, and his Breeches are down; when the Mind and the Body make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Assignations, and he hath both a Booksel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler at once and a Mistriss to satisfie; Like <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> into the Street he runs out naked with his Invention. And truly, if at any time, we might now pardon this Extravagance and Rapture of our Author, when he was pearch'd upon the highest

And so too all his story of the Bookseller, and all the <hi>Volo Nola</hi>'s, and <hi>shall-I shall-I</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betwixt them, was nothing but fooling: And he now all along owns himself to be the Publisher, and alledges the slighter and the main reasons that induced him. Would he had told us so at first; for then he had saved me thus much of my labour. Though as it chances, it lights not amiss on our Author, whose delicate stomach could not brook

For, as they are coupled together, to say the Truth, 'tis not discernable, as in some Animals, whether their motion begin at the head or the tail: whether the Author made his Preface sor Bishop <hi>Bramhal's dear sake,</hi> or whether he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the Bishop's Treatise for sake of his own <hi>dear Preface.</hi> For my own part I think it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that the Bishop and our Author, should (like fair Gamsters at Leap-frog) stand and skip in their turns; and however our Author got it for once, yet if the Bookseller should ever be sollicitous for a Second Edition, that then the Bishops Book should have the Precedence.</p>
            <p>But besore I commit my self to the dangerous dep<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hs of his Discourse, which I am now upon the brink of, I would with his leave make a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that instead of Author, I may henceforth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently call him Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> as oft as <hi>I</hi> shall see oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. And that first, because he hath no Name or at least will not own it, though he himself writes under the greatest security, and gives us the first Letters of other Mens Names before he be asked them. Secondly, because he is <hi>I</hi> perceive a lover of Elegancy, of Stile
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93801:7"/>
and can endure no mans Tautologies but his own, and therefore I would not distast him with too frequent repetition of one word. But chiefly, because <hi>Mr. Bayes</hi> and he do very much Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize; in their understandingt, in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, in their humour, in their contempt and quarrelling of all others, though of their own Profession. Because, our Divine, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, manages his contest with the same prudence and civility, which the Players and Poets have practised of late in their several Divisions. And lastly, because both their Talents do peculiarly ly in exposing and personating the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists. I would therefore give our Author a Name, the memory of which may perpetually excite him to the exercise and highest improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Virtue. For, our <hi>Cicero</hi> doth not yet equal our <hi>Roscius,</hi> and one turn of <hi>Lacy's face</hi> hath more <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy</hi> in it, than all the Books of our Author put together. Besides, to say Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> is more <hi>civil</hi> than to say <hi>Villain</hi> and <hi>Caitiff,</hi> though these indeed are more <hi>tuant.</hi> And, to conclude; The Irrefragable Doctor of School-Divinity, pag. 460. of his <hi>Defence;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining concerning Symbollical Ceremonies, ha<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

And therefore henceforward, seeing I am on such sure Ground, <hi>Author,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> whether I please. Now, having had our Dance, let us advance to our more serious Counsels.</p>
            <p>And first, Our Author begins with a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick upon Bishop <hi>Bramhal;</hi> a Person whom my age had not given me leave to be acquainted with, nor my good fortune led me to converse with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93801:7"/>
his Writings: but for whom I had collected a deep Reverence from the general Reputation he carried, beside the Veneration due to the Place he filled in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So that our Author having a mind to shew us some proof of his Good Nature, and that his Eloquence lay'd not all in Satyr and Invectives, could not, in ny opinion, have fixed upon a fitter subject of commendation. And therefore, I could have wished for my own sake, that I had missed this occasion of being more fully informed of some Bishop's Principles, whereby I have lost part of that pleasure which I had so long enjoyed in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well of so considerable a Person. But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I recreate my self with believing that my simple judgment cannot, beyond my intention, abate any thing of his just value with others. And seeing he is long since dead, which I knew but lately, and now learn it with regret, I am the more obliged to repair in my self whatsoever breaches of his Credit, by that additional Civility which consecrates the Ashes of the Deceased. But by this means I am come to discern how it was possible for our Author to speak a good word for any man. The Bishop was expired, and his Writings jump much with our Author. So that if you have a mind to dy, or to be of his Party, (there are but these two Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) you may perhaps be rendred capable of his Charity. And then write what you will, he will make you a Preface that shall recommend you and it to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Age, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it to the Juncture of Affairs. But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath acquitted himself herein so ill-favour'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Bistop, that I do not think it so much worth to gain his approbation; and I had rather live and enjoy mine own Opinion, than be so treated
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93801:8"/>
For, beside his reflection on the Bishop, and the whole Age he lived in; that <hi>he was, as far as the prejudice of the, Age would permit him, an acute Philosopher</hi> (which is a sufficient taste of Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> his Arrogance, that no Man, no Age can be so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but must abide his Censure, and of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious virulence of his Humour, which infuses it self, by a malignant remark, that (but for this acuter Philosopher) no man else would have thought of, into the Praises of him whom he most. intended to celebrate) if, <hi>I</hi> say, beside this, you consider the most elaborate and studious Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of his Commendation, you find it at best very rediculous, By the Language he seems to transcribe out of the <hi>Grand Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cassandra,</hi> but the Exploits to have borrowed out of the <hi>Knight of the Sun,</hi> and <hi>King Arthur.</hi> For in a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious and effeminate Stile he gives him such a <hi>Termagant</hi> Character, as must either sright or turn the stomach of any Reader; <hi>Being of a brave and enterprising temper, of an active and sprightly mind, he was always busied either in contriving or performing great D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>signs.</hi> Well, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by this, that he might have been an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match to the Bishop of <hi>Cullen</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Strasburg</hi> In another place, <hi>He finished all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Designs <hi>that he undertook.</hi> This might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Bishop of <hi>Munster</hi> before he had rais'd the Siege from <hi>Groningen. As he was able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the most gallant attempts, so he was always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy not only to justisie their Innocence, but to make good their Bravery.</hi> I was too prodigal of my Bishops at first, and now have never another lest in the Gazette, which is to our Authors Magazine. <hi>His Reputation and Innocence were both Arm or of Proof against Tories and Presbyterians.</hi> But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> having to do with such dangerous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93801:8"/>
Enemies, you should have furnished him too with some weapon of Offence, a good old Fox, like that of another Heroe, his Contemporary in <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Scene of Ireland,</hi> of whom it was sung.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Down by his side be wore a sword of price,</l>
               <l>Keen as a Frost, glaz'd like a new made Ice:</l>
               <l>That cracks men shell'd in Steel in a less trice,</l>
               <l>Than Squirrels Nuts, or the Highlanders Lice.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Then he saith; '<hi>tis true the Church of</hi> Ireland <hi>was the largest Scene of his Actions; but yet there in a little time, he wrought out such wondrous Alterations and so exceeding all belief, as may convince us that he had a mind large and active enough to have managed the Roman Empire at its greatest extent.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of our Author's is <hi>Great:</hi> and yet it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not a strain of his fellow-<hi>Pendets</hi> in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Mogol:</hi> where he tells <hi>Dancehment Kan, When you put your foot in the Stirrop, and when you march upon Horseback in the front of the Cavalry, the Earth trembles under your feet, the eight Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants that hold it on their heads not being able to support it.</hi> But enough of this Trafh.</p>
            <p>Beside that it is the, highest <hi>indecorum</hi> for a Divine to write in such a stile as this [part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Play-Book and part Romance] concerning a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bishop; these improbable <hi>Elogies</hi> too are of the greatest disservice to their own design, and do in effect diminish alwayes the Person whom they pretend to magnifie. Any worthy Man may pass through the World unquestion'd and safe with a moderate Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but when he is thus set off, and bedawb'd with Rhetorick, and embroder'd so thick that you cannot discern the Ground, it awakens natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93801:9"/>
(and not altogether unjustly) Interest, Curiosity and Envy. For all men pretend a share in Reputation, and love not to see it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross'd and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and are subject to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, (as of great Estates suddenly got) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he came by all this honestly, or of what credit the Person is that tells the Story? And the same hath happened as to this Bishop, while our Author attributes to him such Atchievments, which to one that could believe the Legend of Captain <hi>Jones,</hi> might not be incredble. I have heard that there was indeed such a Captain, an honest brave fellow: but a Wag that had a mind to be merry with him, hath quite spoil'd his History. Had our Author epitomiz'd the Legend of sixty six Books <hi>de Virtutibus Sancti Patricii</hi> (I mean not the Ingenious Writer of the <hi>Friendly Debates,</hi> but St, <hi>Patrick</hi> the Irish Bishop) he could not have promis'd us greater Miracles. And 'tis well for him that he hath escaped the fate of <hi>Secundinus,</hi> who (as <hi>Josselin</hi> relates it) acquainting <hi>Patrick</hi> that he was inspired to compose something in his Commendation, the Bshiop foretold the Author should dy as soon as 'twas perfected. Which so done, so happened. <hi>I</hi> am sure our Author had dyed no other death but of this his own <hi>Preface,</hi> and a surfeit upon Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> if the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Truth could have choak'd him. He tells us, <hi>I</hi> remember somewhere, that this same Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> said, the <hi>Scots</hi> had a civil expression for these <hi>Improvers of Verity,</hi> that they are <hi>good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> shall say nothing severer, than that our Author speaks the language of a Lover, and so may claim some pardon, if the habit and excess of his Courtship do as yet give a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to his discourse upon more ordinary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. For <hi>I</hi> would not by any means be mistaken,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93801:9"/>
as if <hi>I</hi> thought our Author so sharp set, or so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated that he should make a dead Bishop his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; so far from that, that he hath taken such a course, that if the Bishop were alive, he would be out of love with himself. He hath, like those frightfull Looking-glasses, made for sport, represented him in such bloated linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as, <hi>I</hi> am confident, if he could see his face in it, he would break the Glass. For, hence it falls out too, that men seeing the Bishop furbish'd up in so martial accoutrements, like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Odo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Baieux,</hi> and having never before heard of his prowess, begin to reflect what <hi>Giants</hi> he defeated and what <hi>Damsels</hi> he rescued. Serious Men consider whether he were ingaged in the conduct of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, and to have brought it over upon <hi>England,</hi> for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of which the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> his Patron so undeservedly suffered. But none knowes any thing ofit. Others think it is not to be taken literally, but the wonderful and unheard-of Alterations that he wrought out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> are meant of some Reformation that he made there in things of his own Function. But then men ask again, how he comes to have all the honour of it, and whether all the while that great Bishop <hi>usher,</hi> his Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane, were unconcerned? For even in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Combates, how instrumental soever the Captain hath been, the General usually carries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the honour of the Action. But the good <hi>Primate</hi> was engaged in Designs of lesser moment, and was writing his <hi>de Primordiis Ecclesiae Britani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae,</hi> and the Story of <hi>Pelagius</hi> our Countryman. He, honest man, was deep gone in <hi>Grubstreet</hi> and <hi>Polemmical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and troubled with Fits of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Orthodoxy.</hi> He satisfyed himself with being <hi>admired by the blue and white Aprons, and pointed at

               </gap> Simplicity. What then was this that Bishop <hi>Brambal</hi> did! Did he like a Protestant Apostle, in one day convert thousands of the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists? The contrary is evident, by the Irish Rebellion and Massacre, which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his <hi>Publick Employment and great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,</hi> happened in his time So that after all our Authors bombast, when we have search'd all over, we find our selves bilk'd in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and he hath erected him, like a St <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> in the Popish Churches, as big as ten Porters and yet only imploy'd to sweat under the burden of an <hi>Infant.</hi>
            </p>

And he saith, pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And how he manages it, I had rather any man would learn by reading over his own Book, than that I should be thought to misrepresent him, which I might, unless I tarnscribed the whole. But in summe it seems to me that he is upon his own single judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too liberal of the Publick, and that he retren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93801:10"/>
both on our part more than he hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for, and grants more to the Popish than they can of right pretend to. It is however indeed a most glorious Design, to reconcile all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to one Doctrine and Communion (though some that meddle in it do it chiefly in order to fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men straighter under the formal bondage of fictitious Discipline;) but it is a thing rather to be wished and prayed for, than to be expected from these kind of endeavours. It is so large a Field, that no man can see to the end of it: and all that have adventured to travel it, have been bewildred. That Man must have a vast opinion of his own sufficiency, that can think he may by his Oratory or Reason, either in his own time, or at any of our Author's <hi>more happy juncture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,</hi> so far perswade and fascinate the <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Church,</hi> having by a regular contexture of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Policy for so many Ages interwoven it self with the Secular Interest, and made it self necessary to most Princes, and having at last erected a Throne of infallibility over their Consciences, as to prevail with her to submit a Power and Empire so acquired and established in Compromise to the Arbitration of an humble Proposer. God only in his own time, and by the inscrutable methods of his Providence is able to effect that <hi>Alteration:</hi> though I think too he hath signified in part by what means he intends to accomplish it, and to range so considerable a Church and once so exemplary, into Primitive Unity and Christian Order.

who proposed to make him a Statue of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Achos</hi> (and that was no Molehil) and among other things, that Statue to carry in its hand a great habitable City. But the Surveyor was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd, being asked whence that City should be supplyed with Water. I would only have ask'd the Bishop, when he had carv'd and hammer'd the Romists and Protestants into one <hi>Colossian</hi>-Church, how we should have done as to matter of Bibles. For the Bishop, p. 117. complains that unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied people should have a promiscuous Licence to read the Scriptures: and you may guess thence, if he had moreover the Pope to friend, how the Laity should have been used. There have been attempts in former Ages to dig through the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating <hi>Istmos</hi> of <hi>Peloponnesus;</hi> and another to make communication between the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean:</hi> both more easie than to cut this <hi>Ecclesiastick Canal,</hi> and yet both laid by, partly upon the difficulty of doing it, and partly upon the inconveniences if it had been effected. I must confess freely, yet I ask pardon for the presumption, that I cannot look upon these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking Church-men, however otherwise of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prudence and Learning, but as men struck with a Notio, and craz'd on that side of their head. And so I think even the Bishop had much better have busied himself in Peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his own Diocess, and disarming the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists of their Arguments, instead of rebating our weapons? than in taking an <hi>Oecumenical</hi> care upon him, which none called him to, and, as appears by the sequel, none conn'd him thanks for. But if he were so great a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticion as I have heard, and indeed believe him to have been, me-thinks he should in the first place have contrived how we might live well

with our Protestant Neighbours, and to have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us in one body under the King of <hi>England,</hi> as Head of the Protestant Interest, which might have rendred us more considerable, and put us into a more likely posture to have reduced the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to Reason. For the most lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Party of the <hi>English</hi> Clergy in his time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained such a Pontifical stiffness towards the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Divines, that it puts me in mind of <hi>Austine</hi> the Monk, when he came into <hi>Kent,</hi> not deign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rise up to the <hi>Brittish</hi> or give them the hand, and could scarce afford their Churches either Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion or Charity, or common Civility. So that it is not to be wondred if they also on their parts look'd upon our Models of Accomodation with the same jealousie that the <hi>British</hi> Christians had as <hi>Austin</hi>'s Design, to unite them first to (that is under) the <hi>Savons,</hi> and then deliver them both over bound to the Papal Government and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. But seeing hereby our hands were weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and there was no probability of arriving so near the end of the work, as to a consent among Protestants abroad; had the Bishop but gone that step, to have reconciled the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Differences in our own Nations, and that we might have stood firm at home before we had taken such a Jump beyond-Sea, it would have been a Performance worthy of his Wisdom. For at that time the Ecclesiastical Rigours here were in the highest ferment, and the Church in being arrayed it self against the peaceable Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only in some points of Worship. And what great Undertaking could we be ripe for abroad, while so divided at home? or what fruit expected from the labour of those Mediating Divines in weighty matters, who were not yet past Sucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle; but seem'd to place all the business of Chri

How ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous must we be to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose in her Affairs, and force our Mediation upon her; when besides our ill correspondence with Foreign Protestants, she must observe our weakness within our selves, that we could not, or would not step over a straw, though for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual settlement and security of our Church and Nation? She might well look upon us as those that probably might be forced at some time by our folly to call her into our assistance (for with no Weapons or Arguments but what are fetch'd out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>So that this Enterprise of Bishop <hi>Bramhall</hi>'s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so ill laid and so unseasonable, deserves rather an Excuse than a Commendation. And all that can be gathered besides out of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

concerning him is of little better value for he saith indeed, that <hi>he was a zealous and resolute Assertor of the Publick Rites and Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church.</hi> But those things, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters of external neatness, could never merit the Trophies that our Author erects him. For neither can a Justice of Peace for his severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about Dirt-baskets deserve a Statue. And as for <hi>his expunging some dear and darling Articles from the Ptotestant Cause,</hi> it is, as far as <hi>I</hi> can perceive, only his substituting some <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets (which <hi>I</hi> name so, not for reproach, but for difference) instead of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines.

            <p>For the rest, which he leaves to seek for, and <hi>I</hi> meet casually with in the Bishop's own Book; <hi>I</hi> find him to have been doubtless a very good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Gentleman.

to that under-foot of people.</hi> And pag. 117.

But although <hi>I</hi> cannot warrant any man who hence took occasion to traduce him of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the contrary of which is evident, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be wondred, if he did hereby lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sometimpuration, which he might otherwise have avoided. Neither can <hi>I</hi> be so hard-hearted as our Author in the Nonconformists case of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to think it were better that <hi>he, or a hundred more Divines of his temper should suffer, though inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, in their Reputation, than that we should come under a possibility of losing our Relgion.</hi> For as they (the Bishop and <hi>I</hi> hope most of his Party) did not intend it so, neither could they have effected it. But he could not expect to enjoy his Imagination without the annoyances incident to such as dwell in the middle story: the Pots from above, and the smoak from below. And those Churches which are seated nearer upon the Frontire of Popery, did na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and well if they took Alarm at the March. For, in fact, that incomparable Person <hi>Grotius</hi> did yet make a Bridge for the Enemy to come over; or at least laid some of our most considerable Passes open to them and unregarded: a crime some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like what his Son <hi>De Groot</hi> (here's Gazotte again for you) and his Son-in-law <hi>Mombas</hi> have been charged with. And, as to the Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, his Friend; an Accusatory Spirit would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire no better play than he gives in his, own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, But that's neither my business nor huMour:

and whatsoever may have glanced upon him was directed only to our Author; for publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Book, which the Bishop himself had thought fit to conceal, and for his impertinent efflorescence of Rhetorick upon so mean Topicks, in so choice and copious a Subject as Bishop <hi>Bramhal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet though the Bishop prudently undertook a Design, which he hoped not to accomplish in his own dayes, our Author, however, was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wiser, and hath made sure to obtain his end. For the Bishop's Honour was the furthest thing from his thoughts, and he hath managed that part so, that I have accounted it a work of some Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to vindicate his Memory from so scurvy a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. But the Author's end was only railing; He could never have induc'd himself to praise one man but in order to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And whoever will take the pains to compare, will find, that as it is his only end; so his best, nay his only talent is railing. So that he hath, while he pretends so much for the good Bishop, used him but for a Stalking-horse till he might come within shot of the Forreign Divines and the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists. The other was only a copy of his countenance: But look to your selves, my Masters; forin so venomous a malice, courtesie is always fatal. Under colour of some mens having taxed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, he flyes out into a furious Debauch, and breaks the Windows, if he could, would raze the foundations of all the Protestant Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea: but for all men at home of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, if he meet them in the dark he runs them thorow.

               </gap>rue. What he saith of him indeed in this place did not come very well in; for <hi>Calvin</hi> writ nothing against Bishop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> and therefore here it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more than that his Spirit forsooth had propagated an original <hi>Waspishness</hi> and salse <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> amongst all his Followers. But if you look in other pages of his Book, and particularly Pag. 663. of his <hi>Defence,</hi> you never saw such a Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow as he makes him. <hi>There sprang up a mighty Bramble on the South-side the</hi> Lake Lemane, <hi>that (such is the rankness of the soil) spread and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished with such a sudden growth, that partly by the industry of his Agents abroad, and partly by its own indefatigable pains and pragmaticalness it quite over-ran the whole Reformation</hi> — You must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> was all this while in an Extasy in <hi>Dodona's Grove;</hi> or else here is strange work, worse than <hi>explicating a Post,</hi> or <hi>examining a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> A <hi>Bramble</hi> that had <hi>Agents abroad,</hi> and it self an <hi>indefatigable Bramble.</hi> But straight our Bramble is transformed to a Man, and he <hi>makes a Chair of Infallibility for himself,</hi> out of his own Bramble Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

are performed in the face with the same muscles very little altered; so the changing of a line or two in Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> at any time, will make the same thing serve for a Panegyrick or a Philippick. But what do you think of this Man? Could Mistriss <hi>Mopsa</hi> her self have furnished you with a more pleasant and worshipful Tale?

He knew that not only the Common-Wealth of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> but the King of <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would enter the lists for the common preservation of the place: and therefore though it be otherwise but a petty Town, he disdain'd not where the Race was to be run by Monarchs, to exercise his footmanship. But is it not a great pity to see a man in the flower of his age, and the vigour of his studies, to fall into such a distraction, That his head runs upon nothing but Roman Empire and Ecclesiastical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy?

Beside that too he had the misfortune to have two Friends, who being both also out of their wits, and of the same though something a calmer phrensy, spurr'd him on perpetually with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. But when his Book was once come out, and he saw himself an Author; that some of the Gallants of the Town layd by the new Tune and the <hi>Tay, tay, tarry,</hi> to quote some of his impertinencies; that his Title page was post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pasted up at every avenue next under the Play for that afternoon at the Kings or the Dukes House: the Vain-Glory of this totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded him.

This is an admirable dexterity our Author hath (I wish <hi>I</hi> could learn it) <hi>to correct a man's scribling humour without impairing in the least his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi> He is as courteous as Lightning, and can melt the Sword without ever hurting the Scabbard. But as for their <hi>Rat-Divines, I</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are not all poysoned with nibling at his Writings, he hath strewed so much <hi>Arsenick</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very leaf. But however, methinks he should not not have grudged them so slender a sustenance. For though there was a Sow in <hi>Arcadia</hi> so fat and insensible that she suffered a Rats nest in her but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock, and they had both Dyet and Lodging in the same Gammon; yet it is not every <hi>Rats</hi> good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be so well provided.

            <p>And now, though he told us at the beginning, that the Bookseller was the main reason of publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Book of the Bishop and his own Preface, he tels us that the main reason of its publication was to give some check to their present disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, that is to say to that of <hi>J.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93801:25"/>
Wnen <hi>I</hi> first took notice of this misunderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding betwixt Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> and J. <hi>O I</hi> considered whether it were not Execution day with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Alphabet:</hi> whether all the Letters were not to suffer in the same manner, except <hi>C.</hi> only, which (having been the mark of Condemnation) might have a pardon to serve for the Executioner. <hi>I</hi> began to repent of my Undertaking, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that the Quarrel was with the wole <hi>Cris-Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Row,</hi> and that we must fight it out through all the Squadrons of the <hi>Vowels,</hi> the <hi>Mutes,</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-vowels,</hi> and the <hi>Liquids. I</hi> foresaw a sore and endless labour, and a battle the longest that ever was read of; being probable to continue as long as one Letter was left alive, or there were any use of Reading. Therefore, to spare mine own pains, and prevent <hi>Ink-shed, I</hi> was advising the Letters to go before Mr. <hi>Bales,</hi> or any other his Majesties Justices of the Peace, to swear that they were in danger of their. Lives, and desire that Mr <hi>Bayes</hi> might be bound to the <hi>Good-behaviour.</hi> But after this I had another Phancy, and that not altogether unreasonable; that Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> had, only for health and exercise-sake, drawn J. <hi>O.</hi> by chance out of the number of the rest, to try how he could rail at a Letter, and that he might be well in breath upon any occasion of greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence For, how perfect soever a man may have been in any Science, yet without continual practice he will find a sensible decay of his faculty. Hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and upon the same natural ground, it is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Cats to whet their Claws against the Chairs and Hangings, in mediation of the next <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> they are to encounter. And <hi>I</hi> am confident that Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> by this way hath brought himself into so good railing case, that pick what Letter you will out of the Alphabet, he is able to write an Epistle upon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93801:26"/>
it of 723 pages (I have now told them right) to the Author of the <hi>Friendly Debates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though this had very much of probability, I had yet a further Conjecture: that this <hi>J. O.</hi> was a <hi>Talisman,</hi> signed under some peculiar influence of the Heavenly bodies, and that the Fate of Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> was bound up within it. Whether it be so or no I know not: but this I am assured of, without the help either of <hi>Syderal Magick</hi> or <hi>Judicial Astrologie,</hi> that when <hi>J</hi> and <hi>O</hi> are in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> they do more certainly than any of the <hi>Planets</hi> forbode that a great <hi>Ecclesiastical Politician</hi> shall that Year run mad. I confess after all this, when I was come to the dregs of my phansie (for we all have our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his <hi>Defence</hi> was but the <hi>blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>John</hi> of his <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> and this <hi>Preface</hi> the Tap-droppings of his <hi>Defence</hi>) I reflected whether Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> having no particular cause of indignation against the Let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

so much exasperated Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> who is a <hi>Person,</hi> as he saith himself, <hi>of such a tame and softly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and so cold a complexion, that be thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self scarce capable of hot and passionate impressi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>You see, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> that I too have improved my wit with reading the <hi>Gazettes.</hi> Were you of that Fellows diet here abour Town, that epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curizes upon burning Coals, drinks healths in scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Brimstone, scraunches the Glasses for his <hi>Desert,</hi> and draws his breath through glowing Tobacco-pipes. Nay to say a thing yet greater; had you never tasted other sustenance than the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus of <hi>burning Glasses,</hi> you could not shew more <hi>flame</hi> than you do alwayes upon that subject. And yet one would think that even from the <hi>little sports,</hi> with your <hi>comfortable importance</hi> after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you should have learnt when J. <hi>O.</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to play, to <hi>love your Love</hi> with an J. because he is <hi>Judicious,</hi> though you <hi>hate your Love with an</hi> J, because he is <hi>jealous:</hi> and then to <hi>love your Love with an O.</hi> because he is <hi>Oraculous,</hi> though you <hi>hate your Love with an O.</hi> because he is <hi>Obscure:</hi> Is it not strange, that in those most benign mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of a Man's life, when the Stars smile, the Birds sing, the Winds whisper, the Fountains warble, the Trees blossom, and uuiversal Nature seems to invite it self to the <hi>Bridal;</hi> when the Lion puls in his Claws &amp; the Aspick layes by its Poyson,

and all the most noxious Creatures grow amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusly innocent: that even then, Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> alone should not be able to refrain his Malignity?

And therefore let's take the Candle and see whether there be not some body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath that hath cut the Bed-Cords, There was a worthy Divine, not many years dead, who in his younger time being of a facetious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky humour, was commonly known by the name of <hi>Tom Triplet.</hi> He was brought up at <hi>Pauls-School,</hi> under a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Master, Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> and from thence he went to the Uuiversity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>There he took liberty (as 'tis usual with those that are emancipated from School) to tel Tales, and make the Discipline ridiculous under which he was bred. But, not suspecting the Doctor's intelligence, comming once to Town, he went in full School to give him a Visite, and expected no Iess than to get a <hi>Play-day</hi> for his former acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But, instead of that, he found himself hors'd up in a trice; though he appeal'd in vain to the Priviledges of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, pleaded <hi>Adultus,</hi> and invoked the mercy of the Spectators. Nor was he let down till the Master had planted a Grove of Birch in his back side, fot the Terrour and puplick Example of all Wags that divulg the

Secrets of <hi>Priscian</hi> and make merry with their Teachers. This stuck so with <hi>Triplet,</hi> that all his life-time he never forgave the Doctor, but sent him every Newyears-tide an Anniversary Ballad to a new Tune, and so in his turn avenged himself of his jerking Pedagogue.</p>
            <p>Now when I observed that of late years Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> had regularly <hi>spawned</hi> his Books; in 1670. the <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy;</hi> in 1671. the <hi>Defence of the Ecclesiastical Policy;</hi> and now in 1672 this <hi>Preface</hi> to Biwop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> and that they were writ in a stile so vindictive and poynant, that they wanted nothing but rime to be right <hi>Tom Triplet;</hi> and that their edge bore always upon <hi>J. O.</hi> either in broad meanings or in plain terms; I begun to suspect that where there was so great resemblance in the Effects, there might be some parallel in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, there might be some parallel in their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. For though the Peeks of Players among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or of Poet against Poet, or of a Conformist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Divine against a Nonconformist, are dangerous, and of late times have caused great disturbance; yet I never remarked so irreconcileable a spirit as that of Boyes against their Schoolmasters or Tutors. The quarrels of their Education have an influence upon their Memories and Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings for ever after. They cannot speak of their Teachers with any patience or civility; and their discourse is never so flippant, nor their Wirs so flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as when you put them upon that <hi>Theme.</hi> Nay, I have heard old Men, otherwise, sober, peaceable and good-natured, who never could forgive <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolstone,</hi> as the younger are still inveighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Dr. <hi>Busby.</hi> It were well that both old and young would reform this vice, and consider how easy a thing it is upon particular grudges, and as they conceived out of a just <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> petulancy of inveterate uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And had there not been something of this in his own case, I am confident Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> in his <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> in order to the publick peace and security of the Government, could not have failed to admonish Princes to beware of this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, and to brandish the <hi>Publick Rods</hi> if not <hi>the Axes</hi> against the Boyes, to teach them better manners. And he would have assured them that they might have done it with all safety, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that there were in proportion an hundred Boyes against one <hi>Preceptor.</hi> But therefore is it not possible that J. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr <hi>Bayes</hi> have known one another formerly in the University; and that (as in Seniority there is a kind of Magistracy) <hi>Bayes</hi> being yet young J. <hi>O.</hi> conceiv'd himself in those dayes to be his Superiour, and exercised an Academical Jurisdiction or Dominion over him. Now whether J.

But that is certain that the young Wits in the Universities have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an animosity against the Doctors, and take a reculiar felicity in having a lucky hit at any of them. I rather suppose that after Mr <hi>Bayes</hi> had changed the place, and his condition, to be the Noblemans Chaplain, that he might commit some exorbitance in J.

            <p>His Majesty before his most happy and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Restauration, had sent over a Declaration of his Indelgence to tender Consciencee in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Matters. Which, as it was doubtless the real Result of the last Advice left Him by his glorious Father, and of his own consummate Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and natural Benignity; so at his Return he religiously observed and promoted it as far as the Passions and Influences of the contrary Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93801:29"/>
would give leave. For, whereas among all the decent Circumstances of his welcom Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, the Providence of God had so coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the duty of his Subjects, that so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Action should neither be soiled with the blood of Victory, nor lessened by any capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Treaty, so not to be wanting on his part in courtesy, as I may say, to so happy a conjucture, He imposed upon himself an Oblivion of former offences, and his Indulgence in Ecclesiastical affairs. And to royal and generous minds do sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations are so binding as their own voluntary promises: nor is it to be wondred if they hold those Conditions that they put upon themselves the most inviolable. He therefote carried the Act of Oblivion and Indempnity thorow: that Party who had suffered vastly in the late Cumbustions not refusing to imitate his Generosity, but throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their particular Losses and Resentments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Publick Reckoning. But when it came to the Ecclesiastical Part, the accomplishment of which only remain'd behind to have perfected his Majesty's felicity, the business I warrant you should not go so, (as I shall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to say more par<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

For, though I am sorry to speak it, yet it is a sad truth, that the Animosities and Obstinacy of some of the Clergy have in all Ages been the greatest Obstacle to the Clemency, Prudence and good Intentions of Princes, and the Establishment of their Affairs. His Majesty therefore expected a better season, and having at last rid himself of a great Minister of state who had headed this Interest, he now proceeded plainly to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to his Parliment effectually and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated instances, the Consideration of tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, After the Kings last representing of this

He knows it's all but that you may get into the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle again; and that the Priest may ride him, though it be to a Precipiece. He therefore contents himself with the Power that he hath inherited from his Royal Progenitors Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> and as it is declared by Parliament, and is not to be trepann'd into another kind of Tenure of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to be held at Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his pleasure, and depend upon the strength only of his Argument. But (that I may not offend in Latin too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently? he considers that by not assumining a Deity to himself, he becomes secure and worthy of his Government. There are lightly about the Courts of Princes a sort of Projectors for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed Lands, to which they entitle the King to begg them for themselves: and yet generally they get not much by it, but are exceeding vexatious to the Subject. And even such an one is this <hi>Bayes</hi> with his Project of a <hi>Concealed Power,</hi> that most Princes as ee saith <hi>have not yet rightly understood;</hi> but whereof the King is so little enamour'd, that I am confident, were it not for prolling and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molesting the People, his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:93801:34"/>But one thing I must confess is very pleasant, and he hath past an high Complement upon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty in it: that he may, if he please, reserve the Priest-hood and the Exercise of it to himself.

               </gap>sing; but this only troubles me, how his Majesty would look in all the Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal habiliments, and the Pontifical Wardrobe. I am asraid the King would find himself incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded with all that furniture upon his back, and would scarce reconcile himself to wear even the Lawn-sleeves and the Surplice. But what: even <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> as I have rerd, was at his Inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration by the Pope, content to be vested, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Roman Ceremonial, in the habit of a Deacon: and a man would not scruple too much the formality of the dress in order to Empire.</p>
            <p>But one thing I dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t Mr, <hi>Bayes</hi> did not well consider; that, if the King may discharge the Function of the Prest-hood, he may too (and 'tis all the reason in the world assume the Revenue. It would be the best Subsidy that ever was volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily given by the Clergy. But truly otherwise, I do not see but that the King does lead a more unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Conuersation, and takes more care of Souls than many of them, and understands their office much better, and deserves something already sor the pains he hath taken.</p>
            <p>The next is <hi>Publick Conscience.</hi> For as to mens private Consciences he hath made them very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, and reading what he saith of them with some attention, I only found this new and important Discovery and great Priviledge of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Liberty, thar <hi>Thought is free.</hi> We are howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xer obliged to him for that, seeing by consequence we think of him what we pleaser And thii he saith a man may assert against all the powers of the Earth: and indeed with much reason and to great purpose;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93801:35"/>
seeing, as he also alledges, the Civil Power is so far srom doing violence to that liberty, that it never can, But yet if the freedom of thoughts be in not lying open to discovery, there have been wayes of compelling men to discover them; or, if the freedom consist in retaining their judgments when so manifested, that also hath been made penal. And I doubt not but beside <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Renunciations,</hi> and <hi>Assents</hi> and <hi>Consents,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> if he were searched, hath twenty other tests and picklocks in his pocket. Would Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> then perswade men to assert this against all the Powers of the Earth? I would ask in what manner? To say the truth I do not like him, and would wish the Nonconformists to be upon their guard, lest he trapan them first by this means into a Plot, and then preach, and so hang them: If Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> meant otherwise in this matter, <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my stupidity, and the fault is most his own, who should have writ to the capacity of vulgar Read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rs. He cuts indeed and saulters in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which is no good sign, perswading men that they may, and ought to practise against their Consciences, where the Commands of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate intervenes. None of them denies that it is their duty, where their Judgments or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences cannot comply with what is injoyned, that they ought in obedience patiently to suffer; but further they have not learned. I dare say that the Casual Divinity of the Jesuites is all thorow as Orthodox as this Maxime of our Authors: and as the Opinion is brutish, so the Consequences are Develish. To make it therefore go down more glibly, he saith, that '<hi>tis better to err with Authority, than to he in the right against it in all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful disputable cases: because the great duty of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence outweighs the danger of a little error, (and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93801:35"/>
tittle it is if it be disputable.</hi>) I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the truth of this reasoning; that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is disputable is little; for even the most important matters are subject to controversie: And besides, things are little or great accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Eyes or Understandings of several men; and however, a man would suffer some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rather than commit that little error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Conscience, which must render him an Hypocrite to God, and a Knave amogst Men. <hi>The Commands</hi> (he saith) <hi>and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the publick Conscience ought to carry it; and if there be any fin in the Command, be that imposed it shall answer for it, and not I whose duty it is to obey;</hi> (And mark) <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Authority will warrant my Obedience, my Obedience will hallow, or at least excuse my action, and so secure me from sin if not frfm er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi> and so you are welcome Gentlemen. Truly a very fair and conscionable Reckoning! So far is this from hallowing the Action, that I dare say it will, if followed home, lead only to all that <hi>sanctified Villany,</hi> for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of which we are beholden to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But let him have the honour of it; for he is the first Divine that ever taught Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans how another man's sin cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:93801:36"/>The third is <hi>Moral Grace.</hi> And whoever is not satisfied with those passages of his concerning it, before quoted, may find enough where he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it at large, even to surfeit. I cannot make ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther less or more of it than that. he overturns the whole fabrick of Christianity, and Power of Religion. For my part, if Grace be resolv'd into Mortality, I think a man may almost as well make God too to be only a Notional and Moral Existence.</p>

            <q>But thou most holy Honesty, that only art the invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Deity of the well-born Soul.</q>
            <p>And so too was the Mortal Poet: (for why may not I too bring out my Latin shreds as well as he is,</p>

            </p>
            <p>But so far I must do Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> right, that to my best observation, if Prudence had been God, <hi>Bayes</hi> had been a most damnable Atheist. Or, perhaps only an Idolater of their number, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom he adds in the next line</p>

And more have sprung from the Contentiousness and Ambition of some of the Clergy; But the most of all from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Manners, and alwayes fatal Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It exhausts the Estates of private persons, and makes them fit for nothing but the High-way or an Army. It debases the spirits and weakens the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of any Nation; at once indisposing them for war, and rendring them uncapable of Peace. For, if they escape intestine troubles, which would certainly follow when they had left themselves by their prodigality or intemperance, no other means of subsistence but by preying upon one another; then must they either to get a maintenance, pick a quarrel with some other Nation, wherein they are sure to be worsted; or else (which more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens) some neighbouring Prince that understands Government takes them at the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and, if they do not like ripe Fruit fall into his lap, 'tis but shaking the Tree once or twice, and he is sure of them. Where the Horses are, like those of the <hi>Sybarites,</hi> taught to dance, the Enemy need only learn the Tune and bring the Fiddles. But therefore (as far as I understand) his Majesty to obviate and prevent these inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies in his Kingdoms, hath on the one hand never refused a just War; that so he might take
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93801:38"/>
down our Grease and Luxury, and keep the <hi>English</hi> Courage in breath and exercise: and on the other, (though himself most constantly addicted to the Church of <hi>England</hi>) hath thought fit to grant some liberty to all other Sober People, (and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the are soy God forbid they should have it) thereby to give more temper ond allay to the commhn end notorious Debauchery.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> nevertheless is for his fifth: <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution recommended:</hi> and he does it to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <hi>Julian</hi> himself, who I think was first a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and held forth in the Christian Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he turnd Apostate and then Persecutor, could not have outdone him either in Irony or Cruelty. Only it is God's mercy that Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> is not Emperor. You have seen how he inveighs against Trade: <hi>That whilst mens Consciences are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such peevish and ungovernable Principles, to erect Trading Combinations is but to build so many Nests of Faction and Sedition.</hi> Lay up your Ships, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, set Bills on your Shop-doors, shut up the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom-House; and why not ajourn the Term, mure up <hi>Westminster</hi>-hall, leave Plowing and Sowing, and keep a dismal Holy-day through the Nation; for Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> is out of humour. But I assure you it is no jesting matter. For he hath in one place ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a List of the Fanatick Ministers, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to be but a hundr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And then for their People, either <hi>they live in greater Societies of men</hi> (he means the City of <hi>London</hi> and the other Cities and Towns-Corporate, but expresses it so to prevent some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience that might betide him

               <hi>but there their noise is greater than their number.</hi> Or else in <hi>Country Towns and Villages, where they arise not above the proportion of one to twenty.</hi> It were not unwisely done indeed if he could perswade the the Magistrate that all the Fanaticks have but one neck, so that he might cut off Nonconformity at one blow. I suppose the Nonconformists value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though upon their Conscience, and not their Numbers: but they would do well to be watchful, lest he have taken a List of their Names as well as their Number, and have set Crosses upon all their Doors against there should be occasion. But till that <hi>happy juncture,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Bays shall be avenged of his new Enemies, the wealthy Fanaticks,</hi> (which is soon done too, for he saith, <hi>there are but few of them men of Estates or Interest</hi>) he is-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that they should only be exposed (they are his own expressions) to the <hi>Pillories, Whipping-posts, Galleys, Rods</hi> and <hi>Axes,;</hi> and moreover and above, to all other Punishments whatsoever, provided they be of a severer nature than those that are inflicted on men for their immoralities. O more than human Clemency! I suppose the Division betwixt Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities and Conscience is universal; and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is wicked or penal is comprehended within their <hi>Territories.</hi> So that although a man should be guilty of all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

your Inclination, we know your Abilities, and we know your Lodging: And when there is any further occasion you will doubtless be sent for. For, to say the truth, this <hi>Bayes</hi> is an excellent Tool, and more useful than ten other men. I will undertake that he shall, rather than fail, be the Trepanner, the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Witness, the Atturney, the Judge; and, if the Nonconformist need the benefit of his Book, he shall be Ordinary too, and say he is an ignorant fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losh, <hi>non legit:</hi> and then, to do him the last Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian office, he would be his Hangman. In the mean time, let him enjoy it in speculation, secure of all the Imployments when they shall fall.

So that Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> must either do it himself in person, or constitute the chief Magistrate to be his Deputy.

Nay, I think there was (a thing of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill example) an Arch-Bishop turn'd out of his Sea for some Misdemeanor or other. I have not been curious after his name nor his crime, because as much as possible I would not expose the nakedness of any person so eminent formerly in the Church. But hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward the King fell into disgrace with Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> and any one that had eyes might discern that our Author did not afford his Majesty that Countenance and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which he hath formerly enjoy'd. So that a Book too of <hi>J. O</hi>'s happening mischievously to come out at the same season, Upon pretence of answering that, he resolved to make his Majesty feel the effects of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure. So that he set Pen to Paper again, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept his Midwife of the <hi>Friendly Debate</hi> by him all the time of his pregnancy for fear of miscarrying, he was at last happily delivered of his second Child, the <hi>Defence of the Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> in the year 1671. It was a very lusty Baby, and twice as big as the former, and (which some observed as an ill sign, and that if it lived it would prove a great Tyrant) it had, when born, all the Teeth, as perfect as ever you saw in any mans Head. But I do not reckon much upon those ominous criticismes. For there was partly a natural cause in it, Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> having gone so many months, more than the Civil Laws allowes for the utmost term of legitimation, that it was no wonder if the Brat were at its birth more forward than others usually are. And indeed Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> was so provident against abortion, and

careful for some reasons that the Child sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But Allegories and Raillery and hard words appear in this his second Book, and what I quoted before out of Bishop <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal,</hi> p. 18. with allusion to our Author, is here faln out as exactly true as if it had been expresly calculated for <hi>Bayes</hi> his Meridian. He finds himself to have come too near, nay to have far outgone an <hi>Erastian,</hi> That he had writ his Ecclesiastical Policy before he was come to maturity of Judgement, that one might desire Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> in Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that something had been changed in his Book.

He had, you know, p. 35. of his first Book and in other places, vested them with an universal and unlimited Power, and uncontroulable in the Government of Religion (that is, over mens Consciences) but now in his second, to make them an example to all incorrigible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful persons, he strips and disrobes them again of all those Regal Ornaments that he had superinduced upon them, and leaves them good Princes in <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Tis true, the Author some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for fashion-sake speaks in that Book of Religion and of a Deity, but his Principles do necessarily, if not in terms, make the Princes Power <hi>Paramount</hi> to both those, and if he may by his uncontroulable and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited universal Authority introduce what Religion, he may of consequence what Deity also he pleases. Or, if there were no Deity, yet there must be some Rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that being an Engine most advantagious for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Peace and Tranquillity. This was in 1670. But by 1671. you see the case is altered. Even one night hath made some men gray. And now p. 238. of his second Book, he hath made Princes accountable, ay and to so severe an Auditor as God himself. <hi>The Thrones of Princes are established upon the Dominion of God</hi> And p 241. '<hi>Tis no part of the Princes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to institute rules of Moral Good and Evil, that is the care and the Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That is the thing, that is the business of this whole Book: and knowing that there is a clear and undoubted preingagement to the higher Authority of Nature and Necessity, if the King will persist in tolerating these people, who knows after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating, what Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> will do next? But now in summe what shall we say of this man, and how had the King been served if he had followed <hi>Bayes</hi>'s advice;

and assumed the power of his first Book? He had run himself into a fine <hi>Premunire,</hi> when now after all he comes to be made accountable to God, nay even to his Subjects.

'Tis true, that being distracted betwixt his desire that the Consciences of men should be persecuted, and his anger at Princes that will not be advised, he confounds himself every where in his reasonings, that you can hardly distinguish which is the <hi>Whoop</hi> and which is the <hi>Holla,</hi> and he makes Indentures on each fide of the way wheresoever he goes.

And first I lighted on that place where he strives to disintangle himself from what he had said about Trade in his former Book. Here therefore he defies the whole Fanatick world to discover one Syllable that tends to its discouragement. Let us put it upon that issue, and by this one example take the patern of his ingenuity in all his other contests. <q>Whoop, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> pag. 49. with what conscience does the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer tell the people that I have reprelented all Tradesmen as seditious, when 'tis so notorious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If I should affirm that when the Nobility or Clergy are possest with Principles that incline to Rebellion and disloyal practices, they are of all Rebels the most dangerous, should I be thought to impeach them of Treason and Rebellion?</q> Holla, Mr. <hi>Bayes!</hi> But in the 49th. page of your first Book you say expresly, <q>For 'tis notorious that there is not any sort of people so inclinable to Seditious Practices as the Trading part of a Nation.</q> Is this the same thing now? and how does this Defence take off the Object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>So concerning the Magistrates power in Religion, wherein his Answerer had remark'd some unsafe pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages: Whoop Mr. Bayes! P. 12: of his first Book before quoted: <q>Unless Princes have power to bind their Subjects to what Religion they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend most advantagious, &amp;c. they are no better than Statues of Authority.</q> Holla Bayes. Pag. 467. of the second Book: <q>This bold Calumny I have already I hope compe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet he repeats this fundamental For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery in all places, so that his whole Book is but one huge Lye 400 pages long.</q> Judge now who is the Forger; And yet he roars too here as if he would mix Heaven and Earth together. But you may spare your raving, you will never claw it off as long as your name is <hi>Bayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So his Answerer it seems having p. 85. said, that <hi>Bayes</hi> confines the whole Duty of Conscience to the inward thoughts and perswasions of the mind, over which the Magistrate hath no power at all: Whoop <hi>Bayes,</hi> page 89. of his first Book, <q>Let all matters of mere Conscience, whether purely moral or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, be subject to Conscience only, <hi>i. e.</hi> Let men think of things according to their own perswasions, and assert the Freedom of their Judgments against all the Powers of the Earth. This is the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the mind of man within its own Dominions its Kingdom is intellectual, &amp;c. P. 91. Liberty of Conscience is internal and invisible, and confined
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93801:46"/>
to the minds and judgments of men; and while Conscience acts within its proper sphere, the Civil power is so far from doing it Violence, that it never can. <hi>Holla Bayes p.</hi> 229 of his Second Book, This in down right English is a shameless Lye. Sir, you must pardon my rudeness, for I will assure you, after Long Meditation, I could not devise a more pertinent answer to so bold an one as this.</q> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you Mr. <hi>Bayes:</hi> You meditated long, some twelve moneths at least; and you could not devise any other answer, and in good earnest he hath not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to give any other answer. <hi>I confess 'tis no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinory Conceit, but tis the best Repartee, my bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Fancy was able to suggest to me upon so rude an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> Well Mr. <hi>Bayes!</hi> I see it must come to a quarrel; for thus the Hectors use to do, and to give the Lye at adventure, when they have a mind to try a mans Courage.

                  </gap> Consequence.</hi> 'Tis very well worth reading at large: but in short the Consequence (or the occasion 'tis no matter when I have to do with <hi>Bayes)</hi> was, that <q>Princes how peremptory soever they have been in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the Rights of their Supreme Power, in Civil Affairs, they have been forced to seem modest and diffident in the exercise of their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Supremacy.</q> Now, <hi>Holla, Bayes. p.</hi> 298. of his Second Book. <q>To what purpose does he so briskly taunt me for thwarting mine own principles, because I have censured the impertinency of a reed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Provision in an Act of Parliament.</q> Observe, these are not the Answerers but <hi>Bayes</hi> his own words; whereby you may see with what Reverence and Duty he uses to speak of his Superiors and their Actions, when they are not so happy as to please him. <q>I may obey the Law, though I may be of a different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion from the Law-givers in an Opinion remote and impertinent to the matter of the Law it self: nay, I may condemne the wisdom of enacting it, and yet at the same time think my self to lie under an indispensable Obligation to obey it: for the formal reason of its obligatory power (as any Casuist will inform him) is not the Judgment and Opinion of the Law-giver, but the Declaration of his Will and Pleasure.</q> Very good and sound Mr. <hi>Bayes:</hi> but here you have opened a passage; and this is as imper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At last, having readit all through with some attention, I resolved, having failed so of any thing material, to try my fortune whether it might be more lucky, and to open the Book in several places as it chanced. But, whereas they say that in the <hi>Sortes Virgilianae,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you light you will find something that will hit and is proper to your intention; on the contrary here, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>re was not any leaf that I met with but had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impertinent, so that I resolved to give it over. This onely I observed upon the whole, that he does treat his Answerer the most b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sely and ingratefully that ever man did. For, whereas in his whole first Book there was not one sound principle, and scarce any thing in the second, but what the Answerer had given him occasion to amend and rectifie if he had understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; after so great an obligation he handles him with more rudeness than is imaginable. I know it may be said in Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his defence, that in this his second Book he hath made his matters in many places much worse then they were before. But I say that was <hi>Bayes</hi> his want of understanding, and that he knew not how to take hold of so charitable an opportunity as was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, and 'twas none of the Answerers fault. There are amongst men some that do not study always the true rules of Wisdom a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>me Policy.

but in a seeming Fury too and transport of Passion.</hi> But however, seeing he hath brought us so good Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, let us suppose what is not to be supposed, that Railing is lawful. Whether it be expedient or no will yet be a new question. And I think Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> when he hath had time <hi>to cool his thoughts,</hi> may be trusted yet with that consideration, and to compute whether the good that he hath done by Railling do countervail the damage which both he in particular and the Cause he labours, have suffered by it. For in my observation, if we meet with an Argument in the Streets, both Men, Women, and Boys, that are the Auditory, do usually give it on the modester side, and conclude, that he that rails most has the least rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>For the second, Where he would prove that though he had railed, yet his Answerer <hi>J.

But <hi>quod restat probandum</hi> do's the business without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding other satisfaction. Then, if it were the down-right Lye; it is to be examined who gave the Lve first: for that alters the case. And last of all (but which is indeed upon a quarrel the least mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial point, yet, it too comes under some consideration.) which of the two was in the right, and which of them spoke truth, and which lyed. These are all things to be discussed in their proper places. For I do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that the Answerer gave <hi>Bayes</hi> the down-right Lye.

Answerer I find it not. But wheresoever 'twas it serves to good purpose. For no man would imagine that he could have received so universal a Defeat, and appear in so good humour. A terrible Disputant he is, when he has set up an hard word to be his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; 'Tis a very wholesome thing he knows, and prolongs life: for all the while he can keep up this ball, he may decline the Question. But the poor Word is sure to be mumbled and mowsled to purpose, and to be made an example. But let us, with Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his leave, examine the thing for once a little clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. The Non-conformists, as I took notice before, do object to some of the Rites of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> under the name of Symbolical or significant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. They observe the Church of <hi>England</hi> does in the discourse of Ceremonies printed before the Common Prayer Book, declare that the retaining of those Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, is not onely <hi>as they serve for decent Order and Godly Discipline; but as they are apt to stir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty to God, by some special and notable significancy, whereby he may be edified.</hi> They further observe the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s definition of a Sacrament: That it is <hi>an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward visible sign of an inward spiritual Grace.</hi> They find these Ceremonies, so constituted, impos'd upon them by Authority; and more-over, according to our Authors principle, made a new part of the Divine Law. They therefore quarrel and except against these under the notion of Sacraments, and insist that the Church is not impowred to institute such Ceremonies under such obligations and penalties as they are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Or, if you will, in stead of Church you may say rather the Magistrats: for as much as our Author hath <hi>pro hac vice</hi> delivered the Keys and the whole power of the House into his hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:93801:63"/>Now the Author having got them at this lock, crys Victory. Nothing less will serve him than a three days triumph, as if he had conquered <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and let him have a fourth day added, if he please, over the <hi>Terra Incognita</hi> of <hi>Geneva.</hi> There is no end of his Ostentation and Pageantry: and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Non-conformists follow the wheels of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, to be led afterwards to the Prison and there exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. He had said p. 446. of his Second Book, <hi>Here</hi> Cartwright <hi>begun his Objection, and here he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately check'd in his Carrear by</hi> Whitgift (you might Mr. Author, for respect sake have called him at leaft Mr. if not Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi>) <hi>who told him plainly, he could not be ignorant that to the making of a Sacrament, besides the external Element, there is required a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in his Word that it should be done, and a promise annexed to it, whereof the Sacrament is a Seal.</hi> And in pursuance hereof, p 447. our Author saith, <hi>Here then I fix my foot, and dare him to his teeth, to prove that any thing can be capable of the nature or office of Sacraments that is not established by Divine Institution and upon Promise of Divine Acceptance.</hi> Upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of this Argument 'tis that he <hi>Hectors</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chillezes</hi> all the Non-conformists out of the pit in this Preface. This is the Sword that was consecrated first upon the Altar, and thence presented to the Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church in all Ages. This is that with which Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> gave <hi>Cartwright his death's wound: and laid the Puritan Reformation a gasping.</hi> This is the weapon wherewith Master <hi>Hooker gained those lasting and eternal Trophies over that baffled Cause.</hi> This is that with which Bishop <hi>Bramhal wrought those wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things that exceeded all belief.</hi> This hath been trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted successively to the Writer of the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> and to this our Author.

The Non-conformists had need desire a Truce to bury their dead. Nay there are none left alive to desire it: but they are slain every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Son of them. Yet perhaps they are but stound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and may revive again. For I do not see all this while, that any of them have written, as a great Prelate of ours, a Book of <hi>Seven Sacraments:</hi> or attempted to prove that those <hi>Symbolical</hi> Ceremonies are indeed Sacraments. Nothing less. 'Tis that which they most labour against, and they complain that these things should be imposed on them with so high Penalty, as want nothing of a Sacramental nature but Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And because an Humane Institution is herein made an equal force to a Divine Institution, therefore it is that they are agrieved. All that they mean, or could mean, as far as I or any man can perceive, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that these Ceremonies are a kind of <hi>Anti-Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and so obtruded upon the Church, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condescending to these additional Inventions, no man is to be admitted to partake of the true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were of Christ's appointing. For, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sign of the Cross, our Church will not receive any one to Baptism, as also without kneeling no man is suffered to come to the Communion. So that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, our Author and his partners have wounded themselves only with this Argument: and have had as little occasion here to sing their <hi>Te Deum</hi>'s, as the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But therefore general and applicable Rules of Scripture they urge as directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Conscience; unto which our Author gives no satisfactory Solution, but by superseding and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing the Conscience, or exposing it to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest penalties. But here I say then is their main ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that things indifferent, and that have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per signature, or significancy to that purpose, should by command be made necessary conditions of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Communion. I have many times wished for peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness-sake that they had a greater latitude; but if unless they should stretch their Consciences till they tear again, they cannot conform, what remedy? For I must confess that Christians have a better Right and Title to the Church, and to the Ordinances of God there, than the Author hath to his Surplice. And

So that you see, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison between the signification of Words and Ceremonies stands firm as the Pillars of the Earth, and the Foundations of our Faith.</q> Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> might I see, have spared Sir <hi>Salomon</hi>'s Sword of the Divine Institution of the Sacraments. Here is the terriblest weapon in all his Armory; and therefore I perceive, reserved by our Duellist for the last onset. And, I who am a great well-wisher to the Pillars of the Earth, or the eight Elephants, lest we should have an Earth-quake; and much more a Servant to the Kiag's Prerogative, lest we should all fall into consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and perfectly devoted to the Foundations of our Faith, lest we should run out into Popery or Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism; have no heart to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>his incounter: lest if I should prove that the Magistrates absolute unlimited and uncontrolable Power doth not extend to define the signification of all words, I should thereby not only be the occasion of all those mischiefs mentioned, but, which is of far more dismal Importance, the loss of two or three so significant Ceremonies. But though I therefore will not dispute against that Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Princes Crown, yet I hope that without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much harm, I may observe that for the most part they left it to the people, and seldome themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised it. And even <hi>Augustus Casar,</hi> though he was so great an Emperour, and so valiant a man in his own person, was used to fly from a new word though it were single, as studiously as a Mariner would avoid a Rock for fear of splitting. The differences of one Syllable in the same word hath madeas considerable a Controversy as most have been in the Church, betwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>is as dangerous to take a man by the tongue, as a bear by the tooth. And had I a mind to play the Politician, like Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> upon so pleasant and copious a Subject, I would demonstrate that though the imposition of Ceremonies hath bred much mischief in the world, yet (shall I not venture too upon one word once for a tryal) such a Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Transubstantiation of Language would throw all into Rebellion and Anarchy, would shake the Crowns of all Princes, and reduce the World into a second <hi>Babel.</hi> Therefore, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> I doubt you were not well advised to make so close an Analogy betwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> imposing of significant words and significant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: for I fear the Argument may be improved against you, and that Princes finding that of words so impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and of ill consequence, will conclude that of Ceremonies to be no less pernicious. And the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists (who are great Traders you know, in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and therefore thrown out of the Temple) will be certainly on your back. For they will appropriate your pregnant Text of <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> to preaching or praying in an unknown Tongue, which such an imposition of words would be: and then, to keep you to your Similitude, they will say too that yours are all Latine Ceremonies, and the Congregation does not understand them.

This is such a drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that rather than undergo it, I dare say, there is no Prince but would resign to you so Pedantical a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.

For, if he published but once a Proclamation to that purpose, he must forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with set our another to stamp and declare the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all the words contained in it, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to appoint the meaning of all the words in this, and so on: that here is work cut out in one Paper of State for the whole Privy Council, both Secretaries of State, and all the Clerks of the Council, for one Kings Reign, and <hi>in infinitum.</hi> But, I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, knowing how ambitious Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> is of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over words, and jealous of his own Prerogative of refining Language, how he came to be so liberal of it to the Prince: Why, the same thing that induced him to give the Prince a power an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They want all consideration, all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in those things; and I never heard of any of them at any time, who, if they got into Power or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, did ever make the least experiment or overture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the peace of the Church and Nation they lived in. They are the <hi>Politick Would be</hi>'s of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Not Bishops, but Men that have a mind to be Bishops, and that will do any thing in the World to compass it. And, though Princes have always a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mark upon these Men, and value them no more than they deserve, yet I know not very well, or perhaps I do know, how it oftentimes happens that they come to be advanced. They are Men of a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

You would think the same day that they took up Divinity they divested themselves of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and so they may procure and execute a Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Non-conformists, that they had forgot the Gospel. They cannot endure that Humility, that Meekness, that strictness of Manners and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the true way of gaining Reputation and Authority to the Clergy; much less can they content themselves with the ordinary and comfortable provis sion that is made for the Ministry: But, having who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calculated themselves for Preferment, and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, know or practise no other means to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves venerable but by Ceremony and Severity.

which is in the Latine <hi>Vestra Clementia.</hi> But of all these, none are so eager and virulent, as some, who having had relation to the late times, have got access to <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fortune,</hi> and are resolved to make their best of her.

That which astonishes me, and only raises my indignation is, that of all sorts of Men this kind of Clergy should always be, and have been for the most precipitate, brutish, and fanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Counsels. The former Civil War cannot make them wise, nor his Majesties happy Return, good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured; but they are still for running things up unto the same extreams. The softness of the Universities where they have been bred, the gentleness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in which they have been nurtured, hath but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated their nature; and they seem to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted no <hi>Idea</hi> of wisdom, but what they learnt at School, the Pedantry of Whipping.

'Tis matter of Conscience: and if Kings do, out of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, connive at the other infirmities of their People; If great perfons do out of civility condescend to their inferiours; and if all men out of common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity do yield to the weaker; Will your Clergy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the men, who, in an affair of Conscience, and where perhaps 'tis you are in the wrong, be the onely hard-hearted and inflexible Tyrants; and not only so, but instigate and provoke Princes to be the Ministers of your cruelty? But, I say, Princes, as far as I can take the height of things so far above me, must needs have other thoughts, and are past such boys-play to stake their Crowns against your Pins. They do not think fit to command things unnecesfary, and where the profit cannot countervail the hazard.

That the Prince therefore, by how much God hath indued him with a clearer reason, and by consequence with a more enlightned judgement, ought the rather to take heed lest by punishing Conscience, he violate not onely his own, but the Divine Majesty. But as to that Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> which you still inculcate of the late War, and its horrid Catastrophe, which you will needs have to be upon a religious account: 'Tis four and twenty years ago, and after an <hi>Act of Oblivion;</hi> and for ought I can see, it had been as seasonable to have shown <hi>Casars</hi> bloody Coat, or <hi>Thomas a Beckets</hi> bloody Rochet. The chief of the offenders have long since made satisfaction to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and the whole Nation hath been swept suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of late years by those terrible scourges of Heaven: So that methinks you might in all this while have satiated your mischievous appetite. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you suffered in those times, his Majesty who had much the greater loss, knowing that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Glorious Father will alwayes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, is the best Judge how long the revenge o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ght to be pursued. But if indeed out of your superlative care of his Majesty and your <hi>Living,</hi> you are afraid of some new disturbance of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let me so far satisfie you as I am satisfied. The Non-conformists say that they are bound in conscience to act as far as they can, and for the rest to suffer to the utmost. But because though they do mean honestly, 'tis so hard a Chapter for one that thinks himself in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93801:73"/>
right to suffer extremities patiently, that some think it impossible; I say next, that it's very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom seen that in the same age, a Civil War, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such an interval, has been raised again upon the same pretences: But Men are also weary, that he would be knock'd on the head that should raise the first disturbance of the same nature. A new War must have, like a Book that would sell, a new Title.</p>
            <p>I am asham'd Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> that you put me on talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus impertinently, (for Policy in us is so). There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be short, the King hath so indulged and obliged the Non-conformists by his late mercy, that if there were any such Knave, there can be no such Fool among them, that would ever lift up an ill thought against him. And for you Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> he is assured of your Loyalty, so that I think you may enjoy your <hi>Living</hi> very peaceably, which I know is all your business. 'Twas well replyed of the <hi>English</hi> man in <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourths time, to the <hi>French</hi> man that ask'd him insulting, When they should see us there again? <hi>When your sins are greater than ours.</hi> There are as many occasions of War, as there are Vices i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>clesiastical Policy is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to revenge your quarrel, the World would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be at quiet. Therefore Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> let all those things of former times alone, and mind your own business; for Kings, believe me, as they have Royal understandings, so have G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>'s Essayes;</hi> where you find sometimes scarce one word in the discourse of the matter held forth in the Title. But now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he takes up this Argument and debates it to purpose. For I had before begun to shew that he had writ not only his two former Books but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially too this Preface, with an evil eye and aim at his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sty, and the measures he had taken of Government. And whoever will take the pains to read here, will soon be of my mind. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty had I said, the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1671. issued his Declaration of Indulgence to tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. He, on the contrary, issues out thereupon, all in hast and as fast as he could write, this his Remonstrance or Manifesto against Indulgence to tender Consciences: and to make his Majesties proceedings more odious, stirs up this seditious matter, of what probability there is of Popery.</p>
            <p>And this he discourses, to be sure, in his own imagination very cunningly. For he knows that there was an Act of Parliament in this Kings Reign with a greater penalty than that of 50 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of spreading false News, against reports of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And therefore, he resolves to handle it so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> warily, that he himself might escape, but might draw others that should answer him, within the danger of that Act, and that he may lay the crime at their doors.

            </p>
            <p>It had been something a safer and more dutiful way of writing, A Preface shewing the CAUSE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESNESS of the Fears and Jealousies of PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERY.

               </gap> and malicious way of calumny, than by making a needless Apology for another, in a criminal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. As, suppose I should write a Preface showing what Grounds there are of Fears and Jealousies of <hi>Bayes</hi> his being and Atheist. But this is exactly our Authors method and way of contrivance; whereby more effectually by far than by any flying Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house tattle, he traduces the State, and by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so pernicious a question, fills all mens mouths, and beats out all mens eyes with the probability of the return of POPERY. Had he heard any that malignly and officiously talk'd to such a purpose, it had been the part of one so prudent as he is, not to have continued the Discourse. Had he (as he hath a great gift that way) pick'd up out of any mans talk or writing, matter whereof to make an ill story; there was a better and more r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> proceeding, had he meant honestly to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Government, to have prevented the evil, and to have brought the offender to punishment. He should have gone to one of the Secretaries of State, or to some other of his Majesties Privy Council, and have given them Information. But, in stead of that, I am afraid that in the survey of this business, we shall find, that even some of them are either accused, or shrewdly mark'd out with a Character of our Authors displeasure. Therefore, I will now come nearer to his ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>For when I said, to see Popery return here,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93801:79"/>
would be a very sinister accident; I was just think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that story; the Verses, to humour them in translation, being only this,</p>

               <l>O what a trick unlucky, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky a trick,</l>
               <l>To see friend Doctor Patrick, bestrid by Father Patrick!</l>
            </q>
            <p>Which seem'd to me, would be the most impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and preposterous spectacle that ever was seen; and more rediculous for a sight, than the <hi>Friendly Debate is</hi> for a Book. And yet if Popery come in, this must be, and worse.</p>
            <p>But now I see there is some danger by the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consormists opposition to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> And now your business is all fixed. The Fanaticks are ready at hand to bear the blame of all things. Many a good job have I seen done in my time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of the Fanaticks. I do not think Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> ever breaks his shins, but it is by stumbling upon a Fanatick. And how shall they bring in Popery? why th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s, three wayes. <hi>First, By crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting disorders and disturbances in the State, Secondly, By the assistance of Atheism and Irreligion. Thirdly, By joyning with crafty and sacrilegious Statesmen in confederacy.</hi> Now here I remark two things. One, that however you do not find that the Fanaticks are inclinable to Popery, only they may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate it by creating disturbances in the State. Another is, that I see these Gentlemen, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, the Atheists, and the Sacrilegious Statesmen are not yet acquainted; but you have appointed them a meeting (I believe it must be at your Lodging, or no where;) and I hope you will treat them handsomly. But I think it was not so wisely done, nor very honestly, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> to lay
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93801:79"/>
so dangerous a Plot as this; and instruct men that are strangers yet to one another, how to contrive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ogether such a Conspiracy. But first to your first.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fanaticks you say may probably raise distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the State.</hi> For they <hi>are so little friends to the present Government, that their enmity to that is one of the main Grounds of their quarrel to the Church.</hi> But now, though I must confess it is very much to your purpose, if you could perswade men so, I think you are clear out, and misrepresent here the whole matter. For I know of no enmity they have to the Church it self, but what it was in her power alwayes to have remedied, and so it is still. But such as you it is that have alwayes strove by your leasings to keep up a strangeness and misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding betwixt the King and his people; and all the mischief that hath come on't does lye much at your door.</p>
            <p>Whereas they, as all the rest of mankind, are men for their own ends too: And no sooner hath the King shown them this late favour, but you Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> and your partners reproach them for being too much friends to the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I know nothing they demand, but what is so far from doing you any harm, that it would only make you better. But that indeed is the harm, that is the thing you are afraid of Here our Author divides the discourse into a great Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that if he were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Funeral Sermon, he could not say more in her commendation; and a contrary invective against the Nonconformists, upon whom (as if all he had said before had been nothing) he unloads his whole Leystal, and dresseth them up all in <hi>Sambenitas,</hi> painted with all the flames and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

in Hell, to be led to the place of Execution, and there burnt to ashes. Nevertheless, I find on either side only the natural effect of such Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles and Oratory, that is, not to be beleived. The Church of <hi>England</hi> (I mean as it is by Law E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, lest you should think I equivocate) hath such a stock of solid and deserved Reputation that it is more than you (Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi>) can spoyl or deface by all the Pedantry of your commendation. Only there is that party of the Clergy, that I not long ago described, and who will alwaies presume to be the only Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have been a perpetual Eye-sore, that I may not say a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Gangreen in so perfect a beauty. And, as it joyes my heart to hear any thing well said of her; so I must confess, it stirs my choler, when I hear those men pride and boast themselves under the Mask of her Authority. Neither did I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore approve of an expression you here use: <hi>The Power of Princes would be a very precarious thing without the assistance of Ecclesiasticks, and all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do's &amp; must ow its quiet and continuance to the Churches Patronage</hi> That is as much as to say, That but for the assistance of your <hi>Ecclesiastical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,</hi> Princes might go a begging: and that the Church, that is you, have the <hi>Juspatronatus</hi> of the Kingdome, and may present whom you think fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> This is indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the return of Popery; and right</p>

                  </gap>ection of a wise and gracious Prince: especially when besides the impregnable confidence that we have from his own Inclination, it is so manifest, that he never can forsake it either in Honour or Interest.</hi> This is a prety way of cokesing indeed, while you are all this while cutting the grass under his feet, and animating the people against the exercise of his Ecclesiastical Supremacy. Men are not so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted; but they can see through this oblique Rhetorication and Sophistry. If there be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in his time of taking a <hi>Pin out of the Church</hi> (for that it is you intended) why do you then speak of it in his time, but that you mean mischief? but here you do not only mow the grass under his feet, but you take the pillow from under his head. <hi>But should it ever happen that any King of</hi> England <hi>should be prevail'd with to deliver up the Church, he bad as good at the same time resign up his Crown.</hi> This is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty plain dealing, and you have doubtless secur'd hereby that Princes favour: I should have thought it better Courtship in a Divine, to have said, O King, Live for ever. But I see Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> that you and your Partners are very necessary men, and it were dangerous disobliging you. But in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent and nauseous discourse, you have all along appropriated or impropriated all the Loyalty from the Nobility, the Gentry, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and dedicated it to the Church; So, I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>you are a little too immoderate against the body, of the Nonconformists. You represent them, to a man, to be all of them of Republican Principles, most pestilent and, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> enemies to Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; Traytors and Rebells; such miscreants as never was in the world before, and fit to be pack'd out of it with the first convenience. And, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that all the Argument of your Books is but very frivolous and trivial: only the memory of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93801:81"/>
the late War serves for demonstration, and the detestable sentence and execution, of his lute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, is represented again upon the Scaffold; and you having been, I suspect, better acquainted with Parliament Declarations formerly upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, do now apply and turn them all over to prove that the late War was wholly upon a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Cause, and the dissenting party do still go big with the same Monster. I grew hereupon much displeased with my own ignorance of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of those Troubles so near our own times, and betook my self to get the best Information concerning them, to the end that I might, If it appear'd so, decline the dangerous acquaintance of the Nonconformists, some of whom I had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for honest men, nor therefore avoided their Company. But I took care nevertheless, not to receive Impressions from any of their party; but to gather my lights from the most impartial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities that I could meet with. And <hi>I</hi> think I am now partly prepared to give you, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> some better satisfaction in this matter. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you are a dangerous person, I shall as little as possible, say any thing of my own, but speak too before good Witnesses. First of all therefore, I will without farther Ceremony, fall upon you with the but-end of another Arch-bishop. 'Tis the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Abbot,</hi> in the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative under his own hand concerning his disgrace at Court in the time of his late Majesty. I shall only in the way demand excuse, if, contrary to my fashion, the names of some eminent persons in our Church long since dead, be reviv'd here under no very good character; and most particularly that of Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> who, if for nothing else, yet for his learned Book against <hi>Fisher,</hi> deserved for another Fate than he met with, and ought not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93801:81"/>
now to be mentioned without due honour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> But those names having so many years since escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Press, it is not in my power to conceal them; and I believe Archbishop <hi>Abbot</hi> did not write but upon good Consideration.</p>
            <p>This I have premised for my own Satisfaction, and I will add one thing more, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> for yours. That whereas the things now to be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed relate much to some Impositions of Money in the late King's time, that were carryed on by the Clergy; I know you will be ready to carp at that, as if the Nonconformists had, and would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes enemies to the Kings supply. Whereas, Mr. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ayes,</hi> if I can do the Nonconformists no good, I am resolv'd I will do them no harm, nor desire that they should lye under any imputation on my account. For I write by my own advice, and what I shall alledge concerning the Clergies intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with supplies, is upon a particular aversion, that I have upon good Reason, against their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of our Money. And Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the Reason, which is this. 'Tis not very many years ago that I used to play at <hi>Picket;</hi> and there was a Gentleman of your Robe, a <hi>Dignitary of Lincoln,</hi> very well known and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the Ordinaries, but being not long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ince dead, I will save his name. Now I used to play <hi>Pieces,</hi> and this Gentleman would alwayes go half a Crown with me, and so all the while he sate on my hand he very honestly <hi>gave the Sign,</hi> so that I was alwaies sure to lose. I afterwards dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it, but of all the money that ever I was cheated of in my life, none ever vexed me so, as what I lost by his occasion. And ever since, I have born a great grudge against their fingring of any thing that belongs to me. And I have been told, and show'd the place where the man dwelt in the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93801:82"/>
late King's time near <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> that there was one that used to rob on the high-way, in the habit of a Bishop, and all his fellows rid too in Canonical Coats. And I can but fancy how it madded those, that would have perhaps been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to releive an honest Gentleman in distress, or however would have been less griev'd to be robb'd by such an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>About the same time (for I am speaking within the circle of 20 30, and 40. <hi>Caroli</hi>) that this Book of <hi>Sibthorps,</hi> called <hi>Apostolical Obedience,</hi> was Printed, there came out another of the same stamp, Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled <hi>Religion and Allegiance,</hi> by one Doctor <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring.</hi> It was the substance of two Sermons preached by him at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> beside what of the same nature at his own parish of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> Therein he delivered for truth, <hi>That the King is not bound to observe the Laws of the Realm concerning the Subjects Rights and Liberties, but that his Royal word and command in imposing Loans and Taxes without common consent in Parliament, does oblige the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Conscience upon pain of eternal Damnation, That those who refused to pay this Loan, offended against the Law of God, and the Kings supream Authority, and became guilty of Impiety, Disloyalty and Rebellion.

And after he had been questioned for this doctrine, nevertheless he preached again, <hi>That the King had right to order all as to him should seem good, without any mans consent.

And the choice seemed not imprudent. For on the one hand, it was removed at so moderate a distance from <hi>Popery,</hi> that they should not diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige the <hi>Papists</hi> more than formerly, neither yet could the <hi>Puritans,</hi> with justice reproach these

men, as <hi>Romish Catholicks;</hi> and yet, on the other hand, they knew it was so contrary to the antient reformed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Puritans</hi> would never imbrace it, and so they should gain this pretence further to keep up that convenient and necessary Quarrel against Non-conformity. And accordingly it happened, so that here again was a new <hi>Shiboleth.</hi> And the <hi>Calvinists</hi> were all studiously discountenanced, and none but an <hi>Arminian</hi> was judg'd capable and qualified for imployment in the Church. And though the King did declare, as I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that <hi>Mountague</hi>'s (<hi>Arminian</hi>) Book had been the occasion of the Schisms in the Church; yet care was immediately taken, by those of the same Robe and Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As also it was in <hi>Manwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> Case: who though by Censure in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made incapable of any Ecclesiastical Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was straight made Rector of <hi>Stamford-River<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>So that those who were of understanding in those dayes tell me, that a man would wonder to have heard their kind of preachings.

To show that they were men like others, even cunning men, revengeful men, they drill'd things on, till they might procure a Law, wherein besides all the Conformity that had been of former times enacted, there might be some new Conditions imposed on those that should have or hold any Church Livings, such as they assur'd themselves, that rather than swallow, the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists would disgorge all their Benefic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But to let these things alone; How have they of late years demean'd themselves to his Majesty, although our Author urges their immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the King to be a great obligation he hath upon their Loyalty and Fidelity? I have heard that some of them, when a great Minister of State grew burdensome to his Majesty and the Nation, stood almost in defiance of his Majesties good pleasure, and fought it out to the uttermost in his defence. I have been told that some of them in a matter of <hi>Divorce,</hi> wherein his Majesty desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that justice might be done to the party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griev'd opposed him vigorously, though they made bold too with a point of Conscience in the Case, and went against the judgement of the best Divines of all parties. It hath been observed, that whensoever his Majesty hath had the most urgent occasions for supply, others of them have made it their business to trinkle with the <hi>Members of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi> for obstructing it, unless the King would buy it with a new Law against the Fanaticks. And hence it is that the wisdome of his Majesty and the Parliament must be exposed to after Ages for such a <hi>Supoeer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93801:89"/>
his own best Reasons try to obviate this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, but our Author, who had before our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Manwaring</hi> in their own Bows, is now for retrenching his Authority, and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver calumniates the State with a likelihood, and the Re<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sons thereof of <hi>the return of Popery</hi> into this Nation. And this hath been his first Method by the <hi>Fanaticks raising disturbance:</hi> whereupon if I have raked farther into things than I would have done, the Author's indiseretion will, I hope, excuse me, and gather all the blame for reviving those things which were to be buried in Oblivion. But, by what appears, I cannot see that there is any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of disturbance in the State, but by men of his spirit and principles.</p>
            <p>The second way whereby the Fanatick party, he saith, may at last work the ruine of the Church, is <hi>by combining with the Atheists, for their Union is like the mixture of Nitre and Charcoal, it carries all before it without mercy or resistance.</hi> So it seems, when you have made Gun-power of the Atheists and Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, we are like to be blown up with Popery. And so will the Larks too. But his zeal spends it self most against the <hi>Atheists,</hi> because they use to <hi>jear the Parsons.</hi> That they may do, and no Atheists neither. For really, while Clergy men will, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so serious an office, play the <hi>Drols</hi> and the Boon-companions, and make merry with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not only among themselves, but in Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen's company, 'tis impossible but that they should meet with, at least, an unlucky Repartee sometimes, and grow by degrees to be a tayle, and contempt to the people. Nay, even that which our Athour alwayes magnifies, the Reputation, the Interest, the seculiar grandure of the Church, is indeed the very thing which renders them redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to many, and looks as improper and buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonish,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93801:90"/>
as to have seen the Porter lately in the good <hi>Doctors Cassock</hi> and Girdle. For, so they tell me, that there are no where more Atheists than at <hi>Rome,</hi> because men seeing that Princely garb and pomp of the Clergy, and observing the life and manners, think therefore the meaner of Religion. For certainly, the Reputation and Interest of the Clergy, was first gained by abstracting themselves from the world, attending their Callings, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, strictness of Doctrine, and the same strictness in Conversation; and things are best preserved by the same means they were at fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Tis true he passes his Complement ill-favouredly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough. <q>The Church has at present an impregnable affiance in the wisdom, &amp;c. of so gracious a Prince, that is not capable of such Counsels, should they be sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to him:</q> 
               <hi>though certainly no man that is worthy to be admitted to his Majestrus Favour or Privacy; can be supposed so fool-hardy or presumptuous as to offer</hi> 
               <q>such weak and dishonourable Advice to so wise and able a Prince; Yet Princes are mortal, and if ever hereafter, (and some time or other it must happen) the Crown should chance to settle upon a young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced head, this is usually the first thing in which such Princes are abused by their Keepers and Guardians, &amp;c</q>. But this Complement is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at best, than if discoursing with a man of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I should take him by the Beard.

That would have been like a set of <hi>Elsibeth Players,</hi> that in the Country having worn out and over acted all the Playes they brought with them from <hi>London,</hi> laid their wits together to make a new one of their own.

            <p>To conclude, the Author gives us one ground more, and perhaps more <hi>Seditiously</hi> insinuated than any of the former; that is, if <hi>it should so prove,</hi> that is, if the <hi>Fanaticks by their wanton and unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

All the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of his Treat is <hi>Pork</hi> (he knows the story) but so little disguised by good Cookery, that it discovers the miserableness; or rather the penury of the Host. When I observed how he inveighs against the <hi>Trading part</hi> of the Nation, I thought he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be within the <hi>five mile Act,</hi> and not to come within that distance of any Corporation.

            <p>The Second Person of the Trinity (may I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat these things without offence) to take upon him the Person of a Jewish Zealot, that is, of a notorious Rogue and Cut Throat.</p>
            <p>This seemed to proceed from too slight an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and Knowledge of the Duty we owe to our Saviour. And last of all, in this Preface, as before quoted, he saith, the <hi>Nonconformist Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do spend most of their Pulpit-sweat in making a noise about Communion with God.</hi> So that there is not one Person of the Trinity that he hath not done
