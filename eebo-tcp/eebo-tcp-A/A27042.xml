            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Text is the deſcription of the <hi>Repentance</hi> of the people, in which the <hi>beginning</hi> of their <hi>recovery</hi> doth conſiſt, and by which the <hi>reſt</hi> muſt be attained.

This Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contains the meaning of the Text, which by Gods aſſiſtance, I ſhall now inſiſt on: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Remembring of their own iniquities, and loathing themſelves for them, is the ſign of a Repenting people, and the prognoſtick of their Reſtoration.</hi> (So far as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance may be here expected.)</p>
            <p>For the opening of which, obſerve theſe things following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not all kind of <hi>[Remembring]</hi> that will prove you <hi>penitent.</hi> The impenitent Remember their ſin that they may commit it: They Remember it with love, deſire and delight: The Heart of the worldling goeth after his aery or earthen idol: The heart of the Ambitious feedeth on his vain-glory, and the peoples breath: And the filthy Fornicator is delighted in the thoughts of the object and exerciſe of his luſt. But it is a Remembring, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> From a deep conviction of the evil and odiouſneſs of ſin; 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> And with abhorrence and ſelf-loathing; 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> That leadeth to a reſolved and vigilant <hi>forſaking,</hi> that is the proof of true Repentance, and the prognoſtick of a peoples reſtoration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it is not all <hi>ſelf-loathing</hi> that will ſignifie true <hi>Repentance.</hi> For there is a <hi>ſelf-loathing</hi> of the <hi>Deſperate</hi> and the <hi>damned</hi> ſoul, that abhorreth it ſelf, and teareth and tormenteth it ſelf, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from <hi>ſelf-revenge,</hi> when it finds that it hath wilfully, fooliſhly and obſtinately been its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53082:6"/>
But the <hi>ſelf-loathing</hi> of the truly <hi>penitent,</hi> hath theſe following properties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It proceedeth from the predominant Love of God, whom we have abuſed and offended: The more we Love him, the more we <hi>loath</hi> what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is much excited by the obſervation and ſenſe of his exceeding <hi>mercies,</hi> and is conjunct with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It continueth and encreaſeth under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſſurance of forgiveneſs, and ſenſe of love; and dyeth not when we think we are out of danger.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It containeth a Loathing of ſin as ſin (and a Love of Holineſs as ſuch) and not only a love of eaſe and peace, and a loathing of ſin as the cauſe of ſuffering.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It reſolveth the ſoul againſt returning to its former courſe, and reſolveth it for an entire devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God for the time to come.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It deeply engageth the penitent in a <hi>conflict</hi> againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and maketh him victorious; and ſetteth him to <hi>work</hi> in a life of holineſs as his trade and principal buſineſs in the world.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It bringeth him to a <hi>delight</hi> in God and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and a delight in <hi>himſelf,</hi> ſo far as he findeth God, and Heaven, and Holineſs within him: He can with ſome comfort and content own himſelf and his converſation, ſo far as God (victorious againſt his carnal ſelf) appeareth in him. For as he loveth Chriſt in the <hi>reſt</hi> of his members, ſo muſt he in <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And <hi>this</hi> is it that <hi>ſelf-loathing</hi> doth prepare for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> muſt be the <hi>ſelf-loathing</hi> that muſt afford you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53082:6"/>
comfort, as a penitent people in the way to reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Where you ſee it is implyed, that materially it containeth theſe common acts. 1. <hi>Accuſing</hi> and <hi>Condemning</hi> thoughts againſt our ſelves. It is a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves, and makes us call our ſelves with <hi>Paul, fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived,</hi> yea <hi>mad</hi> (as <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 11.) and with <hi>David</hi> to ſay, <hi>I have done fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. 2. It containeth a deep diſtaſte, and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> with our ſelves; and a <hi>heart-riſing</hi> againſt our ſelves. 3. As alſo an holy <hi>indignation</hi> againſt our ſelves; as apprehending that we have plaid the enemies to our ſelves and God. 4. And it poſſeſſeth us with <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> at our miſcarriages. So that a ſoul in this condition is ſick of it ſelf, and vexed with its ſelf-procured woe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Note alſo, that when <hi>ſelf-loathing</hi> proceedeth from <hi>meer conviction,</hi> and is without the Love of God and holineſs, it is but the <hi>tormentor</hi> of the ſoul, and runs it deeper into ſin; provoking men here to deſtroy their lives; and in hell it is the never dying worm.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>And as by <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Commandment,</hi> God hath given to every man the firſt and principal care and charge of <hi>himſelf,</hi> and his <hi>own</hi> ſalvation, and conſequently of his <hi>own wayes.</hi> So that we may with leſs ſuſpition <hi>loath our ſelves,</hi> then <hi>others;</hi> and are more obliged to do it.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5.

hath no mind or room for the <hi>Remembring</hi> of his fooliſh odious ſin, and the wrong that he is doing to God and to himſelf. <hi>Death</hi> is oblivious: and <hi>Sleep</hi> hath but a diſtracted uneffectual memory, that ſtirreth not the buſie dreamer from his pillow, nor diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any of the work he dreams of. And the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted are <hi>aſleep</hi> and <hi>dead</hi> in ſin. The crowd of cares and worldly buſineſſes; and the tumultuous noiſe of fooliſh ſports, and other ſenſual paſſions and delights, do take up the minds of the unconverted, and turn them from the obſervation of the things of greateſt everlaſting conſequence. They have a memory for <hi>ſin</hi> and the <hi>fleſh,</hi> to which they are <hi>alive;</hi> but not for things ſpiritual and eternal, to which they are <hi>dead.</hi> They Remember not God himſelf <hi>as God,</hi> with any effectual remembrance: <hi>God is not in all their thoughts,</hi> Pſalm 10. 4. They live as <hi>without him in the world,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. And if they <hi>remember not God,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>remember ſin as ſin,</hi> whoſe malignity lyeth in its oppoſition to the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God.

They <hi>forget</hi> that they have ſouls to ſave or loſe; that muſt live in endleſs joy or torment: you may <hi>ſee</hi> by their careleſs and ungodly lives, that they <hi>forget</hi> it.

And he that <hi>remembreth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> remembreth not his <hi>own concernments.</hi> They forget the <hi>end</hi> to which they tend: The <hi>life</hi> which

they muſt live <hi>for ever.</hi> The matters everlaſting (whoſe greatneſs and duration, one would think ſhould ſo command the mind of man, and take up all his thoughts and cares, in deſpight of all the little trifling matters that would avert them, that we ſhould think almoſt of nothing elſe; yet) <hi>theſe,</hi> even <hi>theſe,</hi> that nothing but <hi>deadneſs</hi> or <hi>madneſs</hi> ſhould make a <hi>reaſonable</hi> creature to forget, are <hi>daily forgotten</hi> by the unconverted ſoul, or uneffectually remembred. Many a time have I admired, that men of reaſon that are here to day, and in endleſs joy or miſery to morrow, ſhould be <hi>able</hi> to forget ſuch unexpreſſible concernments! Me thinks they ſhould eaſier forget to riſe, or dreſs themſelves, or to eat or drink, or any thing, then to forget an endleſs life, which is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>certain,</hi> and ſo <hi>near.</hi> A man that hath a <hi>cauſe</hi> to be heard to <hi>morrow,</hi> in which his <hi>life</hi> or <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> is concerned, <hi>cannot forget it:</hi> A wretch that is condemned to die to morrow, cannot forget it. And yet poor ſinners, that are continually uncertain to live an hour, and certain ſpeedily to ſee the Majeſty of the Lord, to their unconceivable joy or terrour, as ſure as now they live on earth, can forget theſe things for which they have their memory; and which one would think ſhould drown the matters of this world, as the report of a Canon doth a whiſper, or as the Sun obſcureth the pooreſt glow-worm. O wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtupidity of an unrenewed ſoul! O wonderful folly and diſtractedneſs of the ungodly!

and in Returning may find life: But ſome either ſcorn them, or quarrel with them, or ſleep under their moſt ſerious and importunate ſolicitations, or careleſly and ſtupidly give them the hearing, as if they ſpoke but words of courſe, or treated about uncertain things, and ſpoke not to them from the God of heaven, and about the things that every man of you ſhall very ſhortly ſee or feel. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time you are called on by the voice of <hi>conſcience</hi> within, to <hi>remember</hi> the unreaſonableneſs and evil of your wayes: but <hi>conſcience</hi> is ſilenced, becauſe it will not be conformable to your luſts. But little do you think what a part your too-late-awakened <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> hath yet to play, if you give it not a more ſober hearing in time. Sometime the voice of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamities,</hi> and National or local judgements do call on you to <hi>remember</hi> the evil of your wayes: But that which is ſpoken to <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>many,</hi> doth ſeem to <hi>moſt</hi> of them as ſpoken unto <hi>none.</hi> Sometime the voice of <hi>particular judgements,</hi> ſeizing upon your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, perſons or eſtates, doth call on you to <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the evil of your wayes: And one would think the rod ſhould make you hear.

well to waſte thy life in vanity? to ſerve thy fleſh? to forget thy God, thy ſoul, thy happineſs? and to thruſt his ſervice into corners, and give him but the odious leavings of the fleſh?] But theſe pleas of God cannot be heard. O horrible impiety! by his <hi>own creatures!</hi> by <hi>reaſonable</hi> creatures (that would ſcorn to be called fools or mad men) the <hi>God of heaven cannot be heard.</hi> The brutiſh, paſſionate, furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinners, <hi>will not Remember.</hi> They <hi>will not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what</hi> they have done, and with <hi>whom</hi> it is that they have to do, and what God thinks and ſaith of men in their condition; and <hi>whither</hi> it is that the fleſh will lead them? and <hi>what</hi> will be the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of all their luſts and vanities? and <hi>how</hi> they will <hi>look back</hi> on all at <hi>laſt?</hi> and whether an <hi>holy</hi> or a <hi>ſenſual</hi> life will be ſweeteſt to a dying man? and what judgement it is that they will all be of, in the controverſie between the fleſh and ſpirit, at the later end? Though they have life, and time, and reaſon for theſe uſes, we cannot entreate them, to conſider of theſe things in time. If our lives lay on it, as their ſalvation, which is more, lyeth on it, we cannot intreate them. If we ſhould kneel to them, and with tears beſeech them, but once a day, or once a week, to beſtow one hour in ſerious conſideration of their latter end, and the everlaſting ſtate of Saints and ſinners, and of the <hi>equity</hi> of the holy wayes of God, and the <hi>iniquity</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them. Till the God of heaven doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule them, we <hi>cannot prevail.</hi> The witneſs that we are forc't to bear, is ſad: It is ſad to us: but it will be ſadder to theſe rebels, that ſhall one day know,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53082:10"/>
that God will not be out-faced; and that they may ſooner ſhake the ſtable earth, and darken the Sun by their reproaches, then out-brave the Judge of all the world, or by all their cavils, wranglings or ſcorns, eſcape the hands of his revenging Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p>But if ever the Lord will ſave theſe ſouls, he will bring their miſdoings to their remembrance. He will <hi>make them think</hi> of that, which they were ſo loth to think on. You cannot <hi>now abide</hi> theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and ſevere meditations: The thoughts of God, and Heaven, and Hell, the thoughts of your ſins, and of your duties, are melancholly unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thoughts to you: But O that you could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know the <hi>thoughts</hi> that you <hi>ſhall have</hi> of all theſe things! Even the proudeſt, ſcornful; hardened ſinner that heareth me this day, ſhall ſhortly have ſuch <hi>a Remembrance,</hi> as will make him wonder at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent blockiſhneſs. O when the unreſiſtible power of heaven ſhall <hi>open</hi> all your ſins before you, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> you to <hi>remember</hi> them, and to <hi>remember</hi> the <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>perſons,</hi> and all the circumſtances of them, What a change will it make upon the moſt ſtout or ſtubborn of the ſons of men? What a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference will there then be between that trembling ſelf-tormenting ſoul, and the ſame that now in his gallantry can make light of all theſe things, and call the meſſenger of Chriſt that warneth him, a Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane or a doting fool! Your <hi>memories</hi> now are <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi> ſubject to your <hi>wills;</hi> and if you <hi>will not think</hi> of your <hi>own,</hi> your <hi>chief,</hi> your <hi>everlaſting</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you may <hi>chooſe.</hi> If you <hi>will chooſe</hi> rather to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53082:10"/>
employ your noble ſouls on beaſtly luſts, and waſte your <hi>thoughts</hi> on things of nought, you may take your courſe, and chaſe a feather with the childiſh world, till overtaking it, you ſee you have loſt your labour. But when <hi>Juſtice</hi> takes the work in hand, your <hi>Thoughts</hi> ſhall be no more ſubject to your <hi>Wills:</hi> You <hi>ſhall</hi> then <hi>Remember</hi> that which you are full <hi>loth</hi> to remember; and would give a world that you <hi>could forget.</hi> Oh then one cup of the waters of oblivion, would be of uneſtimable value to the damned! O what would they not give that they <hi>could but forget</hi> the time they loſt, the mercy they abuſed, the grace which they refuſed, the holy ſervants of Chriſt whom they deſpiſed, the wilful ſins which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the many duties which they wilfully omitted! I have oft thought of their caſe, when I have dealt with melancholy or deſpairing perſons. If I adviſe them to caſt away ſuch thoughts, and turn their minds to other things, they tell me they <hi>cannot;</hi> it is not in their <hi>power;</hi> and I have long found, that I may almoſt as well perſwade a broken head to give over aking. But when the holy God ſhall <hi>purpoſely</hi> pour out the vials of his wrath on the conſciences of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and open the books, and ſhew them all that ever they have done, with all the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how then ſhall theſe worms be able to reſiſt?</p>
            <p>And now I beſeech you all conſider; is it not better to <hi>Remember</hi> your ſins on <hi>earth,</hi> then in <hi>hell?</hi> before your <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> then before your

               <hi>Judge?</hi> for your <hi>cure,</hi> then for your <hi>torment?</hi> Give me leave then, before I go any further, to addreſs my ſelf to you as the Meſſenger of the Lord, with this importunate requeſt, both as you ſtand here in your <hi>private,</hi> and in your <hi>publick</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. In the name of the God of Heaven I charge you [Remember the lives that you have led: Remember what you have been doing in the world! Remember how you have ſpent your time: and whether indeed it is God that you have been ſerving, and Heaven that you have been ſeeking, and Holineſs and Righteouſneſs that you have been practiſing in the world till now? Are your ſins ſo ſmall, ſo venial, ſo few, that you can find no employment on them for your memories? Or is the offending of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, ſo ſlight and ſafe a thing, as not to need your conſideration? God forbid you ſhould have ſuch atheiſtical conceits! Surely God made not his Laws for nought; nor doth he make ſuch a ſtir by his Word, and Meſſengers, and Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt an harmleſs thing? Nor doth he threaten Hell to men for ſmall indifferent matters: Nor did Chriſt need to have dyed, and done all that he hath done to cure a ſmall and ſafe diſeaſe. Surely that which the God of heaven is pleaſed to threaten with everlaſting puniſhment, the greateſt of you all ſhould vouchſafe to <hi>think</hi> on, and with greateſt fear and ſoberneſs to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>It is a pittiful thing, that with <hi>men,</hi> with <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> with <hi>profeſſed Chriſtians, Gods</hi> matters, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53082:11"/>
their <hi>own</hi> matters, their <hi>greateſt</hi> matters, ſhould ſeem unworthy to be <hi>thought on;</hi> when they have thoughts for their honours, and their lands, and friends; and thoughts for their children, their ſervants, and proviſion; and thoughts for their horſes, and their dogs, and ſports! Is God and Heaven leſs worth then theſe? Are death and Judgement matters of leſs moment? Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you would take it ill to have your wiſdom undervalued, and your reaſon queſtioned: For your Honour ſake do not <hi>make</hi> it contemptible your ſelves, in the eyes of all that are truly wiſe. It is the nobleneſs of <hi>objects</hi> that muſt ennoble your <hi>faculties;</hi> and the <hi>baſeneſs</hi> of objects doth <hi>debaſe</hi> them. If <hi>brutiſh objects</hi> be your employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and delight, do I need to tell you what you make your ſelves? If you would be <hi>noble indeed,</hi> let God and everlaſting Glory be the object of your faculties: If you would be <hi>Great,</hi> then dwell on <hi>Greateſt</hi> things: If you would be <hi>High,</hi> then ſeek the things that are above, and not the ſordid things of earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3.

O that I might have now but the grant of this reaſonable requeſt from you, that among all your Thoughts, you would beſtow now and then an hour in the ſerious <hi>Thoughts</hi> of your miſdoings, and ſoberly in your retirement between God and your ſouls, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the paths that you have trod; and whether
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53082:12"/>
you have lived for the work for which you were created? One ſober hour of ſuch employment might be the happyeſt hour that ever you ſpent, and give you more comfort at your final hour, then all the former hours of your life: and might lead you into that new and holy life, which you may review with everlaſting comfort.</p>
            <p>Truly, Gentlemen, I have long obſerved that <hi>Satans</hi> advantage lyeth ſo much on the <hi>brutiſh</hi> ſide, and that the work of mans Converſion, and holy Converſation, is ſo much carryed on by Gods exciting of our <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and that the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ungodly is, that they have <hi>Reaſon</hi> in <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> and not in <hi>uſe,</hi> in the greateſt things, that I perſwade you to this duty with the greater hopes: If the Lord will now perſwade you but to retire from vanity, and ſoberly exerciſe your <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Conſider your wayes,</hi> and ſay, <hi>What have we done?</hi> and <hi>What is it that God would have us do?</hi> and <hi>What ſhall we wiſh we had done at laſt?</hi> I ſay, could you now but be prevailed with, to beſtow as many hours on this work, as you have caſt away in idleneſs, or worſe, I ſhould not doubt, but I ſhould ſhortly ſee the faces of many of you in Heaven, that have been recovered by the uſe of this advice. It is a thouſand pitties, that men that are thought wiſe enough to be entruſted with the publick ſafety, and to be the Phyſitians of a broken State, ſhould have <hi>any</hi> among them that are untruſty to their God, and have not the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to <hi>Remember their miſdoings,</hi> and prevent the danger of their immortal ſouls. Will you ſit all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53082:12"/>
day here, to find out the remedy of a diſeaſed Land; and will you not be intreated by God or man, to ſit down one hour, and find out the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of, and remedy for your own ſouls? Are thoſe men likely to take care of the happineſs of ſo many thouſands, that will ſtill be ſo careleſs of themſelves? Once more therefore I entreate you, <hi>Remember your miſdoings,</hi> leſt <hi>God</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them: And bleſs the Lord that called you this day, by the voice of Mercy, to <hi>Remember</hi> them upon terms of Faith and Hope. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred</hi> they <hi>muſt</hi> be firſt or laſt: And believe it, this is far unlike the ſad remembrance at Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the place of woe and deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And I beſeech you obſerve here, that it is your <hi>Own</hi> miſdoings that you muſt <hi>Remember.</hi> Had it been only the ſins of <hi>other men,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that <hi>differ</hi> from you, or have <hi>wronged</hi> you, or ſtand againſt your <hi>intereſt,</hi> how eaſily would the duty have been performed? How little need ſhould I have had to preſs it with all this importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? How confident ſhould I be, that I could convert the <hi>moſt,</hi> if <hi>this</hi> were the Converſion? It grieves my ſoul to hear how quick and conſtant high and low, learned and unlearned are at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable contumelious <hi>remembring</hi> of the faults of others: how cunningly they can bring in their inſinuated accuſations: how odiouſly they can aggravate the ſmalleſt faults, where diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence cauſeth them to diſtaſte the perſon: how
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53082:13"/>
ordinarily they judge of actions by the perſons, as if <hi>any thing</hi> were a crime that is done by ſuch as they diſlike, and <hi>all</hi> were <hi>vertue</hi> that is done by thoſe that fit their humours: How commonly Brethren have made it a part of their <hi>ſervice of God,</hi> to ſpeak or write uncharitably of his <hi>ſervants;</hi> labouring to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the <hi>hearers charity,</hi> which had more need in this unhappy time, of the <hi>bellows</hi> then the <hi>water!</hi> How uſual it is with the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that cannot reach the truth, and the impious that cannot bear it, to call ſuch <hi>Hereticks</hi> that know more then themſelves; and to call ſuch <hi>Preciſians, Puritanes,</hi> (or ſome ſuch name which Hell invents, as there is occaſion) who dare not be ſo <hi>bad</hi> as they! How odious, men pretending to much gravity, learning and moderation, do labour to make thoſe that are dear to God; and what an art they have to widen differences, and make a ſea of every lake, and that perhaps under pretence of blaming the uncharitableneſs of others! How far the very Sermons and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of ſome learned men are from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule of <hi>doing as we would be done by:</hi> and how loudly they proclaim that ſuch men <hi>love not their neighbours as themſelves;</hi> the moſt unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table words ſeeming moderate which <hi>they give;</hi> and all called intemperate that ſavoureth not of flattery, which they <hi>receive!</hi> Were I calling the ſeveral exaſperated factions now in <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>remember</hi> the miſdoings of their ſuppoſed <hi>adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> What full-mouth'd and debaſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53082:13"/>
would they make? What monſters of Hereſie, and Schiſm, of impiety, treaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, of perjury and perfidiouſneſs, would too many make of the faults of others, while they extenuate their <hi>Own</hi> to almoſt nothing! It is a wonder to obſerve, how the <hi>caſe</hi> doth <hi>alter</hi> with the moſt, when that which was their <hi>adverſaries</hi> caſe, becomes their <hi>own.</hi> The very <hi>prayers</hi> of the godly, and their care of their ſalvation, and their fear of ſinning, doth ſeem their crime in the eyes of ſome that eaſily bear the guilt of ſwearing, drunkenneſs, ſenſuality, filthineſs, and neglect of duty, in <hi>themſelves,</hi> as a tolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
            <p>But if ever God indeed convert you, (though you will pitty others, yet) he will teach you to begin at home, and take the beam out of your own eyes, and to cry out, <hi>[I am the miſerable ſinner.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And leſt theſe <hi>generals</hi> ſeem inſufficient for us to confeſs on ſuch a day as this, and leſt yet your memories ſhould need more help, is it not my duty to mind you of ſome particulars? which yet I ſhall not do by way of <hi>accuſation,</hi> but of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry:</hi> Far be it from me to judge ſo hardly of you, that when you come hither to <hi>lament</hi> your ſins, you cannot with patience endure to be told of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Enquire then, whether there be none among you that live a ſenſual careleſs life; <hi>cloathed</hi> with the beſt, and <hi>faring deliciouſly every day?</hi> in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53082:14"/>
               <hi>gluttony or drunkenneſs, chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtrife or envying, not putting on Chriſt, nor walking in the Spirit, but making proviſion for the fleſh, to ſatisfie the luſts thereof, Rom.</hi> 13. 13, 14. Is there none among you that ſpend your precious time in vanities, that is allowed you to prepare for life eternal? that have time to waſte in complements and fruitleſs talk and viſits; in gaming and unneceſſary recreations, in exceſſive feaſting and entertainments, while God is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and your ſouls forgotten, and you can never find an hour in a day, to make ready for the life which you muſt live for ever. Is there none among you that would take that man for a Puritan or Phanatick, that ſhould employ but half ſo much time for his ſoul, and in the ſervice of the Lord, as you do in unneceſſary ſports and pleaſures, and pampering your fleſh? Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if there be any ſuch among you, as you love your ſouls, <hi>Remember your miſdoings,</hi> and bewail theſe <hi>abominations</hi> before the Lord, in this day of your profeſſed humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Enquire whether there be none among you, that being ſtrangers to the New birth, and to the inward workings of the Spirit of Chriſt upon the ſoul, do alſo <hi>diſtaſte</hi> an <hi>holy Life,</hi> and make it the matter of your reproach, and pacifie your accuſing conſciences with a Religion made up of meer words, and heartleſs out-ſide, and ſo much obedience as your fleſhly pleaſures will

admit; accounting thoſe that go beyond you, eſpecially if they differ from you in your modes and circumſtances, to be but a company of proud, Phariſaical, ſelf-conceited hypocrites, and thoſe whom you deſire to ſuppreſs. If there ſhould be one ſuch perſon here, I would entreat him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it is the ſolemn aſſeveration of our Judge, that <hi>Except a man be converted, and be born again, of water and the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> Joh. 3. 3, 5. Mat. 18. 3. That <hi>if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. That <hi>if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature; old things are paſt away, and all things are become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. That <hi>without holineſs none ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. That <hi>the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt Pure and then Peaceable,</hi> Jam. 3. 17. That <hi>God is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> John 4. 23, 24. That they <hi>worſhip in vain, that teach for Doctrines the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men,</hi> Mat. 15. 8, 9. And that <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed that of the Scribes and Phariſees, you ſhall in no wiſe enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven,</hi> Matth. 5. 20. And I deſire you to remember that its <hi>hard to kick againſt the pricks;</hi> and to proſper in rage againſt the Lord: and that its <hi>better for that man that offendeth one of his little ones, to have had a mill-ſtone faſtened to his neck, and to have been caſt into the bottom of the Sea,</hi> Matth. 18. 6. It is a ſure and grievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that waiteth for all that are <hi>themſelves</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Enquire alſo, Whether there be none among you, that let looſe your paſſions on your inferiours, and oppreſs your poor Tenants, and make them groan under the task, or at leaſt do little to relieve the needy, nor ſtudy not to ſerve the Lord with your eſtates, but ſacrifice all to the pleaſing of your fleſh, unleſs it be ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable pittance, or fruitleſs drops, that are unproportionable to your receivings. If there be any ſuch, let them <hi>Remember</hi> their <hi>iniquities,</hi> and cry for mercy, before the cry of the poor to heaven, do bring down vengeance from him that hath promiſed, to hear their cry, and ſpeedily to avenge them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Enquire, Whether there be none that live the life of <hi>Sodom,</hi> in <hi>Pride, fulneſs of bread and idleneſs,</hi> Ezek. 16. 49. and that are not puſt up with their eſtates and dignities, and are ſtrangers to the humility, meekneſs, patience, and ſelf-denyal of the Saints: That ruffle in bravery, and contend more zealouſly for their honour and preheminence, then for the honour and intereſt of the Lord. For pride of apparel, it was wont to be taken for a childiſh or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh kind of vice, below a man; but its now obſerved among the gallants, that (except in ſpots) the notes of vanity are more legibly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the hair and dreſs of a multitude of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53082:15"/>
effeminate males, then on the females; proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the world <hi>that pride,</hi> which one would think even <hi>pride it ſelf</hi> ſhould have concealed; and calling by theſe ſigns to the beholders to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the emptyneſs of their minds, and how void they are of that inward worth, which is the honour of a Chriſtian, and of a man: It being a marvel to ſee a man of Learning, gravity, wiſdom, and the fear of God, appear in ſuch an antick dreſs.</p>
            <p>I have done with the firſt part <hi>[the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of your own evil wayes and doings.]</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you practically go along with me to the next, <hi>[The loathing of your ſelves in your own eyes, for all your iniquities and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every true Convert doth thus loath himſelf for his iniquities;</hi> and <hi>When God will reſtore a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed people upon their Repentance, he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to this loathing of themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A converted ſoul hath a new and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Light</hi> to help him, to ſee thoſe matters of humbling uſe, which others ſee not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly, he hath the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin, and of <hi>himſelf.</hi> He ſeeth the odious face of ſin, and ſeeth how much his heart and life, in his ſinful dayes abounded with it, and how great a meaſure yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53082:16"/>
3. He hath ſeen by Faith the Lord himſelf: The Majeſty, the holineſs, the jealouſie, the goodneſs of the eternal God whom he hath offended; and therefore muſt needs <hi>abhorr him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> John 42. 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He hath taſted of Gods <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> againſt him for his ſin already. God himſelf hath ſet it home, and awakened his conſcience, and held it on, till he hath made him underſtand that the conſuming fire is not to be jeſted with.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He hath ſeen <hi>Chriſt Crucified,</hi> and mourned over him. This is the glaſs that doth moſt clearly ſhew the uglineſs of ſin: And here he hath learned to abhor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He hath foreſeen by Faith the <hi>End of ſin,</hi> and the doleful recompence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly: His faith beholdeth the miſery of damned ſouls, and the Glory which ſinners caſt away. He heareth them before-hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and lamenting, and crying out of their former folly, and wiſhing in vain that all this were to do again, and that they might once more be tryed with another life, and reſolving then how holily, how ſelf-denying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would live! He knows if ſin had had its way, he had been plunged into this helliſh miſery himſelf, and therefore he muſt needs <hi>loath himſelf for his iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53082:16"/>
7. Moreover the true Convert hath had the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt taſt of <hi>mercy;</hi> of the blood of Chriſt; of the offers and Covenant of grace; of <hi>reprieving</hi> mercy; of <hi>pardoning</hi> mercy; of <hi>healing</hi> and <hi>preſerving</hi> mercy; and of the unſpeakable mercy contained in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of <hi>everlaſting life:</hi> And to find that he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt <hi>all this mercy,</hi> doth conſtrain him to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre himſelf.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And it is only the true Convert that hath a <hi>new and holy nature,</hi> contrary to ſin; and therefore as a man that hath the <hi>Leproſie</hi> doth <hi>loath himſelf</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his <hi>nature</hi> is contrary to his <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> ſo is it (though operating in a freer way) with a converted ſoul as to the Leproſie of ſin. Oh how he <hi>loaths</hi> the remnants of his pride and paſſion; his exceſſive cares, deſires, and fears; the backwardneſs of his ſoul to God and Heaven! Sin is to the new nature of every true Believer, as the food of a Swine to the ſtomack of a man; if he have eaten it, he hath no reſt till he hath vomited it up; and then when he looketh on his vomit, he loatheth himſelf to think how long he kept ſuch filth within him; and that yet in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome there is ſome remains.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The true Covert is one that is <hi>much at home;</hi> his heart is the Vineyard which he is daily dreſſing; his work is ordinarily about it; and therefore he is acquainted with thoſe ſecret ſins, and daily failings, which ungodly men that are ſtrangers to themſelves, do not obſerve, though they have them in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Laſtly, A ſerious Chriſtian is a <hi>workman of the Lords,</hi> and daily buſie at the exerciſe of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53082:17"/>
and therefore hath occaſion to obſerve his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and failings, and from ſad experience is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to abhorre himſelf.</p>
            <p>But with careleſs unrenewed ſouls it is not ſo; ſome of them may have a mild ingenuous diſpoſition; and the knowledge of their unworthineſs; and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily they will confeſs ſuch ſins, as are ſmall diſgrace to them, or cannot be hid; or under the terrible gripes of conſcience, in the hour of diſtreſs and at the approach of death, they will do more; and abhorre themſelves perhaps as <hi>Judas</hi> did; or make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained confeſſion through the power of fear. But ſo far are they from this <hi>loathing of themſelves for all their iniquities,</hi> that ſin is to them as their element, their food, their nature, and their friend.</p>
            <p>And now, Honourable, Worthy and beloved au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, it is my duty to enquire, and to provoke you to enquire, whether the Repreſentative body of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and each man of <hi>you</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, be thus affected to your ſelves or not. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>you</hi> to enquire of it, as you love your ſouls, and love not to ſee the death-marks of impenitencie on them. It concerneth <hi>us</hi> to enquire of it, as we love you and the Nation, and would fain ſee the marks of Gods return in mercy to us, in your <hi>ſelf-loathing</hi> and return to God. Let conſcience ſpeak as before the Lord that ſees your hearts and will ſhortly judg you: Have you had ſuch a ſight of your naturall and actuall ſin and miſery, of your neglect of God, your contempt of Heaven, your loſs of precious haſty time, your worldly, fleſhly, ſenſuall lives, and your omiſſion of the great and holy works which you were
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53082:17"/>
made for; have you had ſuch a ſight and ſenſe of theſe, as hath filled your ſouls with ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? and cauſed you in tears or hearty grief to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your ſinfull careleſs lives, before the Lord. Do you <hi>loath</hi> your ſelves for all this, as being vile in your own eyes, and each man ſay, <hi>What a wretch was I? what an unreaſonable ſelf-hating wretch, to do all this againſt my ſelf? what an unnaturall wretch! what a monster of rebellion and ingratitude, to do all this against the Lord of love and mercy? what a deceived fooliſh wretch! to preferre the pleaſing of my luſt and ſenſes, a pleaſure that periſheth in the fruition, and is paſt as ſoon as its received, before the manly pleaſures of the Saints, and before the ſouls delight in God, and before the unſpeakable everlasting pleaſures? was there any compariſon between the bruitiſh pleaſures of the fleſh, and the ſpirituall delights of a believing ſoul, in looking to the endles pleaſure which we ſhall have with all the Saints and Angels in the glorious preſence of the Lord. Was God and glory worth no more, then to be caſt aſide for ſatiating of an unſatisfiable fleſh and fancie! and to be ſold for a harlot, for a forbidden cup; for a little aire of popular applauſe, or for a burdenſome load of wealth and power, for ſo ſhort a time? where's now the gain and pleaſure of all my former ſins! what have they left but a sting behind them? How neer is the time when my departing ſoul muſt look back on all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and profits that ever I enjoyed, as a dream when one awaketh; as deluſory vanities, that have done all for me that ever they will doe, and all is but to bring my fleſh unto corruption</hi> (Gal. 6. 8.) <hi>and my ſoul to this diſtreſsing grief and fear! Add then I must ſing and</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53082:18"/>
               <hi>laugh no more! I muſt brave it out in pride no more! I muſt know the pleaſures of the fleſh no more! but be levelled with the pooreſt, and my body laid in loathſome darkneſs, and my ſoul appear before that God whom I ſo wilfully refuſed to obey and honour. O wretch that I am! where was my underſtanding, when I plaid ſo boldly with the flames of hell, the wrath of God, the poiſon of ſin! when</hi> God <hi>ſtood by and yet I ſinned! when</hi> conſcience <hi>did rebuke me, and yet I ſinned! when Heaven or hell were hard at hand, and yet I ſinned! when to pleaſe my God and ſave my ſoul I would not forbear a filthy luſt, or a forbidden vanity of no worth! when I would not be perſwaded to a holy, heavenly, watchfull life, though all my hopes of Heaven lay on it. I am aſhamed of my ſelf: I am confounded in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my wilfall ſelf-deſtroying folly! I loath my ſelf for all theſe abhominations: O that I had lived in beggery and rags, when I lived in ſin: and O that I had lived with God in a priſon or in a wilderneſs, when I refuſed a holy heavenly life, for the love of a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full world! Will the Lord but pardon what is paſt, I am reſolved through his grace to do ſo no more, but to loath that filth that I took for pleaſure, and to abhorre the ſin that I made my ſport; and to die to the glory and riches of the world, which I made my idoll; and to live entirely to that God that I did ſo long and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily neglect; and to ſeek that treaſure, that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that delight, that will fully ſatisfie my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and anſwer all my care and labour, with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite advantage. Holineſs or nothing ſhall be my work and life; and Heaven or nothing ſhall be my portion and felicity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53082:18"/>
Theſe are the thoughts, the affections the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every regenerate gracious ſoul. For your ſouls ſake enquire now, Is it thus with you? or have you thus returned with <hi>ſelf-loathing</hi> to the Lord, and firmly engaged your ſouls to him at your enterance into a holy life? I muſt be plain with you Gentlemen, or I ſhall be unfaithfull; and I muſt deal cloſely with you, or I cannot deal honeſtly and truly with you. As ſure as you live, yea as ſure as the word of God is true, you muſt all be ſuch <hi>converted men, and loath your ſelves for your iniquities,</hi> or be condemned as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent to everlaſting fire. To hide this from you, is but to deceive you, and that in a matter of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times greater moment then your lives. Perhaps I could have made ſhift, inſtead of ſuch ſerious admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, to have waſted this hour in flaſhy oratory, and neat expreſſions, and ornaments of reading, and other things that are the too common matter of oſtentation, with men that preach Gods word in jeaſt, and believe not what they are perſwading others to believe. Or if you think <hi>I could not,</hi> I am indifferent, as not much affecting the honour of <hi>being able,</hi> to offend the Lord, and wrong your ſouls, by dallying with holy things. Flattery in theſe things of ſoul concernment, is a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh vilany, that hath but a very ſhort reward; and thoſe that are pleaſed with it to day, may curſe the flatterer for ever. Again therefore let me tell you, (that which I think you will confeſs,) that it is not your greatneſs, nor your high looks, nor the gallantry of your ſpirits that ſcorns to be thus humbled, that will ſerve your turn when God ſhall deal with you, or ſave your carcaſſes from rottenneſs and duſt, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53082:19"/>
your guilty ſouls from the wrath of the Almighty. Nor is it your contempt of the threatnings of the Lord, and your ſtupid neglect, or ſcorning at the meſſage, that will endure, when the ſudden unreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible light ſhall come in upon you and convince you, or you ſhall ſee and feel what now you refuſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve! Nor is it your outſide hypocriticall Religion, made up of meer words or ceremonies, and giving your ſouls but the leavings of the fleſh, and making God an underling to the world, that will do any more to ſave your ſouls, then the picture of a feaſt to feed your bodies. Nor is it the <hi>ſtiffeſt conceits</hi> that you ſhall be <hi>ſaved in an unconverted ſtate,</hi> or that you are <hi>ſanctified when you are not,</hi> that will do any more to keep you from damnation, then a conceit that you ſhall never die, will do to keep you here for ever. Gentlemen, though you are all here in health, and dignity, and honour to day, how little a while is it, alas how little, till you ſhall be every man in Heaven or hell! (unleſs you are Infidels you dare not deny it.) And it is only <hi>Chriſt and a holy life</hi> that is your <hi>way to Heaven,</hi> and only <hi>ſin, and the neglect of Chriſt and holineſs</hi> that can undo you. Look therefore upon ſin as you ſhould look on that which would caſt you into hell, and is daily undermining all your hopes. O that that this Honourable Aſſembly <hi>could know it</hi> in ſome meaſure, as it <hi>ſhall be ſhortly known?</hi> and judg of it as men do, when time is paſt, and deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vaniſhed, and all men are awakened from their fleſhly dreams, and their naked ſouls have <hi>ſeen</hi> the Lord? O then what <hi>Laws</hi> would you make againſt ſin? How ſpeedily would you joyn your ſtrength
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53082:19"/>
againſt it, as againſt the only enemy of our peace, and as againſt a fire in your houſes, or a plague that were broken out upon the City, where you are? O then how zealouſly would you all concurre to promote the intereſt of Holineſs in the Land, and ſtudiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the ſervants of the Lord! How ſeverely would you deal with thoſe, that by making a mock of Godlineſs, do hinder the ſalvation of the peoples ſouls? How carefully would you help the Labourers that are ſent to guid men in the holy path? and your ſelves would go before the Nation, as an example of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>ſelf-loathing</hi> for your ſins, and hearty converſion to the Lord. Is this your duty now, or is it not? If you cannot deny it, I warn you from the Lord, do not neglect it; and do not by your diſobedience to a <hi>convinced</hi> conſcience, prepare for a <hi>tormenting</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. If you know your Maſters will and do it not, you ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</p>
            <p>And your <hi>publike capacity and work,</hi> doth make <hi>your Repentance</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> needfull to <hi>others</hi> as well as to <hi>your ſelves.</hi> Had we none to govern us, but ſuch as entirely ſubject themſelves to the government of Chriſt; and none to make us Laws, but ſuch as have his Law tranſcribed upon their hearts, O what a happy people ſhould we be. Men are <hi>unlikely</hi> to make <hi>ſtrckt Laws,</hi> againſt the vices which they <hi>love</hi> and <hi>live</hi> in: or if they <hi>make</hi> them, they are more unlikely to <hi>execute</hi> them. We can expect no great help againſt drunkenneſs, ſwearing, gaming, filthineſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, from men that love theſe abominations ſo well, as that they will rather part with God and their ſalvation, then they will let them go. All
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53082:20"/>
men are born with a ſerpentine malice and emnity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſeed of Chriſt, which is rooted in their very natures. Cuſtome in ſin encreaſeth this to more malignity; and it is only renewing grace that doth overcome it. If therefore there ſhould be any among our Rulers, that are not cured of this mortall malady, what friendſhip can be expected from them to the cauſe and ſervants of the Lord? If you are all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God your ſelves, and Heaven be your end, and holineſs your delight and buſineſs, it will then be your principall care to encourage it, and help the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the happineſs that you have found your ſelves. But if in any the originall (increaſed) enmity to God and godlineſs prevail, we can expect no better (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) from ſuch, then that they oppoſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs which they hate, and do their worſt to make us miſerable. But woe to him that ſtriveth againſt his Maker. Shall the thorns and bryers be ſet in battail againſt the conſuming fire and prevail? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 4, 5.

We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you therefore for the ſake of a poor diſtreſſed Land, <hi>let our recovery begin with you.</hi> God looks
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53082:20"/>
ſo much at the <hi>Rulers</hi> of a Nation in his dealings with them, that ordinarily it goes with the people as their Rulers are. Till <hi>David</hi> had numbered the people, God would not let out his wrath upon them, though it was they that were the great offenders. If we ſee our Repreſentative body begin in <hi>loathing themſelves for all their iniquities,</hi> and turning to the Lord with all their hearts, we ſhould yet believe that he is returning to us, and will do us good after all our provocations, Truly Gentlemen, it is much <hi>from you</hi> that we muſt fetch our <hi>comfortable</hi> or <hi>ſad prognoſticks,</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> or <hi>death</hi> of this diſeaſed Land. Whatever you do, <hi>I know that it ſhall go well with the righteous;</hi> but for the happineſs or miſery of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in generall, it's <hi>you</hi> that are our beſt prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. If <hi>you repent your ſelves,</hi> and become a <hi>holy people to the Lord,</hi> it promiſeth <hi>us</hi> deliverance: But if you harden your hearts, and prove deſpiſers of God and holineſs, it's like to be <hi>our temporall,</hi> and ſure to be <hi>your eternall</hi> undoing, if ſaving grace do not prevent it.</p>
            <p>And I muſt needs tell you, that if you be not brought to <hi>loath</hi> your ſelves, it is not becauſe there is no <hi>loathſome</hi> matter in you. Did you ſee your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, you could not forbear it. As I think it would ſomewhat abate the pride of the moſt curious Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, if they did but ſee what a heap of flegme, and filth, and dung, (and perhaps crawling worms) there is within them. Much more ſhould it make you loath your ſelves, if you ſaw thoſe ſins that are a thouſand times more odious. And to inſtigate you hereunto, let me further reaſon with you.</p>

            <p>Having called you firſt to <hi>Remember your miſdoings,</hi> and ſecondly to <hi>loath your ſelves in your own eyes for them;</hi> I muſt add a third, That you ſtop not here, but proceed to <hi>Reformation,</hi> or elſe all the reſt is but hypocriſie.

But that in <hi>England God ſhould be ſo provoked,</hi> and <hi>ſouls ſo hindered</hi> from the pathes of life, that whoever will be converted and ſaved, muſt be made a laughing ſtock (which carnall mindes cannot endure,) this is the miſchief which we deprecate.</p>
            <p>The eyes of the Nation, and of the Chriſtian world, are much upon you, ſome high in hopes, ſome deep in fears, ſome waiting in dubious expectations for the iſſue of your counſels. Great expectations, in deep neceſſities, ſhould awake you to the greateſt care and diligence. Though I would not by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any neceſſary directions or admonitions to you, invite the world to think that I ſpeak to ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to hear, and that ſo Honourable an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly doth call the Miniſters of Chriſt to do thoſe works of their proper office, which yet they will be offended if they do; yet had I rather erre in the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi> part, then by <hi>exceſs,</hi> and therefore ſhall not preſume to be too particular. Only in generall, in the Name of Chriſt, and on the behalf of a trembling yet hoping Nation, I moſt earneſtly beſeech and warn you, that <hi>you own and promote the power and practiſe of Godlineſs in the Land,</hi> and that as God whoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> you are <hi>(Rom.</hi> 13. 4.) <hi>is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. and hath made this a principall Article of our Faith; ſo you would imitate your abſolute Lord, and <hi>honour them that fear the Lord,</hi> and encourage <hi>them that diligently</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53082:24"/>
               <hi>ſeek him.</hi> And may I not freely tell you, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould have the <hi>precedencie?</hi> and that you muſt <hi>firſt ſeek his Kingdom and the Righteouſneſs thereof,</hi> and he will facilitate all the reſt of your work. Surely no Powers on earth ſhould be offended, that the God from whom, and for whom, and through whom they have what they have, is preferred before them; when they ſhould own no intereſt but his, and what is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to it. I have long thought that pretences of a neceſſity of beginning with our own affairs, hath fruſtrated our hopes from many Parliaments alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and I am ſure that by delayes the enemies of our peace have got advantage to croſs our ends and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own. Our calamities <hi>begun</hi> in <hi>differences about Religion,</hi> and ſtill <hi>that's</hi> the wound that moſt needs cloſing: and if <hi>that were done, how eaſily</hi> (I dare confidently ſpeak it) <hi>would the generality of ſober godly people, be agreed in things civill, and become the ſtrength and glory of the Soveraign</hi> (under God?) And though with grief and ſhame we ſee this work ſo long undone (may we hope that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it to this ſeaſon.) Yet I have the confidence to profeſs, that <hi>(as the exalting of one party by the ejection and perſecuting of the rest, is the ſinfull way to your diſhonour and our ruine, ſo the termes on which the differing parties moſt conſiderable among us, may ſafely, eaſily and ſuddenly unite, are very obvious; and our concord a very eaſie thing, if the prudent and moderate might be the guides, and ſelfiſh intereſts and paſsion did not ſet us at a further diſtance then our principles have done.</hi> And to ſhew you the facility of ſuch an agreement, were it not that ſuch perſonall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53082:25"/>
matters are much liable to miſinterpretations, I ſhould tell you, that the late Reverend Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> conſented (in leſs than half an hoursdebate) to five or ſix Propoſitions which I offered him, as ſufficient for the Concord of the moderate Epiſcopall and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, without forſaking the Principles of their Parties. O that the Lord would yet ſhew ſo much mercy to a ſinfull Nation, as to put it into your hearts to <hi>promote but the practiſe of thoſe Chriſtian principles which we are all agreed in:</hi> I hope there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie among us <hi>whether God ſhould be obeyed</hi> and <hi>hell avoided,</hi> and <hi>Heaven firſt ſought,</hi> and <hi>Scripture be the rule and teſt of our Religion,</hi> and <hi>ſin abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and caſt out.</hi> O that you would but further the practiſe of <hi>this</hi> with all your might: We crave not of you any Lordſhip or dominion, nor riches, nor intereſt in your temporall affairs: we had rather ſee a Law to exclude all Eccleſiaſticks from all power of force: The God of Heaven that will judg you and us, will be a righteous Judg betwixt us, whether we crave any thing unreaſonable at your hands. Theſe are the ſumme of our requeſts: 1. That <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> may be encouraged, and the overſpreading pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs of this Nation effectually kept down. 2. That an <hi>able diligent Miniſtry</hi> may be encouraged, and not <hi>corrupted by temporall power.</hi> 3. That <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> may be <hi>ſeriouſly promoted,</hi> and Miniſters no more hindred by Magiſtrates in the exerciſe of <hi>their</hi> office, then Phyſicions and Schoolmaſters are in <hi>theirs;</hi> ſeeing it is but a <hi>Government like theirs,</hi> conſiſting in the liberty of conſcionable managing the works of our own office that we expect: Give us but leave to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53082:25"/>
labour in Chriſts Vineyard with ſuch encouragement as the neceſſity of obſtinate ſouls requireth, and we will ask no more. You have leſs cauſe to reſtrain us from <hi>diſcipline</hi> then from <hi>preaching:</hi> for it is a <hi>more fleſh-diſpleaſing</hi> work that we are <hi>hardlier</hi> brought to. I foretell you, that <hi>you ſhut out me and all that are of my minde,</hi> if you would force us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter <hi>Sacraments</hi> without <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and without the conduct of our own diſcretion, to whom the Magiſtrate appoints it; as if a Phyſicion muſt give no Phyſick but by <hi>your preſcript.</hi> The <hi>antidiſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian</hi> Magiſtrate I could as reſolutely ſuffer under as the <hi>ſuperſtitious;</hi> it being <hi>worſe</hi> to <hi>caſt out Diſcipline,</hi> then to <hi>erre</hi> in the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of it. The queſtion is not, <hi>whether Biſhops or no?</hi> but <hi>whether Diſcipline or none?</hi> and <hi>whether enow to uſe it?</hi> 4. We ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly requeſt that <hi>Scripture ſufficiency as the teſt of our Religion,</hi> and <hi>only univerſall Law of Chriſt</hi> may be maintained: and that <hi>nothing unneceſſary may be impoſed as neceſſary,</hi> nor the <hi>Churches unity</hi> laid on that which <hi>will not bear it, nor ever did.</hi> O that we might but have leave to ſerve God only as Chriſt hath commanded us, and to go to Heaven in the ſame way as the Apoſtles did! Theſe are our deſires; and whether they are reaſonable God will judg.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Give firſt to God the things that are Gods,</hi> and then <hi>give Caeſar the things that are Caeſars.</hi> Let your <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> be <hi>firſt pure,</hi> and <hi>then peaceable.</hi> Not but that we are reſolved to be loyall to Soveraignty, though you deny us all theſe: whatever malicious men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, <hi>that is not</hi> nor <hi>ſhall not</hi> be our difference. I have proved more publikely when it was more dangerous
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53082:26"/>
to publiſh it, that the <hi>generality</hi> of the Orthodox ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Miniſters, and godly people of this Nation, did never conſent to King-killing, and reſiſting Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power, nor to the change of the ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Land; but abhorred the pride and ambition that attempted it. I again repeat it: The blood of ſome, the impriſonment and diſplacing of others, the baniſhment or flight of others, and the deteſtations and publike proteſtations of more; the oft declared ſenſe of <hi>England,</hi> and the warres and ſad eſtate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> have all declared before the world, to the ſhame of calumniators, that the generallity of the orthodox ſober Proteſtants of theſe Nations, have been true to their allegiance, and deteſters of unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs and ambition in ſubjects, and reſiſters of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and ſchiſme in the Church, and of Anarchie and Democraticall confuſions in the Commonwealth. And though the Land hath ringed with complaints and threatnings againſt my ſelf, for publiſhing a <hi>little</hi> of the mixture of Jeſuiticall and Familiſticall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, for taking down together our Government and Religion, and ſetting up new ones for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Popery, infidelity and hereſie; yet I am aſſured that there is much more of this confederacie, for the all-ſeeing <hi>God</hi> to diſcover in time, to the ſhame of Papiſts, that cannot be content to write them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the killing of Kings when the Pope hath once excommunicated them, and by the Decrees of a Generall Councill at the Laterane, to depoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that will extirpate ſuch as the Pope calls Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and abſolve all their ſubjects from their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and allegiance, but they muſt alſo creep into the

Councils and Armies of Proteſtants, and taking the advantage of ſucceſſes and ambition, withdraw men at once from their Religion and allegiance, that they may cheat the world into a belief, that Treaſons are the fruits of the Proteſtant profeſſion, when theſe masked Juglers have come by night and ſown and cheriſhed theſe Romiſh tares. As a <hi>Papiſt</hi> muſt <hi>ceaſe</hi> to be <hi>a Papiſt</hi> if he will be <hi>truly and fully loyall</hi> to his Soveraign (as I am ready to prove againſt any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary;) ſo <hi>a Proteſtant</hi> muſt ſo farre <hi>ceaſe</hi> to be <hi>a Proteſtant</hi> before he can be diſloyall. For <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. is part of the Rule of his Religion. Unhappily there hath been a difference among us, <hi>which is the higher Power,</hi> when thoſe that have their ſhares in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty are divided: But whether we ſhould be ſubject to the Higher Power is no queſtion with us.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I have nothing to ask of you for my ſelf nor any of my brethren as for themſelves: But that you <hi>will be friends to ſerious preaching and holy living,</hi> and will not <hi>enſnare our conſciences with any unſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturall inventions of men,</hi> this I would beg of you as on my knees: 1. As <hi>for the ſake of Chriſt,</hi> whoſe cauſe and people it is that I am pleading for. 2. For <hi>the ſake of thouſands of poore ſouls</hi> in this Land, whoſe ſalvation or damnation will be much promoted by you. 3. For <hi>the ſake of thouſands of the dear ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord,</hi> whoſe eyes are waiting to ſee what God will do by your hands. 4. For <hi>your own ſakes,</hi> who are <hi>undone</hi> if you daſh your ſelves on the rock you ſhould build on, and ſet againſt the holy God, and turn the cries of his ſervants to Heaven for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from you, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 8. If you <hi>ſlumble</hi> on
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53082:27"/>
Chriſt he will <hi>break you in pieces;</hi> but if <hi>he fall upon you</hi> he will <hi>grind you to powder.</hi> 5. For <hi>the ſake of your poſterity,</hi> that they may not be bred up in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ungodlineſs. 6. For <hi>the Honour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and your ſelves;</hi> that you turn by all the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions and fears that are raiſed in the Land. 7. For <hi>the honour of ſound Doctrine and Church Government,</hi> that you may not bring <hi>ſchiſme</hi> into <hi>greater credit</hi> then now you have brought it to <hi>deſerved ſhame.</hi> For if you <hi>frown on godlineſs</hi> under pretence of <hi>uniformity in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary things,</hi> and make times worſe then when Libertiniſme and ſchiſme ſo prevailed, the people will look back with groans and ſay, <hi>what happy times did we once ſee?</hi> and ſo will <hi>honour ſchiſme, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſme, and uſurpation,</hi> through <hi>your oppreſſion.</hi> 8. Laſtly, I beg this of you, for <hi>the Honour of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragnty and the Nations Peace.</hi> A Prince of a holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is moſt Honourable. The intereſt of holineſs is Chriſts own: Happy is that Prince that eſpouſeth this, and ſubjecteth all his own unto it. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 1, 2. &amp; 101. &amp; 15. 4. It is the conſcionable, prudent, godly people of the Land that muſt be the glory and ſtrength of their lawfull Soveraign. <hi>Their Prayers</hi> will ſerve him better then the <hi>hideous Oaths and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of the prophane. Woe to the Rulers that ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the intereſt of Chriſt and holineſs. Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. or that <hi>make ſnares</hi> for their conſciences, that they may perſecute them as <hi>diſobedients,</hi> who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to obey their Rulers in ſubordination to the Lord. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. &amp; 6. 5, 10, 13. I have dealt plainly with you, and told you the very truth. If God have now a bleſſing for you and us, you will obey it: but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53082:27"/>
if you refuſe, then look to your ſelves and anſwer it if you can. I am ſure in ſpite of earth and hell, it ſhall go well with them that live by faith.</p>
