         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <note place="margin">His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage.</note> surnamed the <hi>Great</hi>
was the Son of <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
and of his Queen <hi>Olympias.</hi>
He was born on the sixth day of our
<hi>June,</hi> called by the <hi>Macedonians,
Lous.</hi> Upon the very same day
that the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
was burned down; whereupon
the Priests, Magicians, and South-sayers ran about the
City, crying, that some great Plague and mischief to
<hi>Asia</hi> was surely born that day. Three messengers came
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56424:4"/>
to King <hi>Philip,</hi> presently after he had won the City of
<hi>Potidaea,</hi> upon the same day, who brought him great
Newes, the first, that <hi>Parmenio</hi> his Generall, had won
a notable Battel of the <hi>Illyrians:</hi> the second that his
Horse had won the prize at the <hi>Olympian</hi> Games: and
the third, that his wife <hi>Olympias</hi> had brought him a
Son,<note place="margin">His Birth.</note> that was named <hi>Alexander,</hi> born at <hi>Pella</hi> in
<hi>Macedonia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> being marvellous glad to hear these newses, the
Southsayers much added to his joy; assuring him, that
his Son that was thus born, should be invincible. He
had naturally a very fair white colour, mingled with red,
which chiefly appeared in his face and breast: His skin
had a marvellous sweet savour, and his breath was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sweet, which shewed his excellent constitution. He
was naturally hot and Cholerick, which made him to be
addicted to drink, and hasty, and yet was chast withall.
His Father was very carefull of his Education, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gat for him excellent Tutors, as <hi>Leonidas,</hi> which had
the chiefest Government of him. Then <hi>Lysimachus,</hi>
an <hi>Acarnanian:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the Best <hi>Philosopher</hi>
of his time, to whom <hi>Philip</hi> allowed a very Honourable
stipend.</p>
                  <p>He delighted much in hunting divers kinds of wilde
Beasts, and playing at the Staff. On a time while he
was young, Ambassadors were sent to his Father from
the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and it fell out that <hi>Philip</hi> was in
some journey out of his Kingdom. <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore
intertained them familiarly, not using any childish que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
to them, nor enquiring about trifling, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall
matters, but what distance it was from one place
to another, and which way they went into the higher
places of <hi>Asia;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His early wisdom.</note> Also about the King of <hi>Persia</hi> himself,
how he behaved himself towards his enemies, and what
power he had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> insomuch as they were ravished with
delight to hear him, judging him to be of great Courage,
and of a Noble minde, and one that was like to attempt
great enterprises. When at any time news was brought
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56424:4"/>
him that his Father had taken some famous City, or had
won some great Battel, he was no whit glad to hear it, but
would say to his play-fellows: Sirs, <hi>My Father will do all,
I shall have nothing left me to Conquer with you that will be
ought worth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon a time <hi>Philonicus,</hi>

                     </note> a <hi>Thessalian</hi> brought a brave
Horse, called <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> to sell unto King <hi>Philip,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
thirteen Talents for him, and they went into
the Field to try him: But the Horse was found to be so
unruly, and churlish, that they which should have rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
him, said, that he would never be made service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
For he would let no man get upon his Back, nor
abide any of the Gentlemens voices that were about <hi>Philip,</hi>
but would yerk at them with his heels; whereupon <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
being afraid, bad them take him away as a wilde,
untamable, and unprofitable Beast: which they had
done accordingly, had not <hi>Alexander,</hi> that stood by, said,
<hi>O Gods! what a Horse do they turn away for lack of skill, and
courage to handle and break him? Philip</hi> heard what he
said, but held his peace. <hi>Alexander</hi> often repeating those
words, and seeming sorry that the Horse should be
sent back, <hi>Philip</hi> said, Why doest thou controll them
that have more skill and experience than thy self; and
that know better how to handle a Horse than thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
<hi>Alexander</hi> answered, <hi>and yet me-thinks I could handle
him better than all they have done.</hi> But if thou canst do no
more than they (replied <hi>Philip)</hi> what wilt thou forfeit for
thy folly? <hi>I am content</hi> (said <hi>Alexander) to forfeit the price
of the Horse.</hi> Every one laughed to hear his answer, and
the match was made between the Father and the Son.
Then ran <hi>Alexander</hi> to the Horse, and took him by the
Bridle, and turned him towards the Sun. It seems he
had observed how mad the Horse was to see his own
shadow, which was before, always before his eyes as he
stirred too and fro. Then <hi>Alexander</hi> speaking gently to
the Horse, and clapping him on the back with his hand,
till he had left his fury and s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Cloke from him, and lightly leaped on his back, and so
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56424:5"/>
gat up without any danger, and holding the reins of the
Bridle hard, without striking or stirring the Horse, made
him to be gentle enough. And when he perceived that
the fury of the Horse was calmed, he put him forward,
and began to Gallop; Then he put him to his full carrier,
spurring, and switching him. <hi>Philip</hi> at first, seeing his
sons confidence, began to fear lest he should catch any hurt:
But when he saw him readily to turn the Horse at the end
of his carrier, and shewing bravery for what he had done,
all the Spectators gave a great shoot for joy: and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fell a weeping for joy: and when <hi>Alexander</hi> was
allighted from the Horse, his Father went and kissed
him, saying, <hi>O Son! thou must have a Kingdom that is meet
for thee; for</hi> Macedonia <hi>is not sufficient for thee:</hi> Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also that he was not to be rigorously dealt with, and
that by gentle means and perswasions he could make him
do what he would, he ever sought rather to perswade
than to Command him what he would have done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> in these his younger days was very mild,<note place="margin">His mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> and
of a patient disposition, insomuch as being told that some

                  <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> being dead,<note place="margin">He comes to his Kingdom.</note> his son <hi>Alexander</hi> succeeded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Prince no less Valiant by Nature than by Education,
being well instructed, &amp; inriched with all sorts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He began his Reign in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> four hundred and
seventeen years after <hi>Rome</hi> was built, being himself about
twenty years old.</p>
                  <p>Upon this change of the King the neighbour Nations,
whom <hi>Philip</hi> had oppressed, adventured to endeavour the
recovery of their former liberty by force of Arms, the
young years of <hi>Alexander</hi> giving some hope of prevailing,
&amp; his suspected severity encreasing the courage of others,
who could easilier resolve to die, than to live in slavery:
But <hi>Alexander</hi> gave no respite to these discontented hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;<note place="margin">He slays his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</note>
For after revenge taken upon the Conspiratours
against his Father, whom he slew upon his Tomb, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56424:5"/>
the celebration of his Funerals, he first engaged his
<hi>Macedonians</hi> to him by freeing them from all exactions,
and bodily slavery, other than his service in the Wars,
and to others that contemned his youth, he used such an
sterity, and such clemency to the rest; that having
calmed these neerer discontents, he presently went into
<hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and so insinuated himself amongst them,
that by the Council of the States of <hi>Greece,</hi> he was chosen
<hi>Captain Generall</hi> to mannage the War against the <hi>Persians,</hi>
as his Father had been before him, who was so intent
upon that War, that he had sent over into <hi>Asia</hi> part of
his Army under the Conduct of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and <hi>Attalus,</hi>
with order to take in some place which might secure the
descent of the rest.</p>
                  <p>Upon this enterprise against the <hi>Persians</hi> was <hi>Alexander</hi>
wholly busied,<note place="margin">He in-tends war against <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </note> his restless thoughts both sleeping and
waking, presenting to him the Riches, Honour, and
large Dominions which he hoped to attain thereby. Yet
was he again crossed, and retarded by the <hi>Athenians,
Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who had united themselves
against him, hoping by the assistance of the <hi>Persians,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their former liberty; and they were to this, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by <hi>Demosthennes,</hi> whom the <hi>Persian</hi> Gold had
bribed thereunto. This unexpected rub, and loss of time
was very grievous to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was troubled that
he should turn his Sword from the base and effeminate
<hi>Persians,</hi> against the manly, and famous <hi>Grecians,</hi> of whose
assistance in his intended Wars he had assured himself;
He therefore made such expedition against them,<note place="margin">He sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
                     </note> that
himself, with his Army at his heels, brought them the first
news of his preparations. This celerity of his made them
begin to stagger, and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as they were the first
that moved, so were they the first that fainted, and by
their Ambassadours sought to pacifie him. <hi>Alexander</hi>
was not long in resolving, but admitted their excuses, and
made peace.</p>
                  <p>Having now quieted his Borderers on the South, he
resolved also to assure himself of those Nations which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56424:6"/>
lay on the North of <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And other Nations.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Thracians, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balles,
Poones, Getes, Agrians,</hi> and others, who by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
incursions had much molested his Father; and
withall those, after he had given them divers overthrows,
he made peace, or brought them into his Subjection: and
yet could he not find the way out of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Thebans,</hi> which had one thousand <hi>Macedonians</hi>
in Garrison in their Citadel, being impatient of slavery,
endeavoured to force it; which <hi>Alexander</hi> being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, hastened to their succour with thirty thousand Foot,
all old Souldiers, and three thousand Horse, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself before their City, he gave the <hi>Thebans</hi> time
to resolve whether they would have peace or War, only
demanding that they should deliver up to him the two
chief Incendiaries, <hi>Phaenix,</hi> and <hi>Prothytes,</hi> which they took
in such scorn, that they demand <hi>Philotas,</hi> and <hi>Antipater,</hi>
two of his chief Captains.<note place="margin">And the <hi>Thebans.</hi>
                     </note> This so incensed <hi>Alexander,</hi>
that whilst he assailed the City before, the <hi>Macedonian</hi>
Garrison did the like behind, and so breaking into the
City, he slew ninty thousand of them, and sold thirty
thousand more for slaves, and this he did for a terrour
to the other <hi>Grecians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many Arguments were used by <hi>Cleadas</hi> (one of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners)
to disswade him from destroying the City, of <hi>Thebes</hi>
but all proved fruitless; for he razed the City, only out of
his respect to learning, he pardoned all of the race of <hi>Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
the Poet, and set at liberty <hi>Timoclea,</hi> the sister of
<hi>Theagines,</hi> who died in the defence of the liberty of <hi>Greece</hi>
against his Father <hi>Philip.</hi> This Noble Woman, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by a <hi>Thracian,</hi> and ravished, he threatned to kill her
unless she would discover her Treasure to him: She led
him to a Well,<note place="margin">A brave Example.</note> and told him that she had cast it therein,
and when he stooped to look into the well, she thrust him
in, and stoned him to Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> shortly after at a Common Council of <hi>Greece,</hi>
being chosen General a second time against the <hi>Persians,</hi>
went to visit <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Philosopher, there. Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where, in a Town called <hi>Dios,</hi> as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56424:6"/>
he was wholly taken up with thoughts of subduing <hi>Asia,</hi>
there appeared to him in his Sleep the resemblance of the
High Priest of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His vision.</note> who bad him be couragious and
bold, and speedily with his Army to put over into <hi>Asia,</hi>
promising that he would be his Conducter in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, as <hi>Alexander</hi> himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
                  <p>All being now quieted at home,<note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> leaving the
Government of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Antipater,</hi> in the
beginning of the Spring he passed the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> and being
ready to dis-imbark, he threw a Dart towards the <hi>Asian</hi>
shore, as a token of defiance, commanding his Souldiers
not to wast, and destroy the Country, or to burn those
buildings which themselves were presently, and in future
to possess. Then landed he his Army consisting of
thirty two thousand foot, and five thousand Horse, all
old Souldiers, neer unto <hi>Troy,</hi> where he offered a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
upon the Tomb of <hi>Achilles,</hi> his Maternall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestor.</p>
                  <p>But before he left his own Country,<note place="margin">His cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> he put to death,
without any offence given him, all his Mother in Laws
Kinsmen, whom his Father had greatly advanced, not
sparing such of his own as he suspected, thinking by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
cruelty to secure himself for the present, and future:
Yet the end fell out contrary to the Policy which his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
taught him,<note place="margin">Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> though well agreeing with the Justice
of God: For within a few years all that he had planted was
rooted up; those whom he most trusted were most Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous:
His Mother, Friends and Children fell by such
another merciless Sword as his own, and all manner
of confusion followed his dead Body to the Grave, and
left him there.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Darius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> his Pride.</note> the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> was informed that
<hi>Alexander</hi> was landed in <hi>Asia,</hi> he so much scorned the
<hi>Macedonian</hi> Army, and contemned <hi>Alexander</hi> himself,
that writing to him, he stiled him his Servant, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
him for his presumption, and disloyalty (For
<hi>Darius</hi> Intitled himself <hi>King of Kings, and kinsman of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56424:7"/>
Gods)</hi> and withall, he wrote to his Leiutenants in the
Lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> that they should take <hi>Alexander</hi> alive, whip
him with Rods, and then convey him to his presence;
that they should sink his Ships, and send his <hi>Macedonians</hi>
prisoners beyond the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding these brags <hi>Alexander</hi> soon discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what manner of men the <hi>Persians</hi> were: For two of
<hi>Darius</hi> his Generals <hi>[Spithredates,</hi> and <hi>Rhaesaces]</hi> at the
River of <hi>Granick</hi> (which severs the Territories of <hi>Troy</hi>
from <hi>Propontis)</hi> with a huge Army both of Horse and
Foot, sought to stop his passage, taking the higher
ground, and the bank of the River to defend, which <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
was forced to climb up unto from out of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,<note place="margin">His victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick.</hi>
                     </note>
yet was his victory so easily, that the <hi>Persians</hi> flying,
he slew twenty thousand of the Foot, and two thousand
five hundred Horsemen, with the loss of twelve of his
own Foot, and two and twenty of his Horsemen, which
shews that the <hi>Persians</hi> were rather killed in their
backs whilst they ran away, than hurt in their bosoms by
resisting.</p>
                  <p>It was wisely done of <hi>Alexander</hi> to pass this River of
<hi>Granick</hi> in the face of the enemy, without seeking any
other place, or means to convey his men over. For
having beaten the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> upon their own ground, he
did thereby cut off no less of their reputation, than of their
strength, leaving the partakers of such cowards without
hope of Succour.</p>
                  <p>Presently after this victory,<note place="margin">He wins many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Countries</note> he recovered <hi>Sardis, Ephesus,</hi>
and the City of the <hi>Trallians,</hi> and <hi>Magnesia,</hi> all which
were soon rendred to him, the Inhabitants he received
with great grace, suffering them to be Governed by their

<hi>Miletus,</hi> and by force took in <hi>Halicarnassens,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it resisted obstinately, he razed it to the ground.
From thence he went into <hi>Caria,</hi> were <hi>Ada,</hi> the Queen,
who had been cast out of all that she held (except the
City of <hi>Alinda)</hi> by <hi>Darius</hi> his Leiutenants,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Caria</hi> Adopts him.</note> presented her
self to him, and adopted him for her Son, and Successour,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56424:7"/>
which <hi>Alexander</hi> took so kindly that he left the whole
Kingdom to her disposall. Then entred he into <hi>Lycia,</hi> and
<hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and assured to him all the Sea-Coasts, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
to him <hi>Pisidia,</hi> he steared his course towards <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
who (as he was informed) was marching towards him
with a marvellous great Army) by the way of <hi>Phrygia,</hi>
and this he might the easilier do, for that his first victory
had laid under his feet all the Provinces of <hi>Asia</hi> the less,
which bordered upon the Sea-coast.</p>
                  <p>Then gave he order for the se<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

North, he entred <hi>Celenas,</hi> seated on the River <hi>Maeander,</hi>
which was abandoned to him, only the Castle held out,
which yet after forty days, was surrendred to him also:
for so long time he gave them to attend succout from
<hi>Darius.</hi> From <hi>Celenas,</hi> he passed on thorow <hi>Phrygia</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Euxine Sea,</hi> till he came to the City of <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
sometimes the Regal City of King <hi>Midas,</hi> where
he found the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot,<note place="margin">He Cuts the <hi>Gordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> knot.</note> which when he knew

For there was an old Prophesie which promised him that

not respecting the manner so it were done, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to himself the fulfilling of the Prophesie by hewing
it in pieces.</p>
                  <p>Now before he left this part of <hi>Asia</hi> to go to the East,
he took care to clear the Sea-coast on his back, and to
thrust the <hi>Persians</hi> out of the Islands of <hi>Lesbos,</hi>

                     <hi>Chio,</hi> and
<hi>Coos,</hi> the charge whereof he committed to two of his
Captains, giving them such directions as he judged most
meet for that service, and delivering to them fifty Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
for defraying the charges thereof: and withall,
out of the spoil gotten by his first victory, he sent sixty
Talents more to <hi>Antipater,</hi> whom he had left for the
Government of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> From <hi>Celenas</hi> he
went to <hi>Ancira,</hi> standing on the same River of <hi>Sanguarius,</hi>
which runs through <hi>Gordium:</hi> there he mustered his
Army, and so entred into <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> whose Inhabitants
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56424:8"/>
submitted themselves to him, and thereby obtained free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from Tribute. There he left <hi>Catus</hi> Governour,
with one Regiment of <hi>Macedonians</hi> newly come to
him.</p>
                  <p>Here he heard of the Death of <hi>Memnon,</hi>

                        <hi>Memnon</hi> dies.</note> 
                     <hi>Darius</hi>'s Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which much encouraged him to pass on towards
him: For of this one Commander he had more respect
than of all the multitude assembled by <hi>Darius,</hi> and of all
the Captains he had besides. Then did he travell hastily
towards <hi>Cilicia,</hi> with a desire to recover the Streights
thereof before <hi>Darius</hi> should arrive there. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Cilicia</hi> hearing of <hi>Alexanders</hi> hasty march, left
some Companies to keep the Streights, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
very defensible, and now (though too late) began
to prize,<note place="margin">Good Counsel neglected.</note> and put in Execution the advise of <hi>Memnon,</hi>
who in the beginning of the Wars, had counselled to
wast all the provisions both for Man, and Horse that
could not be conveyed into strong holds, and always
to give ground to the Invader, till he found some such
notable advantage as might secure to him the victory.
<hi>For the fury of an invading army is best broken by delays, change

And had <hi>Darius</hi> kept the <hi>Macedonians</hi> but a while without

wearied them with his light Horsemen (as the <hi>Parthians</hi>
afterwards did the <hi>Romans)</hi> in all probability he might
have saved both his life, and Estate. For it was one
of the greatest encouragements given by <hi>Alexander</hi> to

cannot see what is for their good, or that know not how to put in
execution any sound advice;</hi> the course which <hi>Memnon</hi> had
propounded, must in all liklyhood have brought the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> into great straits, and stopt them at those nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56424:8"/>
passages of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> For had <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and <hi>Paphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia</hi>
been wasted when <hi>Alexander</hi> was far off, and the
Streights of <hi>Cilicia</hi> been defended by <hi>Arsenes</hi> with his
best Souldiers, hunger would not have suffered the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to stay the triall of all means for the forcing of that
passage: Or if the place could not have been defended,
yet might <hi>Cilieia</hi> at leasure have been throughly spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the heart of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Army should have
been broken, whilst they sought out miseries by painfull
travell.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Arsenes</hi> leaving a small number to defend the
Streights, took the best of his Army with him to wast
and spoil the Country; or rather, as it seemed, to make
himself some work, under which pretence he might
with honesty run the further from <hi>Alexander;</hi> And in
truth he so handled the matter, that he gave cause to the
<hi>Cicilians</hi> to wish for <hi>Alexanders</hi> coming, and as great
cause to the Keepers of the Passage not to hinder it. For
<hi>cowards are wise in apprehending all forms of danger.</hi> These
Guardians of the Streights, hearing that <hi>Arsenes</hi> hasted to
joyn himself with <hi>Darius,</hi> burning down all as he went,
as one despairing to defend it, began to think, that sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their Generall (who gave for lost the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
their backs) had exposed themselves to certain
ruine, as men that were fit only to dull the swords of the
<hi>Macedonians;</hi> Wherefore, not being ambitious to die
for their Prince and Country (which honour they saw
that <hi>Arsenes</hi> himself could well forbear) they presently
followed the footsteps of their General, gleaning what he
had left. And thus <hi>Alexander</hi> without hazard, got, both
the entrance into <hi>Cilicia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Streights of <hi>Cilicia</hi> taken.</note> abandoned by the cowardliness
of his enemies, and also that whole Province whose minds
were now alienated from the <hi>Persians</hi> through the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
carriage of <hi>Arsenes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> with great speed was come to <hi>Tarsus,</hi>
taking pleasure in the River <hi>Cydnus,</hi> which ran through
the City, all hot as he was, he threw off his Armour,
and leaped into the cold water, whereupon he grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56424:9"/>
so benumbd in all the Nerves of his Body, that
he lost the use of his Tongue; and so far was he from
hope of recovery, that nothing was expected but
present Death: But one <hi>Philip</hi> a Physician, gave him a
Potion, which he took, and it cured him out of hand,
though <hi>Parmenio</hi> had forewarned him, that this <hi>Philip</hi>
was set on work to poison him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Darius</hi> approached,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> his Army.</note> having gathered
together an Army of two hundred and ninty thousand
men out of divers Nations (saith <hi>Q. Curtius)</hi> or of three
hundred thousand Foot, and one hundred thousand
Horse, (as <hi>Justine</hi> numbers them) Or of six hundred
thousand, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates.</p>
                  <p>The manner of his comming was rather like a Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his march.</note>
than a man of War; and like one that took more
care to shew his Glory and Riches, than to provide for
his own safety. For before his Army there was carried
the holy Fire, which the <hi>Persians</hi> worshipped for their
God; attended by their Priests, and after them three
hundred sixty and five young men, answering to the
days of the year, clothed in Skarlet. Then the Chariot of
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> drawn with white Horses, with their Riders clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in white, and carrying Rods of Gold in their hands.
Next after them came the Horse of the Sun, and after
him ten sumptuous Chariots Inlay'd and garnished with
God &amp; Silver:<note place="margin">His Pride and Folly.</note> and then the Vaunt Guard of their Horse,
compounded of twelve severall Nations, which, the
better to avoid confusion, did hardly understand one
anothers Language, and these, marshalled in the head of
the rest, being beaten, might serve very fitly to disorder
all that followed them. In the tail of these, marched
the Regiment of foot stiled by the <hi>Persians, Immortall,</hi>
because if any died, their place was presently supplied by
others; and these were armed with chains of Gold, and
their coats embroidered w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the same, having their sleeves
garnished with Pearl: Baits fit either to entice the poor
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> or to perswade them that it were great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civillity
to cut or deface such goodly Garments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56424:9"/>
Then marched after them fifteen thousand, more rich
and glittering than the former, but apparelled like Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and these were honoured with the title of the
<hi>Kings Kinsmen.</hi> Then came <hi>Darius</hi> himself with the
Gentlemen of his Guard-robe, riding before his Chariot,
which was supported by the Gods of his Nation, cast and
cut in pure Gold: the head of this Chariot was set with
precious Stones, with two Golden Idols, covered with an
open winged Eagle of the same mettal. The hinder part
being raised high, whereon <hi>Darius</hi> sat, had a covering of
inestimable valew.</p>
                  <p>This Chariot of the Kings was followed with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horsmen, having lances plated with Silver, and their
heads guilt. He had for the proper Guard of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
two hundred of the blood Royal: blood too Royal,
and precious to be spilt in any Noble adventure, &amp; these
were backed with thirty thousand Footmen, after whom
again were led four hundred spare Horses for the Kings
own use. Then followed the Rereward, being led by
<hi>Sisygambis,</hi> the Kings Mother, and by his Wife, drawn
in glorious, and glittering Chariots, followed by a great
train of Ladies on Horseback, with fifteen rich Wagons
of the Kings children, and the Wives of the Nobility,
waited upon by two hundred and fifty Concubines, and a
World of Nurses, and Eunuches most sumptuously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled:
Between these, and a Company of slight
Armed Slaves, was the Kings Treasure, loaden on six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Mules and three hundred Camels.</p>
                  <p>In this sort came this May-game King into the field,
encombred with a most unnecessary train of Sumpters,
attended with Troops of divers Nations, speaking divers
Languages, impossible to be well Marshalled by reason
of their numbers, and for the most part so effeminate,
and so rich in Gold and costly Garments, as the same
could not but have encouraged the Nakedst Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> met with these effeminate <hi>Asiaticks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Alexander <hi>beats</hi> Darius.</note>
it may easily be guessed what a cheap Victory he had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56424:10"/>
over them. Some say that he slew in this Battel sixty
thousand Footmen, and ten thousand Horsmen. <hi>Q. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
saith, an hundred thousand Foot, with as many
Horsemen, and took forty thousand Prisoners, whilest of
<hi>Alexanders</hi> Army there miscarried but two hundred and
eighty of all sorts, of which number some Historians
cut off almost one half. He took Prisoners also <hi>Darius</hi>
his Mother, Wife, Daughters, and other the Kings Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<hi>Darius</hi> by this time found it true, that <hi>Charidemus,</hi>
a banished <hi>Grecian</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> had told him when he made
a view of his Army about <hi>Babylon,</hi> to wit, That the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
which he had assembled of divers Nations, richly
attired but poorly Armed, would be found more terrible
to the Countries through which they should pass, than to
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> whom they ment to assail, who being
all old, and Well-disciplined Souldiers, imbattelled in
gross Squadrons, which they called their <hi>Phalanx,</hi> well
covered with Armour for defence, and furnished with
advantagious Weapons for offence, would make so
little account of his delicate <hi>Persians,</hi> ill Armed, and
worse Disciplin'd, that except he would (having such
abundance of Treasure) entertain a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the same <hi>Grecians,</hi> and so encounter the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi>
with men of equall courage, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
overlate, as taught by the miserable success like to
follow.</p>
                  <p>But so unpleasing was this discourse to <hi>Darius,</hi> (who
used to hear nothing but his own praises) that he caused
this poor <hi>Grecian</hi> to be presently slain,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> his cruelty,</note> who whilst he
was under the Tormentors hand, said, to the King, that
<hi>Alexander,</hi> against whom he had given this good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
should certainly revenge his Death, and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
punish <hi>Darius</hi> for refusing this advise.<note place="margin">and Folly.</note> 
                     <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
likewise slighted the counsell given him by the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Souldiers that served under him, who intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him not to fight in those streight places where
<hi>Alexander</hi> could bring as many hands to fight as <hi>Darius</hi>
could: and these old blades, when <hi>Darius</hi> was overthrown
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56424:10"/>
with all his cowardly, and confused Rabble, under their
Captain <hi>Amyntas,</hi> held firm, and made a brave retreat in
despite of the vanquishers.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Grecians</hi> also after their retreat, advised <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
to draw back his Army into the plains of <hi>Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
where he might have environed the <hi>Macedonians</hi> on
all sides with his multitudes; they counselled him also
to divide his huge Army into parts, and not to cast his
Empire upon one Battel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this advise was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the cowardly spirits of the <hi>Persians,</hi> that they
perswaded <hi>Darius</hi> to environ these <hi>Greeks</hi> with his Army,
and to cut them in pieces as Traitors. But <hi>Darius</hi> was so
infatuated that he would needs fight with <hi>Alexander</hi> in such
a streight place, neer unto the City of <hi>Issus,</hi> where he
could bring no more hands to fight than <hi>Alexander</hi> could
(who by the advice of <hi>Parmeni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> staid there as in a place
of advantage) whereby he was utterly overthrown, his
Treasure lost, his Wife, Mother, and Children (whom
the <hi>Grecians</hi> had perswaded him to leave in <hi>Babylon)</hi> taken
prisoners, and all their train of Ladies spoiled of their rich
Garments, Jewels, and Honour. Indeed the Queen, with
her Daughters, who had the good hap to be brought to
<hi>Alexanders</hi> presence, were intertained with all respect
due unto them, their Honours preserved, and their Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and rich Garments restored; and though the Queen

towards them all: Only he embraced the Wife of the
Valiant <hi>Memnon,</hi> who was lately dead, she being taken by
<hi>Parmenio,</hi> as she fled from <hi>Damascus,</hi> at which time the
Daughters of <hi>Ochus,</hi> who reigned before <hi>Darius,</hi> and the
Wives and Children of almost all the Nobility of <hi>Persia,</hi>
fell into Captivity, together with the Treasure of <hi>Darius</hi>
(not taken at <hi>Issus)</hi> was seized upon, amounting to six
thousand and two hundred Talents in ready Coin, and in
Bullion, five hundred Talents, with a world of Riches
besides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parmenio</hi> also in his Letter to <hi>Alexander</hi> sent him
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56424:11"/>
word, that amongst other things, he had taken at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus</hi>
three hundred twenty nine of the Kings Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which were Skilfull in Musick; forty six Weavers,

                  <p>After this overthrow given to <hi>Darius,</hi> all <hi>Phoenicia</hi>
(the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> excepted) yielded unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> who

<hi>Biblos,</hi> which were Maritine Cities of great importance,
of which one <hi>Strato</hi> was King (but hated of his People)

in <hi>Asia</hi> the Less, overthrew the <hi>Cappadocians, Paphla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians,</hi>
and others lately revolted. <hi>Aristodemus</hi> also,
who was <hi>Darius</hi> his Admiral, had his Fleet partly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and partly drowned by the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Likewise
the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who rose up against <hi>Antipater,</hi> were
beaten: and four thousand of those <hi>Greeks,</hi> that made so
brave a retreat at the last Battel, being led by <hi>Amyntas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Egypt,</hi> intending to hold it for themselves, were

                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> to honour his beloved <hi>Ephestion,</hi> gave him
power to dispose of the Kingdom of <hi>Zidon,</hi> and <hi>Ephestion,</hi>
to shew his gratitude, offered to bestow it upon his Host
with whom he quartered;<note place="margin">A notable Example.</note> But the Man, not being of the
Kingly Race, refused it, saying, <hi>It is not our Country-fashion,
that any should be King, but such as are of the
Kingly Line. And such an one</hi> (saith he) <hi>lives hard by,
a good, and a wise man, but very poor, and one that lives by
his hard labour.</hi> Then did <hi>Ephestion</hi> (taking Kingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56424:11"/>
along with him) go to this poor Man, and salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him King, bidding him, wash off his dirt, and put off
his rags, and put on that Royall Apparel; The poor
Mans name was <hi>Abdolominus,</hi> who thought he had been
in a dream, but being by the standers by, washed, and
adorned, <hi>Ephestion</hi> led him into the Pallace, saying,
<hi>When thou sittest on thy Throne, and hast power over the lives
of all thy Subjects, forget not thy former condition. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
hearing of it, sent for him, and asked him, with
what patience, he, being of so Noble an Extraction,
could bear his former poverty? To whom <hi>Abdolominus</hi>
answered; <hi>I pray God that I may bear the Kingdom with the
same mind.</hi> For (said he) <hi>these hands have provided for
my necessities, and as I had nothing, so I wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While <hi>Alexander</hi> staid in those parts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires peace, which <hi>Alexander</hi> rejected.</note> he received
a Letter from <hi>Darius,</hi> wherein he desired to ransom
his Wife, Mother, and Children, with some other
conditions of peace, but such as rather became a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
than one who had been so shamefully beaten,
not vouchsafeing in the Endorsment to give <hi>Alexander</hi>
the title of King. <hi>Alexander</hi> disdained his offers, and sent
him word, that he was not only a King, but the King of
<hi>Darius</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> came neer the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from them the present of a Golden Crown, and
great store of Victuals, with some other things, which
he took very thankfully, sending them word, that he
desired to offer a Sacrifice to <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Protector of
their City, from whom he was descended. The <hi>Tyrians,</hi>
not liking his presence within their walls, returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> was seated where
the old City stood;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tyre</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,</note> but <hi>Alexander</hi> was resolved to enter
<hi>Tyre</hi> by force, though in most mens Judgements the City
was impregnable; for the Island whereon it was built,
was eight hundred furlongs from the land, yet with the
labor of many hands, having great store of stone from old
<hi>Tyre,</hi> and Timber sufficient from <hi>Libanus,</hi> he stopped up
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56424:12"/>
the passage between the Island and the Main, being more
than once carried away by Storms, and sometimes fired
by the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> yet with the help of his Navy, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all difficulties,<note place="margin">and taken.</note> and prevailed, having spent seven
moneths in that attempt. The <hi>Tyrians</hi> in the beginning
of the Siege, hard barbarously drowned some messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
sent by <hi>Alexander</hi> to perswade them to yield, in
respect whereof, and of his great loss of time and men,
he put eight thousand to the sword, and caused two
thousand of those that had escaped the first fury,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> rigor.</note> to be
hanged on Crosses upon the Sea-shore, and reserved for
slaves thirteen thousand, some say thirty thousand, and
many more of them had died, if the <hi>Zidonians,</hi> that
served <hi>Alexander,</hi> had not conveyed great numbers of
them by shipping to their own City. <hi>Alexander</hi> gave the
Government of this Territory to <hi>Philotas,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Parmenio. Ephestion</hi> had the charge of the Fleet, and
was commanded to meet <hi>Alexander</hi> at <hi>Gaza</hi> in the way
to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilst <hi>Alexander</hi> lay at the Siege of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> he sent
to <hi>Jaddus,</hi> the High Priest at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> demanding of
him supplies, and provisions for his Army; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
such Tribute as they formerly paid to <hi>Darius:</hi> But
when <hi>Jaddus</hi> answered, that he was tyed by a former
Oath of Allegiance to <hi>Darius,</hi> from which he could
not be free so long as <hi>Darius</hi> lived: <hi>Alexander</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wroth at this answer, swore, that as soon as he
had taken <hi>Tyrus,</hi> he would march against <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the same time also came <hi>Sanballat,</hi> the <hi>Cuthaean</hi> to
<hi>Alexander;</hi> who, having forsaken <hi>Darius,</hi> brought
with him eight thousand men: Him did <hi>Alexander</hi>
receive very graciously; Whereupon he asked leave
of him to build a Temple upon his own Land, and
to make High Priest thereof, his Son in Law, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses,</hi>
who was Brother to <hi>Jaddus,</hi> the High Priest
at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and having obtained leave, because he
now grew old, he fell presently to work, and built a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56424:12"/>
Temple, and made <hi>Manasses</hi> High Priest of it, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereby to leave a great Honour to the Posterity of his
Daughter.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while <hi>Darius</hi> sends again to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>

                        <hi>Darius</hi> his second message.</note>
setting before him all difficulties he should meet
with in his passing on to the East, laying the loss
of the late Battel to the streightness of the place: He
bids him to consider how impossible it was for him
to pass the Rivers of <hi>Euphrates, Tygris, Araxes,</hi> &amp;c.
with all such other dreadfull things as he thought might
discourage him. Moreover he profered to him all
the Kingdoms which lay between the River <hi>Halis,</hi>
and the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> as a Dower with his beloved
Daughter:<note place="margin">Rejected by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
                     </note> But <hi>Alexander</hi> rejected all, saying, <hi>That
he proferred him nothing but what already was his own,
and what Victory, and his Virtue had possessed him of.
That he was in a capacity to give conditions, and not to
receive any: and that having passed the Sea it self, he
disdained to think of resistance in transporting his Army
over Rivers.</hi> Indeed <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who was now old,
and full of Honour and Riches, told the King, that
if he were <hi>Alexander</hi> he would embrace the offers of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi>
to which <hi>Alexander</hi> answered, that so would he if
he were <hi>Parmenio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then did <hi>Alexander</hi> march on towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
when he came to <hi>Gaza,</hi>

                        <hi>Gaza</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,</note> 
                     <hi>Getes</hi> the Governour, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
servant to <hi>Darius,</hi> shut the Gates against him, and
defended the Town with a Noble Resolution, at the siege
whereof <hi>Alexander</hi> received a wound in the shoulder
which was dangerous, and a blow on his leg with a
stone. He found better men in this place than he had
done in the former Battels: For he left so many of his
<hi>Macedonians</hi> buried in the sands of <hi>Gaza,</hi> that he was
fain to send for a new supply into <hi>Greece.</hi> Here it
was that <hi>Alexander</hi> began to shew his cruelty: For after
he had taken <hi>Gaza</hi> by assault,<note place="margin">and taken. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> and <hi>Getis</hi> the Governour,
who was weakened with divers wounds, and who never
gave ground to the Assailants, <hi>Alexander</hi> caused holes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56424:13"/>
to be bored through his feet, and himself to be drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
about the streets whilst he was yet alive, who
being as valiant a man as himself, scorned to ask
him either for life, or the mitigation of his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Gaza Alexander</hi> led his Army towards <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
                     </note>
a City for the Antiquity, and great fame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
well known unto him; while he lay before <hi>Tyre,</hi>
he had sent for some supplies thither, which <hi>Jaddus</hi>
the High Priest, being Subject, and Sworn to <hi>Darius,</hi>
had refused him. The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore fearing revenge,
and unable to resist, committed the care of their Lives
and Estates to <hi>Jaddus,</hi> who had recourse to God by
supplications and Sacrifices for the Common safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and was by him warned in a Dream that he
should make Holy-day in the City, and set the
Gates wide open, and that he and the rest of the
Priests, every one in his Priestly Raiment, and the
People all clothed in white, should go forth and meet <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi>
and accordingly, he Issued out of the City, array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Pontificall Robes, to wit, an upper garment
of Purple, Embroidered with Gold, with his Mitre,
and the Plate of Gold, wherein was engraved the
Name of God, the Priests and Levites also in their rich
Ornaments, and the People in White Garments, in a
manner so unusuall, stately, and grave, as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
greatly admired it; and when he came neer to the
High Priest,<note place="margin">and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships the High Priest.</note> he fell to the ground before him, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencing
the Name of God, and when <hi>Parmenio</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him for it, <hi>Alexander</hi> told him, that in <hi>Dios,</hi> a City
of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> his mind being busied about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Asia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His vision.</note> he saw in his sleep such a person as
<hi>Jaddus,</hi> and so apparelled, by whom he was encouraged
to pursue his purpose, with assurance of Victory; and
now beholding with his bodily eyes him who before
was onely represented to his fancy, he was so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
pleased, and encouraged, as (contrary to the
expectation of the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> who hoped to have sackt,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56424:13"/>
and destroyed <hi>Jerusalem)</hi> he gave the <hi>Jews</hi> all,<note place="margin">His favor to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </note> and
more than all that they desired; During his abode there,
<hi>Jaddus</hi> shewed him the Prophesie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> wherein he
saw himself; and his Conquest of <hi>Persia</hi> so directly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, as that nothing from thenceforth could either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright,
or discourage him therein.</p>
                  <p>The next day <hi>Alexander</hi> assembled the People, and
bad them ask what they would of him: But they
asked nothing but that they might live according to the
Laws of their own Country, and that every seventh
year (wherein they were to have no harvest) they
might be exempted from paying any Tribute, all
which he granted. And when they asked further,
that he would suffer the <hi>Jews,</hi> which dwelt in the
Countries of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> to live according
to their own Rites and Laws, he answered, that
he would satisfie their desires in that point also, so
soon as he should get those Countries into his
power. And when he told them, that if any of
them would follow him in his Wars, they should use
their own Rites wheresoever they came, many listed
themselves to serve him.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Jerusalem Alexander</hi> turned again towards <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Egypt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him.</note>

                  <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> came neer the place,<note place="margin">His Pride.</note> he sent some
of his <hi>Parasites</hi> to corrupt the Priests attending the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
that their answer might be given in all things
according to his mad ambition, who affected to be
accounted the Son of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> and accordingly, he was
saluted <hi>Jupiters</hi> Son, by the Devils Prophet, for which
he was richly rewarded, and presently a rumour was
spread abroad, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> had owned him for his
Childe: and the better to confirm his followers in the
belief of his Deity, he suborned the Priests to give
answer to such as consulted with the Oracle, that
it would be very pleasing to <hi>Jupiter</hi> to Honour <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
as his Son. But this is certain, and very
observable,<note place="margin">The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Gospel.</note> that at <hi>Christs</hi> coming, and the first preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel, the Devil in this, and in all other his

                  <p>From the Temple of <hi>Hammon, Alexander</hi> returned to
<hi>Memphis,</hi> where, among many other learned men, he
heard the Philosopher <hi>Psammones,</hi> who understanding
that he affected the title of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Son, told him, that
God was the Father King of all men: and, refining
the pride of this haughty King, he brought him to
acknowledge, that God was the Father of all mortall
men, but that he acknowledgeth none for his children, save
good men.</p>

he abandon it, and <hi>Alexander</hi> without resistance, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

for the swiftness thereof, called by the <hi>Persians,
The Arrow:</hi> Here might <hi>Darius</hi> easily have repelled
him; for the violent course of the stream was such, as
it drave before it many weighty stones, and those that
moved not, but lay in the bottom, were so round,
and smooth by continuall rolling, that no man was
able to fight upon so slippery a standing: Nor were
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Footmen able to wade through the
River, otherwise than by joyning their hands, and
interlacing their Arms each in others, making there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
one entire, and weighty Body to resist the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness
of the stream: and besides this, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
was so deep towards the Eastern shore,<note place="margin">And <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris.</hi>
                     </note> where
<hi>Darius</hi> should have opposed him, that the Footmen
were enforced to lift their Bows, Arrows, and Darts
over their Heads to keep them from being made
unservicable by the water. Indeed it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that as all Estates of the World, by the surfeit of
misgovernment, have been subject to many grievous,
and sometimes, mortall diseases: So had the Empire
of <hi>Persia</hi> at this time brought it self into a burning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and thereby became frantick, and without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
foreshewing manifestly the death, and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
thereof.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Alexander</hi> had now recovered the Eastern shore
of <hi>Tygris</hi> without any opposition but what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the River made, were <hi>Mazeus,</hi> who had the
charge to defend the banks, both of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and
it, presented himself to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with certain Troops of Horsemen, as if with
uneven forces, he durst have charged them upon even
ground, when as, with a multitude far exceeding
them, he forsook those advantages which no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the enemy could easily have overcome. But <hi>its
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56424:15"/>

those ways,</hi>

                     <hi>and counsels, whereof the opportunity is already lost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its true, that he set all provisions on fire wherewith
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> might be assisted in their passage over
<hi>Tygris,</hi> thinking thereby greatly to have distrested them:
but the execution of good counsel is fruitless, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable.
For now was <hi>Alexander</hi> so well furnished
with carriages, that no conveniences were wanting to
the Army which he conducted. Those things also
which <hi>Mazeus</hi> now sought to destroy, <hi>Alexander</hi> being in
sight,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> his new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> by his Horsmen, saved and recovered them. This
<hi>Mazeus</hi> might have done some dayes before at good
leasure; yea, at this time he might have done it with so
great a strength of Horsmen, as the <hi>Mecedonians</hi> might
not have dared to pursue, leaving the Body of their Foot
out of sight, and so far behind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius,</hi> upon <hi>Alexanders</hi> first return out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had
assembled all those Forces which the Countries next to
him could afford; and now also were the <hi>Arians, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
Indians,</hi> and other Nations come to him. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(saith <hi>Curtius)</hi> that rather served to make up a
number, than to make resistance. Some reckon them
to amount to the number of ten hundred thousand Foot,
and four hundred thousand Horse, besides armed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
and some few Elephants. <hi>Crutius</hi> numbers them
but two hundred thousand Foot, and about fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse, which is more probable: And yet seeing
<hi>Darius</hi> had more confidence in the number, then in the
Valour of his Souldiers, probably he had brought
together some three or four hundred thousand of all sorts,
with which, he hoped in those fair plains of <hi>Assyria,</hi> to have
overborn the small number of the invading Army. But
its most true, <hi>That in every Battel skill and practice do more to
wards attaining the victory, than multitudes, and rude audacity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilest <hi>Alexander</hi> rested,<note place="margin">An <hi>Eclipse</hi> frightens the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians.</hi>
                     </note> and refreshed his Army after
their heard passage over <hi>Tygris,</hi> there happened an <hi>Eclipse</hi>
of the Moon, at which the <hi>Macedonians</hi> (being ignorant
of the cause, and reason of it) were much troubled;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56424:15"/>
taking it as a certain presage of their ruine and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
insomuch as they began not only to murmur, but
to speak boldly, that to satisfie the ambition of one
man, and of such an one as disdained <hi>Philip</hi> for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and would needs be called the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
they should all perish: For he enforced them, not
onely to War against a world of enemies, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Rivers, Mountains, and the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Alaxander,</hi> who was now ready to advance,
made an halt, and to quiet the minds of the multitude,
he called before him the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Astrologers, that by
them the Souldiers might be assured that this <hi>Eclipse</hi>
of the Moon, was a sure persage of his good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
But they never informed them that it came to
pass by naturall causes, but reserved that as a secret fit
to be kept amongst themselves. These Astrologers
gave no other reason for it than this, That the <hi>Grecians</hi>
were under the Aspect of the Sun, and the <hi>Persians</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that of the Moon, and therefore the Moon losing
her light, did foreshew that the state of <hi>Persia</hi> was now
in danger of falling, and their Glory of being obscured.
This being noised through all the Army, every man
was satisfied, and quieted, and their courage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Alexander</hi> drew neer the <hi>Persian</hi> Army, certain
Letters were intercepted, written by <hi>Darius</hi> to the
<hi>Grecians,</hi> proffering and promising them a great summe
of money, if they would either kill, or betray <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
But these, by the advice of <hi>Parmonio,</hi> were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
                  <p>About this time also <hi>Darius</hi> his beautifull Wife,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> his Wife died.</note> being
oppressed with sorrow, and wearied with travel, died:
which accident <hi>Alexander</hi> seemed to bewaile no lesse than
<hi>Darius.</hi> who, upon the first report of it, suspected, that
some dishonourable violence had been offered to her; but
being satisfied by an Eunuch of his own that attended
her, of <hi>Alexanders</hi> kind, and Kingly respect towards
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56424:16"/>
her from the very time of her being taken, he prayed
the immortall Gods, that if they had decreed to set a
new Master over the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, that then it would
please them to confer it on so just and chast an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as was <hi>Alexander,</hi> to whom, once more before
the last triall by Battel, he offered these conditions of
peace.</p>
                  <p>That if he would marry his Daughter,<note place="margin">Proposals to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
                     </note> he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
and resigne up to him all <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse, with
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and all those Kingdoms between the <hi>Phaenician</hi>
Sea and the River <hi>Euphrates.</hi> That he would pay him
for the Ransom of his Mother, and other Daughters,
thirty thousand Talents, and that for performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he would leave his Son <hi>Ochus</hi> in Hostage; and they
sought by sundry Arguments to perswade <hi>Alexander</hi> to
accept hereof. <hi>Alexander</hi> causing the Ambassadors to
withdraw, advised with his Councel, yet heard no man
speak but <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who was the very right hand of
his good Fortune, and he perswaded him to accept of
such fair conditions: He told him, that the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Euphrates</hi> and the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> was a large addition
to <hi>Macedonia:</hi> That the retaining of those <hi>Persian</hi> priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
was a great cumber to him; and that the Treasure
offered for them was of far better use than their persons,
with divers other Arguments, yet <hi>Alexander,</hi> rejected all;
though it was very probable, that if he had followed his
advice, and set bounds to his ambition within those limits,
he might have been as famous for his virtue, as he was
for his great successes, and might have left a successor
of fit age to have enjoyed his estate, which afterwards,
indeed he much enlarged, rather to the greatning of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
than himself, who to assure themselves of what
they had Usurped, left not one of his issue alive within
a few years after. Besides, <hi>Alexander</hi> by going so far
into the East, left behind him the reputation which he
brought with him out of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> of a just and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Prince: A Prince temperate, advised, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
and learned by aboundance of prosperity, to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56424:16"/>
a lover of wine, of Flatterers, and of extream cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassadors waited for their answer,<note place="margin">Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note>
which was to this effect: that what curtesies soever he
had bestowed upon the Wife, and Children of <hi>Darius,</hi>
proceded from his own naturall clemency, and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
without all respect to their Master, but thanks
to an enemy was improper: That he made no Wars
against adversity, but against those that resisted him:
Not against Women, and Children, but against armed
enemies: And also that by the reiterated practices of
<hi>Darius,</hi> to corrupt his Souldiers, and by great summes
of money, to debauch his Friends to attempt some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against his Person, he had reason to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the peace offered were really intended, yet could
he not (were it true and faithfull) resolve in hast to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of it, seeing <hi>Darius</hi> had Warred against him, not as
a King, with Royal and overt forces, but as a Traitor,
by secret, and base practices. Besides, the Territories
which he offered him were already his own; and if
<hi>Darius,</hi> could beat him back again over <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he
would then believe that he offered him somthing that
was in his power to give: Otherwise he propounded to
himself, as a reward of his enterprizes, all those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
which <hi>Darius</hi> as yet had in his possession; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
whether he was abused by his own hopes or no, the
Battell which he meant to fight the day following,
should determine. And in conclusion, he told them, that
he came into <hi>Asia,</hi> to give Kingdoms, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ive
them: That the Heavens could not hold two
Suns, and therefore if <hi>Darius</hi> could be content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<hi>Alexander</hi> his Superiour,<note place="margin">His ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he might perchance
be perswaded to give him condition fit for a second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and an Inferiour.</p>
                  <p>The Ambassadors being returned with this answer,
<hi>Darius</hi> prepares to fight, and sent <hi>Mazeus</hi> to defend a
Pass, which yet he never dared so much as to hazzard.
<hi>Alexander</hi> consulting with his Captains, <hi>Parmeni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56424:17"/>
perswaded him to force the Camp of <hi>Darius</hi> by night,
that the multitudes of his enemies might not affright his
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> being comparitivly but a few. But <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
replied, that <hi>he s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>orned to steal a victory, and resolved
to bring with him Daylight to witnesse his Valour.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> Indeed
the successe commended <hi>Alexanders</hi> resolution, though
the Counsel given by <hi>Parmenio</hi> was more sound. Yet
when he came to view the multitude of his enemies, he
began to stagger, and entrenched himself upon a Ground
of advantage, which foolishly the <hi>Persians</hi> had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
And when as <hi>Darius,</hi> for fear of a <hi>Camizado,</hi> had
stood with his men in A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mour all the day, and forborne
all sleep in the night; <hi>Alexander</hi> on the contrary, gave
his men rest, and store of food, knowing, that Souldiers
do better stand to it in fight, if they have their bellies
full of meat and drink: for hunger within, fights more
eagerly than steel without.</p>
                  <p>The numbers which <hi>Alexander</hi> had,<note place="margin">They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to fight.</note> were about fourty

him out of those Countries. He used but a short speech
to his Soldiers to encourage them, neither need he; For
one victory begets another, and puts courage into the
Conquerours, and taketh away spirits from those that
have been beaten.</p>
                  <p>Some make large descriptions of this Battel,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> fought at
<hi>Gaugamela,</hi> but in conclusion they tell us but of three
hundred of <hi>Alexanders</hi> men that were slain, and some
say lesse; but of the <hi>Persians</hi> there fell fourty thousand:
But what can we judg of this great encounter, other
than (as in the two forme Battels at <hi>Granick,</hi> and in
<hi>Cilicia)</hi> that the <hi>Persians,</hi> upon the first charge, ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> pursued them. For if
that every man whom <hi>Darius</hi> brought into the field,
had but cast a Dart, or a stone, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> could
not have bought the Empire of the East at so eas<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

as six or seven hundred in three such notorious Battels.

Certainly if <hi>Darius</hi> had fought with <hi>Alexander</hi> upon the
banks of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and had Armed but fifty or sixty
thousand of this great multitude, onely with Spades
(for most of his men were fit for no other weapon) it
had been impossible for <hi>Alexander</hi> to have passed that

man,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> beaten,</note> whose Empire God was putting a Period to,
he abandoned all places of advantage, and suffered

as all hope and possibility of escaping by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
being taken from the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> they were
put to the choice, either to die or Conquer, to

This miserable resolution his Nobility rather obeyed, than

For the fear which accompanied <hi>Darius,</hi> took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

and delivered to him whatsoever was committed to his

and in all sorts of effeminate exercises,
which so much softned the minds of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi>
not acquainted till now with such delicacies, as the
severe Discipline of War, which taught them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
hunger and thirst, painfull travell, and hard
lodging, began rather to be forgotten than neglected.
<hi>Alexander,</hi> as he was rowed upon a Lake neer <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
in his Gally, a sudden tempest arising blew off his
Hat, and Crown fastened upon it, into the Lake,
whereupon one of the Marriners, leaping into the
water, swam, and fetched it to him, and to keep it the
drier, he put it upon his own head. <hi>Alexander</hi> rewarded
him with a Talent for saving his Crown; but withall,
caused his Head to be cut off,<note place="margin">Base cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> for presuming to put his
Crown upon it.</p>
                  <p>During his abode here, <hi>Alexander</hi> instituted those
Regiments consisting of a thousand Souldiers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56424:18"/>
Collonels over them, who thereupon were
called <hi>Chiliarks.</hi> This new order <hi>Alexander</hi> brought
in, was to honour those Captains, which were found by
certain select Judges, to have deserved best in the late
War.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Alexander</hi> was yet at <hi>Babylon,</hi> there came to
him a great supply out of <hi>Europe.</hi> For <hi>Antipater</hi> sent him
six thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse out of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia;</hi>
and of the <hi>Thracians</hi> three thousand Foot, and as
many Horse, and out of <hi>Greece</hi> four thousand, and
four hundred Horse, by which his Army was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
strengthened. For those that were infected with the
pleasures of <hi>Babylon,</hi> could hardly be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to change their soft beds for hard boards, and the
cold ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> left the City and Castle of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with

he gave him the title of his Lieutenant Generall, and
took along with him <hi>Bagistines,</hi> who surrended the
Castle to him; and having distributed to every Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
a part of the Treasure, he left <hi>Babylon</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Province of <hi>Satrapene,</hi> marching from
thence towards <hi>Susa</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> situated on the River
<hi>Euleus,</hi> which City was sometime Governed by the
Prophet <hi>Diniel.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Susa</hi> taken</note> Here <hi>Abulites,</hi> the Governour of this
famous City, gave it up to the Conquerour, with
fifty thousand Talents of Silver in Bullion, and twelve
Elephants for the War, with all other the Treasure of
<hi>Darius</hi> there; such as the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings had for a long
time, heaped up together, leaving it from Father to
Son; all which in one hour came into his hands who
had never cared for it. <hi>In this sort did those Vassals of
Fortune; those lovers of the Kings prosperity, not of his
Person, purchase their own peace, and safety with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Treasure;</hi> and herein was <hi>Alexander</hi> well advised,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56424:19"/>
that whatsoever titles he gave to the <hi>Persians,</hi> yet he left
all places of importance in trust with his own Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
as <hi>Babylon, Susa, Persepolis,</hi> with other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Provinces that were Conquered by him: for
had <hi>Darius</hi> but beaten the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in one Battel, all
the <hi>Persian</hi> Nobility would have turned again to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Lord.</p>
                  <p>Whilest <hi>Alexander</hi> was ransacking <hi>Arbela,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gross folly.</note> 
                     <hi>Mazeus</hi>
might have furnished <hi>Darius</hi> from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and whilest

might have holpen him from <hi>Susa:</hi> and whilest
he was Feasting, and Frolicking there; <hi>Teridates</hi>
from <hi>Persepolis</hi> might fully have supplied him: for
the chiefest bulk of his Treasure was laid up in
that City: But <hi>benefits bind not the ambitious but the
honest; for those that are selfish, do in all changes, consult only
the conservation of their own greatness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Government of <hi>Susa,</hi> with the Castle and treasure,
<hi>Alexander</hi> committed to his own <hi>Macedonians,</hi> making
<hi>Abulites,</hi> who rendred it to him, his Lieutenant, as he had
done <hi>Mazeus</hi> before, giving them Honourable Titles, but
neither trust nor power. For he left three thousand old
Souldiers to Garrison that City, and with them, the
Mother, and Children of <hi>Darius</hi> to repose themselves
there.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Susa Alexander</hi> marched with his Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                     </gap>under <hi>Susiana</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> he was soundly
beaten by <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who defended those Streights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

many of his <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he was forced to save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by retreat, causing his Foot to march close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to cover themselves with their Targets from
the Stones that were tumbled upon them from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-tops.
Yet in the end, he found out another passage,
which was discovered to him by a <hi>Lycian</hi> that lived in
that Country, and thereby, coming suddenly upon <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes,</hi>
who now was enforced to fight <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ground, he overthrew him, who from thence fled
to <hi>Persepolis:</hi> But the Citizens refusing to admit him,
he returned and gave a second charge upon the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi>
in which he was slain.</p>
                  <p>Many <hi>Greeks</hi> (for Authors agree not upon their
number) having been taken Prisoners by the <hi>Persians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Barbarous cruelty.</note>
presented themselves here to <hi>Alexander.</hi> These had
the <hi>Barbarians</hi> so maimed, by cuting off their Hands,
Eares, Noses, and other Members, as that they could
not have been known to their own Country men, but
by there Language. To each of these <hi>Alexander</hi> gave
three hundred Crowns, with new Garments, and such
Lands as they liked to live upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tiridates,</hi> one of <hi>Darius</hi> his falshearted Grandees,
hearing of <hi>Alexanders</hi> approach to <hi>Persepolis,</hi> made him
know that <hi>Persepolis</hi> was ready to receive him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to double his pace, because there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
amongst the People to Plunder the Kings
Treasury. This City was forsaken by many of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
upon <hi>Alexanders</hi> arrivall,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Persepolis</hi> taken.</note> and they that staid,
followed the worst Counsel. For the City was given
up to the Liberty of the Souldiers t2o spoil, and kill at
their pleasure. There was no place in the world at
that time, which, if it had been lain in the Ballance
with <hi>Persepolis,</hi> would have weighed it down, Indeed,
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Susa</hi> were very rich; but in <hi>Persepolis</hi>
lay the bulk, and greatest store of the riches of <hi>Persia.</hi> For
after the spoil that had been made, of money, curious
Plate, Bullion, Images of Gold, and Silver, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
jewels, there remained to <hi>Alexander</hi> himself one
hundred and twenty thousand Talents, and as much
other Treasure as twenty thousand Mules, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sand
Camels could carry away, much whereof had
been reserved there from the dayes of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Here it
was that <hi>Alexander,</hi> setting himself down upon <hi>Darius</hi> his
Throne, it was so high that his feet could not reach
the ground, whereupon one of his attendants brought
him a little Table, and set it under his feet. One of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56424:20"/>
                     <hi>Darius</hi>'s Eunuchs standing by, sighed, and wept grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously,
which <hi>Alexander</hi> taking notice of, asked him
the reason of it? the Eunuch answered, <hi>I weep to see a
Table that was so highly prized by my Master</hi> Darius, <hi>now
to be made thy footstool.</hi> Here he left the same number
of three thousand <hi>Macedonians,</hi> in <hi>Persepolis,</hi> as he had
done in <hi>Susa,</hi> and gave the same formall honour to the
Traitor <hi>Tiridates,</hi> as he had done to <hi>Abulites;</hi> but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the charge of the place to <hi>Nicarides,</hi> a Creature of
his own.</p>
                  <p>The Body of his Army he left here for thirty dayes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the care of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and <hi>Craterus,</hi> and with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse,<note place="margin">A foolish enterprise.</note> and certain chosen Bands of Foot, he would
needs view in the winter time, those parts of <hi>Persia</hi>
which now were covered with Snow: A fruitless and
foolish enterprise. Some speak it in his praise, that
when his Souldiers cried out against him, because of
the extream Frost and Snow, through which they could
not make way but with great difficulty, that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
forsook his Horse, and marched on foot before
them: <hi>But what can be more ridiculous than for a man to
bring other men into extremity, thereby to shew how well him
self can endure it;</hi> Being his walking on foot did no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
take off their wearinesse that followed him,
than his sometime forbearing to drink, did quench their
thirst that could lesse endure it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> being returned to <hi>Persopolis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> turns Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard.</note> those Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that were most enamored of his virtues, complain,
that the opinion of his Valour, of his Liberality, of his
Clemency towards the vanquished, and all other his
Noble conditions, were drowned in Drink. That he
smothered in his carousing cups all the reputation of his
former actions, and that by descending as it were, from
the awfull Throne of the greatest King, into the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and familiarity of the bastest Harlots, he began to
be despised both of his own, and of all other Nations.
For when he was enflamed with Wine, and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by the infamous Strumpet <hi>Thais,</hi> he caused the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56424:20"/>
most sumtuous,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Persopolis</hi> burnt.</note> and goodly Castle and City of <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi>
to be consumed with fire, notwithstanding all the
Arguments that <hi>Parmenio</hi> could use to the contrary,
who told him, that it was a dishonour to destroy those
things by the perswasion of others, which by his proper
virtue, and force, he obtained: and that it would be a
certain evidence to the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> to think hardly of
him, and thereby alienate their hearts from him. For
they might well believe, that he which demolished the
goodliest Ornaments they had, meant nothing lesse,
than after such vastations, to hold the possession of
them.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Alexander</hi> received another supply of
Souldiers out of <hi>Cilica,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> his last Army.</note> and advanced to find out <hi>Darius</hi>
in <hi>Media. Darius</hi> had there formed his fourth, and
last Army, which he meant to have encreased in <hi>Bactria,</hi>
had he not heard of <hi>Alexanders</hi> comming on, with
whom (trusting to his present numbers, which yet
were but thirty or fourty thousand) he intended once
again to try what he might doe against him. He
therefore called together his Captains, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
and propounded his resolution to them, who
desparing of good successe, stood for a while silent:
But at last <hi>Artabazus</hi> one of his eldest men of War, who
had sometime lived with King <hi>Philip</hi> the Father of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> brake the silence, protesting that he
could never be beaten by any adversity of the Kings,
from the faith that he had ever ought him, with firm
confidence that all the rest were of the same mind,
whereof they likewise assured <hi>Darius,</hi> by the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
and so they approved of the Kings resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Two onely, and they the greatest, to wit,
<hi>Naburzanes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Treason of <hi>Bessus.</hi>
                     </note> and <hi>Bessus,</hi> who was Governor of <hi>Bactria,</hi>
had conspired against their Master, and therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vised
the King to lay a new foundation for the War,
and to pursue it for the present by some such person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom neither the Gods, nor Fortune had in all
things declared themselves to be an enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:56424:21"/>
This preamble <hi>Naburzanes</hi> used, and in conclusion
advised the Election of his fellow Traitor <hi>Bessus,</hi> with
promise that when the War should be ended, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
should be again restored to <hi>Darius.</hi> The King,
swolne with disdain, pressed towards <hi>Naburzanes</hi> to
have slain him; but <hi>Bessus,</hi> and the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> whom
he commanded, being more in number than the rest,
with held him. Hereupon <hi>Nahurzanes</hi> withdrew
himself and <hi>Bessus</hi> followed him, making their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
apart from the rest of the Army. <hi>Artabazus,</hi> the
the Kings faithfull servant, perswaded him to be advised,
and to comply for the time, the rather because <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
was at hand, and that he would at lest make shew
of forgeting the offence: which the King (being of a
gentle disposition) easily yeilded to. Then came <hi>Bessus</hi>
to the King and made his submission: But <hi>Patron,</hi> who
commanded a Brigade of four thousand <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                     </note> which
had in all the former Battels served <hi>Darius</hi> faithfully,
and had alwayes made their retreat in despit of the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> offered himself to <hi>Darius</hi> to guard his
Person, protesting against the Treason of <hi>Bessus. (But
God had otherwise determined of the Empire, and therefore
so far was the King infatuated, that he ever rejected their
Counsel from the begining of the War, who were most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him.)</hi> And now hearkened to <hi>Bessus,</hi> who told
him, that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> with <hi>Patron</hi> their Captain, were
corrupted by <hi>Alexander</hi> and practiced the division of
his faithfull servants: Yet, even this while, <hi>Bessus</hi> had
corrupted, and drawn to himself thirty thousand of the
Army, promising them all those things by which, the
lovers of the world and themselves, are wont to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured,
to wit, Riches, honour, and Safety.</p>
                  <p>Now the day following <hi>Darius</hi> plainly discovered
the purposes of <hi>Bessus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                        </hi> discharges his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</note> and being overcome with pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as judging himself unable to make head against
these ungratefull and unnatural Traitors, he prayed
<hi>Artabazus,</hi> his faithfull servant, to depart from him,
and to provide for his own safty. In like mannor he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56424:21"/>
the rest of his attendants, all save a few of his
Eunuchs. For his Gaurds had voluntarily abandoned
him. His <hi>Persians,</hi> being most base cowards, durst
not undertake his defence against the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> though
they had four thousand <hi>Greeks</hi> to assist them, who of
themselves were able to beat both the Parties. But
its most true, <hi>That him that forsakes himself, will no
man follow.</hi> It had been far more manlike, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to have died in the head of those four thousand
<hi>Greeks,</hi> who offered him the disposall of their lives, (to
which <hi>Artabazus</hi> also perswaded him) than to have
lain upon the ground bewailing himself, and suffering
himself to be bound like a slave, by those ambitious
Monsters that laid violent hands on him;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> made a Prisoner and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> whom neither
the consideration of his former great estate, nor the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
he had conferred upon them, nor the trust he had
reposed in them, nor the world of benefits he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on them, could move to pitty: No, nor his
present adversity, which above all things should have
prevailed with them, could pierce their viperous, and
ingratefull hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius,</hi> thus forsaken, was bound by them, and laid
in a Cart covered with Hides of Beasts, that he might
not be discovered; and to adde despite, and derision to
his adversity, they bound him with Chaines of Gold,
and so drew him amongst their ordinary Carriages. For
<hi>Bessus,</hi> and <hi>Naburzanes</hi> perswaded themselves that they
might redeem their lives, and be setled in their Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that they held, either by delivering him a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
to <hi>Alexander,</hi> or if that hope failed, to make
themselves Kings by his murther, and then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves by force of Armes. But their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
were frustrate in both.<note place="margin">Gods Justice.</note> For it was against
the Nature of God, who is most just, to suffer such
villany to go unpunished, yea, though against an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
King, and an Idolator.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing that <hi>Darius</hi> was retreated towards
<hi>Bactria,</hi>

                        <hi>Alexander</hi> pursues him.</note> not daring to abide his coming, hastned after
him by a violent march, and because he would not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56424:22"/>
force his Footmen beyond their strength, he mounted
on Horseback certain select Companies of them, and
those which were best Armed, and with six thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Horse, he rather ran than marched after <hi>Darius.</hi>
Now such as hated the Treason of <hi>Bessus,</hi> secretly forsook
him, and gave intelligence to <hi>Alexander</hi> of all that
had happened, informing him of the way that <hi>Bes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
took, and how neer he was unto him. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Alaxander</hi> again doubled his pace, and his Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
being come within sight of <hi>Bessus</hi> his Reare, <hi>Bes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
brought a Horse to the Cart where <hi>Darius</hi> lay
bound, perswading him to mount thereon, and to save
himself by flight. But the unfortunate King refusing to
follow those that had betraied him, they cast Darts at
him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Darius</hi> is wounded.</note> and gave him some mortall wounds: they woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

fled that could, and left the rest to the mercy of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polystratus,</hi> a <hi>Macedonian,</hi> in his pursuit after <hi>Bessus,</hi>
being extream thirsty, as he was refreshing himself,
with some water that he had found out, espied a Cart
drawn by wounded Beasts, that were now scarce able
to go, whereupon he searched it, and there found
<hi>Darius</hi> bathed in his own blood: and by a <hi>Persian</hi>
Captain that <hi>Polystratus</hi> had, he understood that it was
<hi>Darius,</hi> and was informed of that Barbarous Tragedy.
<hi>Darius</hi> also seemed greatly comforted (if dying men,
ignorant of the living God can be comforted) that he
vented not his last sorrowes unheard, but that by this
<hi>Macedonian, Alexander</hi> might be informed of the truth,
and take vengeance on those Traitors, who had dealt
no lesse unworthily; than cruelly with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
the revenge thereof to <hi>Alexander</hi> by
this messenger,<note place="margin">His last words.</note> beseeching him to pursue the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
not for <hi>Darius,</hi> his sake, but for his own Honour,
and for the safety of all that did, or should hereafter
weare Crowns. He also having nothing else to present
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56424:22"/>
to <hi>Alexander,</hi> rendred him thanks for his Kingly Grace,
and favour used to his Wife Mother and Children, desiring
the immortall Gods to subject to him the Kingdom of
the whole World. As he was thus speaking, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Death pressing out his few remaining spirits, he
desired a little water, which <hi>Polystratus</hi> presented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, after which he lived but to tell him, that
of all the good things which of late he was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of, he had nothing remaining but his last breath,
wherewith to desire the Gods to reward his compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Macedonians</hi> began now to hope that their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
were neer an end: and therefore every man was
preparing for his return, whereof when <hi>Alexander</hi> was
informed, he was much troubled at it. For the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Earth suffized not for his boundlesse ambition.<note place="margin">

Arguments he therefore used to draw on his Army
farther into the East: But that which prevailed most
was, that <hi>Bessus,</hi> a base Traitor to his Master <hi>Darius,</hi>
having at his devotion the <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> and <hi>Bactrians,</hi>
would in a short time, if the <hi>Macedonians</hi> should now
returne, make himself Lord of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, and
reap the fruit of all their former travels. In conclusion,
<hi>Alexander</hi> wan their consents to go on: Which done,
leaving <hi>Craterus</hi> with certain Regiments of Foot, and
<hi>Amyntas</hi> with six thousand Horse,<note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania.</hi>
                     </note> in <hi>Parthia,</hi> he entred
(not without some opposition) into <hi>Hyrcania.</hi> For the
<hi>Mardons,</hi> and other Barbarous Nations, defended cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
passages for a while. But at last prevailing, he
passed the River of <hi>Zioberis,</hi> which, taking its rise in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi>
empties it self into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. It runneth
under the ledg of Mountains which bound <hi>Parthia,</hi>
and <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> where, hiding it self under ground for
three hundred furlongs, it then riseth again, and follows
its former course as is said before. In <hi>Zadracarta</hi> the
Metropolis of <hi>Hyrcania, Alexander</hi> rested fifteen dayes,
Banquetting, and Feasting therein.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Phataphernes,</hi> one of <hi>Darius</hi> his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56424:23"/>
Commanders,<note place="margin">Diverse submit to him.</note> with some others of his followers
submitted themselves to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and were restored to
to their places, and Government. But above all other,
he Graced <hi>Artabazus</hi> most highly, for his approved
and constant Faith and Loyalty to his Master <hi>Darius.
Artabazus</hi> brought along with him ten thousand and
five hundred <hi>Greeks,</hi> the remainder of all those that had
served <hi>Darius.</hi> He treated with <hi>Alexander</hi> for their
pardon before they came; but in the end, they rendred
themselves simply without promise or composition:
<hi>Alexander</hi> pardoned all but the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whom
he imprisoned, their Captain having slain himself:
He was also prevailed with (though to his great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
to pardon <hi>Nabarzanes,</hi> that had joyned with <hi>Bessus</hi>
in the murther of <hi>Darius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere (as some write) <hi>Thalestris,</hi>

obtained) that she might accompany him, till she proved

with him into <hi>India,</hi> but returned into her own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>Now as <hi>Alexander</hi> had begun to change his conditions
after the taking of <hi>Persepolis:</hi> So at this time Prosperity had
so much corrupted his virtue, that he accounted clemency
to be but basenesse, and the temperance, which all his life
before he had used, to be but a poor, and abject humour,
rather becoming the instructers of his youth, than the
condition, and state of so mighty a King, as the World
could not equal. For he perswaded himself that he now
represented the greatness of the Gods; and he was pleased
when those that came before him,<note place="margin">He affects a Deity.</note> would fall on the
ground and adore him. He wore the Garments, and Robes
of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and commanded his Nobles to do the
like. He entertained into his Court, and Camp, the same
shamelesse Rabble of <hi>Curtizans,</hi> and <hi>Catamite,<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> as <hi>Darius</hi>
had done, whom he imitated in all the proud, voluptuous,
and detested manners of the <hi>Persians,</hi> whom he had
vanquished, and became a more foul and fearfull monster
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56424:23"/>
than <hi>Darius,</hi> from whose Tyranny, he vaunted, to have
delivered so many Nations; Insomuch as they that were
neerest and deerest to him, began to be ashamed of him,
entertaining each other with this, or the like scornfull
discourse.<note place="margin">For which he is scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his Friends.</note> That <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi> was become
one of <hi>Darius</hi> licentious Courtiers: That by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> after so many, and tedious
travels, were more impoverished in their virtues, than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
by their victories, and that it was hard now to
judge, whether the Conqueres, or Conquered were the
baser slaves. Neither were these things so whispered in
corners, but that they came to <hi>Alexanders</hi> ears: He
therefore with great Gifts sought to stop the mouthes of
the better sort, and of such of whose Judgments he was
most jealous.</p>
                  <p>Then did he make it known to the Army, that <hi>Bessus</hi>
had assumed the title of a King; and called himself <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi>
and that he had compounded a great Army
of the <hi>Bactrians</hi> and other Nations, whereby he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
them to go on, to the end that all which they
had already gotten, together with themselves (so far
engaged) might not be cast away, and lost. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were pestered with the plunder of so many
rich Cities, that the whole Army seemed but the guard
of their carriages, he commanded that every mans
Fardel should be brought into the Market place,<note place="margin">He burns all the Spoils.</note> which
when it was done, he, together with his own, caused
all to be consumed with fire. This, in probability, might
have proved very dangerous unto him: For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers had more interest in that which they had
purchased with their painfull travel, and with their blood,
than in the Kings Ambition; had not his happy temerity
overcome all difficulties.</p>
                  <p>As he was upon his march,<note place="margin">Rebellion against him.</note> news was brought that
<hi>Satribarzanes,</hi> whom he had established in his former
Government over the <hi>Arians,</hi> was revolted; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
leaving the way of <hi>Bactria,</hi> he sought the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
out: But the Rebel hearing of his coming, fled with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56424:24"/>
two thousand Horse to <hi>Bessus:</hi> Then marched <hi>Alexander</hi>
on against <hi>Bessus,</hi> and by setting a great Pile of Wood on
fire, with the advantage of a strong winde, he won a
passage over an high, and unaccessible Rock, which
was desended against him by thirty thousand Foot, the
extremity of the fire, and smoak, forcing them to quit the
place, which otherwise had been invincible: After which,
he found no resistance till he came into <hi>Aria,</hi> on the East of
<hi>Bactria,</hi> where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief City of that Province, called <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coana,</hi>
was a while defended against him, by the revolt
of <hi>Satribarzanes;</hi> but in the end, he received the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
to mercy. At this place his Army was recruited
with a new supply of five thousand, and five hundred
Foot, and neer five hundred Horse out of <hi>Greece, Thessaly,</hi>
and other places.</p>
                  <p>At this time it was that the Treason of <hi>Dimnus</hi> was
discovered,<note place="margin">Treason against him.</note> of which <hi>Philotas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> was
accused, at least as accessary if not principall. This <hi>Dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
with some others, having conspired against the life
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> went about to draw <hi>Nicomacus,</hi> a young
man whom he loved, into the conspiracy; The youth,
although he was first bound by Oath to secrecy, when he
heard so foul a matter uttered, began to protest against it
so vehemently, that his Friend was like to have slain
him, to secure his own life; and so, constrained by fear,
he made shew as if he had been won by perswasion, and
by seeming at length, to like well of the business, he
was told more at large who they were that had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
it. There were nine or ten of them, all men of
rank, whose Names <hi>Dimnus</hi> (the better to countenance
the enterprize) reckoned up to him. <hi>Nicomacbus</hi> had
no sooner freed himself from the company of this Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
<hi>Dimnus,</hi> than he acquainted his own Brother, <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballinus,</hi>
with the whole design, whereupon it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
between them, that <hi>Ceballinus</hi> (who might do
it with the least suspition) should go to the Court,
and utter all. <hi>Ceballinus</hi> meeting with <hi>Philotas,</hi> told
him the whole business, requesting him to acquaint
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56424:24"/>
the King with it, which he promised to do, but yet did
not.</p>
                  <p>Two days passed, and <hi>Philotas</hi> never brake with the
King about the matter, but still excused himself to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballinus</hi>
by the Kings want of leasure. This his coldness
bred suspition, and caused <hi>Ceballinus</hi> to apply himself
to one <hi>Metron,</hi> Keeper of the Kings Armory, who forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
brought him to <hi>Alexanders</hi> presence.<note place="margin">Its disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Alexander</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi>
finding by examination what had passed between <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballinus,</hi>
and <hi>Philotas,</hi> fully perswaded himself that this
concealment of the Treason argued <hi>Philotas</hi> to have a
hand in it; when <hi>Dimnus</hi> therefore was brought before
him, he asked him onely this Question; <hi>Wherein have
I so offended thee, that thou shouldst think</hi> Philotas <hi>more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be King than my self? Dimnus,</hi> when he was
first apprehended, perceiving how the matter was
like to go, had so wounded himself, that he lived
no longer than to give his last groan in the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                  <p>Then was <hi>Philotas</hi> sent for, and charged with the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which his silence might justly breed. His answer
was, that when the Treason was revealed to him by <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi>
he judged it to be but frivolous, and therefore
forbore to acquaint <hi>Alexander</hi> with ir, till he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
better information. This errour of his (if it were
but an Errour) though <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the notable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
done by his Father <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canor,</hi>
lately dead, and by <hi>Philotas</hi> himself, had freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
him, and given him his hand for assurance: Yet,
by the instigation of <hi>Craterus,</hi> he falsified his Princely
promise,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Philotus</hi> accused.</note> and made the Enemies of <hi>Philotas</hi> his Judges. <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi>
indeed perswaded himself, that he could never find
a better occasion to oppress his private enemy, than by
pretending Piety, and Duty to his Prince. Whence a
Poet saith,
<q>
                        <l>See how these Great men clothe their private hate,</l>
                        <l>In these fair colours of the Publick good;</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56424:25"/>
And to effect their ends, pretend the State,</l>
                        <l>As if the State by their affection stood:</l>
                        <l>And Arm'd with Power, and Princes Jealousies,</l>
                        <l>Will put the least conceit of discontent</l>
                        <l>Into the greatest rank of Treacheries,</l>
                        <l>That no one action shall seem innocent.</l>
                        <l>Yea, Valour, Honour, Bounty shall be made</l>
                        <l>As accessaries unto ends unjust:</l>
                        <l>And even the service of the State must lade</l>
                        <l>The needful'st undertaking with distrust,</l>
                        <l>So that base vileness, idle Luxury</l>
                        <l>Seem safer far than to do worthily.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the King, following the advice of <hi>Craterus,</hi> had
resolved the next day to put <hi>Philotas</hi> to the Torment,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note>
yet in the very evening of the same night in which he
was apprehended, he called him to a Banquet, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
as familiarly with him as at any other time. But
when in the dead of the night, <hi>Philotas</hi> was taken in his
lodging, and that they which hated him began to binde
him, he cried out upon the King in these words: O
Alexander, <hi>the malice of mine enemies hath surmounted thy
mercy, and their hatred is far more constant than the Word of a
King.</hi> Many circumstances were urged against him by
<hi>Alexander</hi> himself; and this was not the least (not the
least offence indeed against the Kings humour, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to be adored as a God) that when <hi>Alexander</hi> wrote
unto him concerning the title given him by <hi>Jupiter Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
he answered, <hi>That he could not but rejoyce that he was
admitted into the Sacred fellowship of the Gods, and yet he could
not but withall grieve for those which should live under such a
one as would exceed the nature of man.</hi> This, said <hi>Alexander,</hi>
assured me that his heart was estranged, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
my Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philotas</hi> was brought before the multitude to hear the
King<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Oration against him.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Philatas</hi> accused by the King.</note> He was brought forth in vile
Garments, and bound like a Thief, where he heard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56424:25"/>
and his absent Father, the greatest Captain in the
World, accused, and also his two other Brothers, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi>
and <hi>Nicanor,</hi> who had lost their lives in these Wars;
wherewith he was so overcome with grief, that, for a
while, he could utter nothing for tears, and sorrow had
so wasted his Spirits, that he sank between those that led
him. In the end, the King asked him in what Language
he would make his defence? He answered, <hi>In the same
wherein it had pleased the King to accuse him:</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he did, to the end that the <hi>Persians,</hi> as well
as the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> might understand him. But here
of the King made this advantage, perswading the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
that he disdained the language of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and so, withdrawing himself, he left him to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless
enemies.</p>
                  <p>This proceeding of the Kings, <hi>Philotas</hi> greatly lament<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed,
seeing the King, who had so sharply invieghed
against him, would not vouchsafe to hear his answer. For
hereby his enemies were emboldned against him, and all
the rest, having discovered the Kings mind, and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
contended amongst themselves, which of them
should shew the greatest hatred towards him. Amongst
many Arguments which he brought for his own defence,
this was not the least, that when <hi>Nicomachus</hi> desired to
know of <hi>Dimnus,</hi> of what quality, and power his partners
in the conspiracy were, seeming unwilling to adventure
himself amongst mean, and base Companions, <hi>Dimnus</hi>
named unto him, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> of the Kings Bed-Chamber,
<hi>Nicanor, Amyntas,</hi> and some others, but spake not a
word of <hi>Philotas,</hi> who, being Master of the Horse,
would greatly have graced the cause, and encouraged
<hi>Nichomacus.</hi> And to make it more cleer that he knew
nothing of their intents, there was not any one of the
Conspirators, that in their torments, would accuse him.
Yet at the last,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Philotus</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tortured to death.</note> himself being put to extream torments by

                     <hi>Craterus, Cenus, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi>
and others, <hi>Philotas</hi> accused himself, hoping that
they would have slain him immediatly: But he failed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56424:26"/>
even in that miserable hope, and suffering all that could
be inflicted on flesh and blood, he was forced to confess,
not what was true, but what might best please them, who
were far more merciless than Death it self. <hi>Cruelty is not
a humane vice: It is unworthy of man: Its even a beastly rage
to delight in blood and wounds, and casting away the nature of
man, to become a savage Monster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whilst <hi>Alexanders</hi> hands were yet died in blood,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> he
commanded that <hi>Lyncestes,</hi> Son in Law to <hi>Antipater,</hi> who
had been three years in Prison, should be slain. The same
dispatch had all those that were accused by <hi>Nicomachus.</hi>
But <hi>Parmenio</hi> was yet living. <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who had served
with great fidelity, as well <hi>Philip</hi> the Kings Father, as
himself. <hi>Parmenio</hi> that first opened <hi>Alexanders</hi> way into

to look the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in the face. He had formerly
complained of <hi>Darius</hi> for neglecting to defend the Banks
of <hi>Tygris,</hi> and other Passes, and yet now, when this Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
slave had stiled himself a King, he durst not perform
anything worthy of a slave: and therefore they that were
neerest to him, and whom he most trusted, to wit, <hi>Spita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,
Dataphernes, Catanes,</hi> and others, the Commanders
of his Army, moved, both by the care of their own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the remembrance of <hi>Bessus</hi> his Treason and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
against <hi>Darius,</hi>

only his chain was closed about his neck, like a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiff

him to <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Alexander</hi> was arrived at a certain
Town inhabited by <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Miletum,</hi> brought thither
by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> when long before he returned out of <hi>Greece,</hi>
whose children had now almost forgoten their Country

                        <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>elty.</note> These entertained him with great joy: but
he most cruelly put them all to the Sword, and destroyed
their City. At this Place he received <hi>Bessus,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

the Traitor into the hands of <hi>Oxatre,</hi> Brother to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
to be tormented by him.</p>
                  <p>But now when he thought himself most secure, and
out of danger, some twenty thousand Mountainers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
his Camp, in repelling whom, he received a
shot in his legg,<note place="margin">He is wounded.</note> the Arrow head sticking in the flesh,
so that he was faign to be carried in a Horslitter for some
time after.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after he came unto <hi>Maracanda,</hi> judged by

of one of these he received a blow in the neck, which
struck him to the ground, and disabled him from action
many dayes after: In the meane while <hi>Spitamenes</hi> had
recovered <hi>Samareand,</hi> against whom he sent <hi>Menede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
with three thousand Foot, and eight hundred Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>In the heat of these affairs, <hi>Alexander</hi> marched to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56424:27"/>
River <hi>Jaxartes,</hi> that runs between <hi>Sogdiana,</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi>
which he pasted over while <hi>Menedemus</hi> was imployed in
the recovery of <hi>Samarcand.</hi> Upon the Banks of this
River he built an other <hi>Alexandria,</hi> sixty furlongs in
compasse, which he beautified with Houses seventeen
dayes after the walls were built: But the <hi>Scythian</hi> King,
perswading himself that this City was built on purpose
to keep him under,<note place="margin">He builds a City.</note> made some attempts to hinder the
erection of this new City; but being naked of defensive
Armes, he was easily beaten-away, Sixty of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi>
are said to be slain in this conflict, and eleven
hundred wounded, which might easily be done in
passing a great River defended against them by good
Archers. Of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Horses eighteen hundred
were brought into the Camp, and many Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>Whilest <hi>Alexander</hi> was securing himself against those
<hi>Scythians,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Jaxartes,</hi> he received the ill

<hi>Alexander</hi> killed, burned, and laid wast all before him,
not sparing the innocent Children, and so departed,
leaving a new Governour in that Province.</p>
                  <p>To repaire this losse, he received a great supply of
nineteen thousand men out of <hi>Greece, Li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ia,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi>
with all which, and his old Army, he returned towards
the South, and passed the River of <hi>Oxus,</hi> on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
whereof he built six Townes, neer each to other
for their mutuall security. But he found a new up-start
Rebel,<note place="margin">A Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</note> one <hi>Arimazes</hi> (a <hi>Sogdian)</hi> who was followed by
thirty thousand Souldiers, that defended against him a
strong piece of ground on the top of an high and steep
Hill. <hi>Alexander</hi> sought (but in vain) to winne him
with fair words: wherefore he made choise of three
hundred young men, and promised ten Tallents to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56424:28"/>
first, nine to the second, and so proportionably to the
rest, that could find a way to creep to the top there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
This they performed with the losse of thirty two
of their number, and then made a signe to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
that they had accomplished his Commandment. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he sent one <hi>Cophes</hi> to perswade <hi>Arimazes</hi> to yeild
up the place, who, being shewed by <hi>Cophes,</hi> that the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> were already gotten up, he yeilded simply
to <hi>Alexanders</hi> mercy, and was, with all his kindred,
scourged, and Crucified: which punishment they well
deserved for keeping no better a watch in so dangerous a
time. For the place might have been defended against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  </p>
                  <p>After these <hi>Sogdian,</hi> and <hi>Scythian</hi> Wars, <hi>Alexander</hi>
committed the Government of <hi>Samarcand,</hi> and the
Country about it, to <hi>Clytus</hi> whom yet he slew soon after,
for preferring the virtue of <hi>Philip</hi> the Father, before that
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son, or rather because he objected to
the King the death of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and derided the Oracle
of <hi>Hammon:</hi> for therein he touched him to the quick;
his Speech being in publick, and at a drunken Banquet.
<hi>Clytus,</hi> indeed, had deserved as much at the Kings hand
as any man living, having saved his life, which the
King well remembred when he came to himself, and
when it was too late to repent. As <hi>Clytus</hi> in his Cups,
forgat whom he offended, So <hi>Alexander</hi> in his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
forgat whom he slew, for griefe whereof, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
tore his Face, and sorrowed so inordinately, that
had he not been overperswaded by <hi>Calisthenes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> he
would have slain himself. <hi>Drunkenesse both kindles, and
discovers every vice: It removes shame which gives impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to bad attempts. Where Wine gets the mastery, all the
evill, which before lay hidden, breaks out. Drunkennesse
indeed rather discovers vices than makes them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after this, <hi>Spitamenes,</hi> who slew <hi>Bessus,</hi> and
had lately revolted from <hi>Alexander,</hi> was murthered by
his own Wife, and his Head was presented to: <hi>Alexander,
Spitamenes</hi> being thus taken away, the <hi>Dabans</hi> also sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56424:28"/>
upon his fellow conspirator, <hi>Dataphernes,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him up: So that <hi>Alexander</hi> being now freed
from all these petty Rebels, and disposed of the Provinces
that he had quieted, marched on with his Army into
<hi>Gabaza,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dreadfull stormes.</note> where it suffered so much Hunger, Cold,
Lightning, Thunder, and such storms, that in one of
them he lost a thousand men. From hence he invaded
the <hi>Sacans,</hi> and destroyed their Country. Then came
he into the Territories of <hi>Cohortanes,</hi> who submitted
himself to him, and presented him with thirty
beautifull Virgins, amongst whom, <hi>Roxane,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Wife, was one; which, although all the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> stomached, yet none of them durst use
any freedom of speech after the death of <hi>Clytus.</hi> From
hence he directed his course towards <hi>India,</hi> having so
encreased his numbers, as amounted to one hundred and
twenty Thousand Armed men.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while he would needs be honoured as
a God,<note place="margin">His Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. <hi>Calisthenes</hi> speaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</note> whereunto, that he might allure his <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
he implyed two of his parasites, <hi>Hagis,</hi> and <hi>Cleo,</hi>
whom <hi>Calisthenes</hi> opposed. For amongst many other
honest Arguments which he used in the Assembly, he
told <hi>Cleo,</hi> that he thought that <hi>Alexander</hi> would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
the title of a God from his Vassels: That the
opinion of Sanctity, though it did sometimes follow
the Death of those, who in their Life-time had done
the greatest things, yet it never accompanied any one
as yet living in the world: He said, that neither <hi>Hercules,</hi>
nor <hi>Bacchus,</hi> were Deified at a Banquet, and upon
drink (fot this matter was propounded by <hi>Cleo</hi> at a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousing
Feast) but for the more than manly acts preform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them in their Life-time, for which they were in
succeeding Ages numbred amongst the Gods. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
stood behind a partitian, and heard all that was
spoken, waiting but for an opportunity to be revenged
on <hi>Calisthenes,</hi> who being free of speech, honest, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and a lover of the Kings Honour, was yet shortly
after tormented to Death. For upon occasion of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56424:29"/>
made against the King,<note place="margin">And is tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Death.</note> by on <hi>Hermolaus,</hi> and
others, who confessed it, he caused <hi>Calisthenes,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

upon the Rack.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This deed, unworthy of a King, is thus censured by</hi>
Seneca. This <hi>(saith he)</hi> is the eternal crime of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
which no virtue, or felicity of his in War shall ever be able
to blot out. For as often as any man shall say, He slew many
thousands of <hi>Persians,</hi> it will be replyed, He did so, and
he slew <hi>Calisthenes</hi> too. When it shall be said, that he wan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

have outgone all the antient Examples of Captains, and Kings,
none of all his Acts make so much to his Glory as the Death of
<hi>Calisthenes</hi> to his roproach.</p>
                  <p>With the Army before mentioned, of one hundred
twenty thousand Foot and Horse,<note place="margin">He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into <hi>India.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> entred
into the Borders of <hi>India</hi> where such of the Princes as
submitted themselves to him, he entertained lovingly,
the others he enforced, killing man, woman, and child,
where they resisted. He then came before <hi>Nisa,</hi> built
by <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which after a few dayes was rendred to him.
From thence he removed to a Hill at hand, which on
the top had goodly Gardens,<note place="margin">His Feasts to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
                     </note> filled with delicate fruits,

Countries spoiled and abandoned by the Inhabitants,
by reason whereof, victuals failing, he divided his Army.
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> led one part, <hi>Cenon</hi> an other, and himself the
rest. These took in many Towns, whereof that of
greatest fame was <hi>Muzage,</hi> which had in it three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

yeilded to him by <hi>Cleophe</hi> the Queen, to whom he again
restored it. At the Siege of this City he received a wound

After this <hi>Nola</hi> was taken by <hi>Polisperchon;</hi> and a Rock
of Great strength by <hi>Alexander</hi> himself: He wan also a
passage from one <hi>Eryx,</hi> who was slain by his own men and
his Head presented to <hi>Alexander:</hi> This was the summe
of his Actions in those parts, before he came to the
great River <hi>Indus.</hi> And when he came thither, he
found there <hi>Ephestion,</hi> who (being sent before) had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Boats for the transportation of his Army, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Alexanders</hi> arrivall, had prevailed with <hi>Omphis,</hi>
King of that part of the Country, to submit himself to
this great Conqueror. And hereupon soon after <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
coming, <hi>Omphis</hi> presented himself, with all the
strength of his Country, and fifty six Elephants, unto
him; offering him his service, and assistance: He told <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
also that he was an enemy to the two next great
Kings of that part of <hi>India,</hi> named <hi>Abiasares,</hi> and <hi>Porus,</hi>
where with <hi>Alexaender</hi> was not a little pleased, hoping
by this their disunion, to make his own victory by far the
more easy.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Omphis</hi> also presented <hi>Alexander</hi> with a Crown
of Gold, the like did the rest of his Commanders, and
with all,<note place="margin">His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digallity.</note> he gave him eight Talents of Silver coined,
which <hi>Alexander</hi> not only refused, but to shew that he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
Glory, not Gold, he gave <hi>Omphis</hi> a thousand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
of his own Treasure, besides other <hi>Persian</hi> rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abiasares</hi> being informed that <hi>Alexander</hi> had received
his enemy <hi>Omphis</hi> into his protection, he resolved to
make his own Peace also. For, knowing that his own
strength did but equall that of <hi>Omphis,</hi> he thought
it but an ill match, when <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ready
subdued all the greatest Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> should
make himself a party, and head of the quarrell. So
then now <hi>Alexander</hi> had none to stand in his way but

that labour, attending him on the farther bank, with
thirty thousand Foot, ninety Elephants, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

River was half a mile broad, and withall, deep and
swift, It had in it many Islands, amongst which there
was one much overgrown with Wood, and of good ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> sent <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> with a good part of the Army
up the River, shrowding the rest from the sight of <hi>Porus</hi>
under this Island, by this devise, <hi>Porus</hi> being drawn
from the place of his first encamping, set himself down
opposite to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> supposing that the whole Army of
<hi>Alexander</hi> was there, intending to force their passage:
But in the mean while <hi>Alexander</hi> with his men, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the farther shore without resistance, and ordering
his Troops, he advanced towards <hi>Porus,</hi> who at first
imagined them to be <hi>Abiasares</hi> his confederate, come

he sent his Brother <hi>Hagis,</hi> with four thousand
Horse,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> and a hundred armed Chariots to entertain
him. Each Chariot had in it four to fight, and two
to guid it: But they were at this time of little use,
by reason that much raine having falne, the
Fields were so soul that the Horses could hardly
trot.</p>
                  <p>In this fight the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and <hi>Dahans</hi> had <hi>Alexanders</hi>

and Arrows, that the Horses brake their reines, and
overturned the Chariots, and those that were in them.
<hi>Perdiccas</hi> also charged the <hi>Indian</hi> Horsemen, who were
by him forced to recoil. Then did <hi>Porus</hi> moove for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with the Gross of his Army, that his Vantgard,
who were scattered, might retreat into his Reare. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>

<hi>Antigonus,</hi> and <hi>Leonatus</hi> to charge <hi>Porus</hi> his Battel
of Foot, strengthned with Elephants, <hi>Porus</hi> himself
riding upon one of the biggest of them. By these Beasts
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Foot received the greatest damage; but
the Archers and Darters being well guarded with the
long, and strong Pikes of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> so galled
them, that the Elephants being inraged, turned head,
and ran over their own Footmen that followed them.
In the end,<note place="margin">

<hi>Alexander</hi> was more enflamed than ever, to proceed
in his Discoveries and Conquests, yet all his Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
could not prevaile with his Souldiers to adventure

which were more terrible to them, than the greatest
Army that the East could gather. Yet at last they
were overcome by many perswasions to follow him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the South, to discover such parts of the Ocean, as
were neerer at hand, unto which the River <hi>Indus</hi> was
their infallible guid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> seeing it would be no otherwise, devised a
pretty trick by which he hoped to beguil after-ages,<note place="margin">His Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> and
make himself seem greater than he was. For which end
he enlarged his Camp, made greater Trenches, greater
Cabins for Souldiers, greater Hors-stalls, and higher
Mangers than Horses could feed in. Yea, he caused all
furniture both for Men, and Horses, to be made larger
than would serve for use, and scattered these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
and Bridles about his Camp, to be kept as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
and wondred at by those Barbarous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Proportionable unto these he raised up twelve
great Altars to be Monuments of his jorneyes
end.</p>
                  <p>This done, he returned again to the banks of <hi>Ase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines,</hi>
and there determined to build his Fleet, where
<hi>Ausines,</hi> and <hi>Hydaspes</hi> meet; and to testifie by a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Monument, how far he had passed towards the
East,<note place="margin">He builds two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> he built by those Rivers, two Cities: the one he
called <hi>Nicaea,</hi> and the other <hi>Bucephalon,</hi> after the name
of his beloved Horse <hi>Bucephalus.</hi> Heere again he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a new supply of six thousand <hi>Thracian</hi> Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
seven thousand Foot, and from his Leiutenant
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> twenty five thousand Armours, garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Silver, and Gold, which he distributed amongst
his Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56424:31"/>
About these Rivers he wan many Towns,<note place="margin">His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</note> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
great slaughter on those that resisted. Its said,
that besieging a City of the <hi>Oxidracans,</hi> he leaped from the
top of the wall into it, and fought long against all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
till his Souldiers, forcing a Gate, came in to
his rescue. Finally he passed down the River with his
Fleet, at which time news was brought him of a Rebellion
in <hi>Bactria,</hi> and then of the arrivall of a hundred Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
from a King in <hi>India,</hi> who submitted himself
to him. These Ambassadors he Feasted upon a hundred
Beds of Gold, with all the sumptuousness that could be
devised, who soon after their dispatch, returned again,
and presented him with three hundred Horses, and one
hundred and thirty Wagons, and in each of them four
Horses, a thousand Targets, with many other things rare
and rich.</p>
                  <p>Then sailed <hi>Alexander</hi> towards the South, passing
through many obscure Nations, which all yielded to him,
either quietly,<note place="margin">He builds a City.</note> or by force: Amongst these, he built an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<hi>Alexandria.</hi> Of the many places which he took in
his passage, one was called <hi>Samus,</hi> the Inhabitants
whereof fought against him with poisoned Swords, with
one of which, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (afterwards King of <hi>Egypt)</hi> was
wounded, and was cured by an Herb which <hi>Alexander</hi>
dreamed he had seen in the mouth of a Serpent.</p>
                  <p>When he came neer to the out-let of <hi>Indus</hi> (being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the Tides of the Sea) his Gallies on a sudden
were shuffled one against another by the coming of the
Flood, and in the Ebb, they were left on the dry ground,
and on the Sandy banks in the River, wherewith the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> were much amazed: But after he had a few
days observed the course of the Sea, he passed out of the
Rivers mouth some few miles, and then offering Sacrifice
to <hi>Neptune,</hi> he returned; and the better to inform himself,
he sent <hi>Nearchus,</hi> and <hi>Onesicritus</hi> to discover the Coast to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the mouth of <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neer the out-lets of this River,<note place="margin">He wants food.</note> he spent some part of

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56424:32"/>
                     <hi>Gredosia,</hi> in which passage his Army suffered such
misery through the want of food, that of one hundred and
twenty thousand Foot, and twelve thousand Horse,
which he carried into <hi>India,</hi> not a fourth part returned
alive.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Gredosia, Alexander</hi> led his Army into <hi>Caramania,</hi>
and so drawing neer to <hi>Persia,</hi> he gave himself wholly
unto Feasting and Drinking,<note place="margin">His De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bauched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> imitating the Tryumphs of
<hi>Bacchus.</hi> And though this Swinish vice be hateful enough
in it self; Yet it always inflamed this King to cruelty
For (saith <hi>Curtius) the Hangman followed the Feast:</hi> For
<hi>Haspastes,</hi> one of his Provincial Governours, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be slain; so as, <hi>neither did the excess of Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
quallifie his Cruelty, nor his cruelty at all hinder his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While he refreshed his Army in these parts, there
came a new supply to him of five thousand Foot; and a
thousand Horse, which were conducted to him by <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and his fellows, that had been impolyed in the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Parmenio.</hi> Against these murtherers great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
were made by the Deputies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Provinces,<note place="margin">He Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes his Officers.</note> in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
they had commanded; and their offences were proved
to be so outragious, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was perswaded, that,
had they not altogether despaired of his return out of
<hi>India,</hi> they durst not have committed them. All men
were glad of the occasion, remembring the Virtue of him
whom they had slain. The end was, that <hi>Cleander,</hi> and
the other chief, together with six hundred Souldiers,
who had been the instruments of their ravages, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
over to the Hangman; Every one rejoycing that
the wrath of the King was at last powred out upon the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Nearchus,</hi> and <hi>Onesicritus</hi> were now returned from
searching the Coast, and made report of an Island they

Hence (saith <hi>Curtius)</hi> he began unreasonably to shed
blood, and to believe false reports. Indeed, he took the
way to make all men weary of him, and his Government,
seeing tyranny is more dreadfull than all adventures that
can be made against it.</p>

                  <p>Unto this place came to him three thousand young

fled with five thousand Talents, and six thousand

After this there followed a marvellous discontent in his

made many Orations to satisfie them, but all his words
were in vain during the height of their fury; Yet when
their first passions were evaporated, they became more
tractable. And with such as were licenced to depart, he
sent <hi>Craterus,</hi> to whom he gave the Lieutenantship of
<hi>Macedonia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He sends for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly if <hi>Alexander</hi> had not taken counsell of his

alteration, and given <hi>Antipater</hi> some stronger reasons of
his remove, than to imploy him in conducting a new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of men to <hi>Babylon,</hi> the War being now at an end. For
<hi>Antipater</hi> could make no other construction of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,
but that he had a purpose to send him after <hi>Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi>

                  <p>A little before his Death,<note place="margin">His Will.</note> his Friends about him, asked

So that all the Family of <hi>Alexander,</hi> within a few

But when they came about it, they durst not at first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

that it might be no sin unto them being but mortals, to

wherein to carry his Body to the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
was committed to <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> who spent two whole
years in making provision for it, which made <hi>Olympias,</hi>
his Mother, (seeing him lye so long unburied) in great
grief of heart to cry out, and say; <hi>O my Son! Thou that

the Tomb of <hi>Achilles,</hi> he fell a weeping, considering
that <hi>Achilles</hi> had a <hi>Homer</hi> to sing his praises, and to
perpetuate his memory, whereas he had no such Poet
to set forth his Commendations. Also he commanded
that no man should draw his Picture, but <hi>Apelles,</hi> the most
exquisite Painter in the world, and that none should
make his Statue in Brass but <hi>Lycippus,</hi> the most excellent
Workman in that kind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> used to carry his Head on one side
inclining to the left,<note place="margin">Flattery.</note> wherein his Court-Parasites
(to ingratiate themselves with him) imitated him.
One desiring to see his Treasures, and his Jewels,
he bad his Servants shew him, not his Talents of
Gold, and Silver, and such other precious things, but his
Friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56424:35"/>
When he had overcome <hi>Darius,</hi> and gotten possession
of all his Dominions, and Treasures, he began to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into the <hi>Asian</hi> Luxury.<note place="margin">He dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated after his victories.</note> His Chastity and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were turned into Pride, and Lust. He judged his
Country manners, and the Discipline of the former <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi>
Kings too sordid and mean for him. He imitated
the pride of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings, he made him a Crown and
Robs like unto <hi>Darius.</hi> He grew so proud and insolent,
that he suffered his Souldiers to fall down and worship
him like a God. Yea, he comanded his servants, and
slaves to do so. He clothed his Captains and Horse-men
like unto the <hi>Persians,</hi> which though they disliked they
durst not refuse. He gat him three hundred sixty five
Concubines, of the beautifullest virgins that could be found
in <hi>Asia,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings, one of
which lay with him every night. He had his Troops
of <hi>Eunuches,</hi> with Musicians, Jesters, Singing women
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> He spent whole dayes and nights in profuse Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Revelling All which was very offensive to
his old Captains, and Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>When he was a Boy, he took both his hands full of
perfumes, and cast them into the fire as he was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing,
whereupon <hi>Leonidas,</hi> one of his School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters
said to him: <hi>O</hi> Alexander, <hi>wben thou hast Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
those Countries wherein these odors grow, then
thou maist be so liberall, but in the mean time be more spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
Afterwards, when he had Conquered <hi>Arabia Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi>
he sent to <hi>Leonidas</hi> a hundred Tallents of <hi>Myrrhe,</hi>
and five hundred of <hi>Frankincense,</hi> bidding him to
be hereafter more Liberall in his service of the
Gods.</p>
                  <p>He was of so bountifull a disposition,<note place="margin">His boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> that it was a
greater trouble to him not to be asked than not to
give. He wrote to <hi>Phocian,</hi> that he would make use
of his friendship no more if he refused his Gifts. <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi>
a young Boy that used to play at Ball with him,
gat nothing because he asked nothing; whereupon the
next time he played, he threw the Ball to all but <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56424:35"/>
the King marvelling at it, asked him why he
threw not the Ball to him? <hi>Forsooth</hi> (said <hi>Serapion) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you asked it not. Alexander</hi> laughing at the jest, sent
him a liberall Gift.</p>
                  <p>As he was travelling through the Deserts of <hi>Persia,</hi>
himself and his Army were in great straits for want of
water: One of his Souldiers having two Sons ready
to die of thirst, sought up and down, and at last found
a little water, wherewith he filled a leather Bottell, and
was running with it to his Sons: but meeting <hi>Alexander</hi>
by the way, he filled it out into a dish, and profered it
to him. <hi>Alexander</hi> asked him, whither he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
it the man told him that his two Sons were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to die with thirst: <hi>But</hi> (said he) <hi>pray you Sir, do you
drink it; For if my Sons die I can get more, but if you
die, we shall not have such an other King. Alexander</hi> hearing
this, gave him the water again, and bid him carry it to
his Sons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> in his younger dayes was so moderate,<note place="margin">His Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note> and
temperate, that he would often open his chests, and
look upon his Garments, to see if his mother had
not provided him, either delicate or superfluous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell.</p>
                  <p>Also when the Queen of <hi>Caria,</hi> to shew her great love
to him, sent him daily variety of Dishes and Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and at last sent her Cooks, and Bakers to him,
he returned them back again, saying, <hi>That he had no
need of their service; for his Master</hi> Leonidas <hi>had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
him better Cooks, by teaching bim to dine and
sup Frugally, and sparingly.</hi> Also when he had any
rare, and dainty Fruits, or Fishes sent him from
the Sea, he used to distribute them amongst his
Friends, reserving very little or none for his own
use.</p>
                  <p>One craving a small gift of him, he gave him a whole
City, and when the Poor man said, <hi>That it was too much
for him to receive:</hi> Yea (said <hi>Alexander)</hi> but not for me to
give.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56424:36"/>
                     <hi>As he was advanceing to Conquer a Kingdom in</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,
Taxilis, <hi>who was King thereof, came and met him,
saying,</hi> O Alexander, What need we fight, if thou comest not
to take away my food and water, for which its only fit for wise
men to fight? If thou seekest after Riches, if I have more
than thou, I will give thee part of mine: if thou hast
more than I, I will not refuse part of thine. Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>being much taken with his speech, said to
him,</hi> Go to, I will contend with thee in bounty,
<hi>and so they mutually gave and received many Gifts.
At last</hi> Alexander <hi>gave him a Thousand Tallents,
which much grieved his Friends, and rejoyced the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He shewed an admirable Example of his Chastity in
the heat of his youth,<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity.</note> when having taken the Mother,
Wives, and Daughters of <hi>Darius,</hi> women of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
beauty, yet, neither by word, nor deed did he profer
them the least indignity, thinking it a greater honour
to overcome himself than his Adversaries: And when
he looked upon other Captive Ladies that excelled in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and beauty, he merrily said, <hi>Persides oculorum dolores
esse:</hi> That the <hi>Persian</hi> women were a disease of the eyes, and
yet he looked on them but as one so many Statues.
When he was informed that two of his Captains under
<hi>Parmenio,</hi> had ravished two of the <hi>Persian</hi> Ladies, he
wrote to him to enquire after the matter, and if he
found it true, he should cut off their Heads, as of Beasts
born for the hurt of mankind. He also sent him word,
that himself was so far from contemplating the Beaut<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Darius</hi> his Wife, that he would not so much as suffer
her to be commended in his presence; and that he was
so carefull of their Chastity, that they lived in his
Camp, shut up in their Tent, as if they had been in a
Temple.</p>
                  <p>At the Death of <hi>Ephestion,</hi> his Favourite, he did not
only clipp the haire of his Horses, and Mules, but
plucked down also the Battlements of the City walls,
that they might seeme to mourne for his Mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56424:36"/>
shewing now deformity instead of their former Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Porus,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> King, fighting valiently against him,
received many wounds, and at last, being overcome,
and falling into his enemies hands, they brought him
to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who hearing of his coming, went forth,
with some of his Friends, to meet him, and asked him
what he would have him to do for him, <hi>Porus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>My only desire is, that thou use me like a King:
Alexander,</hi> admiring his magnimity, replyed, <hi>This I
will do for my own sake: but what wouldest thou have me
doe for thine? Porus</hi> answered, <hi>That all was contained
in his former demand of Kingly usage: Alexander</hi> was so
pleased with this, that he restored him to his Kingdom,
and gave him an other bigger than his own.</p>

and by their joynt consents, divide the Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
his two Sons <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Caroloman,</hi> by equal porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Brothers these were of divers humors, who had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ruined each other by this equality of power, had not
the death of <hi>Caroloman,</hi> within three years after, divolved
the Goverment of the whole Realm upon <hi>Charles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> was endowed with singular gifts both of Body
and Mind,<note place="margin">His Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which were much improved by the sedulous care
of his Prudent Father, manifested in the virtuous education
of him: For which end he procured <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Pisa,</hi> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man, to instruct him in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues,
and one <hi>Aymon</hi> to read to him <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:</hi>
Himself also trained him up in Feates of Armes, and
Warlike exercises. But above all, and as the ground of all
virtues, he was carefull to have him trained up, and well
instructed in Religion, which all his life after he loved, and
honored with great Reverence the Church and Pastors
thereof. He called the study of Humane Sciences his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes,
and the companions of his Sword, and did sometimes
recreate himself therein. He loved Learning and Learned
men by Nature. He delighted in <hi>Poesy,</hi> as some of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
do shew; but especially in <hi>History,</hi> wherein he was
exceeding well read. Charity, Temperance, Equity, care
of Justice to releive his Subjects, to keep his Faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
both to Friend and Foe, and to use a Victory modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
were the notable effects of his excellent knowledge, as
remarkable in him as in any Prince that ever lived. The
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56424:39"/>
Universities of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Pisa</hi> (either Founded, or endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him) witnesse the great love and honour that he did
bear to learning.</p>
                  <p>During the Life of his Father <hi>Pepin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Valour and other vertues.</note> he shewed how much
he had profited in Armes under so good a Schoolmaster, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
great Commands under him, which he discharged with
notable reputation; and the improvement of his skill and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
after he came to his Kingdom, shew plainly, that there
was never any Soldier that carried Sword with more valour,
nor great Captain that commanded with more Obedience,
or that performed Noble Actions with greater successe, or
that used his Victories with more mildnesse, and judgment.
Neither did ever King or Prince rule with more authority,
nor was more reverently obeyed by his Subjects and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
then our <hi>Charles;</hi> who therefore well deserved the name
of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> or <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> by reason of his great
virtues. He was of a lively disposition, quick, active, and
vehement: <hi>Quicquid egit, valdè egit:</hi> Yet modesty, and
wisdom did so season, and moderate his vivacity, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
as gave a great lustre to both, and kept them within
their due bounds: And this mixture of divers humors so
tempered with moderation, made him as admirable for
his Judgment, as venerable in his Person and countenance.</p>
                  <p>There appeared in him a grave,<note place="margin">His Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> sweet Majesty in a goodly
Personage: His Body was large and strong: He was very
patient of labour: Had a quick spirit, was cleer and sound,
both in apprehension, memory, and Judgment: Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
never failed him in difficulties, nor a Reply in Discourses.
Terrible he was to some, Amiable to others, according to
the Cause, Persons, and Occurents; which virtues purchased
him such great esteem, as that he was beloved, respected,
and reverenced of all men, which effects the story of his
raign will shew: For having received a great Kingdom from
his Father, he enlarged it with wonderfull successe; God
having raised him up to be a Bulwork to Christians against
the inundation and rage of Barbarous Nations in the decay
and ruin of the Empire. And in prosecuting the Narrative
hereof, I shall first set down his actions during the Life of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56424:40"/>
his Brother <hi>Caroloman,</hi> then what he did from the time
of his death, till he was made Emperor, and lastly what his
Deportment was from thence to his Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caroloman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Carolomans</hi> envy.</note> being Crowned King at <hi>Soissons,</hi> as <hi>Charles</hi>
was at <hi>Wormes,</hi> began to be extream jealous of his Brothers
greatnesse, whom, with grief, he saw to be beloved, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and obeyed by all the <hi>French,</hi> and that deservedly for
his singular virtues and endowments both of Body and mind.
This jealousie (too ordinary a concomitant of Princes) made
him seek by all meanes to undermine, and overthrow the
affairs of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> whose eyes were fixed upon <hi>Italy,</hi>
as the fittest, and most glorious <hi>Theatre</hi> wherein to exercise
his valour, and to maintain his authority and power amongst
Christians; and <hi>Caroloman</hi> did all that possibly he could to
cross his designes therein. But before I bring him upon
that stage, give me leave to shew you what at this time was
the State of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> (sometimes the Head of the World) was of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the <hi>Chaos</hi> of all confusion,<note place="margin">The State of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </note> the Randevouz of all Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations, as if they had vowed the ruine thereof by
turnes, having already sackt it three times. For under the
Empire of <hi>Honorius, Anno Christi 414.</hi> The <hi>Goths,</hi> under
their King <hi>Alaricus,</hi> after two years seige, took it, and
sackt it, but did not dismantle it. Forty five years after, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Empire of <hi>Martian, Anno Christi 459.</hi> the <hi>Vandales,</hi>
under the conduct of <hi>Genserick</hi> their King, took it again, sackt
it, spoiled and disgraced it, leading the W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, away in Triumph. And in the
time of <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperor, the <hi>Goths,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Totila,</hi> having weakned it by a long seige, took
it, sackt, and dismantled it. Thus <hi>Rome</hi> was no more <hi>Rome,</hi>
but a spectacle of horrid confusion: after so many devastati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
retaining nothing of her antient beauty, but only the
traces of her old buildings, and the punishment of her Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and Tyranny; Afterwards the <hi>Longobards,</hi> or <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi>
held <hi>Italy,</hi> for the space of two hundred years, till by our
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> they were subdued, and expelled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56424:40"/>
Presently after the Death of <hi>Pepin,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
fell into great confusions by the practices of <hi>Didier</hi> King of
<hi>Lombardy,</hi> who having corrupted some of the Clergy, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Constantine,</hi> Brother to <hi>Toton,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nepezo,</hi> to be
chosen Pope,<note place="margin">Severall Popes cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.</note> which he persecuted with such violence, that
he procured <hi>Philippicus,</hi> who was already Canonically cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
to be deposed: But the better party, seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
contemned by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> assembled together,
and by common consent, chose <hi>Steven</hi> the third (a <hi>Sicilian</hi>
by birth) Pope; who being conscious to his own weaknesse,
resolved to call in the King of <hi>France,</hi> and to oppose him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his too-powerfull enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> being thus sollicited by the Pope, sent twelve
Prelates speedily to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might strengthen the
Popes party against the other, intending in a greater need
to apply a greater remedy; and the matter succeeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But <hi>Didier</hi> would not rest satisfied with this affront, and
seeing that force had succeeded no better, he resolved to try
Policy, intending to undermine <hi>Steven</hi> with fair pretences:
For which end he sent to congratulate his Election, purged
himself in reference to the Anti-Pope <hi>Constantine,</hi>

this his good meaning, he desired him to be pleased
with his repair to <hi>Rome,</hi> that there he might confer with him
in private. The Pope (who never seeks to the <hi>French</hi> but
in case of necessity) was easily perswaded by <hi>Didier,</hi> who
came to <hi>Rome,</hi> conferred with the Pope, and made great
Protestations of his Obedience to him. But these his faire
shewes continued not long.</p>
                  <p>There was at this time at <hi>Rome</hi> a Governour for the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne

where there arose a perilous Warre upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>Though the Country of <hi>Guienne</hi> depended upon the Crown

                     </note> yet were there many Tumults raised by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of some Noblemen of the Countrey, who frequently
stirred up the people (mutinous enough of themselves) to
Rebellion. The cause of these Troubles was, the abuse of
the former Kings Clemency and Bounty, who suffered such
people as he Conquered, to enjoy their priviledges and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Guienne</hi> was a part of <hi>Charles</hi> his portion: But <hi>Hunalts</hi>
design was, to withdraw that Country wholly from the
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and for that end he pretended a Title to
the Dukedom thereof, labouring to procure the people to
Elect him, having the promise, and assistance of <hi>Caroloman</hi>
to further him therein. Indeed the countenance of <hi>Carolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
could do much; but the wisdome and courage of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne</hi>
prevailed more: For being advertised of <hi>Hunalts</hi>
practice, and of his Brothers secret designes, he armed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56424:41"/>

not daring to refuse, delivered up <hi>Hunalt,</hi> and all his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that obeyed him; thus ending a dangerous Warre without

                  <p>
                     <hi>Caroloman</hi> seeing his practices against his Brother to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

entertained by <hi>Didier</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> where <hi>Berthe</hi>

of her present condition, and thrust headlong with a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of revenge against her Brother in Law, <hi>Charles)</hi> retired
with her two Sons to <hi>Didier,</hi> King of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> as to the
most bitter, and irreconcilable enemy of her Brother <hi>Charles.
Didier</hi> intertained her and her Children very curteously,
hoping by them to promote his design: But it proved the
leaven of his own destruction. His practice (together with
the Widdows) was to procure the present Pope, who <hi>(Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

by this meanes to bring the Pope in disgrace with <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne,</hi>
that he might the easilier suppresse him, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of the <hi>French</hi> aides, whereon he chiefly relyed; and

in it.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Didier</hi> therefore earnestly besought the Pope to grant
this favour to the Sons of <hi>Caroloman</hi> for his sake: But
<hi>Adrian</hi> (well acquainted with the <hi>Lombards</hi> humour) was
so resolute in denying his request, as that they fell into open
hatred. And <hi>Didier</hi> being much displeased with this repulse,
took Armes, and with his Forces entred into the <hi>Exarchy,</hi>
being a <hi>Signory</hi> under the Popes jurisdiction,<note place="margin">He makes Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pope.</note> and besieged
<hi>Ravenna,</hi> the chief City of the <hi>Exarchie:</hi> Whereupon the Pope
sent his Nuncio to him, to expostulate the cause of this so
sudden War against his Subjects; desiring him to restore
what he had taken, and not to proceed in this Hostile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
without any reasonable cause, and that upon the pain
of <hi>Excommunication.</hi>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:56424:42"/>
At the same time there fell out a great occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the hatred between <hi>Charlemagne</hi> and <hi>Didier:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hunalts</hi> ingratitude</note> For
that <hi>Hunalt</hi> (who had bin before vanquished in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and
to whom <hi>Charles</hi> had shew'd so much favor) very ingratefully
retir'd himself to <hi>Didier,</hi> who did not only receive him courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
but honored him by making him Generall of his Army

to be so far abused by the insinuations, and perswasions of
<hi>Hunalt,</hi> touching the meanes to attempt something against
the Estates of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> that holding <hi>Italy</hi> undoubtedly
for his own, he plotted a War, and assured himself of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
victory in <hi>France.</hi> Thus Ambition and Covetousnesse
hasten mens ruine. The Pope having no other defence to
secure his Estate but his <hi>Excommunication,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Pope sends to <hi>Charles</hi> for aid.</note> which against <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi>
proved but <hi>Brutum fulmen,</hi> a meer scarecrow, he was

Anchor, or last Hope, intreating speedy aide from him in

Arme against <hi>Didier,</hi> who had alwayes crossed his affairs;
fed and fomented his Brothers jealousies, entertained his
Widdow, and Children, and laboured to have them chosen
Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and all to trouble or ruin his estate. He had
also received his rebellious Subjects, and with their aid, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed
to make a War against him.</p>

                     </note> and request also of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
was a great incentive to induce him to Arm, against him, who
professed himself to be an open enemy to the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
whereof the former Kings of <hi>France</hi> had shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Protectors,</hi> and <hi>Guardians.</hi> But that he might not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing rashly, he first sent his Ambassadors to the
Pope, to assure him of his good will, and promising not to
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> wanting to him in his necessitie: Yet withall, to tell him,
that he thought it best, first to use mildnesse, before he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
force against the <hi>Lombard.</hi> He therefore sent also his
Ambassadors to <hi>Didier</hi> to summon him to restore what he had
taken from the Pope, and to suffer him to live in Peace. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi>
(who relied much upon his Policy) gave good words to
the Ambassadors, promising them to perform all that <hi>Charles</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56424:43"/>
required, but in effect, he would have the Pope to accept
of conditions of Peace from him, and that the Children of
<hi>Caroloman</hi> should be declared Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These demands were judged so unreasonable, that the
Treaty was broken, and the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors returned
home: And <hi>Didier</hi> prosecutes his War against the Church
more eagerly then he did before;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Didier</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spers in his Wars.</note> and having spoiled all the

Campagnia,</hi> and <hi>Romandiola,</hi> Towns of the six Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or <hi>Hexarchy. Charlemagnes</hi> Ambassadors, upon
their return, inform their Master, that the War with the
<hi>Lombard</hi> could not be avoided: and they found <hi>Charles</hi> in
a Posture fit to invade <hi>Italy:</hi> For he had Levyed a goodly
Army to suppresse the rebellious <hi>Saxons,</hi> who (impatient
of the <hi>French</hi> yoke) revolted daily from his Obedience,
which Army was now ready to be imployed against the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet was not <hi>Charlemagne</hi> willing to attempt any thing in

                        <hi>Charles</hi> calls a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note>
and therefore he presently summoned a Parliament, and
(being loath to lose time) in the mean season he caused his
Army to March, and to make there <hi>Rendevouz</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> (a
Town under his Obedience, and in the way to <hi>Italy)</hi> and
having divided his Army into two Parts, he seized upon
the Passages of Mount-<hi>Cenis,</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> which are the
two entrances from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Estates at their meeting having found the Causes of

                     <note place="margin">Enters <hi>Italy,</hi> and beates <hi>Didier.</hi>
                     </note> King of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> to be just, <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne</hi>
caused his Army to advance with all speed, and to

him Battel: But at the first encounter he was vanquished
by <hi>Charlemagne.</hi> After which, the <hi>Lombard</hi> rallying, and
reenforcing his Army, fights him again, and was again bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and so shattered were his Troops, that he was enforced
to suffer his Enemy to be Master of the Field; which proved
an infallible Harbinger to his totall Ruine. Thus having
tumultuously trussed up what he could in such haste, he sent
his Son <hi>Aldegise</hi> to <hi>Verona,</hi> with the Widdow and Children
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56424:43"/>
of <hi>Caroloman:</hi> and cast himself into <hi>Pavia,</hi> which he had
diligently Fortified, as the Fortress, or Dungeon rather of his
last Fortune.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> pursues him at the heels,<note place="margin">Charles <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieges</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, <hi>&amp;</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona.</note> and with all his
Forces besieged him in <hi>Pavia,</hi> resolving to have it at what
price soever. And to make his resolution the more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
he sent for his Wife and Children into <hi>Italy,</hi> to the end
that the <hi>Italians</hi> (who hitherto were doubtfull to whom to
adhere) might know his mind, and without attending any
new occurrents, might resolve to obey the Victor.</p>
                  <p>Having thus cooped up <hi>Didier</hi> in <hi>Pavia,</hi> and seised upon
all the avenues, he resolved to attempt <hi>Verona</hi> also, which
they held to be the strongest place in all <hi>Lombardy.</hi> So lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Uncle <hi>Bernard</hi> to continue the siege of <hi>Pavia,</hi> he
marched with part of his Army to <hi>Verona.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His beginnings being so succesfull,<note place="margin">The <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> submit to him.</note> and this Check given
to <hi>Didier,</hi> (who was now, as it were, shut up in Prison,)
gave a great alteration to the affaires of either party amongst
these people of diverse humours. The <hi>Spoletines,</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
and those of <hi>Ancona,</hi> of <hi>Fermo,</hi> and of <hi>Ossino</hi> (stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

and detested the wretched, and forlorn estate of
<hi>Didier,</hi> as a worthy reward of his Treachery, Injustice, and
Violence. The <hi>Venetians</hi> (who were <hi>Neuters,</hi> and specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and had never dealt in any sort with
<hi>Didier)</hi> offered amity and succours to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
them to keep the Seas quiet, lest the Emperor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> should espouse <hi>Didiers</hi> quarrel, and cause any new
disturbance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> staid not long about <hi>Verona</hi> before the City
began to think of yielding: and <hi>Berthe,</hi> the Widdow of
<hi>Caroloman,</hi> was the chief Instrument to draw them to a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
the <hi>French</hi> Forces being (as she said) very formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.
<hi>Aldegise,</hi> the Son of <hi>Didier,</hi> seeing the Citizens
so unanimous in their resolutions to open their Gates to the
Conqueror, and being unable to relieve his Father, he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
stole away, and fled to the Emperor of <hi>Corstantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
Then did <hi>Verona</hi> yeild to <hi>Charlemagne</hi> upon composition,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verona</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</note>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:56424:44"/>
who received both the Inhabitants, and <hi>Berthe</hi> to mercy,
keeping his agreement punctually with them; upon <hi>Berthe</hi> &amp;
her Children, he inflicted no punishment; but only blamed
them for their uncivil rashness, and enjoyned them to return
into <hi>France,</hi> there to do better, and to live more honorably.
This being about <hi>Easter, Charlemagne</hi> took the oportunity
to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> where yet he staied only eight dayes to visit
the most remarkable places, and to confet with Pope <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
The Pope made <hi>Charles</hi> a <hi>Patrician</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
was a step to mount him to the <hi>Empire.</hi> From thence he
hasted, and came to <hi>Pavia,</hi> which had now been besieged
for the space of ten moneths: and being pressed by Warre
without, and by the Famine, and Pestilence within, it at
last yeilded upon composition: and <hi>Didier</hi> (who had hated
<hi>Charles</hi> without cause,<note place="margin">And <hi>Pavia.</hi>
                     </note> and attempted War rashly) fell into
his enemies hands, who yet shewed himself Prudent in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
the War, and mild and modest in his use of the

Christi 776.</hi> A notable date to present the <hi>Tragicall</hi> end
of so great a Kingdom, which had continued in <hi>Italy</hi> for the
space of two hundred and four years under Princes of diverse
dispositions. But Pride, Injustice and Tyranny, had provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the wrath of God against them, so as whilst they thought
to take from another, they lost their own; To usurp the
liberties of others, they fell into ignominious slavery them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and their subtilty proved the occasion, and hastener
of their ruine. An excellent Pattern for Princes and great
States not to attempt an unjust and unnecessary War, nor to
usurp upon any other mans right, thinking to prevail over a
good cause by Craft and Policy.</p>
                  <p>

gave great content to all the <hi>Italians,</hi> who held it a gain to
have lost their old Master, &amp; to be rightly made free by being
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56424:44"/>
subject to so wise a Lord. For he left unto them their ancient
liberties, and to particular Princes (such as were Vassalls to
<hi>Didier)</hi> their <hi>Signeories.</hi> To <hi>Aragise,</hi> Son in Law to <hi>Didier,</hi>
he left the Marquisat of <hi>Beneventum.</hi> He placed <hi>French</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
in Conquered <hi>Lombardy,</hi> whom he ordered to treat
these his new Subjects with the like mildnesse, as he shewed
to those of his antient Patrimony left unto him by his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>

                  <p>No sooner was <hi>Charlemagne</hi> returned into <hi>France,</hi>

the practises of <hi>Rogand,</hi> to whom <hi>Charlemagne</hi> had given

Thus <hi>Italy</hi> remaining quiet to him, and his, (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered

                  <p>But the end of this War proved the beginning of another

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Charles</hi> his Wars with the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                     </note> whereof the <hi>Saxons</hi> were the chief promoters,
drawing other People of <hi>Germany</hi> in to their assistance. This
War continued the space of thirty years, yet not without
some intermissions: The <hi>Saxons</hi> having still a mind to oppose
and Cross <hi>Charlemagne</hi> in his proceedings, especially when he
was busied in other affaires of great consequence.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Saxons</hi> were subject to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
under <hi>Martel,</hi> and <hi>Pepin</hi> his Son. The motives of
this War were diverse: The impatiency of a People desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56424:45"/>
their antient liberty,<note place="margin">The cause of it.</note> and not able to bear subjection to
a forreigner: the hatred &amp; jealousie of a Potent neighbour,
threatning them with servitude: A controversie about the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
and bounds of their Lands: But the greatest, and most
important cause was, the diversity of Religion: For the
<hi>Saxons</hi> were obstinate in retaining and cleaving to their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
superstition, which they had received from their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
and <hi>Charlemagne</hi> urged them to forsake their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme,</hi>
and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and to make open profession of the
Christian Faith; being moved with Zeal to the general ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Truth, and the private Duty of a Prince
to his subjects, to provide for their soules health. Upon this
controversie about Religion the <hi>Saxons</hi> fought eight times
with <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> especially taking advantage when they
found him busied elsewhere, watching their oportunities ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to cross him in his designes, or to frustrate his attempts.
At such time as he was in <hi>Italy</hi> against <hi>Didier,</hi> they played
<hi>Rex,</hi> not only in rejecting the <hi>French</hi> command, but also
in making War against those Cities in <hi>Germany</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
<hi>Charlemagne.</hi> They had taken <hi>Eresbourg</hi> from the
Crown of <hi>France</hi> even upon his return, and besieged <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisbourg,</hi>
robbing, and spoiling all the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> (who would never undertake any weighty
matter without good advise) assembled a Parliament at
<hi>Wormes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Charles</hi> calls a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> and by their Counsel and assistance, levied a great
Army, to Charge the <hi>Saxons</hi> in diverse places at once. This
resolution succeeded happily: For having vanquished the
<hi>Saxons</hi> twice in one moneth in a pitched Field, he soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
them to their antient obedience: Using his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with much modesty and discretion; desiring rather to
shew them the power of his authority, then the rigour of
his force.<note place="margin">The <hi>Saxons</hi> overcome.</note> The chief amongst the <hi>Saxons</hi> was <hi>Widichind,</hi>
and as Religion was the chief motive of their frequent Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions;
so <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> seeking the establishment of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion in <hi>Saxony</hi> with great Zeal, after much relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance,
happily effected it. For having vanquished this
<hi>Widichind,</hi> by reason and humanity, he brought him to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56424:45"/>
knowledge of the Truth;<note place="margin">And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</note> and by his grave and prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
he perswaded him without any Violence, to leave
and forsake his <hi>Pagan</hi> superstition, which force of Armes
could never have effected in him, nor in the <hi>Saxons. For
mens soules are not be compelled with force of Armes, but with
reason.</hi> And by the meanes and endeavours of this <hi>Widichine,</hi>
the greatest part of the <hi>Saxons</hi> were brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true God, and the obedience of the <hi>French</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:
And the most obstinate were forced, either to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
or to abandon their Country. And indeed great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of <hi>Saxons</hi> retired themselves into divers strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes.</p>
                  <p>Thus the War with the <hi>Saxons</hi> was happily ended (which
had been long &amp; dangerous) and the Conquered, by the Truth
were the true Conquerors, by attaining to the knowledge
of the true God. <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was very carefull to have
them well instructed in the Truth: For which end he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
godly and learned men in all places, and gave them
honourable maintenance, whereby he shewed that his Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was not inferior to his Valour, and happy successe; and
for a president to Princes to make Religion the Soveraign
end of their Armes and Authorities.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Widichind</hi> was very eminent, both for Wisdome,
Valour, and Authority in his Country; and from him are
descended many famous Families: as the two <hi>Henries,</hi> the
one called the <hi>Fowler,</hi> and the other of <hi>Bamberg;</hi> and the
two <hi>Othos,</hi> all of them Emperors: as also the Dukes of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi>
the Marquesses of <hi>Misnia,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
the famous race of <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this War of <hi>Saxony</hi> did spring up many others in the
Northen parts, of which we shall hear afterwards; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> which (like a Deluge) threatned to over-run all

who sought to enlarge the limits of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy by

upon lighter grounds, so was it, more painfull, more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and lesse successefull then that of <hi>Italy,</hi> whereunto
necessity and Duty had drawn <hi>Charlemagne;</hi> yet did his
wise and wary proceeding in the action, warrant him from
all blame. The occasions wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Forces against the <hi>Sarazins</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> were, the assurance of
good successe, the quiet and peace of his Realme, that he
might have opportunity to imploy his Souldiery, the hate of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> against the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> and the generall fear of
all Christians, least these Caterpillers should creep further
into <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the estate of <hi>Spain</hi> at this time. The <hi>Sarazins</hi>
had conquered a great part of it, and were divided under
diverse Commands which had the Title of Kingdoms. Yet
these diverse Kings (being apprehensive of their common
danger) resolved to unite their forces against <hi>Charlemagne,</hi>
their common enemy; and foreseeing the Tempest, they
sought to prevent it, and to cross the designes of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne:</hi>
For which end, they suborned King <hi>Idnabala,</hi> a
<hi>Sarazin,</hi> being a very subtile, and crafty man, to insinuate
himself into the acquaintance, and familiarity of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi>
which stratagem prevailed more then all their Power and
Forces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was much quickned to this War by <hi>Alphonso,</hi>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56424:46"/>
concluded a War against the <hi>Sarazins</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> The army
which he imployed in this action was very great, both for
number of men, and Valour of Commanders, and Cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
being the most choise and worthy Captaines in all
<hi>Christendom:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> amongst whom, these were of chiefest note,

Sister to <hi>Charlemagne; Renald</hi> of <hi>Montaubon.</hi> The
four Sons of <hi>Aymon: Oger</hi> the <hi>Dane: Oliver,</hi> Earl of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va:
Arnold</hi> of <hi>Belland: Brabin,</hi> and many others. The
Valour of which persons hath been fabulously related by
the Writers of those dark times (who for the most part were
<hi>Friers,</hi> concerning whom the Proverb was, a <hi>Fryer, a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,)</hi>
with the addition of a thousand ridiculous Tales, so
that the truth is hardly picked out from the midst of so much
error: Yet what is most probable, and can be gathered out
of the most authentick Authors shall be here set down. They
say, that <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> to make this undertaking more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
in shew, did at this time institute the <hi>Order of the
twelve Peers of France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> being entred into <hi>Spain</hi> with his brave Army,<note place="margin">His entry into <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </note>
found no object for them whereon to exercise their Valour:
For the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> resolving to make a defensive, rather
then an offensive War, had withdrawn themselves into their
Cities, which they had fortified strongly. The most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
of the <hi>Sarazin</hi> Kings at this time, were <hi>Aigoland,
Bellingan, Dmises, Marsile,</hi> and <hi>Idnabala:</hi> But this last, as
was said before, made shew of much friendship to <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne,</hi>
and of open hatred against the other <hi>Sarazin</hi> Kings;
with whom notwithstanding he held secret and strickt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
to betray <hi>Charlemagne</hi> unto them.</p>
                  <p>The first City that the <hi>French</hi> attempted was <hi>Pampelune,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pampelune</hi> taken.</note>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Navarr,</hi> the which they took by force,
but with much paines, danger, and losse. Having sackt this
City, and put all the <hi>Sarazins</hi> in it to the sword, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to <hi>Saragoce,</hi> which yielded to them upon composition,
as did also many other small Townes, being terrified with
the example of <hi>Pampelune.</hi> This prosperous beginning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> to advance forward, relying on his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56424:47"/>
wonted Fortune and good successe: But as he passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Provinces of <hi>Spain,</hi> like a Victorious Prince, without
any opposition, he divided his Army, and gave part of it
to be conducted by <hi>Milon</hi> of <hi>Angers,</hi> his Brother in Law,
who in his March near unto <hi>Bayon,</hi> was set upon by <hi>Aigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the <hi>Sarazin</hi> King, who in this common danger had
thrust an army into the Field,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Milon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</note> and now assaulted <hi>Milon,</hi> and
his Troops, little expecting any enemy, and took him at
such an advantage, as he defeated him.</p>
                  <p>This losse was very great: For Writers say that forty
thousand of the <hi>French</hi> here lost their lives; <hi>Milon</hi> himselfe
being also slain for a confirmation of the <hi>Sarazins</hi> Victory.
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> was at this time afar off, and so notable by any
diligence to prevent the losse. Yet he suppressed his grief
and trouble, least he should discourage the whole Army:
and so hastning thitherward, he gathered up the remainder
of those broken, and dispersed Troops, withall, keeping
the Conquered Cities, and such as were Friends in their due
Obedience: But after this there fell out another acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aigoland</hi> being puffed up with Pride through his late Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,<note place="margin">Aigoland <hi>entred</hi> France.</note>
marched with his Army into <hi>Gascoine,</hi> and besieged
<hi>Agen,</hi> to divert <hi>Charlemagne</hi> from his pursuit, and to draw
him home to defend his own Country.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Charles</hi> returnes.</note> So as <hi>Charlemagne,</hi>
fearing least his own absence, and the <hi>Sarazins</hi> late Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
should cause any alteration in the minds of them of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
being then Subjects of whom he had no great assurance,
he returned into <hi>France. Aigoland</hi> had now continued some
moneths at the siege of <hi>Agen,</hi> yet had prevailed little, but
only in over-runing the Country, which he did freely (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any considerable resistance) even unto <hi>Xaintonge:</hi> the
Country-men in the mean time retiring into the Walled
Townes, expected the return of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> their King:
<hi>Aigolands</hi> Army was very great, and puffed up with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of their late Victory: So as <hi>Charlemagne</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his Forces from <hi>Spain</hi> well tired, he maintained his
Countries more through his authority, then by present force;
yet did he give life to the courage of his Subjects with his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56424:47"/>
presence, and bridled the proud <hi>Sarazin,</hi> who could not
be ignorant with whom he had to deal, nor where he was,
being environed with the enemies on all sides, and in an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Country.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Aigoland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aigolans</hi> Policy.</note> pretending an inclination unto peace,
gave <hi>Charlemagne</hi> to understand that he had been the first
Invader, and that his own comming into <hi>France</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to draw his enemy out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to cause him to
leave to the <hi>Sarazins</hi> their conquered Countries free: and
therefore (said he) the Treaty of an accord is easy,
seeing all the question is only to leave to every man his
own, and to suffer him to enjoy it quietly, the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wide enough for us all. But to the end this Treaty
might take good effect, after many messages to and fro,
they resolve to come to a Parlee: and upon <hi>Charlemagnes</hi>
Faith given, <hi>Aigoland</hi> came to his Camp.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> either really moved with a Zeal for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or at least, making it the colour of his Actions, gave
the <hi>Sarazin</hi> to understand, that he should have his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
if he would leave his <hi>Pagan</hi> Superstition, be Baptised,
and make open profession of Christianity. The <hi>Sarazin,</hi>
although he had a goodly Army, yet not willing to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
any thing, and content with his former revenge upon
<hi>Charlemagne,</hi> desired nothing more then to return quietly
into <hi>Spaine.</hi> And being now in the middest of his enemies
Camp, to maintain his reputation, he made no shew at all
of fear, but talking to his own advantage (as if no force,
but only reason should move him) he entred into a serious
and cunning discourse with <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> shewing, That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
Wars were the ruin of mankind, and that he was
grieved to see so much Blood spilt: That he had not begun,
but followed, being urged by necessity to defend himself
and his Country against the Forces of <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> That
he was not yet so dejected, nor his Forces so weak as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
the Battel: But for that it would be an infinite losse to
hazard the lives of so many men, he desired rather to make
tryal of the right by some Troops, and they that vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
should be deemed to have the right, and true Religion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56424:48"/>
on their side: Protesting to yeild to that Religion which
should appear to be best upon this tryal. This Proposal,
and condition was accepted by <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
was fought, the proof made, and the Christian Troop

a Christian, but in heart he had no such meaning, and
therefore took this opportunity to fly from his promise. He
gives <hi>Charlemagne</hi> a visit, and finds him at the Table, well
accompanyed with his chief followers, (for then it was the
Custome of Kings not sit, and eat alone) but, casting his eye
aside, he saw twelve poor men ill apparelled, sitting upon the
ground, near to the Table of the Noblemen; and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
what those poor, miserable Creatures were which did
there feed apart: One answered, <hi>That they were the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God:</hi> He then replyed, <hi>surely your God is of small
account, whose servants are so miserable, and contemptible:</hi>
And thereupon takes an occasion to retire himself, having
lost nothing, but made great advantage by this Treaty:
Having hereby qualified the force of <hi>Charlemaegne,</hi> viewed
his Army, made shew of his own Courage and dexterity,

the <hi>Sarazin</hi> (who had free accesse into the Camp) to make
a motion of Peace. He was a good Secretary of his own

of himself. <hi>Charlemagne</hi> (finding by his late experience that
the event of Warre is uncertain and doubtfull, and that
this War tended to the loss of his Subjects, who imployed
both their lives and goods for the purchass of an uncertain
Victory, and seeing himself overburdened with great affairs
in his other Estates, to the preservation whereof reason did
summon him rather then to seek for new) he seemed not

him that he found the <hi>Sarazins</hi> affaires to be so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
that they would be glad to embrace his friendship at
whatsoever rate they purchased it. The Treaty hereupon
began, and the cheif Article was propounded, which was,
that they should embrace the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, and this
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> seemed to urge with great vehemency: but
finding the <hi>Sarazins</hi> obstinate in their refusall, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to grant them peace, paying him some great summs
of money, as a token that they had been vanquished by him.</p>

to make such a Composition and agreement, which in shew,
was very honorable for <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> to whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to pay (as an Homage, and acknowledgment for the

appoint, and that thereupon he should retire with his Army

                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

what he had designed: and he left his Nephew <hi>Rowland</hi>
only with twenty thousand men, to see the conditions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
And to make his passage into <hi>France</hi> the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
he commanded him to lodge in a place of advantage, in
the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountaines, called <hi>Roncevaux:</hi> and so the
<hi>French</hi> Army marched backwards to <hi>France,</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

                  <p>Whilst the <hi>French</hi> Army were upon their retreat, <hi>Marsile</hi>

had no fear of an Enemy, when as returning to his Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56424:49"/>
he was suddenly set upon by the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> who were

themselves valiantly against those miscreants: But

endeavoured to break his good Sword <hi>Durandall,</hi>

The seat of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,<note place="margin">The State of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> since the time of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the great, remained at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a City of <hi>Thrace,</hi>
situated in a convenient place for the guard of the Easterne
Provinces: After which, all the West being full of new Guests,
who had expelled the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the name, authority and
power of the Empire remained in the East, where now the
State was in a strange confusion, the mother being banded
against her Son, and the People amongst themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Constantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth, was Emperor at
this time, who from his Infancy was governed (together
with the Empire) by his Mother <hi>Irene:</hi> But being now come
to the age of twenty years, he assumed the Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own hands.<note place="margin">Contention about Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> There was then a great division in the
East, which had been continued from Father to Son for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
yeares together, about bringing Images into the
Churches. The Bishops would needs bring them in: But
the Emperors together with the greatest part of the People
opposed themselves against them. This contention had its
beginning under <hi>Philip Bardanes,</hi> was continued under <hi>Leo
Isaurus,</hi> and from him was derived to his Son <hi>Constantine,</hi>
surnamed <hi>Copronimus,</hi> and to <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth, Son to the
said <hi>Constantine.</hi> This filled all the East with infinite scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls.</p>
                  <p>The same fire of contention continued in the minority of
our <hi>Constantine,</hi> who was yet governed by his Mother, a
woman of a violent spirit, who had undertaken the protect o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This crafty Woman made choise of the City of <hi>Nicea,</hi>
that the name of the ancient first Councel held there, might
honour this new invention with the pretext of Antiquity:
For there are some that confound the first Council of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi>
with the second, and <hi>Constantine</hi> the fourth with the
first.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Constantine</hi> continued in the hereditary hatred of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Grandfather against Images, so as being of age,
and in absolute possession of his Empire, he disannulled all
these new decrees, and caused the Images to be beaten down
in all places: Yet did he make all shews of respect to his
Mother, yeilding unto her a good part of his authority and
command: which respect was the cause of an horrible <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</hi>
For this Woman being transported for two causes
(both by reason of her new opinion, and for despight that
she had not the whole Government in her own power)
grew so unnatural, that she resolved to dispossess her Son of
the Empire, and to seize up on it herself: And indeed the
authority which her Son had left her, and the free accesse
which she had unto his Person, gave her oportunity for
the execution of her design.<note place="margin">An unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> For having corrupted such as

won them to her with her Sons Treasure, she seized on his
Person, put out his eyes, and sent him into Exile (where,
shortly after, he died of grief) and took possession of the
Empire.</p>
                  <p>These unnatural and <hi>Tragick</hi> furies were practised in the

the blame upon such as had done it (as she pretended) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

that she also would resign unto him the Empire of the East:

resolved to dispossesse her.</p>

seized upon the Empire, and took <hi>Irene,</hi> whom yet he
only banished, to give her oportunity and means to live

had not yet come to that hight as to pretend to a power of

But the right of <hi>Charles</hi> came another way. For before he

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56424:53"/>
He had subdued a great part of <hi>Spaine</hi> unto the River <hi>Iberus,</hi>

that <hi>Irene</hi> had picked out the eyes of her own Son the

And the Pope anointed him: As also his Son <hi>Pepin,</hi> whom

And the Pope knowing the dangers which had oft befaln

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> was advanced to
the Empire, partly by Inheritance, partly by the sword,
by dedition, and the Title was given him by the People,
and the Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet nothing was proper to the
Bishop, but the Coronation and other Ceremonies, which
he performed in the name of the People, according to the

that all the Chief men of the City, as well <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical,</hi>

the People: and that there should be allotted for his

Thirdly, That if any mans cause was perverted by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

aid of the <hi>Missus,</hi> or Emperors Commissioner, for Justice;
and the <hi>Missus</hi> should adjure the Judges, saying, <hi>By the
Faith ye owe unto my Lord the Emperor, I require you to do this
man Justice:</hi> Then none should dare to decline, either to
the right hand or to the left, although the wrong were done
by any of the Popes kinsmen. Fourthly, That the Mulcts
which should be imposed upon any guilty person, should
be equally divided between the Emperors <hi>Missus,</hi> and the
Popes <hi>Missus.</hi> Fifthly, That if any goods fell under <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat,</hi>

                        <hi>Charles</hi> is envied.</note> nor
did he enjoy the Empire without contradiction. For he

over whom he obtained one great Victory; but when

Then were mutual Ambassadors sent between the two

                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was Crowned Emperor in the thirty-third
year of his Raign, upon the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and in

and was always victorious. He had (as was said before)
Wars with the Heathenish <hi>Saxons,</hi> which, by times, lasted thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

shaked off both Loyalty, and <hi>Christianity.</hi> At several times
when <hi>Charlemagne</hi> had obtained a Victory, his manner was
to erect a new Bishoprick:<note place="margin">

were erected, were, <hi>Breme, Verda, Minda, Paterborne, Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabourg,
Hildesem,</hi> and <hi>Halberstad.</hi> But though he gave
the Bishops power of Governing, yet the Nobles did not
altogether loose the power of administring in Publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
At last, because the <hi>Saxons</hi> revolted again, he removed
ten Thousand of them, with their Wives and Children, into

                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> lived fifteen years after that he had united

<hi>Charles</hi> prevented it betimes, imploying against him his Son

vanquished, was entreated withall mildnesse, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored

                  <p>It afterwards happened that a great Fleet of Infidels
which inhabited <hi>Spaine,</hi> with the aid, and assistance of some
<hi>Africans,</hi> invaded the Isles of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Corsica</hi> in the

                     </gap> whereof, the Emperor
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> sent commandment to his Son <hi>Pepin</hi> that he
should send thither against them a valiant Captain whose

                     <note place="margin">Infidels beaten,</note> who took so good order as that he
drove those Infidels out of those Islands, and slew five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of them in one Battel. And with no lesse good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
the Emperor undertook an other War against the
Dukes of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                     </note> and <hi>Polanders,</hi> which is a part of the

against whom he sent his Son <hi>Charles</hi> with great
Forces of <hi>Burgonias, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Germans:</hi> And this young
<hi>Charles,</hi> imitating his Father, Warred valiantly, and with
discretion against them, and coming first to a Battel with the
<hi>Bohemians,</hi> led by <hi>Leo</hi> their Duke, he overcame them, as
he did also at other times, and at last slew <hi>Leo</hi> their Duke;
the like successe he had also against the <hi>Polanders,</hi> so as at
length they all became his Fathers Subjects. And for these
Victories of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> he was so much feared, and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
through the World, that a great King of the East; and
<hi>Amurath,</hi> the greatest of all the <hi>Mahomatists,</hi> sent their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
with rich Presents unto him, desiring peace, and
friendship: and the like did all <hi>Christian</hi> Kings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> thus living with honour,<note place="margin">His War with the King of <hi>Denmarke.</hi>
                     </note> and in tranquillity,
<hi>Godfrey</hi> King of <hi>Demark</hi> (which was a dependance of the
Realm of <hi>Germany,</hi> and part of <hi>Charles</hi> his Portion, as was
hinted before) made War against him. This <hi>Godfrey</hi> was a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56424:55"/>
mighty Prince, and commanded over a large Dominion,
and with great Forces came into <hi>Friesland</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi>
where he did great harm. Against whom, the Emperor
addressing himself (though he was now Old, and unweil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
speedily departed with a great Army: but by the way
news was brought him that King <hi>Godfrey</hi> was dead, and that
his Army was returned into their own Country. And upon
the same day news came also,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pepin</hi> dies,</note> that his Son <hi>Pepin</hi> (who had
raigned in <hi>Italy</hi> in great prosperity) was dead in the City
of <hi>Millan,</hi> which was an occasion of great grief to the old
Emperor. Then did he return to the City of <hi>Aken,</hi> or <hi>Aix,</hi>
unto which place Ambassadors came to him from <hi>Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
who succeeded <hi>Godfrey</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
humbly desiring Peace. The like came also to him from
the Emperor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and others also from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulat,</hi>
a King of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who raigned in a great part of
<hi>Spaine;</hi> to all which he returned gracious answers, and
granted their Petitions: withall, giving hearty thanks to
God for that he was generally so well esteemed of. But after
this Sunshine, an other storme returned, <hi>as the clouds return
after the raine:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And <hi>Charles.</hi>
                     </note> For it pleased God to take away an other of

for the defence thereof; so as now his whole hope rested
in his third Son <hi>Lewis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus man purposeth and God disposeth. Thus the Sons
die before the Father. Thus we see the greatest cannot
free themselves from the common calamities of mankind.
Thus both great Kings, and great Kingdoms have their
Period.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Charlemagne</hi> lost his Children, and his great Empire
her best support under God: For these two Princes (like

                  <p>After the Death of these two great Princes,<note place="margin">New ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies rise up.</note> many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
rose up against old <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who seemed (as it
were) to have lost his two Armes: as the <hi>Sarazins</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi>
the <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> and the <hi>Normans</hi> in the Northern Regions:
But he vanquished them all, and brought them into
his obedience and subjection, old and broken as he
was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> all his Life time held the Church in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,<note place="margin">His love to the Church.</note>
and had imployed his Authority to beautify it,
and bountifully bestowed his Treasure to enrich it: But this
great Plenty, joyned with so long and happy a Peace, made
the Church-men to live losely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> (being himself well instructed in Religion)
knowing of what great importance it was, to have such as
should instruct others to be sound in the Faith, and holy
and exemplary in their lives, he at sundry times, called five
Councels in sundry Places of his Dominions (For as yet
the Popes had not challenged that Power to belong to them)
for the Reformation and good Government of the Church:<note place="margin">He called five Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</note>
As at <hi>Mentz:</hi> at <hi>Rheimes:</hi> at <hi>Tours:</hi> at <hi>Chaalons:</hi> and at
<hi>Arles:</hi> and by the advise of these <hi>Ecclesiastical Assemblies,</hi>
he made and published many Orders for the good of the
Church which were gathered together in a Book called, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitula
Caroli Magni.</hi> A worthy President for Princes who
seek true honour by virtue, whereof the care of Piety is the
cheifest Foundation.</p>
                  <p>In the Preface to this Book, he thus saith, that he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
these Constitutions with the Advice of his <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>
and <hi>Counsellers:</hi> and that herein he had followed the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of King <hi>Josias,</hi> who endeavoured to bring the Kingdom
which God had given him, to the worship of the true God:
Some of his Constitutions are these. He commanded to
look to, and to try the learning and Conversation of such as
were admitted into the Ministry. He forbad private Masses,
Also the Confusion of <hi>Diocesses,</hi> requiring that no Bishop
should meddle in an others <hi>Diocesse.</hi> He forbad that any
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56424:56"/>
Books should be read publickly, but such as were approved
by the Councell of <hi>Calcedon.</hi> He forbad the worshipping
of Saints. He commanded Bishops not to suffer <hi>Presbyters</hi>
to teach the People other things then what are contained in,
or according to the holy Scriptures. And <hi>Lib. 2. Ch. 3.</hi>
he saith, <hi>Although the Authority of the Ecclesiasticall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
may seem to stand in our Person: Yet by the Authority of
God, and Ordinance of man, its known to be so divided, that
every one of you, in his own place and order, hath his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Ministry: Hence its manifest that I should admonish you
all, and you all should further and help us.</hi> He admonished Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
especially, to teach both by Life and Doctrine, both
by themselves, and the Ministers that were under them, as
they would answer the Contrary in their accounts at the
Great Day. He Ordained that the Bishop of the first See
should not be called the Prince of Priests, or the highest
Priest, or have any such Title, but only should be called,
<hi>The Bishop of the first See.</hi> That none can lay another foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
then that which is laid, which is <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and
that they which lay Christ for their foundation, its to be
hoped that they will be careful to shew their Faith, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth good Workes.</p>
                  <p>He held also a great Councel in the City of <hi>Frankfort,</hi>

the Pope, for confirming that which he had taken,

in liberal studies,<note place="margin">His Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note> famous in manners, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
in all honesty. He was so temperat, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his great revenues, he was never served at the
Table with above four dishes at a meal, and those of such
meat as best pleased his taste, which he used to the same end
for which God created them, which was for sustenance, and
to support his Body, not for shew and pomp.</p>
                  <p>His ordinary exercise was hunting when he was at leisure,<note place="margin">His Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.</note>
in time of War: and in times of peace, he attended to such as
read Histories to him, and sometimes he heard <hi>Musick,</hi> with
which he was much delighted, having good skill therein
himself: He was very charitable, and a bountifull Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
and so carefull to provide for the poor Christians,
that in <hi>Syria,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of the infidels,<note place="margin">His Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> where Christians lived, he found
meanes to have Almes houses, and Hospitalls erected, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
for those that were Poor.</p>
                  <p>But there fell out a new accident, which drew our Great
<hi>Charles</hi> again to Armes in his old age, and that was this; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso,</hi>
King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Chast,</hi> by reason
of his singular,<note place="margin">His last Wars.</note> and signall temperance in that kind, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and advertise him, that there was now a very fit opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
and meanes offered for him utterly to subdue the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razins</hi>
in <hi>Spain. Charlemagne</hi> (who infinitely desired to
finish this work, which he had so often attempted with no
great successe) gave ear to the information and advice,
whereupon he raises an Army, and marches into <hi>Spain,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> favour, and assistance, they being
<hi>Christians.</hi> Indeed <hi>Alphonso</hi> meant plainly, and sincerely,
but so did not his Courtiers, and Nobles, nor associates, who
feared <hi>Charles</hi> his forces no less then they did the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> &amp;
if <hi>Charles</hi> prevailed, the most confident of <hi>Alphonso's</hi> servants
and Officers doubted to be dispossessed of their places, and
Governments by a new Master: and therefore they labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to cross <hi>Alphonso,</hi> and to countermand <hi>Charles;</hi> but the
Lot was cast, his Army was in the Field, and he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to passe on: But when he was entred into <hi>Spain,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered
with so many difficulties, that being discouraged,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56424:57"/>
he returned back into <hi>France,</hi> and so concluded, and put
a period to all his Warlie enterprises; embracing again the
care of the Church, and of Religion, as a fit subject for the
remainder of his dayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was threescore and eight years old when he
left the Wars,<note place="margin">His prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Death.</note> after which he spent three whole years in his
study, to prepare himself for Death, in which time, he
read much in the Bible, and read over also St. <hi>Augustines</hi>
works, whom he loved and preferred before all the other
Doctors of the Church: He resided also at <hi>Paris,</hi> that he
might have oportunity of conferring with learned men.
There he erected a goodly University, which he furnished
with as learned me<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as those times could afford, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
it with great priviledges: For he had an exceeding
great care to make it a Nurcery for the holy Ministry, that
from thence the Church might be supplyed with able Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
whence also grew so many Colleges of <hi>Chan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ons,</hi> with
sufficient revenues annexed thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Charlemagne</hi> spent three years happily in the only
care of his Soul, leaving an illustrious example to all Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
to moderate, and ennoble their greatnesse with Piety,
and so to enjoy their Temporal estates, as in the mean time
not to neglect their eternal concernments, and to think of
their departure out of this Life in time.</p>
                  <p>Foreseeing his Death (whereunto he prepared himself by
these exercise) he made his last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testamont,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He makes His Will.</note> leaving
his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> the sole heir unto his great Kingdoms, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
to the Church much Treasure. But all things and
Persons in this World have an end: His <hi>Testament</hi> was
but the Harbinger to his Death; for presently after, he was
taken with a pain in his side, or Pluresie, and lay sick but
eight dayes, and so yielded up his Spirit unto God that gave
it, <hi>Anno Christi 814.</hi> and of his age seventy one, and of
his Raign forty seven, including fifteen years of his Empire:
His Body was interred in a sumptuous Church which he had
caused to be built in the City of <hi>Aquisgrave,</hi> or <hi>Aix la Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle,</hi>
where he was born, and his memory was honored with
a goodly <hi>Epitaph.</hi>

                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:56424:58"/>
He was one of the greatest Princes that ever lived:<note place="margin">His virtues.</note> His
vertues are a patterne to other <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and his great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
the subject of their wishes. The greatnesse of his
<hi>Monarchy</hi> indeed was admirable:<note place="margin">His large Dominions</note> For he quietly enjoyed
all <hi>France, Germany,</hi> the greatest part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> all <hi>Italy;</hi>
and a good part of <hi>Spain.</hi> At the time of his Death he was
in peace with the other Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> as also with the Kings
of <hi>England, Denmark, Balgarie,</hi> with the Emperor <hi>Leo</hi> of
<hi>Constantinople,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> and withall the Princes of that time.</p>
                  <p>This Noble Prince was endued with so many excellent
virtues that we read of very few in antient Histories that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
him, so that he may be justly compared with the best
of them: For in Martial Discipline, in Valour, in Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in feats of Armes, there are none that exceeded him.
He obtained as many Victories, fought as many Battles, and
subdued as many fierce and Warlike Nations as any one we
read of, and that both before, and after that he was Emperor.
He was tall of Stature, very well proportioned in all his
members, passing strong: of a fair and grave countenance,
Valiant, mild, mercifull, a lover of Justice, liberall, very
affable, pleasant, well read in History, a great Friend of Arts
and Sciences, and sufficiently seen into them, and a man
who above all, loved and rewarded learned men. He was
very Charitable in his Kingdoms, yea, in his very Court, he
harboured and relieved many Strangers, and Pilgrims. In
matters of Faith and Religion he was very Zealous; and
most of the Wars which he made,<note place="margin">His Zeale.</note> were to propagate and
enlarge the Christian Faith.</p>
                  <p>He (being misled by the darknesse of the times wherein
he lived) superstitiously honoured, and obeyed the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope that was Bishop thereof, together
with other Bishops and Prelates, commanding his Subjects
also to do the like. He was also very devout, and spent
much of his time in Prayer, Hearing, and Reading. In his
Diet he was very temperate, and a great enemy to riot and
excesse; and though he was Rich and Mighty, yet fed he his
Body with what was necessary and wholesome, not rare,
costly, and strange.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56424:58"/>
And yet his virtues were not without their blemishes (as
the greatest commonly are not without some notable vices)
For in his Younger dayes,<note place="margin">His blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes.</note> he was much given to women,
adding Concubines to his lawful Wives, by whom he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Children: But this was in the time of his youth:
For afterwards he contented himself with his Wife, and for a
remedy of this imperfection, though he was three or four
times a Widdower, yet he ever maried again the Daughter
of some great Prince or other.</p>
                  <p>To conclude all, he was an excellent Emperor, that loved
and feared God, and dyed when he was very Old, and full
of Honour, leaving <hi>Lewis</hi> (the weakest of his Sons) the sole
heir of his great Empire, but not of his virtues: So that
this great building soon declined in his posterity.</p>
                  <p>He had engraven upon his Sword <hi>Pro Deo, &amp; Religione,</hi>
For God, and Religion: He used to set his Crown upon
the Bible, as our <hi>Canutus</hi> sometime put his Crown upon the
<hi>Rood,</hi> both of them thereby intimating, that as all honour
was due to God, so true Religion was the best <hi>Basis</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and that Piety was the best Policy.</p>

Sons, viz. <hi>Charles</hi> his eldest, whom he made King of the

his second, whom he made King of <hi>Italy, Bavaria,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Lewis</hi> his youngest, to whom he left the Empire intire, his
Brothers being both Dead, in their Fathers Life time.

Books, especially that <hi>De Civitate Dei:</hi> or some
History. He was also a great Friend to Learning, and
