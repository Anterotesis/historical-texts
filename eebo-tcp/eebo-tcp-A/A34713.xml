            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And I will reſtore thy Judges as at the firſt, and
thy Counſellors as at the beginning; after thou

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words are part of that Viſion
we read of (<hi>ver.</hi> 1.) which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw in
the Reigns of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> and <hi>Jotham,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (that is)
the City or Nation, and their Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The fulfilling whereof <hi>Piſcator, Menopius</hi> and <hi>Lyra,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the reſtauration of their Temple and Nation in
their Sacred and Civil Rites, as well as ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both in Church and State, after their return from
their <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity,</hi> which was about 240 years
yet to come. And this ſence is favoured by the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gints</hi>
rendring <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as alſo the <hi>Syriack</hi>
and <hi>Arabick</hi> Verſions, <hi>Salvabitur Captivitas ejus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Forerius</hi> and others look 500 years beyond this
time, and refer the fulfilling of this Viſion to the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
and happy Condition of the Chriſtian Church
and State, as both in After-Ages ſhould be reſtored and
fixed by Chriſt himſelf, their hoped for Meſſiah, who
they believed, when he came, would reſtore all things,
and ſit upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and upon his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48632:4"/>
to order and eſtabliſh it with Judgment and with
Juſtice from thenceforth and for ever. So that under his
Reign the Righteous ſhould flouriſh, <hi>Sion</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed:
Judges, Counſellors, and all things be reſtored
as at the firſt.</p>
            <p>1. Now if we underſtand theſe words in the firſt
ſenſe, of their Reſtoration after their return from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
the time was ſo remote, they could adminiſter no
more of comfort to the <hi>Jews,</hi> than it would to us, if in
the midſt of diſmal Diſtractions one ſhould propheſie,
That 300 years hence our Nation ſhould flouriſh, or
at the Day of Judgment all ſhould be reſtored.</p>
            <p>2. If we underſtand them in the ſecond, of the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by Chriſt under the Goſpel, that could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the preſent State of the <hi>Jews</hi> at all, but the future
of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Beſides, this time being more remote,
would have been leſs of ſupport under their preſſing
Calamities.</p>
            <p>Neither in truth was their Temple, Nation, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or ancient Governours then reſtored, but rather
quite diſſolved, and broken in pieces by the conquering
<hi>Romans,</hi> and themſelves thenceforth enſlaved, and, as an
accurſed People, ſcattered upon the face of the Earth
to this very day: for <hi>when Shilo came, the Scepter
departed from Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I intend to conſider and remark upon
theſe words, as (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 3.) a Revelation of things that
were at hand, and ſpeedily to come to paſs: As a
Meſſage ſent to <hi>Judah</hi> in the latter end of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi>'s
Reign, and fulfilled (about Three Years after) in the
beginning of <hi>Jotham</hi>'s; which will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the preſent juncture of Affairs and Calamities the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Nation then laboured under, and
how occaſioned; which was as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48632:4"/>
               <hi>Joaſh,</hi> the preſent King's Grand-Father, being an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and Religious Prince in the beginning of his
Reign; but after the Death of <hi>Jehoiadah,</hi> following the
wicked Counſel of his cringing Favourites, he forſook
the true Eſtabliſhed Worſhip,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 24. 17, 18 Joſ. lib. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

which thing ſo highly provoked God, that he gave him
up in Battel into the hands of his Enemies, and at laſt
his own Subjects ſlew him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amaziah,</hi> his Son, ſucceeding in the Throne, one of
the firſt things he did, was to try and execute thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides</hi>
who had murthered the King his Father. And
farther we read of him,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 25. 2, 3.</note> that <hi>he did that which was right
in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart;</hi> that
is, he outwardly for a long time ſtill profeſſed and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to protect the true Worſhip and Worſhippers of
God, as then profeſſed amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> (which thing
was right in God's ſight) <hi>but not with a perfect heart;</hi> for
his heart was after the Gods of <hi>Mount Seir;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 25. 14.</note> and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>he burnt incenſe to them.</hi> But knowing the Hatred his
Subjects bore to that Idolatrous Religion, he durſt not
openly enjoyn it them. However, we find, when his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
began to diſcover his former diſsembling his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and fearing he had deſigns, and would in time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to introduce Innovations into the Temple of
God,<note place="margin">Joſ. lib. 9. c. 10. 2 Chron. 25. 27.</note> they plotted and <hi>conſpired againſt him,</hi> and ſo at
laſt made him away too.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe two Princes graſping at an abſolute and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
power, or to make themſelves like to the great
King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> their Neighbour, as the moſt proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
endeavoured firſt to introduce his Idolatrous
Worſhip.</p>
            <p>It being the Nature of all Falſe and Idolatrous Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which come from the Devil, to make all Monarchs,
like himſelf, their Author, <hi>Arbitrary Tyrants.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48632:5"/>
And all their Subjects, like thoſe in his Kingdom of
Darkneſs, <hi>Miſerable Slaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Nature of the true Religion, which comes
from God, is to render all her Kings, being (his <hi>anointed</hi>)
like himſelf, <hi>Indulgent Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all her Subjects, like thoſe in his Kingdom of

the Foundation on which they ſtand.</p>
            <p>Expoſing their Authority to be ſtripped Naked, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and trampled on.</p>
            <p>For tho ſome ſelf-deſigning men, to flatter (and abuſe)
Princes, and promote themſelves, may have tortured
Scripture, and ſcrewed up Conſcience and Religion to
ſuch heighths, as to infer thence Obligations to an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
unreaſonable ſort of Obedience.</p>
            <p>Yet 'tis as impoſſible for men in general to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to their true Intereſt, their Natural Principles
of Freedom and Self-preſervation, or to ſtand by and
aſſiſt any Power in abuſing themſelves. As it is to be
mad with Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And 'tis as fooliſh, if not impious and contradictory,
to pretend to fetch Arguments from a Religion that
comes from God, to cheat men of thoſe Natural Rights
which himſelf (and Nature) has given them.</p>
            <p>Whereby they repreſent God, as tho repenting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling
his Gifts, and ſo acting contradictory to his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which is himſelf, and dividing his Kingdom againſt
it ſelf, like that which cannot ſtand.</p>
            <p>Let then their miſtaken ſenſe of Government be
what it will, it was, no doubt, inſtituted for the defence
and preſervation of the whole, and at firſt the Emperor
and the Judge was the ſame, with his Sword in one hand
to defend againſt their Enemies, and his Scepter in the
other to determine Controverſies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48632:10"/>
But the weight of Government, and number of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

            <p>By Judges (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>1. Such as God himſelf was, or ſuch as he at firſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
qualified and ſent.</p>
            <p>2. Or ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, or ſuch as he commiſſioned.</p>
            <p>3. Or ſuch as the beſt of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi>
were, or ſuch as they commiſſion'd in their reſpective Reigns.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Such as God himſelf was.</hi> For tho by his Univerſal
Power and Providence, he at firſt planted, and ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
all the Kingdoms of the World, and has given
them to the Children of Men, yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> was his peculiar

by <hi>Samuel, They have not rejected thee, but they have
rejected me, that I ſhould not reign over them;</hi> becauſe
that himſelf, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 7. was their King, their Judge

            <p>And it was common for them to bring ſuch Cauſes as
they could not determine,<note place="margin">Exod. 18. 19.</note> and ſpread them before the

            <p>2. Or ſuch as God extraordinarily qualified, and ſent
<hi>to judge his People</hi> Iſrael; <hi>ſuch were</hi> Othniel, Shamgar,

in Circuit, City by City.</p>
            <p>2. We may learn what theſe Judges at firſt were.</p>
            <p>1. From the Rules laid down for their Choice.</p>
            <p>2. From the Charge given them upon Admiſſion, for
the Execution of their Office.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only inſtance in Two, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi>'s
Rules and Charge.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rules for Choice, or Qualifications he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
in a Judge, are reduceable to theſe Four, recorded
<hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 2.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Chuſe able men; (i. e.)</hi> Men of Parts and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Such as fear God:</hi> Not the Face of Man in the
Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48632:11"/>
3. <hi>Men of Truth:</hi> Men of Integrity, hating Falſe
Judgment.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Such as hate Covetouſneſs:</hi> If not, they'l take
Bribes, and ſell Juſtice.</p>
            <p>2. Moſes'<hi>s Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>His Univerſal Negative,</hi> Lev. 19. 5. Ye ſhall do
no unrighteouſneſs in judgment: you ſhall not reſpect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
you ſhall not fear the face of man.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>His Univerſal Affirmative,</hi> Deut. 16. 18. 19. <hi>and</hi>
1. 15, 16. I charged the judges at that time, ſaying, You
ſhall judge the people with juſt judgment: hear the cauſes of
your brethren, judge righteouſly between every man and his
neighbour: hear the ſmall as well as the great: fear not
man, for the judgment is God's.</p>
            <p>But more particularly he charges theſe Four things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That Judges ſhall not ſpeak in a Cauſe to decline after
many to wreſt judgment: (i. e.)</hi> Not pervert Juſtice, out of
Popularity, to gratifie a Multitude.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not countenance a poor man in his cauſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 2, 3. 5, 6. 7.</note>
(that is,) Do no unjuſt thing out of pity: Let not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
blind neither: The Rich may not be favoured in
oppreſſing the Poor, nor the Poor (becauſe ſuch) rob or
injure the Rich.</p>
            <p>3. Thou ſhalt not wreſt the judgment of the poor, nor
take gifts.</p>
            <p>4. They ſhall not condemn the innocent, nor acquit the
guilty.</p>
            <p>2. Jehoſaphat'<hi>s Famous Charge, recorded</hi> 2 Chron.
19. 5, 6, 7. He ſaid unto the judges, Take heed what ye do,
for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in
the judgment; and let the fear of the Lord be upon you:
Shun all iniquity, have no reſpect of perſons, nor take any
gifts: that in all things you may be like unto God, the judge
of judges, with whom there is no iniquity, nor reſpect of
perſons, nor taking of gifts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48632:11"/>
Now ſuch as thoſe Primitive Rules were for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Judges, and ſuch as the Charge was, ſuch were
Judges at firſt.</p>
            <p>(2.) What were Counſellors at the beginning?</p>
            <p>I do not underſtand this Name at all to relate to
the Practitioners of the Law, whom we ſo call; but
to Counſellors of State at Court about the Prince, or
the Grand Senate or Parliament of a Nation.</p>
            <p>And the firſt primitive Pattern of a Counſellor of
State to a Prince was <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 18. 19.</note> who gave him
wiſe and faithful Counſel.</p>
            <p>Such another was <hi>Huſhai</hi> the <hi>Archite</hi> to <hi>David.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such was <hi>Nathan</hi> to King <hi>Solomon,</hi> to the ſaving of
his Life and Kingdom.<note place="margin">1 Kings 1. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such were the good old Men, who ſtood before him
during his whole Reign, by whoſe Conduct and good
Advice himſelf and his Kingdom ſo flouriſhed,<note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 6.</note> that
Silver and Gold was as plenty as ſtones in the ſtreets
of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or ſuch Counſellours as <hi>David</hi> conſulted with, even
God's Oracles. <hi>Thy Teſtimonies are my Counſellors,</hi>
Pſal. 119. 14.</p>
            <p>Now from that time that a Nation hath ſuch Judges
reſtored, and a Prince follows the Advice of ſuch
Counſellors, may ſhe begin to date her Reſtauration.</p>
            <p>2. Indeed theſe are both the Inſtrumental Cauſes and
Eſſential parts of the Reſtauration it ſelf, which is the
ſecond Poſition I propoſed to diſcourſe of, after I had
enquired out and ſtated who and what thoſe Primitive
Judges and Counſellours were.</p>
            <p>As an Exquiſite Maſter in a Ship, that knows how
to make his Obſervations, and perform his Courſe, as
a provident Steers-man at the Helm: or the Skilful
experienc'd Pilot, who knows how to avoid <hi>Sylla</hi> and
<hi>Charibdis,</hi> contribute all to the ſafety of the Veſſel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48632:12"/>
Such are Primitive Judges and Counſellors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
a Nation into Harbours of Tranquility amd Reſt.</p>
            <p>There are other Subordinate Judges which help to
compleat a Reſtauration, had I time to ſpeak to them.</p>
            <p>The High Sheriff, though the Grand Executioner of
the Law, yet he is a Judge too, and hath his County-Court
to ſit in.</p>
            <p>The County-Juſtices are Judges too (as <hi>Jethro</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes)
of ſmaller Matters that are not too hard for
them:<note place="margin">Exod. 18. 25, 26.</note> For ſuch they are to bring before you who are
as <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all neceſſary, and may ſhine in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
inferiour Spheres.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Were it not for the Sun, it would
be night for all the Stars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are this Sun that muſt irradiate and dart beams
on them to reflect again on the People.</p>
            <p>I have ſet <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Primitive Pattern and Charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you to imitate, which if you obſerve and follow,
it will ſuffice that you ſet your ſelves as Originals for
theſe to copy after.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the great Rivers, which run
through a Country, may contain water enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
and fructifie all the Fields they paſs by; yet
without trenching ſmaller Rivulets, to convey and
apply them to the remoter corners of the Paſtures,
they may parch and be barren for all the Streams
paſſing by.</p>
            <p>Your paſſage and circuiting through a Land, is as
Rivers of Righteouſneſs and mighty Streams of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
running down: However theſe, as the ſmaller
Channels and Trenches, muſt be alſo opened and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
or elſe we cannot flouriſh.</p>
            <p>And can we reflect upon our Circumſtances, but
the very laſt years Aſſizes for this County, without a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48632:12"/>
profound Concernment, and almoſt Tears of Joy for
our Deliverance and preſent Reſtauration.</p>
            <p>Then a falſe Prophet on the Bench
for a Judge:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alliborn</hi> at <hi>Reading</hi> foretold, that in a ſhort time they would hear their Miniſter preaching up the King's Right to diſpence with Laws.</note> For what he there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
never did, nor is like to come
to paſs.</p>
            <p>A Romiſh Idolater for a High Sheriff, ready upon a
fair opportunity, with his <hi>Poſſe,</hi> to execute our Laws,
Religion, and her Proteſtant Profeſſors, to introduce
his worſe than Pagan Superſtitions.</p>
            <p>For the moſt part a Crew of perfidious Juſtices (of
the ſame ſtamp) who to capacitate themſelves for the
Bench, had in effect promiſed by the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi>
following to betray both God and Man, their Country,
Laws, Religion, and Liberties, or to cull out ſuch men
for the Senate, as would certainly do it.</p>
            <p>But O happy Change! here our Judges in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Stations now reſtored as at the firſt.</p>
            <p>But this is not the whole of a Nations's Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But,</p>
            <p>2. There muſt be concomitant with Judges, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
too as at the beginning:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>For.</hi> pag. 129.</note> Therefore <hi>Forerius</hi>
commenting on the words, writes; <hi>Ad foelicitatem Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae
non ſatis putavit, ſi Judices integri eſſent, niſi ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
&amp; Conſilliarios forent:</hi> They muſt be both reſtored,
or almoſt as good neither. For if theſe always at the
Spring head ſhall continually poiſon the Fountain, it
will be difficult for a Judge to make Judgment in its
uncorrupt purity to ſtream down in a Country.</p>
            <p>For what by their interpoſition for Bribes, out of
Malice, Favour, or Friendſhip; procuring Sentences
againſt the Innocent; Reprieves or Pardons for the
Guilty, the moſt enormous Crimes in a Kingdom
ſhall frequently eſcape unpuniſhed; and the leſſer
(who are Friendleſs) as often ſuffer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:48632:13"/>
The moſt righteous Sentence ſhall often take no
Effect. Innocent Blood ſhall cry unrevengd: Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Vices connived at; and Sins, when cloathed in
Scarlet, brave it out in the face of the Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore as</hi> Calvin <hi>on the words,</hi> Ordinem illum
purgabo in quo fontem malorum eſſe dixi.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have conſider'd Judges and Counſellors
as a neceſſary eſſential part of a People's Reſtauration.
It remains now to couſider them as Inſtrumental Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which I ſhall treat of under the third and fourth
General Heads propoſed at firſt to be diſcourſed on,
(<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>3. The Order
<hi>and</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The Nature</p>
            <p>of a Church or Nation's Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Ruine.</p>
            <p>And how far Judges and Counſellors Influence, and
are Inſtrumental Cauſes of both.</p>
            <p>1. The Influence of good Counſellours on a Church
or Nation's Proſperity, is and ever has been moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in every Age and in all Nations, and may be moſt
convincingly demonſtrated from the ſad Effects, diſmal
and ſatal Conſequences Nations have ſmarted under
by the Conduct and Advice of wicked ones, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine both of Prince and People.</p>

But moſt famous and remarkable is the Caſe of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,</hi>
who upon the Death of <hi>Solomon</hi> his Father, went
up to <hi>Sichem</hi> to be crown'd King, where multitudes of his
Subjects went alſo to attend the Solemnity, and ſo took
that opportunity of preſenting their humble Addreſſes,
That thoſe Invaſions made upon their Liberties as Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Rights as Subjects, might be redreſs'd. Which
the old faithful Counſellors of his Father adviſed him
to do: But he rejected theſe, and followed the advice
of the young men, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To inſiſt upon his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
to check their Inſolence in daring to petition,
and threaten them the higher for it, and tell them,
He was reſolved to make their Yoke heavier;<note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 1, 1.</note> That
his little Finger ſhould be heavier than his Father's Loins:
And whereas before they were chaſtiſed with Whips,
he would henceforth laſh them with Scorpions.</p>
            <p>When his Subjects heard this, and found that their
humble Addreſs was become their greater Crime, and
a Reaſon for heavier Oppreſſions, they make a general
Revolt, and unanimouſly cry out, <hi>What Portion have
we in David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 16.</note> 
               <hi>neither have we Inheritance in the Son of

<hi>David;</hi> yet if he pervert the Ends of Government,
which are to protect, relieve, and defend, and is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

to our ſelves and ours: <hi>To thy Tents, O Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>

every Aſſizes, and a Judge has done ten thouſand

            <p>But if he has done but one unjuſt Act in the whole

            <p>For thoſe common Acts of Juſtice on certain Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,

            <p>And therefore againſt common notorious Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
the moſt Barbarous Nations have enacted Laws.</p>
            <p>And the moſt unjuſt Judges muſt, and do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

            <p>So that for a judge to do common Acts of Juſtice,
as he cannot avoid, does not denominate him a Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> as low as <hi>Mahometaniſm:</hi> and yet even theſe

            </p>
            <p>And theſe very Men amongſt us have alſo hereby

of the true Church: for <hi>Sion muſt be redeemed with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and her Converts with Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Reſult of the whole, I deſcend to my Fourth and laſt
Inference.</p>
            <p>4. Since both Church and State reap ſo great Advantages by
the Reſtoration of primitive Judges and Counſellors, a People
are highly obliged, when thus reſtor'd, without Murmuring,
to bleſs God for both.</p>
            <p>And our Nation being thus reſtor'd from ſuch forlorn Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
as we were lately in, a Man would think there was
no room left for Murmur or Scruple about this our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration,
urged by Neceſſity, carried on by Miracle, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the Univerſal Conſent of all that love God, their
Religion and Country: Wherefore Juſtice, Equity and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
calls upon us to give the Glory, Honour and Praiſe to that
God who is the primary Author of all; and next under him,
to acknowledg that glorious Inſtrument in his Hand, by which
he hath wrought for us ſo great Salvation, and teach us a ready
ſubmiſſion to one, who under God hath ſnatched us out of the
Jaws of ſo great Deſtruction, and put us into the actual poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Laws, Liberties, Religion and Properties, and all
that was dear to us in this World, and we hope may make us
happy in the next; and ſtill weilds the Sword, to ſupport and
defend us in the enjoyment of all that he has thus acquir'd for
us. Is it now poſſible, that from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> from <hi>Berwick</hi>
to the <hi>Mount,</hi> there ſhould be found amongſt us one <hi>Tobias,</hi> or
<hi>Sanballat,</hi> who when they heard, that the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
were to be made up, and the Houſe of the Lord to be repair'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48632:18"/>
ſhould conſpire to hinder and repine at it? <hi>O my God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah) think thou upon Tobias and Sanballat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had the greateſt Deliverance which ever God vouchſafed to
Mortals, wanted ſuch, it would have been too ſtrange to have
been believ'd now (<hi>O horrendum infandum Nefas</hi>)!</p>
            <p>But as there are a ſort of Men, that no Man, nor themſelves,
know what they would have, or what to make of, ſo not Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
what to do with, how to ſatisfy or humour.</p>
            <p>If they are diſtreſs'd, they groan, complain, and cry for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
            <p>But when deliver'd, they clamour at the Method, Manner
or Means, That God deliver'd them in his own way, not in
theirs.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Naaman</hi> is angry at the Means of his Cure, why
God would not make the Waters of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> as effectual as
thoſe of <hi>Jordan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dathan, Abiram</hi> and <hi>Corah,</hi> quarrel with the Inſtruments of
their Deliverance, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> why they muſt be the
Men rather than others.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they groan'd under their ſlaviſh
Burthens.</p>
            <p>When deliver'd, ungratefully ſaid, <hi>Would to God we had not
come up thence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they began to want, they repined and wiſh'd they had
died in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When reliev'd, and fed with <hi>Quails</hi> and <hi>Manna,</hi> Angels
Food; they loath'd it, and long'd for the Offals of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was defied by <hi>Goliah,</hi> they cry for
help.</p>
            <p>God ſends them <hi>David,</hi> to deliver them, but they deſpiſe
the Stripling.</p>
            <p>Before he fought the Champion, <hi>Saul</hi> will give him his
Daughter, or any thing, if he conquer. When he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
him, and ſaved both the King and his Kingdom, he
throws his Javelin at him to kill him.</p>
            <p>Thus when lately <hi>Rome</hi> threatned our Church with Idolatry,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> our Nation with Slavery;</p>
            <p>A corrupt pack'd Bench ready to decree it;</p>
            <p>An Army encamp'd ready to enforce it;</p>
            <p>A Prince reſolute enough to attempt it;</p>
            <p>Then all, as fill'd with Diſcontent, and ſunk in Deſpair, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
out their Complaints, That their Religion is loſt, their
Laws diſpens'd with and gone, the Government Arbitrary,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48632:19"/>
the Nation ruined, and themſelves all undone; and cry out,
<hi>Help, Lord, or elſe we periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God heard, and ſent his Angel, and deliver'd us, and we are
reſtor'd as at the firſt, and in the beginning, in ſo tranſcendent
a manner, far beyond what in Reaſon we could wiſh or hope
for, without Effuſion of Blood, or Devaſtation of our Cities,
that all muſt ſay, <hi>It was the Lord's doing, and it is wonderful in
our Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we being thus deliver'd, what is the meaning of all theſe
Lowings and Bleatings in our Ears, Diſcontents and Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as tho' we deſign'd to confront Heaven, ſtubbornly to
rebel againſt Providence, charge the moſt High with Injuſtice,
and dare his Vengeance?</p>
            <p>'Tis juſt as if when God ſent <hi>Samuel</hi> to tell <hi>Saul,</hi> that for his
ill Government He had this day rent the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
from him, and given it to <hi>David</hi> his Son-in-law, that was more
righteous than himſelf, by whoſe hands He was reſolv'd to ſave
his People, and they had again replied, <hi>We will not be ſaved after
this manner,</hi> by God's depoſing the Father, and ſetting up his
Son: <hi>Save us by Saul in our own way, as beſt agrees with our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
or ſave us not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How muſt this have provoked the holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to
have deſtroy'd until he had made an end, and their Land a
Deſolation! Yet ſuch as theſe may be found amongſt us, as
Fighters againſt God. For?</p>
            <p>(1.) There are ſome Repiners, who, biaſs'd by a Corrupt
Religion, bear no good Will to our <hi>Sion;</hi> For they know
if the Ark of God be reſtor'd and ſet up, their <hi>Dagon</hi> muſt
be removed and thrown down.</p>
            <p>(2.) There are others repine, becauſe our common Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is not their private Intereſt; as thoſe that made Silver-Shrines
for <hi>Diana,</hi> and by that Craft get their Wealth, may not
be wondred at in being ſo zealous to ſupport her Temple.
The ground of that grand Uproar at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and it may be
the true Reaſon of our preſent Diſcontents at home. Tho'
'tis Conſcience and Sacrifice, with <hi>Saul,</hi> that are the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Reaſons of their murmuring Diſobedience; yet theſe will
no more juſtifie their Rebellions againſt God's Providential
Acts and Deliverances, than <hi>Saul</hi>'s did. Nor render their
Crimes better than his, even as the Sin of Witchcraft, becauſe
the Chriſtian Religion being a Doctrine of Submiſſion and
Obedience to the Powers that are, doth not involve the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of private Chriſtians about the Title of Princes, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48632:19"/>
only aſſure them, that the Powers that are, they are of God,
and therefore muſt be obeyed. Neither can their Pretenſions
(with the Jews) of being bound under an Oath to (kill <hi>Paul</hi>)
murther their Religion, Laws, and Country, or ſtand by one
that will, which is all one, juſtify them in ſo villanous an Act,
or give them the leaſt Merit or Reputation by their refuſal to
renounce ſuch Obligations, and to promiſe Faith, Obedience,
and Aſſiſtance to that Glorious Inſtrument ſent by God to ſave
us. And is therefore juſt ground to conclude what their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
are; and Reaſon for the Government to reject them not
only as uſeleſs, but pernicious and dangerous (<hi>ne pars ſincera
trahatur.</hi>)</p>
            <p>But in truth, I rather believe all to proceed from Caution
and Intereſt, than Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Things may be of doubtful Iſſue, not being yet fully deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and by a bare Suſpenſion, they undergo no greater loſs for
the preſent, than what the Hearts of ſome could wiſh for to
turn their Charges into <hi>ſine</hi> Cures. And having yet time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to prevent any loſs by a deprivation for the future, in
hopes before that time all may ſettle, and they enabled to make
the wiſer Choice, and effectually ſecure their Intereſt, let the
Iſſue be what it will.</p>
            <p>But if there be any that can at laſt for ſake all upon ſo groſs
a miſtake, I will towards ſuch exerciſe the Charity due to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Brethren, and hope the beſt.</p>
            <p>But to lay aſide the gilded Pretenſions of ſome, the blinded
Paſſions and corrupt private Intereſts of others, as no Guides
for us to walk by; it will become us in Duty with all humble
and grateful Acknowledgment, Hearts full of Joy, and Mouths
filled with Hoſanna's, to aſcribe the Praiſe, the Honour, and
Glory of all to that God, by whoſe right Hand we have been
hitherto preſerv'd and reſtor'd both in Church and State, leſt
that by murmuring on, their Doom become ours, who after
all their miraculous Deliverances out of the Hands of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
were ſentenc'd at laſt to die in the Wilderneſs, there
to periſh, and never enter into his Reſt.</p>
            <p>I come now to apply the whole, and conclude. Having hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
endeavour'd to parallel our preſent Reſtauration, and
to ſhew the Influence Primitive Judges and Counſellours may
have on it: As alſo to characteriſe, limn, and preſent you
with their Pictures.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, 'tis your part, if (as I hope) you are ſuch a one,
to ſhew us the Subſtance of this Shadow, the very Life it ſelf.</p>
            <p>You are come forth in this the time of our univerſal Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
the Eyes of the People are upon You; they hope for,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48632:20"/>
and expect better and greater things. Diſappoint them not; ſo
as that when they look for Judgment, behold Iniquity; for
Righteouſneſs, but behold Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Let it be no longer proverbially ſaid, (<hi>
