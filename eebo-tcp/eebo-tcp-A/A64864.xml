            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:45:4"/>
particular parts properly belonging unto them: &amp; first for the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell who is appointed Comander in Chief over his own Regiment, he ought to be a Souldier of extraordinarie experience, &amp; valour, as having the comand of a little army, somtimes singled from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; on him dependeth the good successe of many brave designes &amp; actions, therefore he must be well skilled in inbattailing of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie for sometimes the good ordering of charging the Enemie, causeth the victorie, and the contrarie sometime causeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the whole bodie, he must take particular notice of all the Captains under his command, which are most usually five, and a Serjeant Major, hee is likewise to take care that the Troope under his command be well accommodated with good Equipage, as good and serviceable Horse and Armes, and all other necessaries requisite or belonging unto the Cavalrie, hee is not to suffer his Captains to make Officers, nor to absent themselves from their Troops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave. In the March his own Troop marches first, and is first quartered, in time of fight his place is in the Battalia, if there be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own Regiment, or if he command in Chiefe, that so hee may be able to give order and command upon all occasions, hee should not resolve upon any Enterprize, but first advise with one or more of his faithfullest and most experienced Captains.</p>
            <p>The second Commander belonging unto a Regiment of Horse is, the Serjeant Major whose Experience and Valour had need be answerable unto his place, which is of great concernment, for hee is most usually a man of the most practice in the Regiment, in marching he ought to be well acquainted with the ways. that so he may with best advantage encounter the Enemy, if it hapneth they met, if the Regiment marches in high ways. In the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie or where the people do most affect their Enemie: it is his dutie in all places or fields convenient, to cause all the Regiment to be drawn up into Battalia, which will both annew the Souldiers to this kinde of Exercise, and cause them to be more Expert and Readie at all times to Encounter these Enemies, at this time, and so at all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times in their marching, hee should send forth Scouts before

            <p>The next Commander in a Regiment of Horse is a Captain, who should be a man of Wsdome and Policy, as being one of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels counsel, and wel exercised in Arms that so he may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to Dicipline his own Troop, hee hath need have good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Valour, in regard that many times it hapneth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a distance from the grosse body with his troop, he must with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order or counsell of others, sometimes when he shall see advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageable occasions, execute service of great consequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and compleat, he must endevour to know every one of his souldiers by their names, that so he may distinctly name them upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of employment, hee must never be daunted whatsoever, disadvantage befall him for feare of discouraging his Souldiers, hee must cherish his well deserving Souldiers, and cashiere the contrarie, it must be his care to have one or more of his Souldiers well acquainted with the ways of that Countrie he marches in, to serve him as Guides, to that end he must if he can get one or more of the Country inhabitants to enter themselves as Souldiers under his command.</p>
            <p>The Lievtenant of a Troop of horse ought to be a man of known experience, nursed and well educated in Cavalrie, it properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto his care and office to exercise and discipline the Troope in the Captains absence, he commands the Troope, his name signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth so much in the <hi>French Lievtenant,</hi> that is one which supplieth the place of another upon him, usually all difficulties doe rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause oftimes the Troops are given unto young Gentlemen which want experience, he must see that the Souldiers keep their horse and arms well, he always marches in the Reare, causing the Souldiers to follow their Captaine and Colours; in time of fight his place is in the Reare with his sword drawne in his hand, encouraging the Souldiers, and killing any that shall offer to flie from their Colours or disband themselves, but if the Captain be absent, then hee shall take tht Captaines place, appointing another able Officer in the Reare, in the ordinary marching of the Troope, the Lieutenant must not take the Captains place though he be absent, but the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net must lead the Troop, and the Lievtenant must bring up the Reare, hee must be able to write and read, because hee must keep a List of the Troopers names, and likewise be able himselfe to read those Orders and Letters that shall be sent him from his Superiour Officers, and not communicating it to others, hee must take notice of the sufficiencie of every souldier, and make use of them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, when the Troop goeth to manage any Guard, the Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is to go a little before unto that Lievtenant he is to relieve, and

by him to acquaint himself of the place for the Sentinels for day and night, and must himselfe place the Sentinels when the Troope lodgeth in a Village, he must cause the Billits assigned to be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted before the Cornets lodging, so that in case of an Alarm, the Souldiers may know where to repaire to their Colours, when the Troop is to march: he must be first on horseback, giving the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers a good example, he must endeavour to acquaint himself with the ways of the Country, because hee is often sent forth upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, when the Troop in marching is charged by the Enemy, hee must keep some distance behind, with some of the best mounted Souldiers for a reserve, that so the first having done their dutie, they may second them, giving the other oportunitie to resemble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and time to make ready again.</p>
            <p>The Cornet must be a man of courage, who in the absence of the Captain and Lievtenant commands the Troope, in the ordinary marching of the Troop, he marches in the first division betweene the first and second squadron, the Colours are then carried by his man. In the first rank of the second squadron next the right hand man, but in fight the Cornet takes the Colours himselfe and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the middle of the Front, when the Lord Generall passes by he is to doe oba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Quartermaster must be a souldier of good experience, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many times sent forth upon parties, and sometimes leads on the forlorne hope, he had need bee well acquainted with the wayes, because he alwayes goeth before the Troop to provide quarter for them, he is to take two or more of the nimblest mounted Troopers along with him, and having provided quarter, sends them back to direct the Troop to their quarters, there is likewise much fidelity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them that are Quartermasters, by reason that they distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the word and the billi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Corporals which are commonly three belonging unto a Troop of horse are very usefull, it is requisite they should have good experience in the Cavalry, being commonly sent forth with a party of horse to scout, and scoure the high wayes before the body, and to guard some passages of danger, and to assist the Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in placing the Sentinels when the particular squadrons are to perform that service; their places of marching is after this manner, the eldest Corporall marches on the right hand of the Front, the second Corporall marches on the right hand of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond squadron, the youngest Corporall marches on the right hand of the last squadron.</p>
            <p>The Trumpeters which are usuall too belonging unto a Troop of horse, ought to be men of a pregnant wit and very industrious, fit to deliver Embassages when they are sent, they are to observe if they can have so much liberty the enemies workes and guards, and what they can further gather or espy in the enemies quarters, and so report it unto his commander in chiefe; he must prescisely at the time appointed him by his superiours, sound the Boutezselle, that is clap on your saddles, the next is the Chevall, that is mount on horseback, the next sound of the Trumpet is the standard, that is repaire to your standard; therefore it is requisite that the Troop be distinctly taught to know the severall sounds of the Trumpet, as when to saddle, when to mount, when to repaire to their stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard; when to troop on, when to give the charge, when to retreat, when to attend the watch, and the like. All which they must punctually obey, as being the loud voice of the Commander, the Trumpeter must alwaies have his Trumpet with him, because it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more ready to sound an Alarme when occasion shall require the same. It is requisite for a Trooper to be of a sound and active body, of a fitting age, as from twenty to forty yeares of age, of a resolute spirit, as befitting a horseman, who is to meet the enemy and not to stay his comming, he ought to be of an ingenious mind to learn the perfection of a souldier, to ow obedience to his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officers, one that loveth and knoweth what belongeth to a

            <p>The next thing we are to treat of is, the arming of the Cavalrie which is of two sorts, chiefly defensive, and offensive. The arming of the Currasseer is chiefly defensive, as with a close caske or head-peece, gorget, brest-plate, pistoll proofe, and placket to make it carbine-proofe. Poulderons, and Vambraces, Gantlets, Tassets, Cassets, and Garderans, to arme him fitly downe to the knee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and so loe as the calves behind with a Buffe Coate under his arms, a good sword stiffe and sharp pointed, two good fire-locks, Pistols, In hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sters at his Saddle, with a good Poleaxe, a good strong horse of fifteen handfuls high, his Saddle and Bitt must be strong and usefull, hee must weare a Scarfe on his Headpiece, hee must have false Reines to his bridle made of an Iron or brasse chain, covered over with leather, that if his other Reins should be cut, he may have them to guide his Horse with all as before.</p>
            <p>The Harquebuses and Carbines arming is chiefly offensive, his defensive Arms, as only an open Caske or Head-peece, a back and brest with buffe coat under his armes; his offensive A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mes are a good Harquebus, a Carbine hanging on his right side in a belt by a sweble, a flask and Carthareg case, and spannes, and good fire-lock pistols in houlsters. At his saddle a good stiffe sword sharp pointed, and a good poll-axe in his hand, a good tall horse of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen handfulls high, strong and nimble, with false raines to your bridle made of an Iron Chain as the former. The Dragoones arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is only offensive, having a good fire and cock musket somthing,


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45:7"/>
a wider bore, then ordinary hanging in a belt by a sweble at his side, with a good sword and ordinary horse, it being only to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate his march, for he must perform his service on foot, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary marching is usually ten a brest, and when they come in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nine of them alight casting the bridle over the next side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans horse necke, and for one in ten serves to keepe their horses, the rest performe the service; it is a good and speciall principle, to have our souldiers both horse and foot well chosen, well armed, and well disciplined. The next thing wee have to treat on, is to teach the Cavalrie the use of the horse and armes, concerning your horse, you must be carefull to observe these few following directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is to have him alwayes ready at command, as to pace, trot, gallop, or run in full carreers, also to advance, stop suddenly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and turn readily to either hand, to teach him to turne readily, you must use him often to ride the Ring, and the figure eight, first in the greater compasse, and afterwards in a lesser, by degrees: first on his pace, then on his trot, and so to his gallop; and lastly, in full careere, you may teach him this by using him unto your hand, legge, and voice, for the using him unto your hand you must observe not to move your arme at all, but your rist only; this is excellent for facings, as if you would have him turn to the left, a little motion of the left little finger on that raine, and a touch of the left leg not using the spurre doth it, if you would have him face about to the left, you must use the same motion a little har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the use of the leg if you would have him trot, you must move both your legs a little forward if gallops move them more forward, and if you would have him run in full careere, you must move them most of all forward, and your bodie a little forward with them, it were good after ever motion to keepe him a little while in that motion, as when you bid him stand, to stand a while when you face to either hand to stand in that posture, a while giving him sometimes as a reward when hee hath well done, a piece of bread or the like: for the voice you must use him to these words, as advance, hold, turn, stand, or the like, but it were farre better to use him chiefly to the motions of the hand and legs, because the voice


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45:8"/>
cannot always be heard as in the time of fight or the like, now to teach him to go side-ways which is very usefull for closing of your Files, you must lay his provender at a distance from him in the Manger, keeping him from turning his head towards it, you must use him to the smell of Gunpowder, a sight of fire and armour, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Drums and Trumpets, and shouting of Guns but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, when he is eating of his Oats you may fire a little traine of Gunpowder in the Manger, at a little distance from him, and so neerer by degrees. In like manner you may fire a Pistoll at a little distance from him in the stable, and so neerer by degrees, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Drum, or Trumpet may be used to him in the stable, the Groom may sometimes dresse him in armour, using him sometimes to eat his Oats on the Drum head, In the fields when you are on his back cause a Musquet and your selfe to fire on each other at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient distance, thereupon riding up unto him with speed, making a sodain stand, also you may use to ride him up against a compleat armour set on a stack a purpose, that hee may overthrow it, and so trample it under his feet, so that by these meanes, the horse finding that hee receiveth no harme, may become bold to approach any object; you must use him to ride one Mountaines and on even ways, and to be exercised to leap, swim, run, and stop sodainly, and the like.</p>
            <p>The next thing in order to teach the Cavalier is the use of the Armie, now, for brevity sake I shall purposely omit the postures of the horseman, it being of little use in service, and only acquaint you with those things that are materiall.</p>
            <p>Now if you use Cartrages, you shall finde in your Crattreg case a turned wooden pin which you must take, having cut lengths of white paper something broader then the pin is in length, and roule the paper on the pin, then twist one end of the paper, and fill it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most full of powder, then put the bullet on the top of the powder, twisting that end also, then put it into your Carttreg case, now when you come to lade your Carbine or Pistols with these Cartreges, you must bite off that end of the paper where the powder is, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45:8"/>
it into your Carbine or Pistol, then put in that bullet, and some of that paper will serve for a wad after it, and Ram home, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes observe that your bullet be not too big, but that it may roule home to the Powder, for if there be any distance between the bullet and the powder, it is likely to breake the barrell of your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine or Pistoll: But if you use a flaske, which, in my judgement, is far better then Carttreges, because that many times, the trotting of your horse in long march, shaketh out all the powder out of your Carttrages, and thereby causes you to bee unprovided for the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain charge of the enemie, you must gage your flaske, and so lade your Carbine or Pistol with powder and bullet as before, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prime before you have spand, and never span before you have just need, because many times the firelock pistols will nor goe off if they have stood long spand. Now the quantity of powder u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually required, for the lading of either Carbine or Pistol is halfe the weight of the bullet, but to avoid the cariage of either Cartrage case or flaske, there is a new invented spanner which contains some sixe charges with priming powder, which is more many times then is used in our skirmiges.</p>
            <p>The next thing in order is to shew you the exercise of the horse, in their motions, wherein is to be understood the true distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Horse and Horse, which is to be six foot at their open order, and three foot at their close order, the distance being taken from the head and tail of the Horses; in the File and the like distance, in rank now the Motions for the Cavalrie are of foure kinds, as Facings, Doublings, Countermarchings, and Wheelings: the use of Facings is to make the Troop perfect, to be sodainly prepared for a Charge on either Flank or Reare, Doublings of Ranks or by half Files, or by Bringers up, serveth to strengthen the Front, Doubling the Files serveth to strengthen the Flanks, Countermarching serveth to reduce the File-leaders into the place of the Bringers up, that so the best men may be ready to receive the charge of the Enemy in the Reare: the use of Wheelings is to bring the Front which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly consists of best and ablest men to receive the charge of the


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45:9"/>
Enemy in the Reare, the use of Wheelings is to bring the Front, which commonly consists of best and ablest men to receive the Charge of the Enemy on either Flank or Reare, and also unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Charge the Enemy on either Flanke or Reare, these motions for the more easier apprehending of them as represented in Figures by a Troop of Horse consisting of 72 Horsmen, the Fileleaders and Bringers up are distinguished by a different Letter, but because it may be profitable unto some, I shall first give you the proper words of Command together that belong unto the Excercising of a Troop of Horse, and afterward insert the Figures with the words of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the Reasons of a very Motion.</p>
            <p>First, march into the field foure in Rank when you come into the Field command to double their Ranke, which make eight in Ranke, then command to open to the right and left, as they they march to their open Order of six foot distance, then command to stand and silently hearken unto the word of Command.</p>

It is the policie of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my many times to give false alarms for two reasons, first, to weary out your men by continuall night watches: and secondly, to cause your men by continuall false alarms to grow secure and carelesse, that so by that means they may have the greater advantage by com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming on them unawares, therefore it should be the wisdome of the Commanders to give the alarm secretly without noise from one to another, that so the Enemy may not boast of his putting you to trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, but only weary out himself. The fittest place for the Cavalrie to lie in Garrison, is in the Frontier Towns towards the Enemy, that thereby the incursions of the Enemy may be hindred, and your own friend the better secured, besides it gives courage to brave sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is necssary for a politique Commander, for the better atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of many worthy designes to accommodate himselfe with severall trusty spies; who faining discontent for want of pay or the like, are to enter themselves in the enemies service of the Cavalerie, who for the most part are best acquainted with the sudain designes of the enemie, and to agree with these spies of the place under what tree or the like; where they may convey their letters of intelligence, giving them order when their advice is of greatest importance to come themselves, these spies ought to bee trusty, witty, and well rewarded, which will cause them to expose themselves unto all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and dangers to give intelligence.</p>
            <p>The next thing considerable is the embatteling of a Regiment of horse, which is to be considered two wayes, that is, first by way of offence to assail a Quarter, or to give the charge in fight: Secondly by way of defence, meeting the enemie in marching or the like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Troops in battalia by single combate, or else united in a grosse body together. The best and most advantageable way for the surprising of a Quarter, is to be secretly and sodainly assailed, which may be performed after this manner, or the like. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of horse consisting for the most part of seven Troops, who are to be divided severally, the first Troop marching secretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any forerunner, coming neer the enemies Quarters, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

themselves to be discovered by the enemies Sentinels shall sodainly without losing any time charge the Sentinels, and enter the Quarters with them immediately surprising the Corps de gard, the second Troop immediately following, shall possesse themselves of the Alarme place, the third Troop shall strait ways possesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Market place, the fourth Troop shall with speede run throvgh each street, keeping the souldiers, in and thereby hinder them from mounting on horseback, or uniting of themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the fist Troop being entred, and hearing where the greatest noise is, shall immediately repair thither and alight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> entring the houses, either put to the sword or take prisoners all whom they shall find to be enemies. The rest of the body may place themselvs in the most convenient places on either side of the Town, for the better surprising of those Souldiers that shall indeavour to escape through the gardens or other back waies, by reason of the horses running through the Streets within the Town, hindering them either to mount on horseback, or unite themselves together. Now although your enemie consists of twice so much strength as your selves, which sometimes will cause them to be the more secure and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in their watches, yet will they not be able by reason of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and sodain surprize to stand against you.</p>
            <p>The next thing considerable is, to charge the enemie in the field in a united or grosse body, or else by single Troops, In fighting with the enemie in a pitcht field, with all your Forces united into one intire bodie, these things are considerable, as the place, whether it be hilly or lev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, as also that there be sufficient rome behind you for a retreating place, so that you be not straitned of ground, which manie times proves a great disadvantage, likewise you must always appoint troops of Reserve, which are not by any means to engage themselves in fight till the first Troops have given the charge, and are reasembled behind them to make readie again for the second charge, your Curriassers if you have any are fit for Troopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve which gives a great deal of courage unto the other Cavalrie, this must always be observed either in grosse bodies or in single Troops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45:24"/>In grosse bodies if you have field room enough, all the Troops are to be drawn up into battalia, each being not above three deepe, likewise each troop must be at least a hundred paces distance behind each other for the better avoiding of disorder, those troops that are to give the first charge being drawn up into battail as before, are to be at their close order, every left hand mans right knee must be close locked under his right hand mans left ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In this order they are to advance toward the Enemy with an easie pace, firing their Carbines at a convenient distance, always aiming at their Enemies brest or lower, because that pouder is of an elevating nature, then drawing neere the Enemy, they are with their right hands to take forth one of their Pistols out of their houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and holding the lock up are most firing as before, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving on Pistoll ready charged, spann'd and primed in your houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, in case of a retreat as I have shown before, having thus fired the troops are to charge the Enemy in a full career, but in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with their swords fastned with a Riband or the like unto their wrists, for feare of losing out of their hand, if they should chance to misse their blow, placing the pomel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If one single Troop met another, your Enemy charging you in full career, you are sodainly to divide your Troop in the middle: on Flank from the other, and so the Enemie being in his full career, must either passe through and effect little, or else stopping sodainly disorder his Troops, and thereby give you a fit occasion to wheel both your Flanks inward, to charge him in the Reer.

The Officer that leads on the Squadron, that charges the Front; is to charg as the others in ful career, til he comes close unto the Pikes heads, and then sodainly stopping is sodainly to comand with an elevated voice, close your file or the like, which sodain command being loud will sometimes cause those Pikes that stand charged against the other two Squadrons, either in the Flank or Reer, to extend their bodies towards the Front, which will give a fit advantage unto one of the Squadrons to slip in between, and so make way for the other two Squadrons to charge in, and utterly rout the Front, but you must always observe that this stratagem must always be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
