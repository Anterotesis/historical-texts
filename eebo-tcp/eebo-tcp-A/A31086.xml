            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Baron of

            <head>The Publisher to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THese <hi>SERMONS</hi> are thought
fit to be put together in one
<hi>Volume,</hi> because of their affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to one another, all of them relating
to the same Argument, and tending to
reform the several Vices of the Tongue.
The <hi>Two</hi> last indeed, against <hi>Pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calnesse</hi>
and meddling in the affairs of
others, do not so properly belong to this
Subject; but considering that this Vice
is chiefly managed by the Tongue, and
is almost ever attended with some irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
and indiscretion of Speech,
they are not altogether so forreign and
unsutable to it.</p>
            <p>Never were Discourses of this kind
more necessary then in this wicked and
perverse Generation; wherein the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
here reprehended are so very rife,
and out of the abundant impiety of
men's hearts there proceeds so much
<hi>Evil-speaking</hi> of all kinds, in Atheistical
Discourses, and blasphemous Raillery,
and prophane Swearing; and when
Censoriousness, Detraction, and Slander


<pb facs="tcp:53987:4"/>
are scarce accounted faults, even with
those who would seem to be most strict
in other parts and duties of Religion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Authour</hi> of these <hi>SERMONS</hi>
as he was exemplary in all manner of
conversation, so especially in this part of
it; being of all men I ever had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to know the clearest of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
guilt, and most free from <hi>Offending
in Word;</hi> coming as near, as is possible
for humane frailty to doe, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Idea of S. <hi>James</hi> his <hi>perfect man.</hi> So
that in these excellent Discourses of his
he hath onely transcribed his own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
All the Rules which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
he most religiously observ'd himself,
and was very uneasie when at at any
time he saw them transgress'd by others
in his company.</p>
            <p>There is one thing needs excuse,
namely, That several things which are
more briefly and summarily said in the
First Sermon, are repeated in some of
the following Discourses: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it could not well be avoided, but
either by wholly leaving out the First
Sermon, or very much mangling some
of the rest, will, it is hoped, for that
reason be easily pardoned.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Sentence stands in the head
of a discourse concerning the
Tongue, (that doubtfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
of good and evil,) wherein how
excellent benefits, and how grievous
mischiefs, it, as rightly or perversly
wielded, is apt to produce, how it is
both a sweet instrument of all goodness,
and a sharp weapon of all iniquity, is
positively laid down, and by fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons
illustrated. But secluding all
relation to the Context, the words may
well be considered singly by themselves:
and as such they instruct us, asserting a
certain Truth; they direct us, implying
a good Duty. They assert that man to
be perfect, who offends not in Speech;


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53987:6"/>
and they consequently imply, that we
should strive to avoid offending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:<note place="margin">Deut. 18. 13.</note>
for to <hi>be perfect,</hi> and to <hi>go on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 40.</note>
are precepts,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 48. &amp; 19. 21.</note> the observance
whereof is incumbent on us. We shall
first briefly explain the Assertion,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 11.</note> and
then declare its truth;<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> afterwards we
shall press somewhat couched in the
Duty.</p>
            <p>To <hi>OFFEND</hi> originally signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies

hit dangerously upon somewhat lying
cross our way, so as thereby to be cast
down, or at least to be disordered in
our posture, and stopt in our progress:
whence it is well transferr'd to denote
our being through any incident tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
brought into sin, whereby a man
is thrown down, or bowed from his
upright state, and interrupted from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
a steddy course of Piety and
Vertue. By an usual and apposite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of speaking, our tenour of life is
called <hi>a Way,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 23, 24.</note> our conversation <hi>Walking,</hi>
our actions <hi>Steps,</hi> our observing good
laws <hi>Vprightness,</hi> our transgression of
them <hi>Tripping, Faultring, Falling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>NOT OFFENDING INWORD,</hi>
we may easily then conceive to be


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53987:6"/>
understood such a constant restraint,
and such a carefull guidance of our
Tongue, that it doth not transgress the
rules prescribed unto it by Divine Law,
or by good Reason; that it thwarteth
not the natural ends and proper uses
for which it was framed, to which it is
fitted; such as chiefly are promoting
God's glory, our Neighbour's benefit,
and our own true welfare.</p>
            <p>By <hi>A PERFECT MAN</hi> is meant
a person accomplished and complete in
goodness, one of singular worth and
integrity,<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 4.</note> a brave and excellent man,
who, as to the continual tenour of his
life, is free from all notorious defects,
and hainous faults;<note place="margin">Act. 13. 22.</note> like <hi>David, fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all God's will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 6.</note> and <hi>having respect to
all Gods commandments;</hi> like <hi>Zachary</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>

               <hi>walking in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
and ordinances of the Lord
blameless.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 9. &amp; 17. 1.</note> Thus was <hi>Noah,</hi> thus was
<hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 1. 1.</note> thus was <hi>Job</hi> perfect. This
is the notion of <hi>Perfection</hi> in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
Not an absolute exemption from
all blemish of Soul, or blame in life;
for such a Perfection is inconsistent with
the nature and state of Man here, where
none with modesty or with truth can
say,<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I have made my heart clean, I am


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53987:7"/>

must confess with <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 9. 20.</note> 
               <hi>If I justify my
self, mine own mouth shall condemn me;
if I say, I am perfect, it shall prove me
perverse.</hi>

my Text; which words may serve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
these. <hi>In many things,</hi> saith he,
<hi>we offend all;</hi> that is, there is no man
absolutely perfect: but <hi>if any man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
not in word,</hi> (that is, if a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly

in all the course of his practice;
<hi>able</hi> (as it follows) <hi>to bridle the whole

effect the words import this, That a

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53987:7"/>
The truth of which Aphorism may
from several Considerations appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A good Governance of Speech is
a strong evidence of a good Mind; of a
mind pure from vicious desires, calm
from disorderly passions, void of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest
intentions. For since Speech is
a child of Thought, which the mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
travaileth and teemeth with,<note place="margin">

which after its birth is wont in features
to resemble its parent; since every man
naturally is ambitious to propagate
his conceits, and without a painfull
force cannot smother his resentments;
since especially bad affections (like
stumme or poison) are impetuous and
turgid, so agitating all the spirits, and
so swelling the heart, that it cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
compose, or contain them; since a
distempered constitution of mind, as of
body, is wont to weaken the retentive
faculty, and to force an evacuation of
bad humours; since he that wanteth
the principal wisedom of well ordering
his Thoughts, and mastering his Passions,
can hardly be conceived so prudent, as
long to refrain, or to regulate their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence,
Speech; considering these
things, I say, it is scarce possible, that


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53987:8"/>
he which commonly thinks ill, should
constantly either be well silent, or speak
well. To conceal fire, to check light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to confine a whirlwind, may
perhaps be no less fecible, then to keep
within due compass the exorbitant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Soul, wherein Reason hath
lost its command, so that <hi>quà data por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
where the next passage occurrs, they
should not rush forth, and vent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
A vain Mind naturally will
bubble forth or fly out in frothy expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
Wrath burning in the breast
will flame out, or at least smoak through
the mouth; rancorous impostumes of
Spite and Malice will at length discharge
purulent matter; Lust boiling within
will soon foam out in lewd discourse.
If the fountain it self is polluted, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
how can the streams be clear, or

               <hi>How can ye, being evil,

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53987:8"/>
It is true, that in some particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or at some times, a foul heart may
be disguised by fair words, or covered
by demure reservedness: Shame, or
Fear, or crafty Design, may often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the declaration of ill thoughts and
purposes. But such fits of dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cannot hold; men cannot abide
quiet under so violent constraints; the
intestine jars, or unkindly truces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Heart and Tongue (those natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
friends) cannot be perpetual, or
very durable: No man can hold his
breath long, or live without evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
through his mouth those steams of
passion which arise from flesh and
bloud.<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 3.</note> 
               <hi>My heart was hot within me,
while I was musing, the fire burned; then

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
Hence it is, that Speech is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
judged the truest character of
the mind, and the surest test of inward
worth; as that which discloseth the
<hi>hidden man of the heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 4.</note> which unloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the closets of the breast, which
draws the Soul out of her dark recesses
into open light and view, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
our thoughts visible, and our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53987:9"/>
palpable. Hence, <hi>Loquere, ut
te videam,</hi> Speak, that I may see you,
or know what kind of man you are, is
a saying which all men, at first meeting,
do in their hearts direct one to another:
neither commonly doth any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
more to ground a judgment upon
concerning the worth or ability of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then opportunity of hearing him
to discourse for a competent time: yea
often, before a man hath spoken ten
words, his mind is caught, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
sentence is passed upon it. Such
a strict affinity and connexion do all
men suppose between Thoughts and
Words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence, that the use of Speech
is it self a great ingredient into our
Practice, and hath a very general influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon whatever we doe, may be
inferred, that whoever governeth it
well, cannot also but well order his
whole life. The extent of Speech must
needs be vast, since it is nearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate
to Thought it self, which it
ever closely traceth, widely ranging
through all the immense variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
so that men almost as often speak
incogitantly, as they think silently.
Speech is indeed the Rudder that stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53987:9"/>
humane affairs, the Spring that set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the wheels of action on going; the
Hands work, the Feet walk, all the
Members and all the Senses act by its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and impulse; yea, most Thoughts
are begotten, and most Affections stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up thereby: it is it self most of our
employment, and what we doe beside
it, is however guided and moved by it.
It is the profession and trade of many,
it is the practice of all men, to be in a
manner continually talking. The chief
and most considerable sort of men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
all their concernments meerly by
Words; by them Princes rule their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
Generals command their Armies,
Senatours deliberate and debate about
the great matters of State: by them Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
plead causes, and Judges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
them; Divines perform their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and minister their instructions;
Merchants strike up their bargains, and
drive on all their traffick. Whatever
almost great or small is done in the
Court or in the Hall, in the Church or
at the Exchange, in the School or in
the Shop, it is the Tongue alone that
doeth it: 'tis the force of this little ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
that turneth all the humane
world about. It is indeed the use of


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53987:10"/>
this strange organ which rendreth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life, beyond the simple life of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures, so exceedingly various
and compounded; which creates such a
multiplicity of business, and which
transacts it; while by it we communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
our secret conceptions, transfusing
them into others; while therewith we
instruct and advise one another; while
we consult about what is to be done,
contest about right, dispute about truth;
while the whole business of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of commerce, of government, and
administration of justice, of learning,
and of Religion, is managed thereby;
yea, while it stoppeth the gaps of time,
and filleth up the wide intervalls of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
our recreations and divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(the which do constitute a great
portion of our life) mainly consisting
therein: so that, in comparison thereof,
the execution of what we determine
and all other action do take up small
room; and even all that usually depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
upon foregoing Speech, which
persuadeth, or counselleth, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
it. Whence the Province of
Speech being so very large, it being so
universally concerned, either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
as the matter, or by consequence


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53987:10"/>
as the source of our actions, he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
governeth it well, may justly be
esteemed to live very excellently.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To govern the Tongue well is a
matter of exceeding difficulty, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
not onely hearty goodness, but
great judgment and art, together with
much vigilance and circumspection;
whence the doing it argues a high pitch
of Vertue. For since the Tongue is a
very loose and versatile engine, which
the least breath of thought doth stir,
and set on going any way, it cannot
but need much attention to keep it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a steddy rest, or in a right mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Since numberless swarms of things
roving in the fancy do thence incessantly
obtrude themselves upon the Tongue,
very much application of mind and
great judgment are requisite to select
out of them those few which are good
and fit, rejecting all that is bad, and
improper to be spoken. Since conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
temptations occurr provoking or
alluring to miscarriage in this kind, (for
beside internal propensions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
of Soul, every object we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
every company we are engaged
in, every accident befalling us doth sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
somewhat inviting thereto; the


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53987:11"/>
condition of our neighbour moving us,
if high, to flatter, if low, to insult;
our own fortune prompting, if prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
to boast, if cross, to murmur; any
action drawing from us, if it pleaseth
us, fond admiration, if it disliketh,
harsh censure: since, I say, we are thus
at every turn obnoxious to speak amiss,)
it must be a matter of huge skill and
caution, of mighty industry and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to decline it. We for that purpose
need to imitate that earnest and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
care of the Holy Psalmist, which
he thus expresseth;<note place="margin">Psal. 17. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I have</hi> (saith he)
<hi>purposed that my mouth shall not offend:</hi>
and,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I said,</hi> (saith he again) <hi>I will take
heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
while the wicked is before me.</hi> And
thus to maintain a constant guard over
his heart and ways, thus in consequence
thereof to curb and rule his Speech
well, must assuredly be the mark of a
very good person. Especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Irregular Speech hath commonly
divers more advantages for it, and fewer
checks upon it, then other bad Practice
hath. A man is apt (I mean) to speak
ill with less dissatisfaction and regret


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53987:11"/>
from within; he may doe it with less
controll and less hazard from without,
then he can act ill. Bad Actions are
gross and bulky, taking up much time,
and having much force spent on them,
whence men easily observe and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them in themselves and others: but
ill Words are subtile and transient, soon
born, and as soon deceased; whence
men rashly utter them without much
heed before them, or much reflexion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them. Bad actions have also usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
visible effects, immediately conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
on them: but Words operate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
and at distance; so that men
hardly discern what will follow them, or
what they have effected. There are
also frequent occasions of speaking ill
upon presumption of secrecy, and thence
of indisturbance and impunity; yea,
doing so is often entertained with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence,
and encouraged with applause:
the vilest abuses of speech (even Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
Treason and Slander them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
may be safely whispered into
ears, which will receive them with
pleasure and commendation. Bad Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
also in most cases is neither strictly
prohibited, nor severely chastised by
humane Laws, as bad Action is. Whence


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53987:12"/>
ordinarily the guilt of this misbehavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
seems little or none; and persons
much practising it, both in their own
conceit, and in the opinion of others,
do often pass for innocent. Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
here will hardly discern any rule,
or acknowledge any obligation: the
Tongue they deem is free, and any
words may be dispensed with: it is
sufficient if they abstain from doing gross
wrong or mischief, they have a right
and liberty to say any thing.<note place="margin">Psal. 12. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Our lips
are our own; who is Lord over us?</hi> so
are men commonly prone to say, with
those in the Psalm. Hence whosoever,
notwithstanding such encouragements
to offend herein, and so few restraints
from it, doth yet carefully forbear it,
governing his Tongue according to
rules of duty and reason, may justly
be reputed a very good man. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whereas most of the enormities,
the mischiefs and the troubles whereby
the Souls of men are defiled, their
minds discomposed, and their lives dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,
are the fruits of ill-governed
Speech; it being that chiefly which
perverteth justice, which soweth dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which raiseth all bad passions and


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53987:12"/>
animosities, which embroileth the world
in seditions and factions, by which men
wrong and abuse, deceive and seduce,
defame and disgrace one another,
whereby consequently innumerable
vexations and disturbances are created
among men; he that by well governing
his Speech preserveth himself from the
guilt, disengageth his mind and life
from the inconveniences of all such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
(from the discreet and honest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
thereof enjoying both inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and peace,) must necessarily be
as a very wise and happy, so a very good
and worthy person.</p>
            <p n="6">6. His Tongue also so ruled cannot
but produce very good fruits of honour
to God, of benefit to his Neighbour, of
comfort to himself: it will be sweet
and pleasant, it will be wholsome and
usefull; endearing conversation, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
peacefull society, breeding and
nourishing love, instructing and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
or chearing and comforting the
hearers.<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 18.</note> His <hi>tongue is health;</hi> His
<hi>mouth is a well</hi> and <hi>tree of life;</hi>

               <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 26.</note> Such (as the
Wise-man telleth us) are the effects of


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53987:13"/>
innocent, sober and well-ordered dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
the which do much commend
their authour, and declare the excellent
virtue of that tree from which such
fruits do grow.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Lastly, The observation how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
this practice is, (in any good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree)
may strongly assure the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
thereof. For the rarer (especially
in morals) any good thing is, the more
noble and worthy it is; that rarity ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
somewhat of peculiar difficulty in
the attainment or the atchievement
thereof. Nothing is more obvious to
common experience, then that persons,
who in the rest of their demeanour
and dealings appear blameless, yea who
in regard to other points of duty would
seem nice and precise, are extremely
peccant in this kind. We may see di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
otherwise much restraining and
much denying themselves, who yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
themselves a strange licenciousness
in speaking whatever their humour or
their passion dictates. Many, in other
respects harmless, (who would not for
any thing smite or slay folks,) we may
observe with their Tongue to commit
horrible outrages upon any man that
comes in their way. Frequently persons


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53987:13"/>
very punctual in their dealings, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unjust in their language, cheating
and robbing their neighbour of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
by envious detraction and
hard censure. They who abhor shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a man's bloud, will yet without
any scruple or remorse, by calumnious
tales and virulent reproaches, assassinate
his credit, and murther his good name,
although to him perhaps far more dear
and precious then his life. Commonly
such as are greatly staunch in other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of pleasure, are enormously
intemperate in speaking, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent
of their Tongue: men in all
other parts of morality rigorously sober,
are often in this very wild and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.
Yea, not seldome we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that even mighty pretenders to
godliness, and zealous practisers of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
cannot forbear speaking things
plainly repugnant to God's Law, and
very prejudicial to his honour. Thus
it is observable to be now; and thus
we may suppose that it always hath been.
So of his time S. <hi>Hierome</hi> (or rather
S. <hi>Paulinus,</hi> in his excellent Epistle to
<hi>Celantia)</hi> testifies:<note place="margin">Tanta hújus mali libido mentes homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num invasit, ut etiam qui procul ab ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is vitiis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesserunt, in istud tamen, quasi in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremum Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli laqueum, incidant. <hi>Ad Celant.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Such a lust</hi> (saith
he, concerning the ill-governance of
Speech) <hi>of this evil hath invaded the


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53987:14"/>
minds of men, that even those who have
far receded from other vices, do yet fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, as into the last snare of the Devil.</hi>
So it appears, that among all sorts of
good Practice, the strict Governance of
the Tongue is least ordinary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
that it is most admirable, and
excellent. And this is all I shall say for
Confirmation of the Point asserted.</p>
            <p>NOW then, as it is our duty to
aim at perfection, or to endeavour the
attainment of integrity in Heart and
Life, so we should especially labour to
govern our Tongue, and guard it from
offence. To which purpose it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
that we should well understand
and consider the nature of those several
Offences to which Speech is liable, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the special pravity, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and inconvenience of each: for
did we know and weigh them, we
should not surely either like, or dare to
incurr them.</p>
            <p>The Offences of Speech are many
and various in kind; so many as there
be of Thought and of Action, unto
which they do run parallel: according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they well may be distinguished from
the difference of objects which they do


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53987:14"/>
specially respect. Whence 1. some of them
are committed against God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
Piety; 2. others against our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and violate Justice, or Charity,
or Peace; 3. others against our Selves,
infringing Sobriety, Discretion, or Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty;
or, 4. some are of a more general and
abstracted nature, rambling through all
matters, and crossing all the heads of
Duty. It is true, that in most, or in
all offences of Speech, there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of Impiety, Iniquity, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence;
for that by all sorts of ill
Speaking we sin against God, and break
his Commandment; we injure our
Neighbour, at least by contagion and
bad example; we abuse our Selves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
guilt, and exposing our selves
to punishment: also the general vices
of Speech (unadvisedness and vanity)
do constantly adhere to every bad
word: Yet commonly each evil Speech
hath a more direct and immediate aspect
upon some one of those objects, (God,
our Neighbour, or our Selves,) and is
peculiarly repugnant to one of those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Vertues (Piety, Charity, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety)
unto which all our Duty is
reduced. Now according to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
I should, if time would give


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53987:15"/>
leave, describe, and dissuade particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
all these sorts of Offence: but
(since I must be respectfull to patience,
and carefull my self not to offend in
Speech) I shall confine the rest of my
present Discourse to the first sort, the
Offences against Piety; and even of
them I shall (waving the rest) onely
touch two or three, insinuating some
reasons why we should eschew them.
These are,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Speaking blasphemously against
God,<note place="margin">(Psal. 78. 19. Num. 21. 5. Job 34. 37.)</note> or reproachfully concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or to the disgrace of Piety, with
intent to subvert mens faith in God, or
to impair their reverence of him. There
hath been a race of men (and would
to God that race were not even till now
continued) concerning whom the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
said,<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>They speak loftily, they set

               <note place="margin">Dan. 11. 36.</note> 
               <hi>speak marvellous things
against the God of Gods.</hi> This of all
impieties is the most prodigiously Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantick,
the most signal practice of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
towards God, and downright wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of war against Heaven. Of all


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53987:15"/>
               <hi>weapons formed against God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 54. 17.</note> the Tongue
most notoriously doth impugn him:
for we cannot reach Heaven with our
hands, or immediately assault God by
our actions: other ill practice indeed
obliquely, or by consequence disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth
God, and defameth goodness;
but profane Discourse is directly level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at them, and doth immediately
touch them, as its formal objects. Now
doing thus argueth an extremity both
of folly and naughtiness: for he that
doeth it, either believeth the existence
of God, and the truth of Religion; or
he distrusts them. If he doth believe
them, what a desperate madness is it in
him, advisedly to invite certain mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to his home, and pull down hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest
vengeance on his head, by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the irresistible power, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the inflexible justice of God?
What an abominable villany and base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is it, thus to abuse God's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
goodness and mercy, offering
such despight to the Authour of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and free donour of all the good he
enjoys? What a monstrous conspiracy
is it of stupidity and perverseness in him,
thus wilfully to defy his own welfare,
to forfeit all capacity of happiness; to


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53987:16"/>
precipitate and plunge himself into a
double Hell, that of bitter remorse here,
that of endless pain hereafter? But if
he that reproacheth God and Religion
be supposed distrustfull of their being
and reality, neither so is he excusable
from like degrees of folly and pravity:
for, beside the wild extravagance of
such disbelief, against legions of cogent
arguments and pregnant testimonies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the voice of nature and faith of
history, against the settled judgment of
wise and sober persons, who have studied
and considered the point, against the
current tradition of all Ages, and general
consent of mankind; all which to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
no less demonstrateth high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion
then arrogance; beside also
the palpable silliness which he displays,
in causelesly (or for no other cause then
soothing a phantastick humour) draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon himself the anger and hatred
of all men, who are concerned for the
interests of their Religion, thrusting
himself into great dangers and mischiefs
thence imminent to him both from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
zeal, and publick law; beside (I
say) these evident follies, there is an
unsufferable insolence and horrible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
apparent in this practice: for 'tis no


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53987:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
less then the height of insolence, thus
to affront mankind in matters of highest
consideration, and deepest resentment
with it; not onely thwarting its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
notions, but vilifying the chief
objects of its highest respect and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of its main care and concernment;
so making the fiercest invasion that can
be on its credit, and charging it with
greatest fondness. Who can endure,
that He, whom he apprehends to be
his grand Parent, his best Friend and
Benefactour, his great Patron and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
should in down-right terms be
defamed or disparaged? Who can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
bear, that wherein he placeth
his utmost hopes, and supreme felicity,
to be expressly slighted or scorned?
Who can take the offering to doe this,
otherwise then for a most injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
upon his judgment and his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice?
If he cannot believe in God, he
may let them alone who do: if he will
not practise Religion, he may forbear
to persecute it. He cannot pretend any
zeal; 'tis therefore onely pride that
moves him to disturb us. So may eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man with all the reason in the world
complain against the profane Talker.
Seeing also it is most evident, that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53987:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reverence of God, and a conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
regard to Religion, do produce
great benefits to mankind, being indeed
the main supports of common honesty
and sobriety, the sole curbs, effectually
restraining men from unjust fraud and
violence, from brutish lusts and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
since apparently Religion prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
the best rules, and imposeth the
strongest engagements to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of those actions, whereby not
onely mens private welfare is promoted,
and ordinary conversation is sweetned,
and common life is adorned, but also
whereby publick order and peace are
maintained;<note place="margin">Haud scio an, pietate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus Deos sublatâ, fides etiam, &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietas humani generis, &amp; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissima virtus justitia tolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Cic.</hi>
               </note> since (as <hi>Cicero</hi> with good

vain to fansy, that assuredly without
Religious conscience any one will be a
good Subject, a true Friend, or an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

can induce men to prefer duty to
their Prince, the prosperity of their
Country, fidelity toward their Friends
or Neighbours, before their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53987:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
interests and pleasure: Since, I
say, the credit of Religion is so very
beneficial and usefull to mankind, 'tis
plain, that he must be exceedingly spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and malicious, who shall by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Discourse endeavour to supplant or
shake it. He that speaketh against God
or Providence, hath assuredly a pique
at Goodness, and would not have it
predominant in the hearts of men. He
that disparages Religion, doth certainly
take his aim against Vertue, and would
not have it practised in the world: his
meaning plainly is, to effect, if he can,
that Men should live like Beasts in foul
impurities, or like Fiends in mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
iniquities. Such an one therefore
is not to be taken as a simple embracer
of Errour, but as a spitefull designer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
common Good. For indeed,
were any man assured (as none can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so much as probable grounds think
it) that Religion had been onely devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by men, as a supplemental aid to
Reason and Force,<note place="margin">Vt quos ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio non posset, eos ad offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um religio duceret. <hi>Cic.</hi>
               </note> (drawing them, whom
the one could not persuade, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it were meerly an implement of policy,
or a knack to make people loyal to


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53987:18"/>
their Prince, upright in their dealings,
sober in their conversations, moderate
in their passions, vertuous in all their
doings; it were yet a most barbarous
naughtiness and inhumanity in him to
assay the overthrow thereof, with the
defeating so excellent purposes: he that
should attempt it, justly would deserve
to be reputed an enemy to the welfare
of mankind, to be treated as a pestilent
disturber of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another like Offence against Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
is, to speak loosely and wantonly
about Holy things, (things nearly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God or to Religion,) to make
such things the matter of sport and
mockery, to play and trifle with them.
But of this I shall have occasion to speak
in another Discourse.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another grand Offence against
Piety is rash and vain Swearing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
discourse; an Offence which now
strangely reigns and rages in the world,
passing about in a specious garb, and
under glorious titles, as a gentile and
gracefull quality, a mark of fine bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and a point of high gallantry.
Who, forsooth, now is the brave Spark,
and complete Gentleman, but he that
hath the skil and confidence (O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53987:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how mean a skill how mad a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence!)
to lard every sentence with
an Oath or a Curse; making bold at
every turn to salute God, fetching him
down from Heaven to avouch any idle
prattle, to second any giddy passion,
to concern himself in any trivial affair
of his; yea, calling and challenging
the Almighty to damn and destroy him?
But somewhat to repress these fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
and vile practices, let us, I pray,
consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Swearing thus is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
and strictly prohibited to us.<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 34, 37.</note> 
               <hi>I
say unto you, Swear not at all: But let
your conversation be Yea, yea, Nay, nay;
for whatsoever is more then these, cometh
from evil:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 12.</note> so our Lord forbids it. <hi>But
above all things, my brethren, swear not—
lest you enter into condemnation:</hi> so doth
Saint <hi>James</hi> warn against it. And is it
not then prodigious, that in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
any man should affect to break
laws so plain, and so severe; that it
should pass here not onely for a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but even for a commendable prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
to violate so manifest and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
a Duty; that so directly to
thwart our Lord himself should be a
thing not in use onely, but in credit


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53987:19"/>
and request among Christians? What
more palpable affront could be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to our Religion, and to all that
is Sacred among us? For, what respect
or force can we imagine reserved to
Religion, while a practice so indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
opposite thereto, in a high degree,
is so current and prevalent?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, according to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and reason of things, it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an intolerable Profaneness, thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly
to make addresses and appeals
to God, invoking his testimony, and
demanding his judgment about trifles;
far more such, then it were a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
and encroachment upon the
Majesty of a Prince, on every petty oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to break into his presence, and
to assail his ears, dragging him to hear
and determin concerning it. Whence
the very light of Nature condemns this
practice, and even Heathens have loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared against it, as derogatory to
the reverence of the Deity, and unsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the gravity of a worthy man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Swearing indeed is by our Holy
Oracles worthily represented to us, as
an especial piece of Worship and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
toward God; wherein, duely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
we piously acknowledge his


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53987:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
chief Attributes, and singular Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:
(his being every-where present,
and conscious of all we say or doe; his
Goodness, and Fidelity, in favouring
truth, and protecting right; his Justice,
in rewarding veracity and equity, in
avenging falshood and iniquity; his
being the Supreme Lord of all persons,
and last Judge in all causes: to signify
and avow these things to God's glory,
Swearing was instituted, and naturally
serveth:) wherefore as all other acts
of Devotion, so this grand one especially
should never be performed without all
serious consideration and humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
the cause should be certainly
just and true, the matter worthy and
weighty, the manner grave and solemn,
the mind framed to earnest attention,
and furnished with devout affections.
Those conditions are always carefully
to be observed, which the Prophet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates,
when he chargeth thus;<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Thou
shalt swear, That Lord liveth, in truth,
in judgment, and in righteousness.</hi> It is
therefore horrible mockery, and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of a most sacred ordinance, when
men presume to use it without any care
or consideration, without any respect or
awe, upon any slight or vain occasion.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53987:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
4. The doing so is also very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to humane Society; for the decision
of Right, the security of Government,
and the preservation of Peace, do much
depend upon an awfull regard to Oaths;
and therefore upon their being onely
used in due manner, and season: the
same do greatly suffer by the contempt
or disregard of them, and consequently
by their common and careless use. They
are the surest bonds by which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men are tied to the attestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of truth, and observance of faith;
the which as by rare and reverent use
they are kept firm and fast, so by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and negligent application of
them (by their prostitution to every
light and toyish matter,) they are quite
dissolved, or much slackned. Whence
the publick seems much concerned, that
this enormity should be retrenched.
For if Oaths generally become cheap
and vile, what will that of Allegeance
signify? if men are wont to dally with
Swearing every-where, can they be
expected to be strict and serious therein
at the Bar, or in the Church? Will
they regard the testimony of God, or
dread his judgment, in one place, or at
one time, whenas every-where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53987:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(upon any, upon no occasion)
they dare to confront and contemn
them?</p>
            <p n="5">5. This way of Swearing is also a
very uncivil and unmannerly practice.
It is not onely a gross rudeness toward
the main body of men, who justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
the Name of God, and loath
such abuses thereof; not onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
defiance to the common Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Law of our Country, which
disallows and condemns it; but it is
very odious and offensive to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Society, if at least there be one
sober person therein: for to any such
person (who retains a sense of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or is any-wise concerned for God's
honour) no language or behaviour can
be more disgustfull; nothing can more
grate the ears or fret the heart of such
an one, then this kind of talk: to give
him the Lie were a complement, to spit
in his face were an obligation, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
thereto. Wherefore 'tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that any person, having in him a
spark of ingenuity, or at all pretending
to good manners, should find in his
heart or deign to use it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This practice also much derogateth
from the credit of him that useth it,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53987:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rendring the truth of what-ever he says
in reason and justice suspected. For he
that is so void of Conscience, as to swear
vainly, what can engage him to speak
truly? He that is so loose in one such
point of obedience to God and Reason,
why should we conceive him strict in
regard to another?</p>
            <p n="7">7. It can be surely no wrong to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
him, since he implies himself not
to be, even in his own opinion, a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
person; since he judges not his
own bare affirmation to deserve belief.
For why,<note place="margin">Tantus in te sit veri amor, ut quicquid dixeris, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum putes. <hi>Hier.</hi>
               </note> if he takes his word to be
competently good, doth he back it
with such Asseverations? why unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
calls he God to witness, if he
thinks his own honesty sufficient to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the truth of what he says? An
honest man, methinks, should scorn
thus to invalidate his own credit, or to
detract from the authority of his word,
which should stand firm upon it self,
and not want an Oath to support it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To excuse this, the Swearer must
be forced to confess another ugly fault
in speaking, that is, impertinence, or
using of wast and insignificant words;
to be charged wherewith he is indeed
however unavoidably liable. For Oaths,


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53987:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as they pass commonly, are meer excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scencies
of Speech, which do nothing
else but encumber and deform it: they
embellish discourse, just as a wen or a
scab does beautifie a face; as a spot or
a patch does adorn a garment. For to
what purpose (I pray) is God's Name
haled into our idle talk? why should
we so often mention him, when we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mean any thing about him? Into
every sentence to foist a dog, or a horse,
would altogether be as proper and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hier.</note>
These superfluous words signify
nothing, but that the speaker little skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the use of speech, or the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
but meaneth to parte any
thing without wit or judgment; that
his fancy is very beggarly, and craves
the aid of any impertinency to relieve
it. One would think, that a man of
sense should grutch to lend his ears, or
incline his attention to such putid stuff;
that without nauseating he should not
endure to see men lavish time, and
squander breath so frivolously.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In fine, this Offence is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
most inexcusable, in that it scarce
hath any temptation to it, or bringeth
with it any advantage; so that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
what (beside meer vanity


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53987:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or perverseness) should dispose men
thereto. It gratifieth no sense, it yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no profit, it procureth no honour:
for the sound of it is not very melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
nor surely was any man ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
for it, or got an estate thereby;
it rather to any good ear maketh a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
and jarring noise, it rather produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
displeasure, dammage, and disgrace.
Wherefore of all dealers in sin the Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
is apparently the silliest, and maketh
the worst bargains for himself: for he
sinneth <hi>gratis,</hi> and (like those in the
Prophet) <hi>selleth his soul for nothing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 52. 3.</note> An
<hi>Epicure</hi> hath some reason, and an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner
is a man of wisedom, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to him; for they enjoy some
pleasure, or acquire some gain here, in
lieu of their Salvation hereafter. But
he offends Heaven, and abandons hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
he knows not why, nor for
what; a fond humour possesses him,
he inconsiderately follows a herd of
fopps, he affects to play the Ape; that
is all he can say for himself. Let me be
pardoned, if just indignation against a
wickedness so contemptible, so hainous,
and so senseless, and withall so notorious,
and so rife among us, doth extort from me
language somewhat tart and vehement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53987:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If men would then but a little
consider things, surely this scurvy
fashion would be soon discarded,
much fitter for the scumme of the
people, then for the flower of the
Gentry; yea rather, much below any
man endued with a scrap of Reason,
not to say with a grain of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Could we bethink our selves,
certainly modest, sober and pertinent
Discourse would appear far more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and manly, then such wild
Hectoring God Almighty, such rude
insulting over the received Laws,
such ruffianly swaggering against so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and goodness. If Gentlemen
would regard the Vertues of their
ancestours, (that gallant Courage,
that solid Wisedom, that noble Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy,
which first advanced their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and severed them from the
vulgar,) this degenerate wantonness
and dirtiness of Speech would return
to the dunghill, or rather (which
God grant) would be quite banished
from the world.</p>
            <p>Finally, as to this whole Point, about
not offending in our Speech against Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
we should consider, that as we
our selves, with all our members and


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53987:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
powers, were chiefly designed and
framed to serve and glorify our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
(it being withall the greatest
perfection of our nature, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
privilege thereof so to doe;)
so especially our Tongue and Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
faculty were given us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
our admiration and reverence
of him, to express our love and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
toward him, to celebrate his
praises, to acknowledge his benefits,
to promote his honour and service.
This consequently is the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and worthy use thereof; from
this it becomes in effect what the
Psalmist so often terms it,<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 9. &amp; 30. 12. &amp; 57. 8. &amp; 108. 1.</note> our <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and the best member we have;
as that whereby we far excell all
creatures here below; that whereby
we consort with the blessed Angels
above, in distinct utterance of praise
to our Creatour. Wherefore apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to any impious discourse, (ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any-wise to the dishonour of
God, or disparagement of Religion,)
is a most unnatural abuse thereof,
and a vile ingratitude toward him
that gave it to us. From which, and
from all other offences, God in his
mercy preserve us all, through <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

Whence it may seem requisite so to
interpret and determine S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
here concerning <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> (that
is, facetious speech, or raillery, by our
Translatours rendred <hi>Jesting,)</hi> that he
may consist with himself, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who placeth this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
in the rank of Vertues; or that
Religion and Reason may well accord
in the case; supposing, that if there
be any kind of Facetiousness innocent
and reasonable, conformable to good
manners, (regulated by common sense,
and consistent with the tenour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Duty, that is, not transgressing
the bounds of Piety, Charity, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,)
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not intend to
discountenance or prohibit that kind.</p>
            <p>For thus expounding and limiting his
intent, we have some warrant from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
some fair intimations in the words
here. For first, what sort of facetious
speech he aimeth at, he doth imply by
the fellow he coupleth therewith;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (saith he) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>foolish talking, or facetiousness:</hi> such
Facetiousness therefore he toucheth as
doth include Folly, in the matter or
manner thereof. Then he farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth
it, by adjoyning a peculiar


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53987:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
quality thereof, unprofitableness, or
impertinency; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>which
are not pertinent,</hi> or conducible to any
good purpose: whence may be collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it is a frivolous and idle sort
of Facetiousness which he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
            <p>But however manifest it is, that some
kind thereof he doth earnestly forbid:
whence, in order to the guidance of
our practice, it is needfull to distinguish
the kinds, severing that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
from that which is unlawfull;
that so we may be satisfied in the case,
and not on the one hand ignorantly
transgress our duty, nor on the other
trouble our selves with scruples, others
with censures, upon the use of warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
liberty therein.</p>
            <p>And such a resolution seemeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
especially needfull in this our Age,
(this pleasant and jocular Age,) which
is so infinitely addicted to this sort of
speaking, that it scarce doth affect or
prize any thing near so much; all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
appearing now to vail and
stoop to that of being a Wit: to be
learned, to be wise, to be good, are
nothing in comparison thereto; even to
be noble and rich are inferiour things,


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53987:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and afford no such glory. Many at least,
to purchase this glory, (to be deemed
considerable in this faculty, and enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
among the Wits,) do not onely
<hi>make shipwreck of conscience,</hi> abandon
Vertue, and forfeit all pretences to
wisedom; but neglect their estates, and
prostitute their honour: so to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
dammage of many particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and with no small prejudice to
the publick, are our Times possessed
and transported with this humour. To
repress the excess and extravagance
whereof, nothing in way of discourse
can serve better, then a plain declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
when and how such a practice is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
or tolerable; when it is wicked
and vain, unworthy of a man endued
with Reason, and pretending to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
or honour.</p>
            <p>This I shall in some measure endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to perform.</p>
            <p>But first it may be demanded what
the thing we speak of is, or what this
Facetiousness doth import. To which
question I might reply as <hi>Democritus</hi>
did to him that asked the definition of
a Man, <hi>'Tis that which we all see and
know:</hi> any one better apprehends what
it is by acquaintance, then I can inform


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53987:27"/>
him by description. It is indeed a thing
so versatil and multiform, appearing in
so many shapes, so many postures, so
many garbs, so variously apprehended
by several eyes and judgments, that it
seemeth no less hard to settle a clear and
certain notion thereof, then to make a
pourtraict of <hi>Proteus,</hi> or to define the
figure of the fleeting Air. Sometimes
it lieth in pat allusion to a known story,
or in seasonable application of a trivial
saying, or in forging an apposite tale:
sometimes it playeth in words and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
taking advantage from the ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of their sense, or the affinity of their
sound: sometimes it is wrapped in a
dress of humourous expression;<note place="margin">Eadem quae, si imprudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus excidunt, stulta sunt, si simulamus, venusta cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur.</note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it lurketh under an odd simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
sometimes it is lodged in a sly
question, in a smart answer, in a quir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
reason, in a shrewd intimation, in
cunningly diverting,<note place="margin">Quint. 6. 3.</note> or cleverly retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an objection: sometimes it is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in a bold scheme of speech, in a
tart Irony, in a lusty Hyperbole, in a
startling Metaphor, in a plausible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
of contradictions, or in acute
Nonsense: sometimes a scenical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of persons or things, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
speech, a mimical look or gesture


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53987:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
passeth for it: sometimes an affected
simplicity, sometimes a presumptuous
bluntness giveth it being: sometimes it
riseth onely from a lucky hitting upon
what is strange, sometimes from a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
wresting obvious matter to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
often it consisteth in one knows
not what, and springeth up one can
hardly tell how. Its ways are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
and inexplicable, being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the numberless rovings of
fancy, and windings of language. It
is, in short, a manner of speaking out
of the simple and plain way,<note place="margin">Et hercle om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis salsè di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi ratio in eo est, ut ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quàm est rectum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rúmque dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Quint.</hi>

Reason teacheth and proveth things
by,) which by a pretty surprizing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthness
in conceit or expression doth
affect and amuse the fancy, stirring in it
some wonder, and breeding some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
thereto. It raiseth Admiration,
as signifying a nimble sagacity of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
a special felicity of invention,
a vivacity of spirit, and reach of wit
more then vulgar: it seeming to argue
a rare quickness of parts, that one can
fetch in remote conceits applicable; a
notable skill, that he can dexterously
accommodate them to the purpose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; together with a lively brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of humour, not apt to damp those

sportful flashes of imagination. (Whence

by diverting the mind from its road of

delight to conversation: (harmless, I
say, that is, not intrenching upon Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not infringing Charity or Justice,
not disturbing Peace.) For Christianity
is not so tetrical, so harsh, so envious,
as to bar us continually from innocent,
much less from wholsome and usefull
pleasure, such as humane life doth need
or require. And if jocular discourse may
serve to good purposes of this kind; if
it may be apt to raise our drooping spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,<note place="margin">Danda est re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missio animis; meliores acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orésque requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eti surgent, <hi>&amp;c. Sen.</hi> de Tranq. 15.</note>
to allay our irksome cares, to whet
our blunted industry, to recreate our
minds being tired or cloyed with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
occupations; if it may breed ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity,
or maintain good humour among
us; if it may conduce to sweeten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and endear society; then is
it not inconvenient, or unprofitable.
If for those ends we may use other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
employing on them our ears
and eyes, our hands and feet, our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
instruments of sense and motion;
why may we not as well to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
our organs of speech, and
interiour sense? Why should those


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53987:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
games which excite our wits and fancies
be less reasonable, then those whereby
our grosser parts and faculties are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised?
Yea, why are not those more
reasonable, since they are performed in
a manly way, and have in them a smack
of Reason; seeing also they may be so
managed, as not onely to divert and
please,<note place="margin">—riden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem dicere verum Quid vetat?</note> but to improve and profit the
mind, rouzing and quickning it, yea
sometimes enlightning and instructing
it, by good sense conveyed in jocular
expression?</p>
            <p>It would surely be hard, that we
should be tied ever to knit the brow,
and squeeze the brain, (to be always
sadly dumpish, or seriously pensive,)
that all divertisement of mirth and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness
should be shut out of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and how can we better relieve
our minds, or relax our thoughts, how
can we be more ingenuously chearfull,
in what more kindly way can we exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larate
our selves and others, then by
thus <hi>sacrificing to the Graces,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

call'd it? Are not some persons
always, and all persons sometimes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
otherwise to divert themselves,
then by such discourse? Shall we, I
say, have no recreation? or must our


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53987:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
recreations be ever clownish, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish,
consisting meerly in rustical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
or in petty sleights of bodily
strength and activity? Were we in
fine obliged ever to talk like Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
assigning dry reasons for every
thing, and dropping grave sentences
upon all occasions, would it not much
deaden humane life, and make ordinary
conversation exceedingly to languish?
Facetiousnesse therefore in such cases,
and to such purposes, may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Facetiousnesse is allowable, when
it is the most proper instrument of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
things apparently base and vile
to due contempt. It is many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
that things really ridiculous
should appear such, that they may be
sufficiently loathed and shunned; and to
render them such is the part of a faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wit, and usually can onely be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
thereby. When to impugn them
with down-right reason, or to check
them by serious discourse, would signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
nothing; then representing them in
a shape strangely-ugly to the fancy, and
thereby raising derision at them, may
effectually discountenance them. Thus
did the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> expose the wicked


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53987:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
superstition of those who worshipped
<hi>Baal:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Elias</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>mocked
them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a
God, either he is talking, or he is pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or he is in a journey, or peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he sleeps, and must be awaked.</hi> By
which one pregnant instance it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that reasoning pleasantly-abusive
in some cases may be usefull. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture doth not indeed use it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently;
(it not suting the Divine
simplicity and stately gravity thereof to
doe so;) yet its condescension thereto
at any time sufficiently doth authorize a
cautious use thereof. When sarcastical
twitches are needfull to pierce the thick
skins of men, to correct their lethargick
stupidity, to rouze them out of their
drouzy negligence; then may they
well be applied: when plain declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will not enlighten people, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the truth and weight of things,
and blunt arguments will not penetrate,
to convince or persuade them to their
duty; then doth Reason freely resign
its place to Wit, allowing it to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
its work of instruction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Facetious discourse particularly
may be commodious for reproving some


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53987:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vices, and reclaiming some persons;
(as Salt for cleansing and curing some
sores.) It commonly procureth a more
easie accesse to the ears of men, and
worketh a stronger impression on their
hearts, then other discourse could do.
Many who will not stand a direct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
and cannot abide to be plainly
admonished of their fault, will yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be pleasantly rubb'd, and will
patiently bear a jocund wipe; though
they abominate all language purely bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or sour, yet they can relish discourse
having in it a pleasant tartnesse: you
must not chide them as their master, but
you may gibe with them as their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
if you doe that, they will take you
for pragmatical and haughty; this they
may interpret friendship and freedome.
Most men are of that temper; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Genius of divers persons,
whose opinions and practices we should
strive to correct, doth require not a
grave and severe, but a free and merry
way of treating them. For what can
be more unsutable and unpromising,
then to seem serious with those who
are not so themselves, or demure with
the scornfull? If we design either to
please or vex them into better manners,


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53987:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we must be as sportfull in a manner, or
as contemptuous as themselves. If we
mean to be heard by them, we must
talk in their own fashion, with humour
and jollity: if we will instruct them,
we must withall somewhat divert them:
we must seem to play with them, if we
think to convey any sober thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. They scorn to be formally
advised or taught; but they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be slily laughed and lured into
a better mind. If by such complaisance
we can inveagle those Dottrels to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to us, we may induce them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
farther, and give Reason some
competent scope, some fair play with
them. Good Reason may be apparelled
in the garb of Wit, and therein will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
passe, whither in its native home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
it could never arrive: and being
come thither, it with especial advantage
may impresse good advice; making an
offender more clearly to see, and more
deeply to feel his miscarriage; being
represented to his fancy in a strain
somewhat rare and remarkable, yet not
so fierce and frightfull. The severity
of reproof is tempered, and the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's
anger disguised thereby. The
guilty person cannot but observe, that


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53987:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he who thus reprehends him is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd
or out of humour, and that he
rather pitieth then hateth him; which
breedeth a veneration to him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
no small efficacy to his whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
suggestions. Such a Reprehension,
while it forceth a smile without, doth
work remorse within; while it seemeth
to tickle the ear, doth sting the heart.
In fine, many whose foreheads are brazed
and hearts steeled against all blame, are
yet not of proof against derision; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
who never will be reasoned, may
be raillied into better order: in which
cases Raillery, as an instrument of so
important good, as a servant of the best
Charity, may be allowed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some Errours likewise in this way
may be most properly and most succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
confuted; such as deserve not,
and hardly can bear a serious and solid
confutation. He that will contest things
apparently decided by sense and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
or who disavows clear Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of reason, approved by generall
consent, and the common sense of men,
what other hopefull way is there of
proceeding with him, then pleasantly
to explode his conceits? To dispute
seriously with him, were trifling; to


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53987:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
trifle with him is the proper course:
since he rejecteth the grounds of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
'tis vain to be in earnest; what
then remains but to jest with him? To
deal seriously, were to yield too much
respect to such a baffler, and too much
weight to his fancies; to raise the man
too high in his courage and conceit;
to make his pretences seem worthy the
considering and canvasing. Briefly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
obstinacy is more easily quelled,
petulant impudence is sooner dashed,
Sophistical captiousnesse is more safely
eluded, Sceptical wantonnesse is more
surely confounded in this, then in the
simple way of discourse.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This way is also commonly the
best way of defence against unjust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and obloquy. To yield to a
slanderous reviler a serious reply, or to
make a formal plea against his charge,
doth seem to imply, that we much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
or deeply resent it; whereas by
pleasant reflexion on it we signify, the
matter onely deserves contempt, and
that we take our selves unconcerned
therein. So easily without care or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
may the brunts of malice be decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or repelled.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53987:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
6. This way may be allowed in way
of counterbalancing, and in compliance
to the fashion of others. It would
be a disadvantage unto Truth and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
if their defenders were barred
from the use of this weapon; since
it is that especially whereby the patrons
of Errour and Vice do maintain and
propagate them. They being destitute
of good reason, do usually recommend
their absurd and pestilent notions by a
pleasantnesse of conceit and expression,
bewitching the fancies of shallow hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and inveagling heedlesse persons
to a liking of them: and if, for reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
such people, the folly of those
Seducers may in the like manner be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
as ridiculous and odious, why
should that advantage be refused? It
is Wit that wageth the war against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
against Vertue, against Religion;
Wit alone it is that perverteth so many,
and so greatly corrupteth the world:
It may therefore be needfull, in our
warfare for those dearest concerns, to
sort the manner of our fighting with
that of our adversaries, and with the
same kind of arms to protect Goodnesse,
whereby they do assail it. If Wit may
happily serve under the banner of Truth


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53987:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Vertue, we may imprest it for that
service; and good it were to rescue so
worthy a faculty from so vile abuse. It
is the right of Reason and Piety, to
command that and all other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
Folly and Impiety do onely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp
them: just and fit therefore it is,
to wrest them out of so bad hands,
to revoke them to their right use and
duty.</p>
            <p>It doth especially seem requisite to
doe it in this Age, wherein plain Reason
is deemed a dull and heavy thing. When
the mental appetite of men is become
like the corporeal, and cannot relish
any food without some piquant sawce,
so that people will rather starve, then
live on solid fare; when substantial and
sound discourse findeth small attention,
or acceptance; in such a time, he that
can may in complaisance, and for fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's
sake, vouchsafe to be facetious;
an ingenious vein coupled with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
mind may be a good talent; he
shall employ Wit commendably, who
by it can further the interests of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
alluring men first to listen, then
inducing them to consent unto its whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
dictates and precepts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:53987:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Since men are so irreclaimably dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to mirth and laughter, it may be
well to set them in the right pin, to
divert their humour into the proper
chanel, that they may please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in deriding things which deserve
it, ceasing to laugh at that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
reverence or horrour.</p>
            <p>It may also be expedient to put the
world out of conceit, that all sober and
good men are a sort of such lumpish or
sour people, that they can utter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but flat and drowzy stuff; by
shewing them, that such persons, when
they see cause, in condescension, can
be as brisk and smart as themselves;
when they please, can speak pleasantly
and wittily as well as gravely and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously.
This way at least, in respect
to the various palates of men, may for
variety sake be sometimes attempted,
when other means do fail: when many
strict and subtle arguings, many zealous
declamations, many wholsome serious
discourses have been spent, without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the extirpation of bad principles,

7. Furthermore, the warrantableness
of this practice in some cases may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from a parity of reason, in this
manner: If it be lawfull, (as by the
best authorities it plainly doth appear
to be,) in using Rhetorical schemes,
Poetical strains, involutions of sense in
Allegories, Fables, Parables, and Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
to discoast from the plain and
simple way of speech; why may not
Facetiousness, issuing from the same
principles, directed to the same ends,
serving to like purposes, be likewise
used blamelesly? If those exorbitancies
of speech may be accommodated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still
good Doctrine into the head, to
excite good Passions in the heart, to
illustrate and adorn the Truth, in a
delightfull and taking way; and face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
discourse be sometime notoriously
conducible to the same ends; why,
they being retained, should it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected?
especially considering how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
often it may be, to distinguish
those forms of discourse from this, or
exactly to define the limits which sever
Rhetorick and Raillery. Some elegant
figures and tropes of Rhetorick (bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Sarcasms, sly Ironies, strong Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,
lofty Hyperbole's, Paronoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53987:34"/>
Oxymorons, and the like, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
used by the best speakers, and
not seldome even by Sacred Writers)
do lie very near upon the confines of
Jocularity, and are not easily differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from those sallies of wit, wherein
the lepid way doth consist: so that
were this wholly culpable, it would be
matter of scruple, whether one hath
committed a fault or no, when he
meant onely to play the Oratour, or
the Poet; and hard surely it would
be to find a judge, who could precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set out the difference between a Jest
and a Flourish.</p>

did much affect this kind of discourse,
and did apply it to noble purposes.

among the Pagans did practise it so
much, (by it repressing the windy pride

to him, without profoundest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence

sauciness that can be imagined,
to speak petulantly or pertly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

the true life and health of our Soul, are
interest in God's favour and mercy, are
everlasting glory and blisse affairs of
less moment? are the treasures and

No certainly, no: in all reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to speak of them in most sober

            <p>The proper objects of common mirth
and sportfull divertisement are mean
and petty matters; any thing at least
is by playing therewith made such:
great things are thereby diminished and
debased; especially Sacred things do
grievously suffer thence, being with
extreme indecency and indignity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
beneath themselves, when they
become the subjects of flashy wit, or
the entertainments of frothy merriment:
to saorifice their honour to our vain
pleasure, being like the ridiculous fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that people, which (as <hi>Aelian</hi>
reporteth) worshipping a Fly, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up an Oxe thereto. These things


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53987:37"/>
were by God instituted, and proposed
to us for purposes quite different; to
compose our hearts, and settle our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in a most serious frame; to breed
inward satisfaction, and joy purely spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;
to exercise our most solemn
thoughts, and employ our gravest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses:
All our speech therefore about
them should be <hi>wholsome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fir. 2. 8.</note> apt to afford
good instruction, or to excite good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 29.</note>

            </p>
            <p>If we must be facetious and merry,
the field is wide and spacious; there
are matters enough in the world beside
these most august and dreadfull things,
to try our faculties, and please our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
with; every-where light and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous
things occurr: it therefore doth
argue a marvellous poverty of wit, and
barrenness of invention, (no less then
a strange defect of goodness, and want
of discretion,) in those who can devise
no other subjects to frollick upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
these, of all most improper and
perillous; who cannot seem ingenious
under the charge of so highly trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon decency, disclaiming wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
wounding the ears of others, and


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53987:37"/>
their own consciences. Seem ingenious,
I say; for seldome those persons really
are such, or are capable to discover any
wit in a wise and manly way. 'Tis not
the excellency of their fancies, which
in themselves usually are sorry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid
enough, but the uncouthness of
their presumption; not their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
wit, but their prodigious rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is to be admired. They
are gazed on, as the doers of bold
tricks, who dare perform that which
no sober man will attempt: they
do indeed rather deserve themselves
to be laughed at, then their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.
For what can be more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
then we do make our selves, when
we thus fiddle and fool with our own
Souls; when, to make vain people
merry, we incense God's earnest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
when, to raise a fit of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
laughter, we expose our selves to
endless wailing and woe; when, to be
reckoned Wits, we prove our selves
stark wild? Surely to this case we may

To doe thus, as it is the office of mean
and base spirits, (unfit for any worthy
or weighty employments,) so it is full
of inhumanity, of iniquity, of indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and folly. For the weaknesses of
men, of what kind soever, (natural, or
moral, in quality, or in act,) conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
whence they spring, and how
much we are all subject to them, and
do need excuse for them, do in equity
challenge compassion to be had of
them; not complacency to be taken
in them, or mirth drawn from them:
they, in respect to common humanity,


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53987:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should rather be studiously connived
at and concealed, or mildly excused,

            <p>The Reputation of men is too noble
a sacrifice to be offered up to vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

a good far more dear and precious, then
to be prostituted for idle sport and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement.

               </note> yet
of so vast price; which being once
broken or crackt, it is very hard, and
scarce possible, to repair. A small tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient

whence can it proceed, but from the

decided in the court of morality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it consists not with Vertue and

overthrows his own pretence, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reasonably claim any interest in
wit, who doth thus behave himself:
he prejudgeth himself to want wit, who
cannot descry fit matter to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

streightnesse and sterility of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
who cannot in all the wide

            <p>Neither is it any argument of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

for him to be zealous about

            <p>He indeed that prefers any faculty to

Hence if we must be venting pleasant
conceits, we should doe it <hi>as if we did
it not,</hi> carelesly and unconcernedly;
not standing upon it, or valuing our
selves for it: we should doe it with
measure and moderation; not giving

to nauseate serious businesse, or disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

of it, which we daily see men to

that it is this onely which they can like
or savour, which they can endure to

But farther,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Vainglorious ostentation this way
is very blameable. All ambition, all
vanity, all conceitednesse, upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ground they are founded, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely

ability, or some usefull skill, are wise
and manly in comparison to this, which
standeth on a foundation so manifestly
slight and weak. The old Philosophers
by a severe Father were called <hi>animalia

               <note place="margin">Tertull.</note> 
               <hi>animals of glory;</hi> and by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical

praise from praise-worthy knowledge;
they were puff'd up with a wind which
blowed some good to mankind; they
sought glory from that which deserved
glory if they had not sought it; it was
a substantial and solid credit which they
did affect, resulting from successfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
of strong reason, and stout in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry:<note place="margin">Risus—te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuissimus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genii fructus. <hi>Cic.</hi> de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. 2.</note>
but these <hi>animalcula gloriae,</hi>
these flies, these insects of glory, these,
not bladders, but bubbles of vanity,
would be admired and praised for
that which is no-wise admirable or lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
for the casual hits and emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of roving fancy; for stumbling on
an odd conceit or phrase, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
nothing, and is as superficiall
as the smile, as hollow as the noise it
causeth. Nothing certainly in nature
is more ridiculous then a self-conceited
Wit, who deemeth himself some-body,
and greatly pretendeth to commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53987:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on from so pitifull and worthlesse a
thing as a knack of trifling.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Lastly, It is our duty never so far
to engage our selves in this way, as
thereby to lose or to impair that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
seriousnesse, modesty, and sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of mind, that steddy composednesse,
gravity, and constancy of demeanour,
which become Christians. We should
continually keep our minds intent upon
our <hi>high calling,</hi> and grand interests;
ever well tuned, and ready for the
performance of holy Devotions, and the
practice of most serious duties with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
attention and fervent affection:
Wherefore we should never suffer them
to be dissolved into levity, or disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into a wanton frame, indisposing
us for religious thoughts and actions.
We ought always in our behaviour to
maintain, not onely <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore we should not let our selves
be transported into any excessive pitch

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53987:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prejudicial to our Christian state and
businesse. Gravity and Modesty are
the fences of Piety, which being once
slighted, sin will easily attempt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon us. So the old <hi>Spanish</hi>

been wise, who, when his Son upon a

him,<note place="margin">

son, in the first place keep thy Gravity,
in the next place fear God:</hi> intimating,
that a man must first be serious, before
he can be pious.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as we need not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
so must we not be impudent;
as we should not be sour, so ought we
not to be fond; as we may be free, so
we should not be vain; as we may well
stoop to friendly complaisance, so we
should take heed of falling into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
levity. If without wronging
others, or derogating from our selves,
we can be facetious; if we can use our
wits in jesting innocently, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently;
we may sometimes do it: but
let us, in compliance with S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
beware of <hi>foolish talking and

            <p>AMong other Precepts of Good
life (directing the practice of
Vertue, and abstinence from Sin)
S. <hi>James</hi> doth insert this about Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
couched in expression denoting
his great earnestnesse, and apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
our special attention. Therein he
doth not mean universally to interdict
the use of Oaths; (for that in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
is not onely lawfull, but very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
yea needfull, and required
from us as a Duty;) but that Swearing
which our Lord had expresly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Disciples, and which thence,
questionlesse, the <hi>brethren</hi> to whom
S. <hi>James</hi> did write did well understand
themselves obliged to forbear, having


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53987:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
learnt so in the first Catechisms of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
institution; that is, needlesse and
heedlesse Swearing in ordinary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation:
a practice then frequented in
the world, both among <hi>Jews</hi> and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;
the which also, to the shame of
our Age, is now so much in fashion, and
with some men in vogue; the invoking
God's Name, appealing to his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and provoking his judgment, upon
any slight occasion, in common talk,
with vain incogitancy, or profane bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
From such practice the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
dehorteth in terms importing his
great concernednesse, and implying the
matter to be of highest importance:
for, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith he, <hi>Before all
things, my brethren, do not swear;</hi> as
if he did apprehend this sin of all other
to be one of the most hainous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.
Could he have said more?
would he have said so much, if he had
not conceived the matter to be of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
weight and consequence? And
that it is so, I mean now, by God's
help, to shew you, by proposing some
Considerations, whereby the hainous
wickednesse, together with the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
folly, of such rash and vain Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
will appear; the which being laid

and deterr from it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Let us consider the nature of an
Oath, and what we do when we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to swear.</p>
            <p>It is (as it is phrased in the Decalogue,
and other-where in Holy Scripture) an
<hi>assuming the Name of our God,</hi>

it to our purpose,<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 9.</note> to countenance
and confirm what we say.</p>
            <p>It is an invocation of God as a most
faithfull Witnesse,<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 50.</note> concerning the truth
of our words,<note place="margin">Jud. 11. 10.</note> or the sincerity of our
meaning.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 5.</note>

            <p>It is a formal engagement of God to

Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>Whence we may collect, that Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ever doth require great modesty
and composednesse of spirit, very seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
consideration and solicitous care,
that we be not rude and saucy with God,
in <hi>taking up his Name,</hi> and prostituting
it to vile or mean uses; that we do not

What a wildnesse is it, to dally with

               <note place="margin">Job 26. 11.</note>
which hurled down legions of Angels

which, as grievous sinners, of all things
we have most reason to dread; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which no sober man can otherwise

            </p>
            <p>How prodigious a madnesse is it,

II. We may consider, that Swearing
(agreeably to its nature, or natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and tendency) is represented in
Holy Scripture as a special part of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship, or Devotion toward
God; in the due performance whereof
we do avow him for the true God, and
Governour of the world; we piously
do acknowledge his principal Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and special Prerogatives; (his
Omnipresence and his Omniscience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it self to our most inward
thoughts, our secretest purposes, our
closest retirements; his watchfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
over all our actions, affairs,
and concerns; his faithfull Goodnesse,
in favouring truth, and protecting right;
his exact Justice, in patronizing since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and chastizing perfidiousnesse;)
his being Supreme Lord over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and Judge paramount in all causes;
his readinesse in our need, upon our
humble imploration and reference,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is a pious thing willingly to commend our case or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie to God. <hi>Arist.</hi> Rhet. 1. 48.</note> to
undertake the arbitration of matters
controverted, and the care of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
justice, for the maintenance of
truth and right, of loyalty and fidelity,
of order and peace among men. Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
doth also intimate a pious trust and
confidence in God; as <hi>Aristotle</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:53987:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Such things a serious Oath doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
to such purposes Swearing natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
serveth; and therefore to signify
or effectuate them, Divine institution
hath devoted it.</p>
            <p>God in goodnesse to such ends hath
pleased to lend us his great Name, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
us to cite him for a Witnesse, to
have recourse to his Bar, to engage his
Justice and Power, when-ever the case
deserveth and requireth it, or when we
cannot by other means well assure the
sincerity of our meaning, or secure the
constancy of our resolutions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea in such exigencies he doth exact
this practice from us, as an instance of
our religious confidence in him, and as
a service conducible to his glory: For
it is a Precept in his Law, of moral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 20. &amp; 6. 13.</note>
and eternal obligation,</hi> Thou shalt
fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou
serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and
shalt swear by his Name. <hi>It is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a religious man, to swear with
due reverence and upright conscience.
For,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 63. 11.</note> The King <hi>(saith the Psalmist)</hi>
shall rejoyce in God; every one that swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by him shall glory: but the mouth of
them that speak lies shall be stopped. <hi>It is
a distinctive mark of God's people, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53987:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to that of the Prophet</hi> Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,<note place="margin">Jer. 12. 16.</note>
And it shall come to passe, if they
will diligently learn the ways of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to swear by my Name—then shall
they be built in the midst of my people. <hi>It
is predicted concerning the Evangelical
times,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 45. 23.</note> Unto me every knee shall bow, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tongue shall swear:<note place="margin">Isa. 65. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and,</hi> That he who
blesseth himself in the earth, shall blesse
himself by the God of truth; and he that
sweareth in the earth, shall swear by the
God of truth.</p>
            <p>As therefore all other acts of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein immediate application is
made to the Divine Majesty, should
never be performed without most hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
intention, most serious consideration,
most lowly reverence; so neither should
this grand one, wherein God is so near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touched, and his chief Attributes so
much concerned: the which indeed
doth involve both Prayer and Praise,
doth require the most devotional acts of
Faith and Fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We therefore should so perform it,
as not to incurr that reproof;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 15. 8.</note> This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
draweth nigh unto me with their
mouth,<note place="margin">Isa. 29. 13.</note> and honoureth me with their lips,
but their heart is far from me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:53987:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When we seem most formally to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow
God, to confesse his Omniscience,
to confide in his Justice; we should not
really disregard him, and in effect sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify,
that we do not think he doth
know what we say, or mind what we
doe.</p>
            <p>If we do presume to offer this service,
we should doe it in the manner appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by himself, according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
prescribed in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Thou
shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in truth,
in judgment, and in righteousnesse: in
truth,</hi> taking heed, that our meaning be
conformable to the sense of our words,
and our words to the verity of things;
<hi>in judgment,</hi> having with carefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
examined and weighed that
which we assert or promise; <hi>in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi>
being satisfied in conscience,
that we do not therein infringe any
rule of Piety toward God, of Equity
toward men, of Sobriety and discretion
in regard to our selves.</p>
            <p>The cause of our Swearing must be
needfull, or very expedient; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of it must be honest, and usefull
to considerable purposes; (tending to
God's honour, our Neighbour's bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
our own welfare;) the matter of


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53987:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it should be not onely just and lawfull,
but worthy and weighty; the manner
ought to be grave and solemn, our mind
being framed to earnest attention, and
endued with pious affections sutable to
the occasion.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, if we do venture to swear,
without due advice and care, without
much respect and awe, upon any slight
or vain (not to say, bad or unlawfull)
occasion; we then desecrate Swearing,
and are guilty of profaning a most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Ordinance: the doing so doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
base hypocrisie,<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 7, 8.</note> or leud mockery,
or abominable wantonnesse and folly;
in boldly invading, and vainly trifling
with the most august Duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Such Swearing therefore is very
dishonourable and injurious to God,
very prejudicial to Religion, very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to Piety.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We may consider that the Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
prohibited is very noxious to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society.</p>
            <p>The great prop of Society (which
upholdeth the safety, peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
thereof, in observing laws, dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
justice, discharging trusts, keeping
contracts, and holding good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
mutually) is Conscience, or a


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53987:54"/>
sense of Duty toward God, obliging
to perform what is right and equal;
quickned by hope of rewards, and fear
of punishments from him: secluding
which principle, no worldly considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is strong enough to hold men fast;
or can farther dispose many to doe right,
or observe faith, or hold peace, then
appetite, or interest, or humour (things
very slippery and uncertain) do sway
them.</p>
            <p>That men should live honestly, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly,
and comfortably together, it is
needfull that they should live under a
sense of God's will, and in awe of the
Divine power, hoping to please God,
and fearing to offend him, by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
respectively.</p>
            <p>That Justice should be administred
between men, it is necessary that testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of fact be alledged; and that
witnesses should apprehend themselves
greatly obliged to discover the truth,
according to their conscience, in dark
and doubtfull cases.</p>
            <p>That men should uprightly discharge
offices serviceable to publick good, it
doth behove that they be firmly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to perform the trusts reposed in
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:53987:55"/>
That in affairs of very considerable
importance, men should deal with one
another with satisfaction of mind, and
mutual confidence, they must receive
competent assurances concerning the
integrity, fidelity, and constancy each
of other.</p>
            <p>That the safety of Governours may
be preserved, and the obedience due to
them maintained secure from attempts to
which they are liable, (by the treachery,
levity, perverseness, timorousness, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all such lusts and ill humours of men,)
it is expedient that men should be tied
with the strictest bands of allegeance.</p>
            <p>That controversies emergent about
the interests of men should be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and an end put to strife by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory

necessary for common quiet.</p>
            <p>Wherefore for the publick interest,
and benefit of humane Society, it is
requisite, that the highest obligations
possible should be laid upon the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men.</p>
            <p>And such are those of Oaths, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them to fidelity and constancy in
all such cases, out of regard to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, as the infallible Patron
of truth and right, the unavoidable


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53987:55"/>
Chastiser of perfidiousnesse and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity.</p>
            <p>To such purposes therefore Oaths
have ever been applied, as the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
instruments of working them;
not onely among the followers of true
and perfect Religion, but even among
all those who had any glimmering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning a Divine Power and
Providence; who have deemed an
Oath the fastest tie of Conscience, and
held the violation of it for the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
impiety and iniquity. So that
what <hi>Cicero</hi> saith of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that
<hi>their Ancestours had no band to constrain

of them, and render them insignificant,


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53987:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either to bind the Swearers, or to ground
a trust on their Oaths.</p>
            <p>As by the rare and reverent use of
Oaths their dignity is upheld, and their
obligation kept fast: so by the frequent
and negligent application of them, by
the prostituting them to every mean
and toyish purpose, their respect will
be quite lost, their strength will be
loosed, they will prove unserviceable
to publick use.</p>
            <p>If Oaths generally become cheap and
vile, what will that of Allegeance sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify?
If men are wont to play with
Swearing any-where, can we expect
they should be serious and strict therein
at the Bar, or in the Church? Will
they regard God's testimony, or dread
his judgment, in one place, or at one
time, when every-where upon any,
upon no occasion they dare to confront
and contemn them? Who then will
be the more trusted for Swearing? what
satisfaction will any man have from it?
The rifenesse of this practice, as it is the
sign, so it will be the cause of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
diffidence among men.</p>
            <p>Incredible therefore is the mischief
which this vain practice will bring in

            <p>

and saying, Embrace the murtherer of me,
an Oath. That which reproof did not,
this an Oath did doe; that which the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant's
wrath could not, this the necessity
of keeping an Oath did effect. For when


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53987:59"/>
the Tyrant was reprehended publickly in
the audience of all men, he bravely did
bear the rebuke; but when he had cast
himself into the necessity of Oaths, then
did he cut off that blessed head.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Likewise the use of rash Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
will often ingage a man in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings

that he do not put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

great sin, or undergoing great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience;
that he do not rush into

               <hi>It is a snare to a man to devour
that which is holy,</hi> (or, to swallow a
sacred obligation,) <hi>and after vows to
make inquiry,</hi> seeking how he may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
himself: the doing which is a
folly offensive to God, as the Preacher


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53987:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
telleth us;<note place="margin">Eccles 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>When</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou vowest
a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for
he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that
which thou hast vowed.</hi> God will not
admit our folly in vowing, as a plea or
an excuse for non-performance; he
will exact it from us both as a due debt;
and as a proper punishment of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
folly.</p>
            <p>For instance, into what losse and
mischief, what sorrow, what regret and
repentance, did the unadvised vow of
<hi>Jephtha</hi> throw him? the performance
whereof (as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> remarketh)
God did permit,<note place="margin">Chrys. <gap reason="foreign">

with solemn lamentation,
that all posterity might be admonished
thereby, and deterred from such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitant
Swearing.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Let us consider, that Swearing
is a sin of all others peculiarly clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and provocative of Divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
God is hardly so much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or in a manner constrained, to
punish any other sin as this. He is
bound in honour and interest to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his Name from the abuse, his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from the contempt, his holy
Ordinance from the profanation, which
it doth infer. He is concerned to take


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53987:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
care that his providence be not questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that the dread of his Majesty be
not voided, that all Religion be not
overthrown by the outrageous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
thereof with impunity.</p>
            <p>It immediately toucheth his Name,
it expresly calleth upon him to mind
it, to judge it, to shew himself in aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
it. He may seem deaf, or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
if, being so called and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
he doth not declare himself.</p>
            <p>There is understood to be a kind of
formall compact between him and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
obliging him to interpose, to take
the matter into his cognizance, being
specially addressed to him.</p>
            <p>The bold Swearer doth importune
him to hear, doth rouze him to mark,
doth brave him to judge and punish
his wickednesse.</p>

that to common sense vain Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
is a very unreasonable and ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
practice, greatly misbecoming
any sober, worthy, or honest person;
but especially most absurd and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
to a Christian.</p>
            <p>For in ordinary conversation what
needfull or reasonable occasion can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene
of violating this command?
If there come under discourse a matter
of reason, which is evidently true and
certain, then what need can there be of
an Oath to affirm it, it sufficing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to light, or to propose the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
for it? If an obscure or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
point come to be debated, it will
not bear an Oath; it will be a strange
madnesse to dare, a great folly to hope
the persuading it thereby. What were
more ridiculous, then to swear the
truth of a demonstrable Theorem?
what more vain, then so to assert a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
Probleme? Oaths (like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers)
are in such cases no arguments,

except of silliness in the users of them.</p>
            <p>If a matter of history be started, then
if a man be taken for honest, his word
will pass for attestation, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But such pleas do no more then sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53987:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other faults of Swearing, and good
arguments against it; its impertinence,
its abuse of speech, its disgracing the
practiser of it in point of judgement
and capacity. For so it is, Oaths as
they commonly pass are meer excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scencies
of Speech, which do nothing
but encumber and deform it; they so
embellish discourse, as a Wen or a Scab
do beautifie a face, as a Patch or a Spot
do adorn a garment.</p>
            <p>To what purpose, I pray, is God's
Name hooked and haled into our idle
talk? why should we so often mention
him, when we do not mean any thing
about him? would it not, into every
sentence to foist a dog or a horse, (to
intrude <hi>Turkish,</hi> or any barbarous gibbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,)
be altogether as proper and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent?</p>
            <p>What do these superfluities signifie,
but that the venter of them doth little
skill the use of speech, or the rule of
conversation, but meaneth to sputter
and prate any thing without judgement
or wit; that his invention is very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
his fancy beggarly, craving the aid
of any stuff to relieve it? One would
think a man of sense should grutch to
lend his ear, or incline his attention to


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53987:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such motley ragged discourse; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
nauseating he scarce should endure
to observe men lavishing time, and
squandring their breath so frivolously.
'Tis an affront to good company, to
pester it with such talk.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. But farther, upon higher accounts
this is a very uncivil and unmannerly
practice.</p>
            <p>Some vain persons take it for a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and gracefull thing, a special ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment,
a mark of fine breeding,
a point of high gallantry: for who,
forsooth, is the brave Spark, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Gentleman, the man of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and address, but he that hath the
skill and confidence (O heavens! how
mean a skill! how mad a confidence!)
to lard every sentence with an Oath or
a Curse; making bold at every turn to
salute his Maker, or to summon him in
attestation of his tattle; not to say,
calling and challenging the Almighty
to damn and destroy him? Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
I say, too many have of Swearing,
because a custome thereof, together
with divers other fond and base quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
hath prevailed among some people,
bearing the name and garb of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:53987:66"/>
But in truth there is no practice more
crossing the genuine nature of Gentile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or misbecoming persons well
born and well bred; who should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
the rude vulgar in goodnesse, in
courtesie, in noblenesse of heart, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse
to offend, and readinesse
to oblige those with whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
in steddy composednesse of mind
and manners, in disdaining to say or
doe any unworthy, any unhandsome
things.</p>
            <p>For this practice is not onely a grosse
rudenesse toward the main body of men,
who justly reverence the Name of God,
and detest such an abuse thereof; not
onely (farther) an insolent defiance of
the common Profession, the Religion,
the Law of our Country, which disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
and condemneth it; but it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
odious and offensive to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Society or company, at least wherein
there is any sober person, any who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
a sense of goodnesse, or is any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
concerned for God's honour: for
to any such person no language can be
more disgustfull; nothing can more grate
his ears, or fret his heart, then to hear
the sovereign object of his love and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
so mocked and slighted; to see


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53987:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Law of his Prince so disloyally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed,
so contemptuously trampled
on; to find his best Friend and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour
so outrageously abused. To
give him the lie were a complement, to
spit in his face were an obligation, in
comparison to this usage.</p>
            <p>Wherefore 'tis a wonder, that any
person of rank, any that hath in him a
spark of ingenuity, or doth at all pretend
to good manners, should find in his
heart or deign to comply with so scurvy
a fashion; a fashion much more befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the scumme of the people, then
the flower of the Gentry; yea rather
much below any man endued with a
scrap of reason, or a grain of goodnesse.
Would we bethink our selves, modest,
sober and pertinent discourse would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
far more generous and masculine,
then such mad Hectoring the Almighty,
such boisterous insulting over the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Laws and general notions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
such ruffianly swaggering against
sobriety and goodnesse. If Gentlemen
would regard the Vertues of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours,
the founders of their quality;
that gallant courage, that solid wisedom,
that noble courtesy, which advanced
their families, and severed them from


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53987:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the vulgar; this degenerate wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and sordidnesse of language would
return to the dunghill, or rather (which
God grant) be quite banished from the
world; the vulgar following their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. Farther, the words of our Lord,
when he forbad this practice, do sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
another consideration against it,
deducible from the causes and sources of
it; from whence it cometh, that men
are so inclined or addicted thereto:

of it he assureth us are evil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Sometimes it ariseth from exorbitant
heats of spirit, or transports of unbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled

peevish, or fiercely angry, or eagerly
contentious, then he blustereth, and
dischargeth his choler in most tragical
strains; then he would fright the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his displeasure by the most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
expressions thereof. This is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
alleged in excuse of rash Swearing;

that a bad cause should justify a bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
that one crime should warrant
another; that what would spoil a good
action, should excuse a bad one.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it proceedeth from arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
conceit, and a tyrannical humour;
when a man fondly admireth his own
opinion, and affecting to impose it on

            <p>Sometimes its rise is from stupid inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency,
or heady precipitancy; when
the man doth not heed what he saith,
or consider the nature and consequence
of his words, but snatcheth any expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which cometh next, or which his
roving fancy doth offer; for want of
that caution of the Psalmist,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 1. &amp; 141. 3.</note>

Sometimes (alas! how often in this
miserable Age?) it doth spring from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
boldnesse; when men design to
put affronts on Religion, and to display
their scorn and spight against Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
affecting the reputation of stout
Blades, of gallant Hectors, of resolute
Giants, who dare doe any thing, who
are not afraid to defy Heaven, and
brave God Almighty himself.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is derived from apish
imitation,<note place="margin">(Psal. 26. 4.)</note> or a humour to comply with
a fashion current among vain and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

            <p>It always doth come from a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

as we our selves, with all our members

framed to glorify our Maker; (the
which to doe is indeed the greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and noblest privilege of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;)
so our Tongue and speaking
faculty were given to us to declare our

exhibit our due love and gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, to professe our trust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

our knowledge, fear, love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to him, in all such ways to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
his honour and service. This is
the most proper, worthy and due use
of our Tongue, for which it was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to which it is dedicated, from

            <p>THese words do imply a double
Duty; one incumbent on Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
another on the People
who are to be instructed by them.</p>
            <p>The Teachers Duty appeareth from
reflecting on the words of the Context,
which govern these, and make them up
an entire sentence;<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Put them in
mind,</hi> or, Rub up their memory to doe
thus. It is S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s injunction to <hi>Titus,</hi>
a Bishop and Pastour of the Church,
that he should admonish the people
committed to his care and instruction,
as of other great Duties, (of yielding
obedience to Magistrates, of behaving
themselves peaceably, of practising
meeknesse and equity toward all men,
of being <hi>readily</hi> disposed <hi>to every good


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53987:72"/>
work,)</hi> so particularly of this, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>to revile,</hi> or <hi>speak evil of,
no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence it is apparent, that this is
one of the principal Duties that Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
are obliged to mind people of,
and to presse upon them. And if this
were needfull then, when Charity,
kindled by such instructions and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
was so lively; when Christians,
by their Sufferings, were so inured to
meeknesse and patience; when every
one, for the honour of his Religion, and
the safety of his person, was concerned
in all respects to demean himself inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
and inoffensively; then is it now
especially requisite, when (such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
and restraints being taken
off, Love being cooled, Persecution
being extinct, the tongue being set
loose from all extraordinary curbs) the
transgression of this Duty is grown so
prevalent and rife, that evil-speaking is
almost as common as speaking, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conversation extremely abounding
therewith, that Ministers should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their office in dehorting and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading
from it.</p>
            <p>Well indeed it were, if by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of using mild and moderate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53987:72"/>
of abstaining from virulent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives,
tauntings and scoffings, good
for little but to enflame anger, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
ill-will, they would lead men to
good practice of this sort: for no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
can be so wholsome, or so mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to this purpose, as those which
come down from the Pulpit, the place
of edification, backed with special au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and advantage.</p>
            <p>However, it is to Preachers a ground
of assurance, and matter of satisfaction,
that in pressing this Duty they shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their duty: their Text being not
so much of their own chusing, as given
them by S. <hi>Paul;</hi> they can surely scarce
find a better to discourse upon: it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a matter of small moment or use,
which this great Master and Guide so
expressely directeth us to insist upon.
And to the observance of his Precept,
so far as concerneth me, I shall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
apply my self.</p>
            <p>It is then the Duty of all Christian
people, (to be taught, and pressed on
them,) <hi>not to reproach,</hi> or <hi>speak evil of
any man.</hi> The which Duty, for your
instruction, I shall first endeavour some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to explain, declaring its import
and extent; then, for your farther edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,

            <p>
               <hi>NO MAN.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> questionlesse
did especially mean hereby to hinder
the Christians at that time from reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the <hi>Jews</hi> and the Pagans among
whom they lived, men in their lives
very wicked and corrupt, men in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
extremely dissenting from them,
men who greatly did hate, and cruelly
did persecute them; of whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had mighty provocations and
temptations to speak ill; their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the persons, and their resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of injuries, making it difficult to
abstain from doing so. Whence by
manifest analogy may be inferred, that
the Object of this Duty is very large,
indeed universal and unlimited: that
we must forbear reproach not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
pious and vertuous persons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
persons of our own judgment or


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53987:73"/>
party, against those who never did
harm or offend us, against our relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
our friends, our benefactours; in
respect to whom there is no ground or
temptation of ill-speaking; but even
against the most unworthy and wicked
persons, against those who most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coast
in opinion and practice from us,
against those who never did oblige us,
yea those who have most disobliged us,
even against our most bitter and spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enemies. There is no exception or
excuse to be admitted from the quality,
state, relation, or demeanour of men;
the Duty (according to the proper
sense, or due qualifications and limits of
the act) doth extend to all men: for,
<hi>Speak evil of no man.</hi>

            <p>As for the Act, it may be inquired

doth import. I answer, that it
is to vent words concerning any person

observe, that whereas in our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and commerce with men, there do
frequently occurr occasions to speak of
men and to men words apparently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous
to them, expressing our
dissent in opinion from them, or a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
in us of their proceedings, we may
doe this in different ways and terms;
some of them gentle and moderate, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
no ill mind or disaffection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them; others harsh and sharp, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
height of disdain, disgust, or
despite, whereby we bid them defiance,
and shew that we mean to exasperate
them. Thus, telling a man that we
differ in judgment from him, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him not to be in the right, and


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53987:74"/>
calling him a Liar, a Deceiver, a Fool;
saying that he doeth amisse, taketh a
wrong course, transgresseth the rule,
and calling him dishonest, unjust,
wicked; (to omit more odious and
provoking names, unbecoming this
place, and not deserving our notice;)
are several ways of expressing the same
things: whereof the latter, in relating
passages concerning our Neighbour, or
in debating cases with him, is prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:<note place="margin">(Act. 23. 3, 4, 5.)</note>
for thus the words <hi>reproaching,
reviling, railing, cursing,</hi> and the like,
do signify; and thus our Lord himself
doth explain them, in his Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
wherein he doth enact this Law;
<hi>Whosoever</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall say to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 22.</note>
               <hi>RACA,</hi> (that is, Vain man, or
Liar,) <hi>shall be in danger of the councill:
but whosoever shall say, THOU FOOL,
shall be in danger of Hell-fire;</hi> that is,
he rendreth himself liable to a strict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and to severe condemnation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, who useth contemptuous
and contumelious expressions toward his
Neighbour, in proportion to the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of such expressions.</p>
            <p>The reason of things also doth help
to explain those words, and to shew
why they are prohibited: because those


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53987:75"/>
harsh terms are needlesse; mild words
serving as well to expresse the same
things: because they are commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
loading men with greater defect
or blame then they can be proved to
deserve, or their actions do import:
(for every man that speaketh falshood
is not therefore a Liar, every man that
erreth is not thence a Fool, every man
that doeth amisse is not consequently
Dishonest or wicked; the secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and the habitual dispositions
of men not being always to be collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from their outward actions:) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are uncharitable, signifying
that we entertain the worst opinions of
men, and make the worst construction
of their doings, and are disposed to
shew them no favour or kindnesse: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
also they produce mischievous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
such as spring from the worst pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
raised by them.</p>
            <p>This in gross is the meaning of the
Precept. But since there are some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Precepts seeming to clash with
this; since there are cases wherein we
are allowed to use the harsher sort of
terms, there are great examples in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
thwarting this rule; therefore
it may be requisite for determining the


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53987:75"/>
limits of our duty, and distinguishing it
from transgression, that such exceptions
or restrictions should be somewhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First then, we may observe, that
it may be allowable to persons any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
concerned in the prosecution or
administration of Justice, to speak words
which in private intercourse would be
reproachfull. A Witnesse may impeach
of crimes hurtfull to justice, or publick
tranquillity; a Judge may challenge,
may rebuke, may condemn an offender
in proper terms, (or forms of speech
prescribed by Law,) although most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull
and distastfull to the guilty:
for it belongeth to the majesty of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Justice to be bold, blunt, severe;
little regarding the concerns or passions
of particular persons, in comparison to
the publick welfare.</p>
            <p>A Testimony therefore or Sentence
against a criminal, which materially is
a reproach, and morally would be such
in a private mouth, is not yet formally
so according to the intent of this rule.
For practices of this kind, which serve
the exigencies of Justice, are not to be
interpreted as proceeding from anger,
hatred, revenge, any bad passion or


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53987:76"/>
humour; but in way of needfull disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
for God's service, and common
benefit of men. It is not indeed so much
the Minister of justice, as God himself,
our absolute Lord, as the Sovereign,
God's representative, acting in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
behalf, as the Commonwealth it
self, who by his mouth do rebuke the
obnoxious person.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God's Ministers in Religious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
to whom the care of mens instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and edification is committed, are
enabled to inveigh against sin and vice,
who-ever consequentially may be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
thereby: yea sometimes it is their
duty, with severity and sharpnesse to
reprove particular persons, not onely
privately, but publickly, in order to
their correction, and edification of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> directeth <hi>Timothy;
Them that sin</hi> (notoriously and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 20.</note>
he meaneth) <hi>rebuke before all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 2.</note>
               <hi>that others may fear:</hi> that is in a manner
apt to make impression on the minds of
the hearers, so as to scare them from
like offences. And to <hi>Titus</hi> he writes,
<hi>Rebuke them sharply,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>that they may be
sound in the faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 1.</note> And, <hi>Cry aloud,

the Lord to the Prophet. Such are the

               <hi>to admonish the disorderly,</hi> is

are enjoyned to shun and decline:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 5.</note> but
first we must endeavour by sober advice
and admonition to reclaim them;<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> we

contumacious and incorrigible,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 10.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to hear us,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 6.</note> or becoming deaf to
reproof.<note place="margin">Matt. 18. 17.</note> This although it necessarily
doth include setting out their faults,
and charging blame on them, (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to their offences,) is not the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
reproach here meant, it being
needfull toward a wholsome effect, and


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53987:78"/>
proceeding from charitable intention.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some vehemency (some smartness
and sharpness) of speech may sometimes
be used in defence of Truth, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning
Errours of bad consequence;
especially when it concerneth the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of Truth, that the reputation and
authority of its adversaries should some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
be abased, or abated. If by a
partial opinion or reverence toward
them, however begotten in the minds
of men, they strive to overbear or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
a good cause, their faults
(so far as truth permitteth, and need
requireth) may be detected and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played.
For this cause particularly may
we presume our Lord (otherwise so
meek in his temper, and mild in his
carriage toward all men) did characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
the <hi>Jewish</hi> Scribes in such terms,
that their authority (being then so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
with the people) might not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the Truth, and hinder the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of his Doctrine. This is part of
that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Jud. 3.</note> that duty
of <hi>contending earnestly for the faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
which is incumbent on us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It may be excusable upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
emergent occasions, with some
heat of language to expresse dislike of


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53987:78"/>
notorious wickednesse. As our Lord
doth against the perverse incredulity
and stupidity in the Pharisees,<note place="margin">Matt. 17. 17.</note> their
profane misconstruction of his words
and actions, their malicious opposing
truth, and obstructing his endeavours
in God's service. As S. <hi>Peter</hi> did to
<hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 8. 23.</note> telling him, that he <hi>was
in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond
of iniquity.</hi> As S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Elymas</hi> the
Sorcerer,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 8, 10.</note> when he <hi>withstood him, and
desired to turn away the Deputy, Sergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
from the faith;</hi> O (said he, stirr'd
with a holy zeal and indignation) <hi>thou
full of all subtlety and all mischief, thou
child of the Devil, thou enemy of all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
wilt thou not cease to pervert
the right ways of the Lord?</hi> The same
spirit which inabled him to inflict a
sore punishment on that wicked wretch,
did prompt him to use that sharp lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
toward him; unquestionably
deserved, and seasonably pronounced.
As also, when the High Priest comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him illegally and unjustly to be
misused, that speech from a mind justly
sensible of such outrage broke forth,
<hi>God shall smite thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 23. 3.</note> 
               <hi>thou whited wall.</hi>
So, when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> presumptuously
would have dissuaded our Lord from


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53987:79"/>
compliance with God's will, in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
those crosses which were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him by God's decree, our Lord
calleth him <hi>Satan;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 16. 23.</note>—<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Avant, Satan, thou art an offence unto
me; for thou savourest not the things
that be of God, but those that are of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These sort of speeches, issuing from
just and honest indignation, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
excúsable, oftentimes commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
especially when they come from
persons eminent in authority, of nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
integrity, endued with special mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Divine grace, of wisedom, of
goodnesse; such as cannot be suspected
of intemperate anger, of ill nature, of
ill will, of ill design.</p>
            <p>In such cases as are above mentioned,
a sort of <hi>Evill-speaking</hi> about our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
may be allowable or excusable.
But for fear of over-doing, great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and temper is to be used; and we
should never apply any such limitations
as cloaks to palliate unjust or unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
dealing. Generally it is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable,
to suppresse such eruptions of
passion, then to vent it; for seldom
passion hath not inordinate motions
joyned with it, or tendeth to good ends.
And however it will doe well to reflect


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53987:79"/>
on those cases, and to remark some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
about them.</p>
            <p>First, We may observe, that in all
these cases all possible moderation, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and candour are to be used; so
that no Ill-speaking be practised beyond
what is needfull, or convenient. Even
in prosecution of offences, the bounds
of truth, of equity, of humanity and
clemency are not to be transgressed.
A Judge must not lay on the most cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
person more blame, or contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then the case will bear, or then ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the designs of justice. However
our Neighbour doth incurr the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of sin and of punishment, we must
not be insolent, or contemptuous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him. So we may learn by that
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> back'd with a notable
reason:<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>And it shall be, if the wicked
man be worthy to be beaten, that the
Judge cause him to lie down, and to be
beaten before his face, according to his
fault, by a certain number. Forty stripes
he may give him, and not exceed; lest if
he should exceed, and beat him above
those stripes, then thy brother should seem
vile unto thee.</hi> Whence appears, that
we should be carefull of not vilifying
an offender beyond measure. And how


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53987:80"/>
mildly Governours should proceed in
the administration of justice, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Joshua</hi> may teach us, who thus
examineth <hi>Achan,</hi> the cause of so great
mischief to the publick;<note place="margin">Josh. 7. 19, 25.</note> 
               <hi>My son, give,
I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and make confession unto him; and
tell me now what thou hast done, hide it
not from me. My son;</hi> what compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could be more benign and kind?
<hi>I pray thee;</hi> what language could be
more courteous and gentle? <hi>give glory
to God, and make confession;</hi> what
words could be more inoffensively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent?
And when he sentenced that
great Malefactour, the cause of so much
mischief, this was all he said, <hi>Why hast
thou troubled us? The Lord will trouble
thee;</hi> words void of contumely or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting,
containing onely a close inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the cause, and a simple decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the event he was to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Likewise Ministers, in the
taxing sin and sinners, are to proceed
with great discretion and caution, with
much gentleness and meekness; signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
a tender pity of their infirmities,
charitable desires of their good, the
best opinion of them, and the best


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53987:80"/>
hopes for them, that may consist with
any reason; according to those Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
rules:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> Brethren, if a man be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken
in a fault, ye which are spiritual,
restore such an one in the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
considering thy self, lest thou also
be tempted:<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and,</hi> We that are strong
ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,

the persecution of a spitefull enemy:
it seemeth rather an ebullition of gall,

that can bear a friendly touch, will not

we may observe, that commonly the

that he is in a temper fit to apprehend

course, upon many obvious accounts.
It doth first put in a strong bar to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
for no man willingly doth

disaffected toward him; which

no man can expect to hear truth

who presume to revile others for using
their own judgment freely, and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

this course doth blind the hearer's mind,
so that he cannot discern what he that
pretends to instruct him doth mean, or
how he doth assert his doctrine. Truth
will not be discerned through the smoak
of wrathfull expressions; right being
defaced by foul language will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
passion being excited will not
suffer a man to perceive the sense, or
the force of an argument. The will

rendreth him invincibly obstinate in
his conceits and courses. Briefly, from
this proceeding men become unwilling

to embrace any good instruction or

            <p>Fifthly, As for the examples of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
persons, which in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
do seem to authorize the practice of
Evil-speaking, we may consider, that
as they had especial commission enabling
them to doe some things beyond ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
standing rules, wherein they are
not to be imitated; as they had especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
illumination and direction, which
preserved them from swerving in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
cases from truth and equity; so
the tenour of their life did evidence,
that it was the glory of God, the good
of men, the necessity of the case, which
moved them to it. And of them also
we may observe, that in divers occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(yea generally, whenever onely
their private credit or interest were
concerned,) although grievously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
they did out of meeknesse, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53987:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and charity, wholly forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
speech. Our Saviour, who
sometimes upon special reason in his
discourses used such harsh words, yet
when he was most spitefully accused,
reproached, and persecuted, <hi>did not
open his mouth,</hi> or return one angry
word:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Being reviled, he did not</hi> (as
S. <hi>Peter,</hi> proposing his example to us,
telleth us) <hi>revile again; suffering, he
did not threaten.</hi> He used the softest
language to <hi>Judas,</hi> to the Souldiers, to
<hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> to the Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And the Apostles, who sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
so zealously against the opposers
and perverters of truth, did in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
conversation and demeanour strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe their own rules of abstinence
from reproach:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Being reviled we blesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 14.</note>
               <hi>being persecuted we suffer it;</hi> so doth S.
<hi>Paul</hi> represent their practice. And in
reason we should rather follow them in
this their ordinary course, then in their
extraordinary sallies of practice.</p>
            <p>In fine, however in some cases and
circumstances the matter may admit such
exceptions, so that all language dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull
to our Neighbour is not ever
culpable; yet the cases are so few and
rare in comparison, the practice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53987:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is so dangerous and ticklish, that
worthily forbearing to reproach doth
bear the style of a general Rule: and
particularly, (for clearer direction;)
we are in the following cases obliged
carefully to shun it; or in speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
our Neighbour we must observe
these Cautions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We should never in severe terms
inveigh-against any man without reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
warrant, or presuming upon a
good call and commission thereto. As
every man should not assume to himself
the power of administring justice, (of
trying, sentencing, and punishing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,)
so must not every man take
upon him to speak against those who
seem to doe ill; which is a sort of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
including the infliction of
smart and dammage upon the persons
concerned. Every man hath indeed a
commission, in due place and season,
with discretion and moderation to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
his Neighbour offending; but
otherwise to speak ill of him, no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man hath just right or authority;
and therefore in presuming to doe it, he
is disorderly and irregular, trespassing
beyond his bounds, usurping an undue
power to himself.</p>

2. We should never speak ill of any
man without apparent just cause. It
must be just: we must not reproach
men for things innocent, or indifferent;
for not concurring in disputable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with us, for not complying with our
humour, for not serving our interest,
for not doing any thing to which they
are not obliged, or for using their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in any case: it must be at least
some considerable fault, which we can
so much as tax. It must also be clear
and certain, notorious and palpable;
for to speak ill upon slender conjectures,
or doubtfull suspicions, is full of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.<note place="margin">Jud. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

such reasons, (really being, not affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53987:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
We should never speak worse of
any man what-ever then he certainly
deserveth, according to the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
construction of his doings;
never more then the cause absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.
We should rather be carefull
to fall short of what in rigourous truth
might be said against him, then in the
least to passe beyond it. The best cause
had better seem to suffer a little by our
reservednesse in its defence, then any
man be wronged by our aspersing him;
for God, the patron of truth and right,
is ever able to secure them without the
succour of our unjust and uncharitable
dealing. The contrary practice hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
within it a spice of Slander, that is,
of the worst iniquity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We must never speak ill of any

Hatred or Ill-will. For this murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
this viperous disposition should it

issueth from it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then very bad; it must be a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous

            <p>We must not be provoked thereto
by any Revengefull disposition, or ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous
Spleen, in regard to any injuries
or discourtesies received. For, as we
must not revenge our selves, or render
evil in any other way; so particularly
not in this, which is commonly the

for we are not to slight our

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53987:88"/>
(considering what he is, whence he
came, how he is related, what he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of) can be despicable. Extreme
naughtinesse is indeed contemptible;
but the unhappy person that is engaged
therein,<note place="margin">He that is void of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom despiseth his neighbour. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 12.</note> is rather to be pitied, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.
However, Charity bindeth us
to stifle contemptuous motions of heart,
and not to vent them in vilifying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
Particularly, it is a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
practice, out of contempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
persons for natural imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for meannesse of condition, for
unlucky disasters, for any involuntary
defects: this being indeed to reproach
Mankind, unto which such things are
incident; to reproach Providence,
from the disposal whereof they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.<note place="margin">Prov. 17. 5.</note>
               <hi>Whoso mocketh the poor, despiseth
his Maker,</hi> saith the Wise-man: and the
same may be said of him that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
mocketh him that is dull in parts,
deformed in body, weak in health or
strength, defective in any such way.</p>
            <p>Likewise we must not speak ill out
of Envy; because others do excell us
in any good quality, or exceed us in
fortune. To harbour this base and ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disposition in our minds, is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a Man, (who should delight in


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53987:88"/>
all good springing up any-where, and
befalling any man, naturally allied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him;) it is most unworthy of a
Christian, who should tender his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
good as his own,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 15.</note> and <hi>rejoyce with
those that rejoyce.</hi> From thence to be
drawn to cast reproach upon any man,
is horrible and hainous wickednesse.</p>
            <p>Neither should we ever use reproach
as a means of compassing any Design
we do affect or aim at: 'tis an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
engine of raising us to wealth,
dignity, or repute. To grow by the
diminution, to rise by the depression,
to shine by the eclipse of others, to
build a fortune upon the ruines of our
Neighbour's reputation, is that which
no honourable mind can affect, no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man will endeavour. Our own
wit, courage, and industry, managed
with God's assistence and blessing, are
sufficient, and onely lawfull instruments
of prosecuting honest enterprises; we
need not, we must not in stead of them
employ our Neighbour's disgrace: no
worldly good is worth purchasing at
such a rate, no project worth atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by such foul ways.</p>
            <p>Neither should we out of Malignity,
to cherish or gratify ill humour, use


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53987:89"/>
this practice. It is observable of some
persons, that not out of any formed
displeasure, grudge, or particular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection,
nor out of any particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
but meerly out of a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an
ill disposition, springing up from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or contracted by use, they are
apt to carp at any action, and with
sharp reproach to bite any man that
comes in their way, thereby feeding
and soothing that evil inclination. But
as this inhumane and currish humour
should be corrected, and extirpated
from our hearts; so should the issues
thereof at our mouths be stopped: the
bespattering our Neighbour's good
name should never afford any satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or delight unto us.</p>
            <p>Nor out of Wantonnesse should we
speak ill, for our divertisement or sport.
For our Neighbour's reputation is too
great and precious a thing to be played
with, or offered up to sport; we are
very foolish in so disvaluing it, very
naughty in so misusing it. Our wits
are very barren, our brains are ill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with store of knowledge, if we
can find no other matter of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:53987:89"/>
Nor out of Negligence and inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
should we sputter out reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
speech; shooting ill words at ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
or not regarding who stands in
our way. Among all temerities this is
one of the most noxious, and therefore
very culpable.</p>
            <p>In fine, we should never speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our Neighbour from any other
principle then Charity, or to any other
intent but what is charitable; such as
tendeth to his good, or at least is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
therewith.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Let all your things</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Paul) be done in charity:</hi> and
words are most of the <hi>things</hi> we doe
concerning our Neighbour, wherein
we may expresse Charity. In all our
speeches therefore touching him, we
should plainly shew, that we have a
care of his reputation, that we tender
his interest, that we even desire his
content and repose. Even when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and need do so require, that we
should disclose and reprehend his faults,
we may, we should by the manner and
scope of our speech signify thus much.
Which rule were it observed, if we
should never speak ill otherwise then
out of charity, surely most Ill-speaking
would be cut off; most, I fear, of our


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53987:90"/>

would be marr'd.</p>

wrath, ill-will, contempt, or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity,
that it should expresse tender

toward our brethren; and be apt to

Commonly ill language is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sign of inward enmity and ill-will.
Good-will is wont to shew it self in
good terms; it cloatheth even its
grief handsomely, and its displeasure
carrieth favour in its face: its rigour is
civil and gentle, temper'd with pity for
the faults and errours which it disliketh,


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53987:90"/>
with the desire of their amendment and
recovery whom it reprehendeth. It
would inflict no more evil then is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
it would cure its Neighbour's
disease without exasperating his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
troubling his modesty, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
his credit. As it always jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
candidly, so it never condemneth
extremely.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But so much for the explication
of this Precept, and the directive part
of our discourse. I shall now brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propound some inducements to the
observance thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us consider, that nothing more
then railing and reviling is opposite to

               <hi>doth recommend, nothing
but what is very just and mild:</hi>
which propoundeth the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
of Charity, Meeknesse,
Patience, Peaceablenesse,
Moderation, Equity, Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
or good humour, as its
principal laws, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them the chief fruits of


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53987:91"/>
the Divine Spirit, and Grace: which
chargeth us to curb and compose all our
Passions; more particularly to restrain
and represse Anger, Animosity, Envy,
Malice, and such like dispositions, as
the fruits of carnality and corrupt lust:
which consequently drieth up all the
sources, or dammeth up the sluces of
bad language.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 8.</note> As it doth <hi>above all
things</hi> oblige us to bear no ill-will in
our hearts, so it chargeth us to vent
none with our mouths.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is therefore often expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and prohibited as evil. 'Tis
the property of the wicked, a character
of those who <hi>work iniquity,</hi>

            <p n="4">4. If we look upon such language in
its own nature, what is it but a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome
of a foul, a weak, a disordered
and distempered mind? 'Tis the smoak

5. This practice doth plainly signify
low spirit, ill breeding, and bad man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and thence misbecometh any
wise, any honest, any honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
It agreeth to Children, who are
unapt, and unaccustomed to deal in
matters considerable, to squabble; to
Women of meanest rank, (apt by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or custome, to be transported
with passion,) to scold. In our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
languages it is termed <hi>Villany,</hi> as
being proper for rustick Boors, or men
of coursest education and employment;
who, having their minds debased by
being conversant in meanest affairs, do
vent their sorry passions, and bicker
about their petty concernments, in
such strains; who also, being not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a fair reputation, or sensible
of disgrace to themselves, do little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the credit of others, or care for
aspersing it. But such language is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of those persons, and cannot
easily be drawn from them, who are
wont to exercise their thoughts about
nobler matters, who are versed in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
manageable onely by calm delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and fair persuasion, not by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
and provocative rudenesse; the
which do never work otherwise upon


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53987:92"/>
masculine souls, then so as to procure
disdain, and resistence. Such persons,
knowing the benefit of a good name,
being wont to possesse a good repute,
prizing their own credit as a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
good, will never be prone to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
others of the like by opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
speech.<note place="margin">In quo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari soleo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatem &amp; justitiam &amp; sapientiam Caesaris, qui nunquam nisi honorificentissimè Pompeium ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellat. <hi>Cic.</hi> Epist. Tom. 6. 6.</note> A noble enemy will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
speak of his enemy in bad terms.</p>
            <p>We may farther consider, that all wise,
all honest, all ingenuous persons have an
aversation from ill speaking, and cannot
entertain it with any acceptance or
complacence; that onely ill-natured,
unworthy and naughty people are its
willing auditours, or do abett it with
applause. The good man, in the 15.
Psalm,<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 3.</note> 
               <hi>non accipit opprobrium, doth
not take up,</hi> or accept, <hi>a reproach against
his neighbour:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 4.</note> but <hi>A wicked doer</hi> (saith
the Wise-man) <hi>giveth heed to false lips,
and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.</hi>
And what reasonable man will doe that
which is disgustfull to the wise and
good, is gratefull onely to the foolish
and baser sort of men? I pretermit,

that using this sort of language doth
incapacitate a man for to benefit his

            <p n="8">8. He that useth this kind of speech
doth, as harm and trouble others, so
create many great inconveniencies and

and he is sufficiently punished for this
dealing. No man can otherwise then
live in perpetual fear of reciprocal like
usage from him, whom he is conscious


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53987:93"/>
of having so abused. Whence, if not
justice, or charity toward others, yet
love, and pity of our selves, should
persuade us to forbear it as disquietfull,

            <p>GEneral Declamations against Vice
and Sin are indeed excellently
usefull, as rouzing men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and look about them: but they
do often want effect, because they
onely raise confused apprehensions of
things, and indeterminate propensions
to action; the which usually, before
men throughly perceive or resolve
what they should practise, do decay
and vanish. As he that cries out fire
doth stir up people, and inspireth them
with a kind of hovering tendency eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way; yet no man thence to purpose
moveth, untill he be distinctly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
where the mischief is; then do
they, who apprehend themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
run hastily to oppose it: So,


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53987:96"/>
till we particularly discern where our
offences lie, (till we distinctly know
the hainous nature and the mischievous
consequences of them,) we scarce will
effectually apply our selves to correct
them. Whence it is requisite, that men
should be particularly acquainted with
their sins, and by proper arguments be
dissuaded from them.</p>
            <p>In order whereto I have now selec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one sin to describe, and dissuade
from, being in nature as vile, and in
practice as common, as any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that hath prevailed among men.
It is Slander, a sin which in all times
and places hath been epidemical and
rise; but which especially doth seem
to reign and rage in our Age and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>There are principles innate to men,
which ever have, and ever will incline
them to this offence. Eager appetites
to secular and sensual goods; violent
passions, urging the prosecution of what
men affect; wrath and displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those who stand in the way of
compassing their desires; emulation and
envy toward those who hap to succeed
better, or to attain a greater share in
such things; excessive self-love; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53987:96"/>
malignity and vanity, are
in some degrees connatural to all men,
and ever prompt them to this dealing,
as appearing the most efficacious, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
and easie way of satisfying
such appetites, of promoting such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
of discharging such passions.
Slander thence hath always been a
principal engine, whereby covetous,
ambitious, envious, ill-natured and vain
persons have strove to supplant their
competitours, and advance themselves;
meaning thereby to procure, what they
chiefly prize and like, wealth, or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or reputation, favour and power
in the court, respect and interest with
the people.</p>
            <p>But from especial causes our Age
peculiarly doth abound in this practice:
for, besides the common dispositions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
thereto, there are conceits new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
coined, and greedily entertained by
many, which seem purposely levelled
at the disparagement of Piety, Charity,
and Justice, substituting Interest in the
room of Conscience, authorizing and
commending, for good and wise, all
ways serving to private advantage.
There are implacable dissensions, fierce
animosities, and bitter zeals sprung up;


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53987:97"/>
there is an extreme curiosity, nicenesse,
and delicacy of judgement; there is a
mighty affectation of seeming wise and
witty by any means; there is a great
unsettlement of mind, and corruption
of manners, generally diffused over
people: from which sources it is no
wonder that this floud hath so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown,
that no banks can restrain it,
no fences are able to resist it; so that
ordinary conversation is full with it,
and no demeanour can be secure from
it.</p>
            <p>If we do mark what is done in many
(might I not say, in most?) companies,
what is it, but one telling malicious
stories of, or fastning odious characters
upon another? What do men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
please themselves in so much,
as in carping and harshly censuring, in
defaming and abusing their Neighbours?
Is it not the sport and divertisement of
many, to cast dirt in the faces of all
they meet with; to bespatter any man
with foul imputations? Doth not in
every corner a <hi>Momus</hi> lurk, from the
venome of whose spitefull or petulant
tongue no eminency of rank, dignity
of place, or sacrednesse of office, no
innocence or integrity of life, no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53987:97"/>
or circumspection in behaviour,
no good nature, or benignity in dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and carriage, can protect any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
Do not men assume to themselves
a liberty of telling Romances, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
characters concerning their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
as freely as a Poet doth about
<hi>Hector</hi> or <hi>Turnus, Thersites</hi> or <hi>Draucus?</hi>
Do they not usurp a power of playing
with, of tossing about, of tearing in
pieces their Neighbour's good name, as
if it were the veriest toy in the world?
Do not many, <hi>having a form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
(some of them demurely, others
confidently, both without any sense of,
or remorse for what they doe,) back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
their brethren? Is it not grown so
common a thing to asperse causelesly,
that no man wonders at it, that few
dislike, that scarce any detest it? that
most notorious Calumniatours are heard,
not onely with patience, but with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
yea are even held in vogue and
reverence, as men of a notable talent,
and very serviceable to their party?
so that Slander seemeth to have lost its
nature, and not to be now an odious
sin, but a fashionable humour, a way
of pleasing entertainment, a fine knack,
or curious feat of policy; so that no


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53987:98"/>
man at least taketh himself or others to
be accountable for what is said in this
way? Is not, in fine, the case become
such, that whoever hath in him any
love of truth, any sense of justice or
honesty, any spark of charity toward
his brethren, shall hardly be able to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
himself in the conversations he
meeteth; but will be tempted, with
the Holy Prophet, to wish himself se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred
from society, and cast into so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude;
repeating those words of his,
<hi>Oh that I had in the wildernesse a lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging-place
of way-faring men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 9. 2, 3. &amp; 6. 28.</note> 
               <hi>that I
might leave my people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 22. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and go from them:
for they are—an assembly of treacherous
men, and they bend their tongues like
their bow for lies?</hi> This he wished in an
Age so resembling ours, that I fear the
description with equal patnesse may
sute both:<note place="margin">Jer. 9. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Take ye heed</hi> (said he then,
and may we not advise the like now?)
<hi>every one of his neighbour, and trust ye
not in any brother: for every brother
will utterly supplant, and every neighbour
will walk with slanders. They will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
every one his neighbour, and will
not speak the truth: they have taught
their tongue to speak lies, and weary
themselves to commit iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:53987:98"/>
Such being the state of things, obvious
to experience, no discourse may seem
more needfull, or usefull, then that
which serveth to correct or check this
practice: the which I shall endeavour
to doe, 1. by describing the Nature,
2. by declaring the Folly of it; or
shewing it to be very true which the
Wise-man here asserteth, <hi>He that utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
Slander is a Fool.</hi> The which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
I hope so to prosecute, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man shall be able easily to discern,
and ready heartily to detest this practice.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For explication of its Nature, we
may describe Slander to be the uttering
false (or equivalent to false, morally
false) speech against our Neighbour,
in prejudice to his fame, his safety, his
welfare, or concernment in any kind,
out of malignity, vanity, rashness, ill
nature, or bad design. That which is in

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53987:99"/>
others imply the maners, others suggest
the ends of this practice. But it seemeth
most fully intelligible by observing the
several kinds and degrees thereof; as
also by reflecting on the divers ways
and manners of practising it.</p>
            <p>The principall kinds thereof I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The grossest kind of Slander is
that which in the Decalogue is called
<hi>Bearing false testimony against our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi>
that is, flatly charging him with
facts the which he never committed,
and is no wise guilty of. As in the
case of <hi>Naboth,</hi> when men were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
to say,<note place="margin">1 King. 21. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Naboth did blaspheme God
and the King:</hi> and as was <hi>David</hi>'s
case,<note place="margin">Psal. 35. 11.</note> when he thus complained, <hi>False
witnesses did rise up, they laid to my
charge things that I knew not of.</hi> This
kind in the highest way (that is, in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
proceedings) is more rare; and
of all men, they who are detected to
practise it, are held most vile and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;
as being plainly the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and perillous instruments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
the most desperate enemies of
all mens right and safety that can be.
But also out of the Court there are
many Knights errant of the post, whose


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53987:99"/>
business it is to run about scattering
false reports; sometimes loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
them in open companies,
sometimes closely whispering them in
dark corners; thus infecting conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with their poisonous breath:
these no lesse notoriously are guilty of
this kind, as bearing always the same
malice, and sometimes breeding as ill
effects.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another kind is, Affixing scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
names, injurious epithets, and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
characters upon persons, which
they deserve not.<note place="margin">Num. 16. 3, 13, 14.</note> As when <hi>Corah</hi> and
his complices did accuse <hi>Moses</hi> of being
ambitious, unjust, and tyrannical: when
the Pharisees called our Lord an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postour,<note place="margin">John 19. 7, 21.</note>
a Blasphemer,<note place="margin">Matt. 26. 65.</note> a Sorcerer,<note place="margin">Matt. 9. 3. &amp; 12. 24.</note> a
Glutton and Wine-bibber,<note place="margin">Matt. 11. 19.</note> an Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 2, 5, 14.</note>
and Perverter of the people, one
that <hi>spake against Caesar,</hi> and <hi>forbad to
give tribute:</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 19. 12.</note>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 2.</note> when the Apostles were
charged of being<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 17. 6. &amp; 24. 5.</note> pestilent, turbulent,
factious and seditious fellows. This
sort being very common, and thence
in ordinary repute not so bad, yet in
just estimation may be judged even
worse then the former; as doing to
our Neighbour more heavy and more
irreparable wrong. For it imposeth on


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53987:100"/>
him really more blame, and that such
which he can hardly shake off: because
the charge signifieth habit of evil, and
includeth many acts; then, being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and indefinite, can scarce be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.
He, for instance, that calleth
a sober man Drunkard, doth impute to
him many acts of such intemperance;
(some really past, others probably fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;)
and no particular time or place
being specified, how can a man clear
himself of that imputation, especially
with those who are not throughly
acquainted with his conversation? So
he that calleth a man unjust, proud,
perverse, hypocritical, doth load him
with most grievous faults, which it is
not possible that the most innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should discharge himself from.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Like to that kind is this, Aspersing
a man's actions with harsh censures, and
foul terms, importing that they proceed
from ill principles, or tend to bad ends;
so, as it doth not, or cannot appear.
Thus when we say of him that is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
hospitable,<note place="margin">At nos virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ipsas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertimus, atque Sincerum cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pimus vas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crustare. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quis</note> that he is profuse;
of him that is prudently frugal, that he
is niggardly; of him that is chearfull
and free in his conversation, that he is
vain or loose; of him that is serious


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53987:100"/>
and resolute in a good way,<note place="margin">Nobiscum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit? multùm est demissus homo. illi Tardo cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men pinguis damus. <hi>&amp;c. optimé. Hor.</hi> Serm. 1. 3. Vid. <hi>Sidon. Apoll.</hi>
               </note> that he is
sullen or morose; of him that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
and brisk in vertuous practice,
that it is ambition or ostentation which
acts him; of him that is close and bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the like good way, that it is
sneaking stupidity, or want of spirit;
of him that is reserved, that it is craft;
of him that is open, that it is simplicity
in him: when we ascribe a man's libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
and charity to vain-glory, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity;
his strictnesse of life, and
constancy in devotion, to superstition,
or hypocrisie. When, I say, we passe
such censures, or impose such characters
on the laudable or innocent practice of
our Neighbours, we are indeed Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
imitating therein the great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniatour,
who thus did slander even
God himself, imputing his prohibition
of the Fruit unto envy toward men;
<hi>(God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note> said he, <hi>doth know, that in the
day ye eat thereof, your eyes shall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ye shall be as Gods, knowing
good and evil;)</hi> who thus did ascribe
the steddy Piety of <hi>Job,</hi> not to a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious
love and fear of God, but to
policy,<note place="margin">Job 1. 9. &amp; 2. 4.</note> and selfish design, <hi>Doth Job
fear God for nought?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:53987:101"/>
Whoever indeed pronounceth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Neighbour's intentions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then as they are evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by words, or signified by overt
actions, is a Slanderer; because he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to know, and dareth to averr,
that which he no-ways possibly can
tell whether it be true; because the
heart is exempt from all jurisdiction
here, is onely subject to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and trial of another world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no man can judge concerning
the truth of such accusations; because
no man can exempt, or defend himself
from them: so that apparently such
practice doth thwart all course of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and equity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another kind is,<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 36.</note> Perverting a
man's words or actions disadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
by affected misconstruction. All
words are ambiguous, and capable of
different senses, (some fair, some more
foul;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Epict.</note>) all actions have two handles,
one that candour and charity-will, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
that disingenuity and spite may
lay hold on: and in such cases, to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehend
is a calumnious procedure,
arguing malignant disposition and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
design. Thus when two men
did witnesse, that our Lord affirmed,


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53987:101"/>
he <hi>could demolish the temple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 26. 60, 61.</note> 
               <hi>and rear it
again in three days;</hi> although he did
indeed speak words to that purpose,<note place="margin">Joh. 2. 19.</note>
meaning them in a figurative sense,
(discernible enough to those who
would candidly have minded his drift
and way of speaking;) yet they who
crudely alleged them against him are
called false witnesses.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 5. Every day they wrest my words.</note> 
               <hi>(At last,</hi> saith
the Gospel, <hi>came two false witnesses, and
said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> ubi suprá.</note> This fellow said, I am able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the temple,</hi> &amp;c.) Thus also when
some certified of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> as having
said,<note place="margin">Act. 6. 13, 14.</note> that <hi>Jesus of Nazareth should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
that place, and change the customes
that Moses delivered;</hi> although proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he did speak words near to that
purpose, yet are those men called false
witnesses: <hi>And</hi> (saith S. <hi>Luke) they set
up false witnesses, which said, This man
ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words,</hi> &amp;c.
Which instances plainly do shew, if
we would avoid the guilt of Slander,
how carefull we should be to interpret
fairly and favourably the words and the
actions of our Neighbour.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another sort of this practice is,
Partial and lame representation of mens
discourse, or their practice; suppressing
some part of the truth in them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53987:102"/>
some circumstances about them,
which might serve to explain, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
or to extenuate them. In such a
manner easily, without uttering any
Logical untruth, one may yet grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
calumniate. Thus suppose that a
man speaketh a thing upon supposition,
or with exception, or in way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
or meerly for disputation sake,
in order to the discussion or clearing of
truth; he that should report him asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it absolutely, unlimitedly, positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and peremptorily, as his own settled
judgment, would notoriously calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate.
If one should be inveagled by
fraud, or driven by violence, or slip
by chance into a bad place, or bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
he that should so represent the
grosse of that accident, as to breed an
opinion of that person, that out of pure
disposition and design he did put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
there, doth slanderously abuse that
innocent person. The reporter in such
cases must not think to defend himself
by pretending that he spake nothing
false; for such propositions, however
true in Logick, may justly be deemed
lies in morality, being uttered with a
malicious and deceitfull (that is, with
a calumnious) mind, being apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53987:102"/>
false conceits, and to produce
hurtfull effects concerning our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
There are slanderous truths, as
well as slanderous falshoods: when
truth is uttered with a deceitfull heart,
and to a base end,<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 17.</note> it becomes a lie. <hi>He
that speaketh truth,</hi> (saith the Wise-man)
<hi>sheweth forth righteousnesse: but a false
witnesse, deceit.</hi> Deceiving is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
work of Slander; and truth abused
to that end putteth on its nature, and
will engage into like guilt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another kind of Calumny is, by
Instilling sly suggestions; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they do not downrightly assert
falshoods, yet they breed sinister opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in the hearers; especially in those
who, from weaknesse or credulity, from
jealousie or prejudice, from negligence
or inadvertency, are prone to entertain
them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Herm. <hi>Pastor.</hi> where the <hi>Pastor</hi> observes, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doth in his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse some truths, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> This is done many ways; by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
wily suppositions, shrewd
insinuations, crafty questions, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
comparisons, intimating a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
or inferring some likelihood of,
and thence inducing to believe the fact.
Doth not (saith this kind of Slanderer)
his temper incline him to doe thus?
may not his interest have swayed him
thereto? had he not fair opportunity


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53987:103"/>
and strong temptation to it? hath he
not acted so in like cases? Judge you
therefore whether he did it not. Thus
the close Slanderer argueth; and a
weak or prejudiced person is thereby
so caught, that he presently is ready
thence to conclude the thing done. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
He doeth well, (saith the Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant)
it is true; but why, and to
what end? Is it not, as most men do,
out of ill design? may he not dissemble
now? may he not recoil hereafter?
have not others made as fair a show? yet
we know what came of it. Thus do
calumnious tongues pervert the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men to think ill of the most
innocent, and meanly of the worthiest
actions. Even commendation it self is
often used calumniously, with intent
to breed dislike and ill-will toward a
person commended in envious or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ears; or so as to give passage to
dispraises, and render the accusations
following more credible. 'Tis an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
commonly observed to be much in
use there, where the finest tricks of
supplanting are practised, with greatest
effect; so that, <hi>pessimum inimicorum
genus, laudantes;</hi> there is no more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent

All these kinds of dealing,<note place="margin">

issue from the principles of Slander, and
perform its work, so they deservedly
bear the guilt thereof.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A like kind is that of Oblique and
covert reflexions; when a man doth not
directly or expresly charge his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
with faults, but yet so speaketh,
that he is understood, or reasonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to doe it. This is a very cunning
and very mischievous way of Slandering;
for therein the sculking Calumniatour
keepeth a reserve for himself, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
off from the person concerned the
means of defence. If he goeth to clear
himself from the matter of such aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
What need (saith this insidious
speaker) of that? must I needs mean
you? did I name you? why do you
then assume it to your self? do you
not prejudge your self guilty? I did
not, but your own Conscience it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
doth accuse you. You are so jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and suspicious, as persons over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
or guilty use to be. So meaneth
this serpent out of the hedge securely
and unavoidably to bite his Neighbour;
and is in that respect more base and


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53987:104"/>
more hurtfull then the most flat and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Slanderer.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Another kind is that of Magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and aggravating the faults of others;
raising any small miscarriage into a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
crime, any slender defect into an
odious vice, and any common infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
into a strange enormity; turning a
small <hi>mote in the eye</hi> of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
into a huge <hi>beam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 7. 3.</note> a little dimple
in his face into a monstrous wen. This
is plainly Slander, at least in degree, and
according to the surplusage whereby the
censure doth exceed the fault. As he
that, upon the score of a small debt,
doth extort a great summe, is no lesse
a thief, in regard to what amounts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his due, then if without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
he had violently or fraudulently
seised on it: so is he a Slanderer, that,
by heightning faults or imperfections,
doth charge his Neighbour with greater
blame, or loads him with more disgrace
then he deserves. 'Tis not onely Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to pick a hole where there is none,
but to make that wider which is, so that
it appeareth more ugly, and cannot so
easily be mended. For Charity is wont
to extenuate faults, Justice doth never
exaggerate them. As no man is exempt


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53987:104"/>
from some defects, or can live free from
some misdemeanours; so by this practice
every man may be rendred very odious
and infamous.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Another kind of Slander is, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
to our Neighbour's practice,
judgment, or profession, evil conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
(apt to render him odious,
or despicable) which have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on them, or connexion with
them. There do in every Age occurr
disorders and mishaps, springing from
various complications of causes, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
some of them in a more open and
discernible, others in a more secret and
subtle way; (especially from Divine
judgment and Providence checking or
chastizing Sin:) from such occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it is common to snatch occasion and
matter of Calumny. Those who are
disposed this way, are ready perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to charge them upon whom-ever
they dislike or dissent from, although
without any apparent cause, or upon
most frivolous and senselesse pretences;
yea, often, when Reason sheweth the
quite contrary, and they who are so
charged are in just esteem of all men the
least obnoxious to such accusations. So
usually the best friends of mankind,


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53987:105"/>
those who most heartily wish the peace
and prosperity of the world, and most
earnestly to their power strive to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
them, have all the disturbances
and disasters happening charged on
them by those fiery <hi>Vixons,</hi> who (in
pursuance of their base designs, or
gratification of their wild passions) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
do themselves embroil things, and
raise miserable combustions in the world.
So it is, that they who have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to doe mischief, will have the
confidence also to disavow the blame
and the iniquity, to lay the burthen of
it on those who are most innocent.
Thus, whereas nothing more disposeth
men to live orderly and peaceably, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more conduceth to the settlement
and safety of the publick, nothing so
much draweth blessings down from
Heaven upon the Common-weal, as
true Religion; yet nothing hath been
more ordinary, then to attribute all
the miscarriages and mischiefs that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
unto it: even those are laid at
its door, which plainly do arise from
the contempt or neglect of it; being

These are the chief and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
kinds of Slander; and there are
several ways of practising them worthy
our observing, that we may avoid them;
namely these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The most notoriously-hainous way
is, forging, and immediately venting
ill stories.<note place="margin">Psal. 52. 2.</note> As it is said of <hi>Doeg, Thy
tongue deviseth mischief;</hi> and of another
like companion,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Thou givest thy mouth

and as our Lord saith of the Devil,

               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar,
and the father of it.</hi> This palpably is
the supreme pitch of Calumny, unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any qualification or excuse:
Hell cannot goe beyond this; the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Fiend himself cannot worse employ
his wit, then in minting wrongfull false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another way is, receiving from
others, and venting such stories, which
they who doe it certainly know, or may
reasonably presume to be false: the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
hucksters of counterfeit wares,
or factours in this vile trade. There is
no false coiner, who hath not some
complices and emissaries ready to
take from his hand, and put off his


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53987:108"/>
mony: and such Slanderers at second
hand are scarce lesse guilty then the first
authours. He that breweth lies may
have more wit and skill, but the broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
sheweth the like malice and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse.
In this there is no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

spread tales prejudicial to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's
welfare; relying for his warrant
(as to the truth of them) upon any
slight or slender authority.<note place="margin">

very common and current practice:
men presume it lawfull enough to say
over what-ever they hear; to report
any thing, if they can quote an authour

I tell it as I heard it: <hi>sit fides

me undergoe the blame, if it prove

therein: for as this practice commonly


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53987:108"/>
doth arise from the same wicked prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
at least in some degree, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
altogether the like mischievous
effects, as the wilfull devising and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
Slander: so it no lesse thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

God hath prohibited it, and
reason doth condemn it.<note place="margin">Levit. 19. 16.</note>

as a tale-bearer, (as <hi>Rachil,</hi> that is,) as
a merchant or trader in ill reports and
stories concerning our Neighbour, to
his prejudice. Not onely the framing
them, but the dealing in them beyond
reason or necessity, is interdicted. And
it is part of a Good man's character in
the 15. Psalm, <hi>Non accipit opprobrium,
He taketh not up a reproach against his

               <note place="margin">Psal. 15. 3.</note> that is, he doth not easily

            </p>
            <p>And in reason, before exact trial and
congnizance, to meddle with the fame
and interest of another, is evidently a
practice full of iniquity, such as no man
can allow in his own case, or brook be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53987:109"/>
used toward himself, without jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
himself to be extremely abused by
such reporters. In all reason and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(yea in all discretion,) before we
yield credence to any report concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our Neighbour, or adventure to
relate it, many things are carefully to
be weighed and scanned. We should
concerning our Authour consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be not a particular enemy, or
disaffected to him; whether he be not
ill-humoured, or a delighter in telling
bad stories; whether he be not disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
or unregardfull of justice in his
dealings and discourse; whether he be
not vain, or carelesse of what he saith;
whether he be not light and credulous,
or apt to be imposed upon by any small
appearance; whether at least in the
present case he be not negligent, or too
forward and rash in speaking. We
should also concerning the Matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
mind, whether it be possible,
or probable; whether sutable to the
disposition of our Neighbour, to his
principles, to the constant tenour of
his practice; whether the action im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him be not liable to misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
or his words to misconstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
All reason and equity do, I say,


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53987:109"/>
exact from us, diligently to consider
such things, before we do either embrace
our selves, or transmit unto others any
story concerning our Neighbour; lest
unadvisedly we doe him irreparable
wrong and mischief. Briefly, we should
take his case for our own, and consider
whether we our selves should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
that upon like grounds or testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
any man should believe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
disgracefull things concerning us.
If we fail to doe thus, we do (vainly,
or rashly, or maliciously) conspire
with the Slanderer to the wrong of our
innocent Neighbour; and that in the
Psalmist (by a parity of reason) may
be transferred to us,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 18.</note>

            <p n="4">4. Of kin to this way is the assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to popular rumours, and thence
affirming matters of obloquy to our
Neighbour. Every one by experience
knows how easily false news do rise,
and how nimbly they scatter themselves;
how often they are raised from nothing,
how soon they from small sparks grow
into a great blaze, how easily from one
thing they are transformed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
especially news of this kind,

mankind is. Whoever therefore gives

very malignantly disposed. If he want
not judgment, he cannot but know,
that when he complieth with popular
fame, it is meer chance that he doth
not slander, or rather it is odds that he
shall doe so; he consequently sheweth
himself to be indifferent whether he

these occasion can never be wanting to
them who seek them, or are ready to
embrace them; no innocence, no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
can any-wise prevent them; and
if they may be admitted as grounds of
defamation, no man's good name can
be secure. But he that upon such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
dareth to asperse his Neighbour,<note place="margin">Ziba. 2 Sam. 16. 3. &amp; 19. 27.</note>
is in moral computation no lesse a Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
then if he did the like out of
pure invention, or without any ground
at all: for doubtfull and false in this
case differ little; to devise, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
in matters of this nature, do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
near the same. He that will judge
or speak ill of others, ought to be well
assured of what he thinks or says: he
that asserteth that which he doth not
know to be true, doth as well lie, as
he that affirmeth that which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be false; (for he deceiveth the
hearers, begetting in them an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that he is assured of what he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms;)
especially in dealing with the
concernments of others, whose right


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53987:111"/>
and repute justice doth oblige us to be
wary of infringing, charity should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us to regard and tender as our own.
It is not every possibility, every seeming,
every faint shew or glimmering appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which sufficeth to ground bad
opinion, or reproachfull discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our Brother: the matter should
be clear, notorious, and palpable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we admit a disadvantageous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
into our head, a distastfull resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into our heart, a harsh word into
our mouth about him. Men may fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
themselves sagacious and shrewd,
(persons of deep judgment and fine wit
they may be taken for;) when they
can dive into others hearts, and sound
their intentions; when through thick
mists or at remote distances they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scry
faults in them; when they collect
ill of them by long trains, and subtle
fetches of discourse: but in truth they
do thereby rather bewray in themselves
small love of truth, care of justice, or
sense of charity, together with little
wisedom and discretion: for Truth is
onely seen in a clear light; Justice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
strict proof;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 5, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Charity thinketh
no evil,</hi> and <hi>believeth all things</hi> for the
best; Wisedom is not forward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53987:111"/>
before full evidence.<note place="margin">Prov. 18. 13.</note> 
               <hi>(He,</hi> saith
the Wise-man, <hi>that answereth a matter
before he heareth it, it is folly and shame
unto him.)</hi> In fine, they who proceed
thus, as it is usual that they speak false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as it is casual that they ever speak
truly, as they affect to speak ill, true
or false; so worthily they are to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
among Slanderers.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another like way of Slandering
is, impetuous or negligent sputtering
out of words, without minding what
truth or consequence there is in them,
how they may touch or hurt our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
To avoid this sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we must not
onely be free from intending mischief,
but wary of effecting it; not onely
carefull of not wronging one distinct
person, but of harming any promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously;
not onely abstinent from aiming
directly, but provident not to hit ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
any person with obloquy. For
as he that dischargeth shot into a crowd,
or so as not to look about regarding
who may stand in the way, is no lesse
guilty of doing mischief, and bound to
make satisfaction to them he woundeth,
then if he had aimed at some one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
so if we fling out bad words at
random, which may light unluckily, and


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53987:112"/>
defame some-body, we become Slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
unawares, and before we think on
it. This practice hath not ever all the
malice of the worst Slander, but it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
often the effects thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth incurr its guilt, and its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
especially it being common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
derived from ill temper, or from bad
habit, which we are bound to watch
over, to curb, and to correct. The
Tongue is a sharp and parlous weapon,
which we are bound to keep up in the
sheath, or never to draw forth but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly,
and upon just occasion; it must
ever be wielded with caution and care:
to brandish it wantonly, to lay about
with it blindly and furiously, to slash
and smite therewith any that happeth
to come in our way, doth argue malice,
or madnesse.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is an ordinary way of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to calumniate, for men, reflecting
upon some bad disposition in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
(although resulting from their
own particular temper, from their bad
principles, or from their ill custome,)
to charge it presently upon others;
presuming others to be like themselves:
like the wicked person in the Psalm,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 21.</note>
               <hi>Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53987:112"/>
an one as thy self.</hi> This is to slander
Mankind first in the grosse; then in
retail, as occasion serveth, to asperse
any man: this is the way of half-witted
<hi>Machiavilians,</hi> and of desperate repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
in wickednesse, who, having
prostituted their consciences to vice,
for their own defence and solace, would
shrowd themselves from blame under
the shelter of common pravity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity;<note place="margin">Remedium poenae suae ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrantur, si nemo sit sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, si omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatur, si tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba sit pereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, <hi>&amp;c.

accusing all men of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they know themselves guilty. But
surely there can be no greater iniquity
then this, that one man should undergo
blame for the ill conscience of another.</p>
            <p>These seem to be the chief kinds of
Slander, and most common ways of
practising it. In which description the
Folly thereof doth, I suppose, so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shine, that no man can look thereon
without loathing and despising it, as not
onely a very ugly, but a most foolish
practice. No man surely can be wise,
who will suffer himself to be defiled
therewith. But to render its Folly more
apparent, we shall display it; declaring
it to be extremely foolish upon several
accounts. But the doing this, in regard

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Slandering is Foolish, as sinfull

as proceeding from ignorance,
errour, inconsideratenesse, vanity; as
implying weak judgement, and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53987:114"/>
of Reason, and best rules of Wisedom;
as producing very mischievous effects
to our selves, bereaving us of the chief
goods, and exposing us to the worst
evils. What can be more egregiously
absurd, then to dissent in our opinion
and discord in our choice from infinite
Wisedom; to provoke by our actions
sovereign Justice, and immutable Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
to oppose Almighty Power, and
offend immense Goodnesse; to render
our selves unlike, and contrary in our
doings, our disposition, our state, to
absolute Perfection and Felicity? What
can be more desperately wild, then to
disoblige our best Friend, to forfeit his
love and favour, to render him our
Enemy, who is our Lord and our Judge,
upon whose meer will and disposal all
our subsistence, all our welfare does ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely

can be conceived, then to deprive
our Minds of all true content here, and
to separate our Souls from eternal Bliss
hereafter; to gall our Consciences now
with soar Remorse, and to engage our
selves for ever in remedilesse Miseries?
Such Folly doth all Sin include: whence
in Scripture-style worthily Goodnesse

practice. The Slanderer is an enemy,
as the most fierce and outrageous, so
the most base and unworthy that can
be: he fighteth with the most perillous

atchieveth the greatest mischief that can
be. His words are, as the Psalmist saith
of <hi>Doeg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 52. 4.</note> 
               <hi>devouring words, (Thou lovest
all devouring words, O thou deceitfull
tongue:)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 25. 18. &amp; 12. 6.</note> and, <hi>A man</hi> (saith the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
<hi>that beareth false witness against
his neighbour, is a maul, and a sword,
and a sharp arrow;</hi>
               <note place="margin">An ungodly man diggeth up evil, and in his lips there is a burning fire.</note> that is, he is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
instrument of all mischiefs:
he smiteth and bruiseth like a <hi>maul,</hi>
he cutteth and pierceth like a <hi>sword,</hi>
he thus doth hurt near at hand; and
at distance he woundeth like a <hi>sharp
arrow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 27.</note> it is hard any-where to evade
him,<note place="margin">Ecclus 28. 18, &amp;c.</note> or to get out of his reach. <hi>Many</hi>
(saith another Wise-man, the imitatour
of <hi>Solomon) have fallen by the edge of
the sword: but not so many as have fallen
by the tongue. Well is he that is defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from it, and hath not passed through
the venome thereof; who hath not drawn
the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in
its bands. For the yoke thereof is as a


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53987:116"/>
yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are
bands of brass. The death thereof is an
evil death, the grave were better then it.</hi>
Incurable are the wounds which the
Slanderer inflicteth, irreparable the
dammages which he causeth, indeleble
the marks which he leaveth.<note place="margin">Adversus Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophantae mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum nullum est remedium.</note> 
               <hi>No bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
can heal the biting of a Sycophant;</hi>
no thread can stitch up a good name
torn by calumnious defamation; no
soap is able to cleanse from the stains
aspersed by a foul mouth. <hi>Aliquid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerebit;</hi>
somewhat always of suspicion
and ill opinion will stick in the minds
of those who have given ear to slander.
So extremely opposite is this practice
unto the Queen of Vertues, <hi>Charity.</hi>
Its property indeed is,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 7.</note> to <hi>believe all
things,</hi> that is, all things for the best,
and to the advantage of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
not so much as to suspect any
evil of him, without unavoidably-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
cause: how much more not to
devise any falshood against him? It
<hi>covereth</hi> all things,<note place="margin">Prov. 17. 9.</note> studiously conniving
at real defects, and concealing assured
miscarriages: how much more not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging
imaginary or false scandals?
It disposeth to seek and further any
the least good concerning him: how


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53987:117"/>
much more will it hinder committing
grievous outrage upon his dearest good
name?</p>
            <p>Again, all injustice is abominable;
to doe any sort of wrong is a hainous
crime; that crime, which of all most
immediately tendeth to the dissolution
of society, and disturbance of humane
life; which God therefore doth most
loath, and men have reason especially
to detest. And of this the Slanderer is
most deeply guilty.<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 28.</note> 
               <hi>A witness of Belial
scorneth judgement, and the mouth of
the wicked devoureth iniquity,</hi> saith the
Wise-man. He is indeed, according to
just estimation, guilty of all kinds what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of injury, breaking all the Second
Table of Commands respecting our
Neighbour. Most formally and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he <hi>beareth false witnesse against his
neighbour:</hi> He doth <hi>covet his neighbour's
goods;</hi> for 'tis constantly out of such
an irregular desire, for his own presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
advantage,<note place="margin">Wo be to them who justifie the wicked for reward, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the righteous from him.</note> to dispossess his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of some good, and transfer it on
himself, that the Slanderer uttereth his
tale: He is ever a thief and robber of
his good name, a deflowrer and defiler
of his reputation, an<note n="*" place="margin">Dei Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos linguae gladio jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lâstis, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem non corporis, sed honoris. <hi>Opt.</hi> lib. 2.</note> assassine and
murtherer of his honour.<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 23.</note> So doth he


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53987:117"/>
violate all the rules of justice, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrateth
all sorts of wrong against his
Neighbour.</p>
            <p>He may indeed perhaps conceive it
no great matter that he committeth;
because he doth not act in so boisterous
and bloudy a way, but onely by words,
which are subtle, slimme, and transient
things; upon his Neighbour's credit
onely, which is no substantial, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
matter. He draweth (thinks he)
no bloud, nor breaketh any bones, nor
impresseth any remarkable scar: 'tis
onely the soft air he breaketh with his
tongue, 'tis onely a slight character that
he stampeth on the fancy, 'tis onely an
imaginary stain that he daubeth his
Neighbour with: therefore he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
no great wrong done, and seemeth
to himself innocent, or very excusable.
But these conceits arise from great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerateness,
or mistake; nor can
they excuse the Slanderer from grievous
injustice. For in dealing with our
Neighbour, and meddling with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
we are not to value things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our fancy, but according to
the price set on them by the owner:
we must not reckon that a trifle, which
he prizeth as a jewel. Since then all


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53987:118"/>
men (especially men of honour and
honesty) do, from a necessary instinct
of nature, estimate their good name
beyond any of their goods, yea do
commonly hold it more dear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
then their very lives; we, by
violently or fraudulently bereaving
them of it, doe them no lesse wrong,
then if we should rob or couzen them
of their substance, yea then if we should
maim their body, or spill their bloud,
or even stop their breath. If they as
grievously feel it, and resent it as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as they do any other outrage, the
injury is really as great to them. Even
the Slanderer's own judgement and
conscience might tell him so much:
for they who most slight another's
fame, are usually very tender of their
own, and can with no patience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
that others should touch it: which
demonstrates the inconsideratenesse of
their judgment, and the iniquity of
their practice. It is an injustice not to be
corrected or cured. Thefts may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored,
Wounds may be cured; but
there is no restitution or cure of a lost
good name: it is therefore an irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
injury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:53987:118"/>
Nor is the thing it self, in true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
contemptible; but in it self really
very considerable.<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1. &amp; 15. 30.</note> 
               <hi>A good name,</hi> saith
<hi>Solomon</hi> himself,<note place="margin">Eccles 7. 1.</note> (no fool,) <hi>is rather to be
chosen then great riches; and loving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
rather then silver and gold.</hi> In its
consequences it is much more so; the
chief interests of a man, the successe of
his affairs, his ability to doe good, (for
himself, his friends, his neighbour,) his
safety,<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 6.</note> the best comforts and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of his life, sometimes his life it
self, depending thereon: so that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
doth snatch or filch it from him,
doth not onely according to his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in morall value, but in reall
effect commonly rob, sometime mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ever exceedingly wrong his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
It is often the sole reward of a
man's Vertue and all the fruit of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry;
so that by depriving him of
that, he is robb'd of all his estate, and
left stark naked of all, excepting a
good Conscience, which is beyond the
reach of the world, and which no malice
or misfortune can devest him of. Full
then of iniquity, full of uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
full of all wickednesse is this
practice; and consequently full it is of
Folly. No man, one would think, of


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53987:119"/>
any tolerable sense, should dare, or
deign to incurr the guilt of a practice
so vile and base, so indeed diabolical
and detestable. But farther more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Slanderer is plainly a Fool;
because he maketh wrong judgments
and valuations of things, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
driveth on silly bargains for himself,
in result whereof he proveth a great
loser. He means by his calumnious
stories either to vent some passion boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in him, or to compasse some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
which he affects, or to please some
humour that he is possessed with: but
is any of these things worth purchasing
at so dear a rate? can there be any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
exchange for our honesty? Is it
not more advisable to suppress our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or to let it evaporate otherwise,
then to discharge it in so foul a way?
Is it not better to let go a petty inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
then to further it by committing
so notorious and hainous a sin; to let
an ambitious project sink, then to buoy
it up by such base means? Is it not
wisedom rather to smother, or curb
our humour, then by satisfying it thus
to forfeit our innocence? Can any
thing in the world be so considerable,


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53987:119"/>
that for its sake we should defile our
Souls by so foul a practice, making
shipwreck of a good Conscience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning
honour and honesty, incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the guilt, and all the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to so enormous a crime? Is
it not far more wisedom, contentedly to
see our Neighbour to enjoy credit and
successe, to flourish and thrive in the
world, then by such base courses to
sully his reputation, to rifle him of his
goods, to supplant or cross him in his
affairs? We do really, when we think
thus to depresse him, and to climb up
to wealth or credit by the ruines of his
honour, but debase our selves. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
comes of it, (whether he succeeds,
or is disappointed therein,) assuredly
he that useth such courses will himself
be the greatest loser, and deepest suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer.
'Tis true which the Wise-man
saith,<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 6.</note> 
               <hi>The getting of treasures by a lying
tongue, is a vanity tossed to and fro of
them that seek death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 5. 18.</note> And, <hi>Woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>that draw
iniquity with cords of vanity;</hi> that is,
who by falshood endeavour to compass
unjust designs.</p>
            <p>But it is not, perhaps he will pretend,
for to asswage a private passion, or to


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53987:120"/>
promote his particular concernment,
that he makes so bold with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or deals so harshly with him;
but for the sake of orthodox Doctrine,
for advantage of the true Church, for
the advancement of publick Good, he
judgeth it expedient to asperse him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This indeed is the covert of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Slanders: zeal for some Opinion,
or some Party, beareth out men of Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian
and factious spirits in such practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
they may doe, they may say any
thing for those fine ends. What is a
little truth, what is any man's reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in comparison to the carrying on
such brave designs? But (to omit that
men do usually prevaricate in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
that it is not commonly for love
of truth, but of themselves, not so
much for the benefit of their Sect, but
for their own interest, that they calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate)
this plea will no-wise justifie
such practice. For Truth and Sincerity,
Equity and Candour, Meeknesse and
Charity are inviolably to be observed,
not onely toward dissenters in opinion,
but even toward declared enemies of
truth it self; we are to <hi>bless them,</hi> (that
is, to speak well of them, and to wish
well to them,) <hi>not to curse</hi> them, (that


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53987:120"/>
is, not to reproach them, or to wish
them ill, much lesse to bely them.)
Truth also, as it cannot ever need, so
doth it always loath and scorn the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
and the succour of lies; it is
able to support and protect it self by
fair means; it will not be killed upon
a pretence of saving it, or thrive by
its own ruine. Nor indeed can any
party be so much strengthned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derpropt,
as it will be weakned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined,
by such courses: No cause
can stand firm upon a bottom so loose
and slippery, as falshood is: All the
good a Slanderer can doe is, to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
what he would maintain. In
truth, no Heresie can be worse, then
that would be which should allow to
play the Devil in any case. He that
can dispense with himself to slander a
<hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Turk,</hi> doth in so doing ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself worse then either of them
by profession are: for even they (and
even Pagans themselves) disallow the
practice of inhumanity and iniquity.
All men by light of nature avow Truth
to be honourable, and Faith to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably
observed. He doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what it is to be <hi>Christian,</hi> or
careth not to practise according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53987:121"/>
who can find in his heart in any
case, upon any pretence, to calumniate.
In fine, to prostitute our Conscience,
or sacrifice our honesty, for any cause,
to any interest what-ever, can never be
warrantable or wise. Farther,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Slanderer is a Fool, because
he useth improper means and preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
methods of effecting his purposes.
As there is no design worth the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on by ways of falshood and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
so is there scarce any (no good or
lawfull one at least) which may not
more surely, more safely, more clever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be atchieved by means of truth and
justice. Is not always the straight way
more short then the oblique and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked?
is not the plain way more easie
then the rough and cragged? is not
the fair way more pleasant and passable
then the foul? Is it not better to walk
in paths that are open and allowed,
then in those that are shut up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited;
then to clamber over walls,
to break through fences, to trespasse
upon enclosures?<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 9.</note> Surely yes: <hi>He that
walketh uprightly, walketh surely.</hi> Using
strict veracity and integrity, candour
and equity, is the best method of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing
good designs. Our own


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53987:121"/>
industry, good use of the parts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
God hath given us, embracing
fair opportunities, God's blessing and
Providence, are sufficient means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon for procuring, in an honest
way, what-ever is convenient for us.
These are ways approved, and amiable
to all men; they procure the best
friends, and fewest enemies; they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
to the practiser a chearfull courage,
and good hope; they meet with lesse
disappointment, and have no regret or
shame attending them. He that hath
recourse to the other base means, and
<hi>maketh lies his refuge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 28. 15, 17.</note> as he renounceth
all just and honest means,<note place="margin">Jer. 28. 15.</note> as he disclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
all hope in God's assistence, and
forfeiteth all pretence to his blessing;
so he cannot reasonably expect good
successe, or be satisfied in any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.
The supplanting way indeed
seems the most curt and compendious
way of bringing about dishonest or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
designs: but as a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
is certainly dishonoured thereby,
so is it apt thence to be defeated; it
raising up enemies and obstacles, yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
advantages to who-ever is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to cross us. As in trade it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
that the best course to thrive is


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53987:122"/>
by dealing squarely and truly; any
fraud or couzenage appearing there
doth overthrow a man's credit, and
drive away custome from him: so in
all other transactions, as he that dealeth
justly and fairly will have his affairs
proceed roundly, and shall find men
ready to comply with him; so he that
is observed to practise falshood, will
be declined by some, opposed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
disliked by all; no man scarce
willingly will have to doe with him;
he is commonly forced to stand out
in businesse, as one that plays foul
play.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Lastly, the Slanderer is a very
Fool, as bringing many great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
troubles, and mischiefs on
himself.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Prov. 18. 7. &amp; 13. 3. &amp; 18. 21.</note> 
               <hi>A fool's mouth</hi> (saith the Wise-man)
<hi>is his destruction, his lips are the
snare of his soul:</hi> and if any kind of
speech is destructive and dangerous,
then is this certainly most of all; for
by no means can a man enflame so fierce
anger, impresse so stiff hatred, raise so
deadly enmity against himself, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
so endanger his safety, ease,
and welfare, as by this practice. Men
can more easily endure, and sooner


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53987:122"/>
will forgive, any sort of abuse then
this; they will rather pardon a robber
of their goods, then a defamer of their
good name.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such an one indeed is not
onely odious to the person immediately
concerned, but generally to all men
that observe his practice. Every man
presently will be sensible how easily
it may be his own case, how liable
he may be to be thus abused, in a
way against which there is no guard or
defence.<note place="margin">—ecquid Ad te pòst paulò ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra pericula sentis? <hi>Hor.</hi> Ep. 1. 18.</note> The Slanderer therefore is
apprehended a common enemy, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to all men; and thence rendreth
all men averse from him, and ready to
crosse him.<note place="margin">—Sibi quisque timet, quanquam est intactus &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. <hi>Idem.</hi>
               </note> Love and peace, tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and security can onely be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by innocent and true dealing:
so the Psalmist hath well taught us;
<hi>What man is he that desireth life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 34. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>and
loveth many days, that he may see good?
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips
from speaking guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, All wise, all noble, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
and honest persons have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
from this practice, and cannot
entertain it with any acceptance, or
complacence.<note place="margin">Prov. 13. 5.</note> 
               <hi>(A righteous man hateth
lying,</hi> saith the Wise-man.) It is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53987:123"/>
ill-nurtured and ill-natured, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and naughty people, that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
auditours or encouragers thereof.
<hi>A wicked doer</hi> (saith the Wise-man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain)
<hi>giveth heed to false lips;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and a
liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.</hi> All
love of truth, and regard to justice, and
sense of humanity, all generosity and
ingenuity, all charity and good will to
men, must be extinct in those who can
with delight, or indeed with patience,
lend an ear, or give any countenance
to a Slanderer: and is not he a very
Fool, who chuseth to displease the best,
onely soothing the worst of men?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Slanderer indeed doth
banish himself from all good conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and company, or intruding into
it becomes very disgustfull thereto:
for he worthily is not onely looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as an enemy to those whom he slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth,
but to those also upon whom
he obtrudeth his calumnious discourse.
He not onely wrongeth the former by
the injury, but he mocketh the latter
by the falshood of his stories; implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charging his hearers with weaknesse
and credulity, or with injustice and
pravity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:53987:123"/>
Fifthly, He also derogateth wholly
from his own credit, in all matters of
discourse. For he that dareth thus to
injure his Neighbour, who can trust
him in any thing he speaks? what will
not he say to please his vile humour, or
farther his base interest? what (thinks
any man) will he scruple or boggle
at, who hath the heart in thus doing
wrong and mischief to imitate the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?
Farther,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, This practice is perpetually
haunted with most troublesome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
inward regret, and self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
fear, and disquiet:<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. &amp;c. Chrys.<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the
conscience of dealing so unworthily
doth smite and rack him; he is ever
in danger, and thence in fear to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and requited for it. Of these
passions the manner of his behaviour is
a manifest indication: for men do seldom
vent their slanderous reports openly,
and loudly, to the face, or in the ear of
those who are concerned in them; but
do utter them in a low voice, in dark
corners, out of sight and hearing, where
they conceit themselves at present safe
from being called to an account.<note n="‖" place="margin">Psal. 59. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Swords</hi>
(saith the Psalmist of such persons) <hi>are
in their lips; for, Who, say they, doth,


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53987:124"/>
hear?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 101. 5.</note> And, <hi>Whoso privily slandereth
his neighbour, him will I cut off,</hi> saith
<hi>David</hi> again, intimating the common
manner of this practice. Calumny is
like <hi>the plague,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 91. 6.</note> 
               <hi>that walketh in darkness.</hi>
Hence appositely are the practisers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
termed whisperers, and backbiters:
their heart suffers them not openly to
avow, their conscience tells them they
cannot fairly defend their practice. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The consequent of this
practice is commonly shamefull disgrace,
with an obligation to retract, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <hi>The lip of truth shall be established for
ever; but a lying lip is but for a moment,</hi>
saith the great observer of things. And
when the Slander is disclosed, the Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
is obliged to excuse, (that is, to
palliate one lie with another, if he can
doe it,) or forced to recant, with much
disgrace and extreme displeasure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
he is also many times constrained,
with his losse and pain, to repair the
mischief he hath done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:53987:124"/>
Eighthly, To this in likelihood the
concernments of men, and the powers
which guard justice will forcibly bring
him: and certainly his Conscience will
bind him thereto; God will indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably
exact it from him. He can never
have any sound quiet in his mind, he can
never expect pardon from Heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acknowledging his fault, repairing
the wrong he hath done, restoring that
good name of which he dispossessed his
Neighbour: for in this no lesse then in
other cases Conscience cannot be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
remission will not be granted,
except due restitution be performed:
and of all restitutions this surely is the
most difficult, most laborious, and most
troublesome. 'Tis no-wise so hard to
restore goods stollen or extorted, as
to recover a good opinion lost, to wipe
off aspersions cast on a man's name, to
cure a wounded reputation: the most
earnest and diligent endeavour can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ever effect this, or spread the plaister
so far as the soar hath reached. The Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
therefore doth engage himself into
great streights, incurring an obligation
to repair an almost-irreparable mischief.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, This practice doth also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
revenge it self, imposing on its


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53987:125"/>
actour a perfect retaliation;<note place="margin">He that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently seeketh good, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth favour: but he that seeketh mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, it shall come unto him. <hi>Prov. 11. 27.

            <p>Tenthly, In fine, the Slanderer (if

we be severely reckoned with for this
sort of words, so empty of truth and
void of equity; words that are not
onely negatively vain, or uselesse, but
positively vain, as false, and spoken to
bad purpose? If Slander perhaps here
may evade detection, or scape deserved
punishment; yet infallibly hereafter,
at the dreadfull Day, it shall be disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
irreversibly condemned, inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
persecuted with condign reward of
utter shame and sorrow.</p>
            <p>Is not he then, he who, out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity,
or vanity, to serve any design,
or sooth any humour in himself or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
doth by committing this sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
himself into all these great evils,
both here and hereafter, a most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and deplorable Fool?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:53987:126"/>
Having thus described the Nature of
this Sin, and declared the Folly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we need, I suppose, to say no
more for dissuading it; especially to
persons of a generous and honest mind,
who cannot but scorn to debase and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
themselves by so mean and vile a
practice; or to those who seriously do
professe Christianity, that is, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which peculiarly above all others
prescribeth constant Truth, strictest Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and highest Charity.</p>
            <p>I shall onely adde, that since our
faculty of speech (wherein we do excell
all other creatures) was given us, as in
the first place to praise and glorifie our
Maker, so in the next to benefit and
help our Neighbour; as an instrument
of mutual succour and delectation, of
friendly commerce and pleasant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
together; for instructing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising,
comforting and chearing one
another; it is an unnatural perverting,
and an irrational abuse thereof, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it to the dammage, disgrace, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
or wrong in any kind of our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Better indeed had we been as
Brutes without its use, then we are, if
so worse then bruitishly we abuse it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:53987:126"/>
Finally, all these things being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
we may, I think, reasonably
conclude it most evidently true, that,
<hi>He which uttereth Slander, is a Fool.</hi>

much the greater part seemeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in Speech; for as speaking doth
take up the greatest part of our life, (our
quick and active Mind continually ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
its Thoughts, and discharging its
Passions thereby; all our conversation
and commerce passing through it, it
having a large influence upon all our
practice) so Speech commonly having
our Neighbour and his Concernments
for its Objects, it is necessary, that
either most of our Charity will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53987:128"/>
therein, or that by it we shall
most offend against that great Duty,
together with its Associates, Justice and
Peace.</p>
            <p>And all Offences of this kind (which
transgress Charity, violate Justice, or
infringe Peace) may perhaps be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
in this Apostolical Precept;
for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, according to
its origination, and according to some
use, doth signifie all kind of Obloquy,
and so may comprize slander, harsh
censure, reviling, scoffing, and the like
kinds of speaking against our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
but in stricter acceptation, and
according to peculiar use, it denoteth
that particular sort of Obloquy, which
is called <hi>Detraction,</hi> or <hi>Backbiting:</hi> So
therefore we may be allowed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it here; and accordingly I
now mean to describe it, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
from its practice.</p>
            <p>There is between this, and the other
chief sorts of Obloquy, (Slander, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring,
and Reviling) much affinity,
yet there is some difference; for Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
involveth an imputation of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
Reviling includeth bitter or
foul language, but Detraction may
be couched in Truth, and cloathed in


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53987:128"/>
fair Language; it is a Poison often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
in sweet Liquor, and ministred
in a Golden Cup. It is of nearer kin
to Censuring, and accordingly S. <hi>James</hi>
here coupleth it thereto: <hi>He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth
from a Brother, and he that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth
his Brother, backbiteth the Law,
and censureth the Law:</hi> yet may these
two be distinguished; for Censuring
seemeth to be of more general purport,
extending indifferently to all kinds of
Persons, Qualities, and Actions, which
it unduly taxeth; but Detraction espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
respecteth worthy Persons, good
Qualities, and laudable Actions, the
reputation of which it aimeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,
or to impair.</p>
            <p>This sort of ill practice (so rife in
use, so base in its nature, so mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
in its effects) it shall be my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to describe, that we may
know it, and to dissuade, that we may
shun it.</p>
            <p>It is the fault (opposite to that part
of Charity and Goodness, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Ingenuity, or Candor) which, out
of naughty disposition or design, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to disgrace worthy Persons, or to
disparage good Actions, looking for
blemishes and defects in them, using


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53987:129"/>
care and artifice to pervert and misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
things to that purpose.</p>
            <p>An honest and charitable Mind dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
us, when we see any Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with good Qualities, and pursuing
a tenour of good practice, to esteem
such a Person, to commend him, to
interpret what he doth to the best, not
to suspect any ill of him, or to seek any
exception against him; it inclineth us,
when we see any Action materially
good, to yield it simply due approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and praise, without searching for,
or surmising any defect in the cause or
principle, whence it cometh, in the
design or end to which it tendeth, in
the way or manner of performing it.
A good man would be sorry to have
any good thing spoiled; as to find a
crack in a fair Building, a flaw in a fine
Jewel, a canker in a goodly Flower,
is grievous to any indifferent man; so
would it be displeasing to him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
defects in a worthy Person, or
commendable Action; he therefore
will not easily entertain a suspicion of
any such, he never will hunt for any.
But on the contrary, 'tis the property
of a Detractor, when he seeth a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Person, (whom he doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53987:129"/>
or whom he is concerned to
wrong) to survey him throughly, and
to sift all his Actions, with intent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scry
some failing, or any semblance of
a fault, by which he may disparage
him; when he vieweth any good
Action, he peereth into it, labouring
to espy some pretence, to derogate
from the commendation apparently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it. This in general is the
nature of this Fault. But we may get
a fuller understanding of it, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
more distinctly some particular
Acts, wherein it is commonly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
or the several paths in which the
detracting Spirit treadeth; such are
these following:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Detractor is wont to represent
Persons and Actions under the most
disadvantagious Circumstances he can,
setting out those which may cause them
to appear odious or despicable, slipping
over those which may commend or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them. There is no Person so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
who is not by his Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
forced to omit some things, which
would become him to do, if he were
able; to perform some things lamely,
and otherwise then he would do, if
he could reach it; no Action so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53987:130"/>
but may have some defect in matter,
or manner,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Theoph.</note> uncapable of redress; and
he that representeth such Person or
Action, leaving out those excusing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
doth tend to beget a bad
or mean opinion of them, robbing them
of their due value, and commendation:
thus to charge a man of not having
done a good work, when he had not
the power, or opportunity to perform
it, or is by cross accidents hindred from
doing it according to his desire; to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
the Action was not done exactly,
in the best Season, in the rightest Mode,
in the most proper Place, with Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Looks, or Gestures most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
these are tricks of a Detractor;
who when he cannot deny the Metal
to be good, and the Stamp true, he
clippeth it, and so would reject it from
being current.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is wont to misconstrue ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
Words, or to misinterpret
doubtful appearances of Things: Let a
man speak never so well, or act never
so fairly, yet a Detractor will say his
Words may bear this ill Sence, his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may tend to that bad Purpose; we
may therefore suspect his meaning, and
cannot yield him a full Approbation.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53987:130"/>

               </note> assigning
bad Appellations or Epithets to good or
indifferent Qualities: the names of
Vertue and Vice do so neerly border
in signification, that it is easy to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them from one to another, and to
give the best Quality a bad Name:
Thus, by calling a sober man sowre, a
chearful man vain, a conscientious man
morose,<note place="margin">Hor. Sat. L. 3.</note> a devout man superstitious, a
free man prodigal, a frugal man sordid,
an open man simple, a reserved man
crafty, one that standeth upon his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Honesty proud, a kind man
ambitiously popular, a modest man
sullen, timerous, or stupid, is a very
easy way to detract, and no Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
can scape being disparaged.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He doth imperfectly characterize
Persons, so as studiously to vail, or
faintly to disclose their Vertues, and
good Qualities, but carefully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and fully to aggravate or amplify
any defects or failings in them. The
Detractor will pretend to give a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of his Neighbour, but in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he stifleth what may commend him,
and blazoneth what may disgrace him;
like an envious Painter he hideth, or


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53987:131"/>
in dusky Colours shadoweth all the
graceful Parts and goodly Features, but
setteth out all Blemishes in the briskest
Light, and most open view. Every
Face hath in it some Mole, Spot or
Wrinkle; there is no man, that hath
not (as they speak) some blind place;
some blemishes in his nature or temper,
some faults contracted by education or
custom, somewhat amiss proceeding
from ignorance, or misapprehension of
things; these (although they be in
themselves small and inconsiderable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they are some of them involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and thence inculpable, although
they be much corrected or restrained by
vertuous Discipline, although they are
compensated by greater Vertues, yet
these) the Detractor snatcheth, mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and out of them frameth an Idea
of his Neighbour, apt to breed hatred,
or contempt of him in an unwary Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator;
whereas were Charity, were
Equity, were Humanity to draw the
Person, it representing his Qualities
with just advantage, would render him
lovely, and venerable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He is wont not to commend or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any thing absolutely, and clearly, but
always interposing some exception, to


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53987:131"/>
which he would have it seem liable: the
man indeed,<note place="margin">Non audes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petere, qui ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo ampliùs criminaris: &amp; quia non habes quod objicias, simulas veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundiam; ut lector te putet mihi parcere, qui mentiens nec tuae animae pepercisti.</note> saith he, doth seem to have
this, or that laudable quality; the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath a fair appearance, but then if
he can, he blurteth out some spiteful
Objection; if he can find nothing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
to say against it, yet he will
seem to know, and to suppress some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what;
but (saith he) I know what I
know, I know more than I'le say—
so (adding perhaps a crafty Nod or
Shrug,<note place="margin">Hier. in Ruff. 3, 6.</note> a malicious Sneer or Smile)
he thinks to blast the fairest perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He is ready to suggest ill Causes
and Principles (latent in the Heart) of
Practices apparently good; ascribing
what is well done to bad Disposition, or
bad Purpose: So to say of a liberal man,
that he is so from an ambitious Temper,
or out of a vain-glorious design; of a
religious man, that his constant Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of Devotion proceed not from a
conscientious Love and Fear of God,
or out of intention to please God and
work out his Salvation, but from Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy,
from affectation to gain the
favour and good opinion of men, from
design to promote worldly Interests;
this is the way of Detraction: He doth


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53987:132"/>
well (saith the Detractor) it cannot be
denied; but for what reason doth he
so? is it not plainly his Interest to do
so? doth he not mean to get Applause,
or Preferment thereby? <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>serve
God for naught?</hi> so said the Father of
detracting Spirits.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He derogateth from good Actions
by pretending to correct them, or to
shew better that might have been done
in their room: it is, saith he, done in
some respect well or tolerably; but it
might have been done better, with as
small trouble, and cost; he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
in chusing this way, or proceeding
in this manner: Thus did <hi>Judas</hi> blame
the good woman, who anointed our
Lord's Feet;<note place="margin">Joh. 12. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Why</hi> (said he) <hi>was not
this Ointment sold, and given to the Poor?</hi>
so did his covetous baseness prompt him
to detract from that performance, of
which our Saviour's goodness did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
that it was a <hi>good work,</hi> which
should perpetually <hi>through the whole
World</hi> pass for <hi>memorable.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. A Detractor not regarding the
general Course, and constant Tenour
of a mans Conversation, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiciously
and clearly good, will attaque
some part of it, the goodness whereof


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53987:132"/>
is less discernable, or more subject to
contest, and blame; as if in a Body ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably

that curious Harmony, that delicate
Complexion, those fine Lineaments,
and goodly Features which running
through the whole, do conspire to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it a lovely Spectacle, should pitch
on an Eye, or a Nose to carp at; or as
if in a Town, otherwhere begirt with
impregnable Defences, one should
search for the weakest place, to form a
Battery against it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In Fine, The Detractor injecteth
suggestions of every thing any-wise
plausible or possible, that can serve to
diminish the worth of a Person, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of an Action, which he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance;
he pryeth into every
Nook, he bolteth every circumstance,
he improveth every pretence, he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any Report or Rumour, he useth
all the tricks imaginable to that end.
Such is the nature and way of detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
in enlarging upon which I am the
more sparing, because the Arts and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Detraction being in great part
common with those of Slander and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
I have otherwhile in treating upon
those offences more fully declared them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53987:133"/>
Now for disswading from its Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
I shall propound to your Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
the causes whence it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
the irregularities and pravities
which it involveth, the effects which it
produceth; the which will appear so
base, and ugly, that whoever shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them, cannot I suppose but loath
the Daughter of such Parents, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of such Qualities, and the Mother
of such Children.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The causes of Detraction are</p>
            <p n="1">1. Ill Nature, and bad Humour: as
good Nature, and ingenuous Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
incline men to observe, like, and
commend what appeareth best in our
Neighbour; so malignity of Temper
and Heart prompteth to espy, and
catch at the worst: one, as a Bee, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Honey out of any Herb; the other,
as a Spider, sucketh Poison out of the
sweetest Flower.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pride,<note place="margin">Expedit vobis neminem vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri bonum, quasi aliena virtus exprobratio ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strorum deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum sit. <hi>Sen.</hi> de Vit. B 19.</note> Ambition, and inordinate
Self-Love: the Detractor would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
Praise, and derive all Glory to
himself; he would be the chief, the
only excellent Person; therefore he
would justle anothers Worth out of
the way, that it may not endanger


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53987:133"/>
standing in competition with his, or
lessening it by a partnership; that it
may not out-shine his Reputation, or
dim it by the lustre thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Envy: A Detractor liketh not to
see another thrive, and flourish in the
good esteem of men, therefore he
would gladly blast his Worth, and
Vertue; his <hi>Eye</hi> is <hi>evil</hi> and sore, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would he quench, or cloud the
light, that dazleth it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Malicious Revenge and Spite: his
Neighbours good Practice condemneth
his bad Life; his Neighbours worth
disparageth his unworthiness; this he
conceiveth highly prejudicial to him;
hence in revenge he will labour to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify
the Worth and good Works of his
Neighbour.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sense of Weakness,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Socr. Hist. Eccl. 6. 13.</note> want of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
or despondency of his own Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
He that in any kind deemeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
able, or confideth in his own
Strength, and Industry, will allow to
others the commendation beseeming
their Ability; for he thinketh himself
in capacity to deserve the same, and as
he would not lose the Fruits of his
own Deserts, so he taketh it for equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that another should enjoy them;


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53987:134"/>
to deprive another of them, he seeth
were in consequence to prejudice his
own capacity and hope: but he that
feeleth himself destitute of worth, and
despaireth to arrive to the credit of
others, is thence tempted to disparage
and defame such Persons: this course
he taketh as the best allay of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibleness,
the only solace for his
defects that he can hope for; being he
cannot arise to anothers pitch, he would
bring down that other to his; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
directly get any praise, therefore
he would indirectly find excuse, by
shrouding his unworthiness under the
blame of others: Hence Detraction is
a sign of the weakest and basest Spirit;
'tis an impotent and groveling Serpent,
that lurketh in the Hedg, waiting op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to bite the heel of any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
Creature that passeth by.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Evil Conscience: A man that is
conscious to himself of a solid worth
and vertue,<note place="margin">Remedium poenae suae ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrantur si ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo sit sanctus, si omnibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahatur, si turba sit pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untium, si mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium. <hi>Hier.</hi> ad <hi>Asellam.</hi> Ep. 99</note> of having honest intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of having performed good Deeds,
is satisfied with the Fruits of inward
Comfort, and outward Approbation,
which they do yield; he therefore will
scorn to seek the bettering himself by
the discredit of others; he will not by


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53987:134"/>
so mean a practice, adulterate that
worth, in which he feeleth sufficient
complacence; he rather doth like, that
others should enjoy their due commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
as justifying his own claim
thereto; he willingly payeth it, because
he may justly demand it; and because
with-holding it from another, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
his own right thereto: But he
that is sensible of no good qualities in
himself, that is conscious of no worthy
actions that he hath done, to breed a
satisfaction of mind, or build a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
upon, would please himself in
making others as little better than
himself as he can, would ground a
kind of credit upon the ruins and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
of another's fame. When he
knoweth he cannot shine by his own
light, he would seem less obscure by
eclipsing the brightness of others, and
shutting out the day from about him;
conceiving that all things look alike in
the dark, and that bad appeareth not
bad where no good is near.</p>
            <p>As also a good man liketh Worth and
Vertue, because they resemble what he
discerneth in himself; so evil men hate
them, because they do not find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
masters of them; they are like


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53987:135"/>
the Fox, who said, The Grapes were
sowr, because he could not reach them;
and that the Hare was dry meat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he could not catch her. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor
therefore is always a bad man,
and wanteth those good qualities which
he would disparage.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Bad selfish Design: Detraction is
a common Engine, whereby naughty
men strive to compass their ends; when
by fair means, by their own Wit, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
Courage, worthy Behaviour,
they cannot promote their Interests,
they cannot drive on their ambitious
or covetous Projects, they cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that preferment or that gain which
they affect, then they betake themselves
to this crooked and foul way of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting,
by detracting those whom
they conceit to stand in the way of
their Designs. It was the first piece of
wicked policy that ever was practised
in the World, the Devil by detracting
from the goodness and veracity of God
(misrepresenting his Intentions, and
misconstruing his Commands) strove
to atchieve his mischievous design of
seducing our Fore-fathers; and in his
foot-steps his serpentine Progeny (the
race of malicious, envious, ambitious,


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53987:135"/>
covetous, and crafty Politicians) do tread.
It is observed to be a Fault that usually
haunteth Courts, wherein there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
for the favour of a Prince, and
the consequences thereof, (for Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Power, Wealth, Repute): to get
which to themselves, they strive to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess,
or prevent others by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of Detraction. It is also rife
among Scholars, that is, among Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors
for Wit, Learning, Industry,
and the rewards of them, Reputation
or Preferment. From such Principles
and Causes usually doth this Practice
spring.</p>
            <p>It doth involve these kinds of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
and pravity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Injustice. A Detractor careth not
how he dealeth with his Neighbour,
what wrong he doth him. Justice ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
to render every man his due;
<hi>honour to whom honour is due,</hi> and praise
to him that deserveth praise. There
can be no greater injury done a man,
then to spoil his best good, his Vertue;
then to rob him of the best reward of
his pains and cares, which is a fair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
(I speak of Rewards which
lie in the reach of men). No man


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53987:136"/>
prizes any thing comparably to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
and Honour; who therefore by
any means blurreth them, is most inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
<hi>Wo unto them—who take the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the Righteous from him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 15.</note> Isa.
5. 23.</p>
            <p>Injurious indeed he is not only to
the vertuous Person, but to Vertue it
self; for commendation is a debt we
owe to it where-ever it is found;
which conduceth to its encouragement
and advancement; and to wrong
Goodness it self, is the most heinous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Uncharitableness: It is evident
that the Detractor doth not love his
Neighbour; for Charity maketh the
best of every thing:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Charity believeth
every thing, hopeth every thing</hi> to the
advantage of its Object; Charity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
to see the Beloved to prosper
and flourish; and will therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
its endeavour to the procuring
it to do so: the Detractor therefore
(who would defile the best, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
the worst in his Neighbour) can
have no Charity; he indeed manifesteth
the greatest hatred, seeing he striveth to
do the greatest mischief, to cause the
greatest vexation to his Neighbour, in


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53987:136"/>
bereaving him of his most precious and
dear enjoyments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Impiety: He that loveth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenceth
God, will acknowledg and
approve his Goodness, in bestowing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Gifts and Graces to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
when such appear, he will be
afraid to disavow, or disgrace them,
that he may not rob God himself of
the glory thence due to his favour and
mercy, or through his Neighbours side
wound the Divine Benignity: he will
be ready to bless and praise God for all
such emanations of his Goodness; as
those did in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> who beholding
our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s miraculous Works of
Grace, did <hi>glorifie God, who had given
such works unto men:</hi> but the Detractor
careth not for that; he feareth not to
bereave God of the honour of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
good Gifts, that his Brother may
not have the honour of receiving
them; he will rather deny God to be
good, then allow a man to be so by his
Grace and Blessing; so is he no less a
Detractor from God, then from his
Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Hence of all Offences, Detraction
certainly must be most odious to God:
He is the God of Truth, and therefore


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53987:137"/>
detesteth Lying, of which Detraction
ever (especially in moral esteem) hath a
spice: He is the God of Justice, and
therefore especially doth abhor wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the best Persons and Actions; he is
the God of Love, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but loath this capital violation of
Charity; he is jealous of his Glory,
and cannot therefore endure it to be
abused by slurring his good Gifts and
Graces; he cannot but hate that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
which approacheth to that most
heinous and unpardonable sin, that
consisteth in defaming the excellent
Works performed by Divine Power
and Goodness,<note place="margin">Matt. 12.</note> ascribing them to bad
Causes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Detraction involveth degenerous
baseness, meanness of spirit, and want
of good manners. All men affect to
seem generous, and will say, They
scorn to be base; but Generosity is in
nothing more seen, then in a candid
estimation of other mens Vertues and
good Qualities; to this generosity of
Nature, generosity of Education, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
of Principles and Judgment do
all conspiringly dispose: 'Tis the noblest
kind of courtesie, to tender and farther
the Reputation of others; to be liberal


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53987:137"/>
in bestowing commendation on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Persons; it obligeth men more
then any other benefit can do, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
them commonly real advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
always chearing and satisfying
their mind; for in nothing more do
they please themselves, then in reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Fruit of their good Intention,
and honest Industry, the approbation
of worthy men; it is therefore a
most gentile thing thus to oblige
men. But on the other side, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more plainly argueth a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
and ignoble heart, ill-breeding
and ill-formed Manners, a sorry Mind
and poor Judgment, then to disesteem
or disparage Worth and Vertue in
others: 'Tis the most savage rudeness,
the most sordid illiberality, the most
ugly clownishness that can be; of all
men therefore it most doth misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
those who pretend to be Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In consequence to these things,
Detraction includeth Folly; for every
injust, every uncharitable, every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
every base Person is (as such)
a Fool; none of those qualities are
consistent with Wisdom; but the folly
of it will particularly appear (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53987:138"/>
with its pravity) by the bad and
hurtful effects, which it produceth,
both in regard to others, and to him
that practiseth it; some of which are
these:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 1. The practice thereof is a great
discouragement, and obstruction to
the common practice of Goodness: for
many seeing the best Men thus dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
and the best Actions vilified,
are disheartned and deterr'd from pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
Vertue, especially in a conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
and eminent degree: Why, will
many a man say, Shall I be strictly
good, seeing Goodness is so liable to
be misused, seeing thereby I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the detracting Tongue, seeing
my Reward shall be to have a severe
inquisition pass upon me, to have my
Life defaced, and my Name bespat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered?
Had not I better be contented
with a mediocrity, and obscurity of
goodness, then by a glaring lustre
thereof to draw the envious eye, and
kindle raging Obloquy upon me?
Thus men of a weaker spirit, or a
bashful temper (who are not stiff and
resolute in their way, who have not
the heart or the face to bear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53987:138"/>
rude assaults of their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
will be scared and daunted by
Detraction; so as consequently to be
induced,
<q>—placare invidiam virtute relictâ.<note place="margin">Hor.</note>
               </q>
And when thus the credit of Vertue is
blasted in its Practisers, many will be
diverted from it; so will it grow out
of request, and the World will be
corrupted by these Agents of the <hi>Evil
One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were indeed, upon this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
advisable and just, not to seem
ever to detract; even not then when
we are well assured that by speaking
ill, we shall not really do it; if we
should discover any Man to seem wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
or to be so reputed, whom yet
we discern (by standing in a nearer
light) not to be truly such, having
had opportunity to know his bad qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
bad purposes, or bad deeds;
yet Wisdom would commonly dictate,
and Goodness dispose not to marr his
repute: If we should observe (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger of mistake) any plausible
Action to be performed out of bad
Inclinations, Principles, or Designs;


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53987:139"/>
yet ordinarily in discretion and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
we should let it pass with such
commendation as its appearance may
procure, rather then to slur it, by ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our disadvantagious apprehensions
about it: for it is no great harm that
any man should enjoy undeserved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
or that a counterfeit worth
should find a dissembled respect; it is
but being over-just, which if it be
ever a fault, can hardly be so in this
case, wherein we do not expend any
cost, or suffer any dammage; but it
may do mischief to blemish an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Vertue; it may be a wrong
thereto to deface its very Image; the
very disclosing Hypocrisy doth inflict
a wound on Goodness, and exposeth
it to scandal; for bad men thence will
be prone to infer, that all Vertue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from the like bad Principles:
so the disgrace cast on that which is
spurious, will redound to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of that which is most genuine:
And if it be good to forbear detracting
from that worth which is certainly
false, much more is it so in regard to
that which is possibly true; and far
more still is it so in respect to that
which is clear and sure.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53987:139"/>
2. Hence Detraction is very noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and baneful to all Society; for all
Society is maintained in welfare by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of honesty and industry;
the which, when disparagement is cast
upon them, will be in danger to languish
and decay; whence a Detractor is the
worst Member that can be of a Society;
he is a very Moth, a very Canker there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Detraction worketh real dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and mischief to our Neighbour;
it bereaveth him of that goodly Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which is the proper reward of
Vertue, and a main support to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it; it often really obstructeth
and disappointeth his Undertakings,
estranging those from him, or setting
them against him, who do credulously
entertain it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Detractor abuseth those, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose ears he instilleth his poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
suggestions, engaging them to
partake in the injuries done to Worth
and Vertue; causing them to entertain
injust and uncharitable conceits, to
practise unseemly and unworthy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
toward good men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Detractor produceth great
inconveniences and mischiefs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53987:140"/>
He raiseth against himself fierce ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity,
and wrath: for Men, that are
conscious to themselves of their own
honest meaning, and blameless pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
cannot endure to be abused
by unjust disparagement; hence are
they stirred to boil with passion, and to
discharge revenge upon the Detractor.</p>
            <p>He exposeth himself to general ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
all good men loath him as a base
and mischievous Person, and a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Enemy of theirs, always ready to
wrong them; every man is apt to say,
He that doth thus abuse another, will
be ready to serve me in like manner, if
I chance to come in his way, vilifying
the best thing I can do; even the worst
men will dislike him; for even such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to do somewhat laudable or plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and would be glad to enjoy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
for it; and cannot therefore
brook those who lie in wait to rob
them of the Fruit of their good endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
so do all men worthily detest
and shun the Detractor, as a common
Enemy to Goodness first, and then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Men. Farther;</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Detractor yieldeth occasion
to others, and a kind of right to return
the same measure upon him. If he


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53987:140"/>
hath in him a shew of any thing lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
men will not allow him any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
from it: for why, conceive
they, shall he receive that which he
will not suffer others to enjoy? How
can any Man admit him to have any
real worth or vertue in himself, who
doth not like it, or treat it well in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Hence, if a Detractor hath any
good in him, he much injureth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
depriving himself of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
belonging thereto.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Again, the Detractor (esteeming
things according to moral possibility)
will assuredly be defeated in his aims;
his detraction in the close will avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but to bring trouble and shame
upon himself; for God hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
care over Innocence and Goodness,
so as not to let them finally to suffer;
the <hi>good mans Righteousness he will bring
forth as the light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and his Judgment as
the noon day:</hi> Wise men easily will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the foul play, and will scorn it;
Good men ever will be ready to clear
and vindicate the Truth; Worth how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
clouded for a time, will break
through all Mists, and gloriously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand
it self, to the confusion of its most
sly opposers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53987:141"/>
Such are the natural and obvious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of this practice; the consideration
whereof (together with the causes
producing it, and the essential adjuncts
which it doth involve) will, I should
think, suffice to deter us from it.</p>
            <p>I shall only adjoin one Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which our Text suggesteth: <hi>Speak
not evil of one another, Brethren,</hi> saith
the Apostle: <hi>Brethren;</hi> That Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth imply a strong Argument en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
the Precept: Brethren, with
especial tenderness of affection, should
love one another, and delight in each
others good; they should tender the
interest and honour of each other as
their own; they should therefore by
all means cherish and countenance Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in one another, as that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteth
the common Welfare, which
adorneth and illustrateth the dignity of
their Family. We should rejoice in
the good qualities and worthy deeds of
any Christian, as glorifying our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

for one Christian any-wise to

hearty esteem, to pay due respect, glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>THese Words (being part of our
Saviours most Divine Sermon
upon the Mount) contain a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
short Precept, but of vast use, and
consequence; the observance whereof
would much conduce to the good of
the World, and to the private quiet of
each man; it interdicting a Practice,
which commonly produceth very mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
and troublesome Effects; a
Practice never rare among men, but
now very rife; when with the general
causes, which ever did and ever will in
some measure dispose men thereto, some
special ones do concur, that powerfully
incline to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53987:143"/>
There are innate to men an injust
Pride, emboldning them to take upon
them beyond what belongeth to them,
or doth become them; an excessive
Self-love, prompting them as to flatter
themselves in their own conceit, so to
undervalue others, and from vilifying
their Neighbours, to seek commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to themselves; an envious maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which ever lusteth to be pampered
with finding or making faults; many
corrupt Affections, springing from flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Nature, which draw or drive men
to this Practice; so that in all Ages it
hath been very common, and never any
profession hath been so much invaded,
as that of the Judg.</p>
            <p>But divers peculiar Causes have such
an influence upon our Age, as more
strongly to sway men thereto: there is
a wonderful affectation to seem hugely
wise and witty; and how can we seem
such more, then in putting on the garb
and countenance of Judges; scanning,
and passing Sentence upon all Persons,
and all things incident? there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
niceness and delicacy of conceit,
which maketh us apt to relish few things,
and to distast any thing; there are
dissensions in opinion, and addicted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53987:143"/>
to parties, which do tempt us, and
seem to authorize us in condemning all
that differ from us; there is a deep cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of mind and manners, which
engageth men in their own defence to
censure others, diverting the blame
from home,<note place="margin">Expedit vobis neminem vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri bonum; quasi aliena virtus exprobratio ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strorum deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum sit. <hi>Sen.</hi> de Vit. <hi>B.</hi> 19.</note> and shrowding their own
under the covert of other mens faults;
there are new principles of Morality,
and Policy, become current with great
vogue, which allow to do or say any
thing subservient to our Interests, or
Designs; which also do represent all
men so bad, that (admitting them true)
nothing hardly can be said ill of any
man beyond Truth and Justice.</p>
            <p>Hence is the World become so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
critical and censorious,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Chrys. ad den. T. 6. Orat. 42.</note> that in
many places the chief employment of
men, and the main body of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, if we mark it, taken up in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Every gossiping is, as it were, a
Court of Justice; every seat becometh
a Tribunal; at every Table standeth a
Bar, whereto all men are cited, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
every man (as it happeneth) is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigned,
and sentenced: No sublimity
or sacredness of Dignity, no integrity
or innocence of Life, no prudence or
circumspection of Demeanour can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53987:144"/>
any Person from it; Not one es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeth
being taxed under some scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Name, or odious Character, one
or other. Not only the outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and visible Practices of men are
judged; but their retired sentiments
are brought under trial, their inward
dispositions have a verdict past on them,
their final states are determined. Whole
Bodies of men are thus judged at once,
and nothing it is in one breath to damn
whole Churches, at one push to throw
down whole Nations into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Pit. All mankind in a lump is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
censured, as void of any real
goodness, or true vertue; so fatally
depraved as not to be corrigible by any
good discipline, not to be recoverable
even by the grace of God: yea God
himself is hardly spared, his Providence
coming under the bold obloquy of
those, who (as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaketh
of some in his time, whose race doth yet
survive) <hi>speak loftily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>and set their Mouth
against the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being too apparently the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of things, and obvious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of men, it were desirable, that in
order to their being reclaimed, men
commonly did well understand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53987:144"/>
of this practice with the heinous
guilt, and consequently the deadly
hazard they do incur thereby: at this
purpose my discourse shall aim, wherein
I shall endeavour both to describe the
nature of the practice forbidden in my
Text, and to declare the pravity, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and folly of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge not.</hi> As to the word we may
observe, that it being in it self accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its primitive sence of a middle
and indifferent signification, is yet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in the Scripture used in the
worst sence; so as to import those acts,
or those effects of judgment, which
pass to the disadvantage of the Persons
subjected thereto; for condemnation,
and for infliction of punishment: And
this sence here surely the word doth
principally respect, yet not so precisely
as to exclude somewhat contained in
the larger sence: We are so prohibited
the condemning, and punishing our
Neighbour in his good name, that
withal some acts antecedent, or conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant
to those, are glanced at in the
prohibition: undue application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
unjust proceeding therein are also
signified unlawful; for the meaning
of the word, and the reason of the


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53987:145"/>
case may be so far extended.</p>
            <p>But for the fuller and clearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the matter, we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that there are divers sorts of
Judging, or acts resembling Judgment,
which do not belong to this precept;
which it is requisite to distinguish from
this Judging prohibited.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That exercising publick Judgment,
or administring Justice is not here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
I need not to insist, that is
necessary; Humane Society could not
subsist, Right could not be maintained,
nor Peace preserved without it; God
thereby governeth the World, earthly
Judges being his Instruments and Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;
such Judgment is not so much
the act of men, as of God himself, by
whose Authority, in whose Name, for
whose Service it is ministred. As <hi>Moses</hi>
told the Judges in his time,<note place="margin">Deut. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>You shall not
be afraid of the Face of Man, for the
Judgment is God's.</hi> And in numberless
places of Scripture this Judgment is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and authorized; it therefore is
not touched here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Trial and Censure (although
out of Court, and without formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess)
which any kind of Superiors do
exercise upon their Inferiors, committed


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53987:145"/>
to their inspection and care; such as of
Parents over Children, Masters over
Servants, Pastors over their Flock, any
Governours over their Charge, their
Admonitions, Reprehensions, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
are to be excepted hence, as
being in themselves needful, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted,
yea enjoyned by God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither are fraternal correption
or friendly reproof (proceeding out of
charitable design, upon clear ground,
in fit season, within reasonable compass)
concerned in this prohibition; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a wholesome practice, and a duty
incumbent on us:<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt</hi> (saith the
Law) <hi>not hate thy Brother in thine
heart;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy
Neighbour, and not suffer Sin upon
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. All observing, and reflecting upon
our Neighbours Actions, all framing
an opinion about them, and expressing
our Minds concerning them are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
For we are not bound perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to shut our Eyes, or go about
hood-winked; nor to stop our Ears
and make our selves deaf: And how
can we forbear to think according to
plain evidence? how can we resist the
impressions of sense upon our Minds?


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53987:146"/>
how can we contest notorious experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
How also barring such appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of obvious and apparent
things, could we bear testimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them? how could we signifie
our approbation or dislike of them?
how could we for his amendment admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
or reprove our Neighbour, as in
some cases we are obliged to do?</p>
            <p n="5">5. We are not hence obliged to think
so well of all men, as without compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
knowledg always to rely upon their
pretences, or to intrust our interests in
their hands; for common experience
acquainteth us that we may be deceived
in trusting men, Prudence biddeth us
in matters of importance not to confide
in uncertainties; wherefore we shall
not be culpable for being wary in such
cases: this indeed is not a positive
Judgment, but only a waving to declare
in favour, when sufficient ground of
doing so doth not appear; it is only a
reasonable suspecting the possibility of
miscarriage in some Persons, not a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
asserting ill concerning any one
man; wherefore to do it as it suiteth
discretion, so it doth not thwart Justice
or Charity; and cannot therefore be
prohibited here.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53987:146"/>
6. We are also not hence obliged,
in contradiction to plain sense, to judg
well of men; accounting him for a
Saint, or a good man, whom we see
living disorderly, or committing scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
offences; plainly repugnant to
the rules of Piety, Justice, or Sobriety.</p>
            <p>In fine, There are some special
cases, and circumstances, wherein good
men excusably may in severe terms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their resentment of manifest wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
especially such as is prejudicial
to God's Honour, and publick good.
Of this there are divers instances, which
yet hardly can be reduced to common
rules, or proposed for general example;
the matter being ticklish, and men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apt to pervert any liberty or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of this kind, by indulging to their
own bad humours and passions.</p>
            <p>These sorts of allowable Judgments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excepted, it is then private, affected,
needless, groundless, rash and harsh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
the persons or actions of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
such as doth resemble not the
acting of a lawful Superior, of a needful
Witness, of a faithful Friend, but of a
Judg, acting without competent right,
upon no good grounds, or in undue
manner, which is here interdicted: the


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53987:147"/>
word <hi>Judging</hi> doth well imply the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this Fault, the manner of our
proceeding therein, the grounds of its
unlawfulness; neither perhaps can we
better understand our duty in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then by expending what are the
Properties and Obligations of a Judg,
and comparing our practice thereto;
for thence it may plainly appear how
unqualified we are to bear this Office,
and how unduly we execute it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No Judg should intrude himself
into the Office, or assume a Judicial
Power without competent Authority;
that is, by delegation from Superior
Powers, or by voluntary reference of
the Parties concerned. This Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we fail in, when-ever without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from God, or special reason ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
it from us, we do pry into, scan,
and tax the Actions of our Neighbour.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 15.</note>
When,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 11.</note> I say, we are pragmatically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
into the Purposes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of our Superiors,<note place="margin">Prov. 27. 16.</note> of our
Equals,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 13.</note> of those who are not subject
to our Charge and Care, when we nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
examine them: When we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
blame them, then do we
unduly exalt our selves above them, and
exercise an unwarrantable jurisdiction


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53987:147"/>
over them. What Sense doth offer,
we may receive in; what Judgment
Reason doth extort, we may follow;
what Testimony publick Benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
we may yield; what Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
Charity doth call for toward our
Neighbour's edification, we may sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
vent: but if we proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this way, the Party concerned
may appeal from us as incompetent
and unlawful Judges of his actions,<note place="margin">Quid in pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem alienam irruis? quid temerarius Dei Tribunal as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendis? <hi>Opt.</hi> lib. 2.</note> or
his state; we are arrogant and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in presuming to exercise that Office.
God is the Master and Judg of Men,
and without Authority from him, we
must not presume to judg his Servants
and Subjects: So we are taught by
S. <hi>Paul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Who</hi> (saith he) <hi>art thou that
judgest another man's Servant? to his
own Master he standeth or falleth:</hi> and
S. <hi>James</hi> in like manner upon the same
ground expostulateth with the Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer;<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 11.</note>
               <hi>There is</hi> (saith he) <hi>one Law-giver,
who is able to save, or to destroy; Who art
thou that judgest another?</hi> Our Lord
himself for this reason declined inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling
in the affairs of Men;<note place="margin">Luke 12. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Who</hi>
(said he) <hi>made me a Judg, or Divider
over you?</hi> And shall we constitute our
selves in the Office, shall we seat our


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53987:148"/>
selves on the Tribunal, without any
Commission from God, or Call from
Men? How many Judges, if this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso</hi>
were observed, would have their
<hi>quietus?</hi> how many Censures would
be voided hence?</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Judg should be free from all
Prejudices, and all partial Affections;
especially from those which are disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to the Party in danger to
suffer;<note place="margin">Levit. 19. 15.</note> such as tempt or incline to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him; from ill-opinion, and ill-will,
from anger, envy, revengefulness, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and the like: for he that is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with these, is no wise qualified to
be a Judg; his eyes are blinded, or
distorted, or infected with bad tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
so that he cannot discern what
is right, or that he seeth things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in the wrong place, and under
false colours: His Mind is discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and disturbed, so that he cannot
calmly and steadily apprehend or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the just state of the Case; his
Will is biassed, and strongly propend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
one way, so that he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
uprightly in a streight and even
course: Being not indifferently affected,
but concerned on one side,<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 1.</note> he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Party,<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 16.</note> or an Adversary,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 21.</note> and


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53987:148"/>
thence unfit to be a Judg; He hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
the Cause with himself before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
so that no place is left to further
discussion or defence; wherefore before
such a Judg the best Cause will fall, the
clearest Innocence shall not preserve
from condemnation. He therefore that
will undertake this Office, must first
devest himself of all Prejudices, must
rid himself of all Passions, must purify
himself from all corrupt Inclinations,
taking care not to come with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
Mind, or a lust to punish the
obnoxious Party; otherwise a just Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
lieth against him, and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
his Jurisdiction may be decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>If this Rule were put in practice,
there would be little censuring; for
few come to it with a free and pure
Mind; few blame their Neighbours
without some preoccupation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or some disaffection toward
them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Judg should never proceed in
Judgment, without careful examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Cause, so as well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it.<note place="margin">Deut. 1. 16.</note> Even those, who out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible
Duty, or by a just Power
may call others to accompt, are yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53987:149"/>
to be wary, and never to pass
Sentence without due congnizance of
the Cause; otherwise they will judg
blindly and rashly; they will either
decide wrongly, or so truly, that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it must be imputed not to their
Vertue, but to their Fortune; often
they will be mistaken, and 'tis luck
that they are not so always; and what
plainer Iniquity can there be, then that
the Reputation or real Interest of any
Man should be put to the arbitrement
of Chance; that he should be defamed,
or damnified, not for a certain Fault,
but from an unhappy Lot? As things
viewed at a distance appear much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in bigness, shape, and colour
from what they are in nature and reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
so if we do not look nearly and
narrowly, we shall greatly misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the nature, the degrees, the right
characters of things, and of persons;
then be our pretence to judg never so
fair, yet our proceeding is unjust; then
if we do unduly invade the place, it
will be a great aggravation of our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour:
If of our own head and
pleasure, we will constitute our selves
Judges, yet at least we should act the
Judges part, in patiently attending to,


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53987:149"/>
and heedfully sifting the Cause: If we
have not a stomack to hear, if we will
not afford the care to mind what may
be alledged in favour of the Party
concerned; if we cannot, or will not
scan every Point and Circumstance,
which may serve to acquit him, or to
excuse and extenuate his Guilt, why
do we undertake to be his Judges?
Why do we engage our selves into the
Commission of so palpable injustice?
yea,<note place="margin">Prov. 18. 13.</note> of so disgraceful folly: for, <hi>He
that answereth a Matter before he heareth
it, it is</hi> (saith the <hi>wise Man) a folly,
and shame unto him.</hi> This Caution ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
rash Judgment, from which if
Men would abstain, there would be
little censuring: for nothing is more
ordinary, then for men to do like those
of whom S. <hi>Jude</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>they rail at what they know

Not any slight Conjecture, or thin

fact, and in point of right, it be firmly
proved true; it sufficeth not to presume
it may be so; to say, It seemeth thus,
doth not sound like the Voice of a

wanting some colour of Accusation,
every Action being liable to some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion,


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53987:150"/>
or sinister construction, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
could be secure, no Person
could escape condemnation; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and Interest of all men living
would continually stand exposed to
inevitable danger. It is a Rule of
Equity and Humanity, built upon plain
Reason, that rather a Nocent Person
should be permitted to escape, then an
Innocent should be constrained to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer:
for the impunity of the one is but
an inconvenience, the suffering of the
other is a wrong; the punishment of
the Guilty, yieldeth only a remote pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
benefit; the affliction of the
Blameless, involveth a near certain mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief:
wherefore it is more prudent
and more righteous to absolve a Man,
of whose guilt there are probable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
then to condemn any Man
upon bare suspicions. And remarkable
it is how God in the Law did prescribe
the manner of Trial and Judgment,
even in the highest Case, and most
nearly touching himself, that of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
If</hi> (saith the Law, <hi>Deut. 17. 4.)
it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it,
and enquired diligently, and behold it be
true, and the thing certain, that such an
abomination is wrought in</hi> Israel; <hi>then


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53987:151"/>
shalt thou bring forth that man, or that
woman, and shalt stone them:</hi> See what
great Caution is prescribed, what preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Evidence is required in such Cases;
it is not enough that it be reported, or
come to our ear; diligent inquiry must be
made, it must be found true, it must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
certain, before we may proceed to
condemn, or execute; it is indeed not
fair judgment, but meer calumny to
condemn a man, before he doth by
sufficient proof appear guilty.</p>
            <p>If this Rule were regarded, how
many Censures would be prevented?
For do not men catch at any shadow of
a Fault? are they not ready upon the
least presumption to condemn their
Neighbour? Doth not any, even the
weakest &amp; vainest testimony, any wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
hear-say, or vulgar rumour serve
to ground the most heavy Sentences?</p>
            <p n="5">5. From hence is plainly consequent,
that there are divers Causes wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from our Judgment, and which
in no case we must pretend to meddle
with; such as are the secret thoughts,
affections, and purposes of men, not
expressed by plain words, nor declared
by overt acts; for a capacity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
doth ever suppose a power of cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance;


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53987:151"/>
and it being impossible for
us to reach the knowledg of those
things, we cannot therefore pretend to
judg of them. As it is the property of
God to search the Hearts, and try the
Reins, so it is his Prerogative to judg
concerning the secret motions in them;
the which we attempting to do, no less
vainly and foolishly, then presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and profanely do encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>This Point also being regarded,
would prevent innumerable rash Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for men commonly do no less
dive into the thoughts, and reprehend,
the inward dispositions and designs of
their Neighbour, then they do his most
apparent and avowed Actions; 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as ordinary to blame men for the
invisible workings of their Mind, as
for their most visible deportment in

            <p n="6">6. Hence also it is not commonly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable

As a specious out-side doth often cover
inward hollowness and foulness, so

under an unpromising appearance
much solidity and sincerity of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
may lodg; a dirty ground doth
often contain good Seeds within it;
our judgment therefore in such Cases
is likely (at least in degree) to be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious
and unjust; and therefore it is

            <p n="7">7. Farther; A Judg should not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to proceed against any man,
without warning and citing him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
or without affording him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
liberty and opportunity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and justifie himself. Judgment
should not be administred clancularly,
in dark Corners, but in open Court;


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53987:153"/>
not suspiciously, in a muttering or
whispering way; but frankly, with a
clear and audible voice; not upon
surprize, but with allowance of leisure
and advice, that the Party may be able
to apprehend his Case, and manage his
Plea, for his best defence: for it may
justly be presumed, that as he is most
concerned, so he is best acquainted
with his own Proceedings, and may
allege Reasons for them, which no man
can so well perceive as himself; it is
therefore fit that he should be heard,
before he is condemned, that he may
not suffer wrong; at least that he may
be convinced that he doth not, and
that our proceeding may be cleared
from misprision; that also the World
may be satisfied of Justice being done;
and that likewise false Accusers may be
liable to due shame and chastisement.
The manner of proceeding used by the

               <note place="margin">Acts 25. 16.</note> and reported by <hi>Festus</hi> in

               </note> The end of Justice,
we may consider, is not to condemn
nor to work mischief to any one, but
rather, so far as may be, to acquit and
prevent evil to all; at least it aimeth to
clear the Truth, and state the Case in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently;
wherefore 'tis just, that
all advantage that well can be, should
be afforded to the obnoxious Party for
his justification and deliverance; at
least that he be not denied equal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
with his Prosecutors; Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
would allow him some favour;
the most rigorous Justice cannot refuse
him leave to contest his Cause upon
equal terms: wherefore 'tis fit that he
should be acquainted with his Case,
that competent time and means should
be afforded him to prepare for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that his Plea should receive, if
not a favourable, yet a free audience:
the contrary practice is indeed rather
backbiting, whispering, supplanting,
or sycophantry, then fair and lawful
judging.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:53987:154"/>
The observation of this Rule would
also cut off many Censures; for seldom
it is that our Censurers do charge men
to their faces, but rather take all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
care, that what they say may never
come to the ears of those whom they
accuse; they fear nothing more then
being confronted, and detected; they
decline the shame and the requital due
to their sycophantick practice; which
is a manifest Argument of their foul
dealing; and they no less in reality do
thence condemn themselves, then they
would seem to condemn others.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Moreover, a Judg is obliged to
conform all his Determinations to the
setled Rules of Judgment, so as never
to condemn any man for acting that,
which is injoined, or approved, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by them; he must not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
according to his private fancy,
or particular affection, but according
to the standing Laws; which as they
are the only certain Rules of Moral
Action, the only Grounds of Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the only Standards of Guilt and
Innocence, so in reason they should be
the sole Measures of Judging; he that
proceedeth otherwise, is an arbitrary
and a slippery Judg; he encroacheth


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53987:154"/>
upon the Right and Liberty of those
with whom he medleth, pronouncing
them Guilty, whom God and Reason
do proclaim blameless. This is that
which S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth reprove in the 14<hi>th</hi>
to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> and other-where;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 8.</note> the
Case was this;<note place="margin">Col. 2. 16.</note> Some were of opinion,
that abstaining from some kinds of
Meat, and observing some Festival
Times, were matters of Duty required
by God; others thought it free to
eat any thing, and to use any times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
these, according to such their
private opinions, did censure the
practices of each other; one Party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the other as transgressing Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the other contemned them as weak
in Judgment; but the Apostle reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
both as irregular in their Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
in taxing one another for Matters
which on both hands were indifferent;
the Divine Law having clearly neither
enjoined those observances, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
them; so that each man had a
liberty to do, or to abstain, as he thought
good, or most agreeable to his Duty,
and conducible to his Salvation: So
is it culpable in us to blame any man
for doing that which is not repugnant
to God's express Command, or to the


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53987:155"/>
plain Dictates of Reason.</p>
            <p>The observing this Condition, would
smother many Censures: For do we
not commonly reprehend our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for practices wholly blameless,
perhaps commendable? Do we not
sometimes grievously reproach them
for not complying with our Desires, for
not serving our Interests, for not jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with our Humours, for not dancing
after our Pipe; for dissenting from us
in any Conceit, although dubious or
false; for discosting from our practice,
although bad or inconvenient? Say we

is weak, nice, superstitious, because

because he useth his liberty in

matters of obloquy, into how narrow
a compass would it be restrained?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Hence farther it is to be supposed,
that a Judg should be a Person of good

and skilful in the Laws concerning

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53987:155"/>
as to sift aud canvas Matters of Fact,
so to compare them accurately with
the Rules of Right; for nothing is
more absurd then an Ignorant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
Judg. Men therefore of weak
Capacity, of mean Education, of small
Experience, are qualified to judg in
few Cases, most things being placed
above their reach; such never should
presume to censure Actions, the worth
or moral quality whereof, depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the stating and resolution of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse,
intricate, or subtile Questions:
It is not therefore for Mechanicks or
Rusticks to judg about Difficulties of
Science, about Controversies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
about Mysteries of Policy, or
Reasons of State; or to censure those
who deal in them; in so doing, they
hugely trespass beyond their Calling
and Sphere; they do strangely mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become
the Bench, and will very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly
misbehave themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the decision of such Matters is to
be reserved to those, who by study and
experience have attained peculiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
to do it respectively.</p>
            <p>Observing this Point, would draw
many down from their usurped Seats
of Judicature, and stop numberless vain


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53987:156"/>
Sentences; we should have very few
Judges left, if all men would be so
modest and so wise, as not to meddle
beyond their skill and ability.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Again; It is proper for a Judg
not to make himself an Accuser; not
to seek for Misdemeanours;<note place="margin">Sine dubio in omnibus statim accusationibus hoc agendum est, nè ad eas libenter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendisse vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amur. <hi>Quintil.</hi> 11. 1.</note> not to
draw more Causes under his cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,
then are in course presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: He should rather judg as
out of constraint, then of choice;
rather as sorry to find a Necessity, then
glad to snatch an occasion of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Offenders. So should we rather
decline, then seek the Office of censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our Brethren, rather conniving
at, and concealing their Faults, then
being forward to expose them; abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Reason only should induce, or
indispensible Necessity force us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>This also greatly would diminish the
Trade of Censuring; for if we should
never censure without great Reason or
necessity, how seldom should we do
it? Do we not rather affect to do it
causlesly and needlesly? do we not
eagerly search after, and greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
all occasions to do it? Is it not
a pleasant entertainment to us, to be


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53987:156"/>
carping and cavelling at any Body we
meet, at any thing we see done? Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>

It is the case of us all, we are all noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously

of his Law; we do all stand in need of

we then pretend to be Judges, or be
passing Sentence on our Brethren? If
only those, who are free and guiltless,
should judg, who could undertake it?
there would surely be no more, then

            <p n="12">12. Lastly; It is the property of a
good Judg to proceed with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
equity, candor, and mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
as a general Friend, a Friend to
Justice, to the Publick, to Mankind,
to the Party impeached: As a Friend
to Justice, he should be careful that the
Defendant receive no wrong in his
Credit, or Interest; as a lover of the
Publick, he should wish that no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
or Scandals be found; out of
humanity he should desire, that no
man may incur the blemish of guilt,
or pain of suffering; he should ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Parties Case as compassionable,
and desire that he may be delivered
from the evil threatning him; this
should render him willing to acquit,
and free the Party, apt to apprehend
and interpret all things favourably,
ready to excuse and mollifie the business


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53987:157"/>
what he can; far from picking faults
out of obscure surmises, or slender
pretences, from aggravating the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
that are detected, from stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the blame farther then it will reach
of it self, or making the case worse
then it needs must be, from pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a harsh or heavy sentence thereon.
He should always be of Counsel to the
Defendant, pleading his Cause so far
as truth and equity will permit; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himself in his Case, and thence no
wise dealing with him more rigorously,
then he, according to impartial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
should in the like case deem it
equal that himself should be dealt
with: in fine, however the Matter in
the result appear to stand, he should
avoid rigour and extremity, he should
exercise clemency and mercy.</p>
            <p>If this course were observed, innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Causes, which now are severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judged, would never be mentioned,
or come under trial, but would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
be cast out; many would soon,
after small discussion, be voided; few
would pass that extremity of censure,
which now by the cruel asperity of
men, they are forced to undergo: For do
we not accuse men for things, that are


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53987:158"/>
no Faults; do we not exaggerate the
guilt of petty Faults? do we not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
over great miscarriages with too
unmerciful severity? as if they were
incorrigible and unpardonable.</p>
            <p>Seeing then few of us, according
to those reasonable qualifications and
conditions, are capable of being Judges;
seeing, if those equal Rules were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
most Censures would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded;
seeing hard it is for any man
either warrantably to undertake, or
uprightly to discharge this Office;
great reason there is for this Precept,
most fit it is that we should be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to judg.</p>
            <p>So much for the part explicative,
and directive; now for the persuasive,
and for inducing us to eschew this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
let us briefly declare the pravity
and vanity of it; the performing

1. Censuring is an impious practice
in regard to God.</p>
            <p>By taking upon our selves to judg
unduly, without Authority, or beyond
it, we do invade God's Office, setting
up our selves as Judges in his room;
we usurp his Right, exercising Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over his Subjects, without order
and license from him: 'tis S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note>

bold and arrogant, how sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
injurious and profane art thou,
to climb up into God's Tribunal, and
thence to pronounce doom upon his
Subjects?</p>
            <p>By rash judgment in matters not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to our cognizance, (as when we
pronounce concerning the secret
thoughts and intentions of men) we
proudly and perversly do arrogate to
our selves the incommunicable Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of God, who alone can know
such things, and determine rightly in
such cases; who therefore hath reserved
them to himself,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 5.</note> commanding us <hi>to
judg nothing before the time, until the
Lord come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By passing Sentence about the state
of our Neighbour, we do anticipate


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53987:159"/>
God's Judgment, and by prejudging
strive to frustrate it. We take upon
us to <hi>purge his Floor;</hi>

            <p>By censuring our Brethren causlesly,
for not complying with our conceits,
humours, or practices, we lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and appropriate to our selves God's
Legislative Power; we subject his Law
to our fancy and pleasure; we in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
condemn his Law of Error and
Imperfection; we do at least make our
selves sharers with him in the enacting
Laws, and dispensing Justice: <hi>He</hi>

his Brother,</hi>

speaketh against the Law, and judgeth
the Law;</hi> that is, he opprobriously
doth imply the Law to be defective,
until he doth compleat or correct it;
making it a guilt not to satisfy his Will

the Law; the dispensation of Justice
is not sufficient, unless he partake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
taxing whom and why he pleaseth;
God without him is not a perfect Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,

            <p>We are also very ingrateful in not

offend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or seem to do so?</p>
            <p>In fine; Censuring is impious, as
involving the violation of those great
Commandments, of exercising (in all


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53987:160"/>
our demeanour and dealing) Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Meekness, Pity, and Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
our Brethren; of pursuing and
promoting peace among them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Censuring, in respect to our
Neighbour, is an unjust practice. It
is unjust to meddle in Affairs, with
which we have nothing to do; to
draw those Persons under our Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
who are not subject to it, but
are liable to render their Accompt at
another Bar; to punish those in their
reputation or interest, over whom we
have no just Authority, <hi>who have their

fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis most unjust to judg any man
without competent means of knowing,
or skill to determine his Case; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him without diligent trial, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
certain proof, without full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of his Fault; to punish him
without just cause, or beyond due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>'Tis very unjust to usurp an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in the Goods, which are to our

practice, and so contrary to the
principal Duty of our Religion; it is
so eminently in all cases wherein it is
unjust, (for Charity doth virtually
contain Justice, and transcendeth it)
it is so peculiarly when-ever it is harsh
or rigorous, when it is affected; when
it is needless or unprofitable; for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
disposeth us to be gentle, meek,
patient, and merciful in all our deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
it engages us to hide and smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to diminish and excuse, to pass
by and pardon Offences;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 5, 7. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>A Censurer is indeed unjust and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable,
not only toward those

whom he censureth, but also toward
those into whom thereby he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
ill-opinion, and ill-will toward
their Neighbour; he is guilty of their
injustice and uncharitableness, a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
more irreparable then his own.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Censuring is a very foolish and

            <p>It signifieth, that we do not well
understand, or not well consider the
natural impotency and frailty of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
how liable others are to mistake,
and slip; and how prone we our selves
are thereto; how (as S. <hi>James</hi> saith)
<hi>in many things we offend all;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 2.</note> Did we
observe, or would weigh this; we
should not be so forward to censure,
or so vehement and bitter in it; we
should see failing and tripping in many
things to be a common case, rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
commiseration then censure.</p>
            <p>It implieth also, that we little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
how our escaping any Faults,
which our neighbour slippeth into, is
no wise imputable to any worth or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in us, so much as the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53987:161"/>
and merciful Grace of God,
guarding or rescuing us from them;
if we did apprehend and reflect on
this, it would appear our Duty rather
to bless God for our being protected
from miscarriages, then censoriously to
insult over those who seem to fall into
them. It signifieth we have no sight
or sense of our own defects; for did
we clearly see, did we humbly resent
them, that would damp our heat and
earnestness to censure. It declares a
fond self-conceit, that we deem our
selves superior to our Neighbour in
Wisdom, and less obnoxious to blame,
and therefore fit to be his Judges;
whereas according to a sober esteem of
our selves, we should appear more fit
to stand at the Bar, then to sit upon
the Bench; and should thence more
dread the one, then affect the other.</p>
            <p>It sheweth likewise, that we do not
rightly conceive the nature, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
esteem the consequences of this
practice: We know not, or regard not,
the value of our Neighbour's Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which by censure we do mean to
ruin, or impair: We perhaps by no
means would rob him of his Substance,
or of his Life; yet we scruple not by


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53987:162"/>
grievous censure to bereave him of his
good Name; which he, the best prizer
of his own Goods, may esteem beyond
his Estate, or his Life it self; we think
it nothing, or a slight matter to carp
at him, but he feeleth it very painful,
and deeply resenteth it.</p>
            <p>It argueth in us an untamed fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of mind, and discomposedness of
passion, which can never consist or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
with Wisdom; for a well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
calm, and free mind, will be slow
in conceiving offence or dislike, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

            <p>AS frequently between neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

Dissentions and Contests about
the just limits of their Territories; so
doth it frequently happen between
Vertue and Vice, Right and Wrong,
Duty and Miscarriage in Practice: for
although the extream Degrees; and
even the middle Regions of these
things are very distant, yet the Borders
of them do lie very close together, and
are in a manner contiguous; a certain
ridg of separation running between
them, which commonly (being very
narrow, thin, and obscure) it is not

out in the matter before us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

which seem to contradict; there are
Duties appearing to thwart one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

            <p>In fine; Our Religion doth seem,
by the bands of mutual Relation, and
obligations of Charity so to unite us
together, so to endear us to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to all men; that all things
belonging to our Brethren do nearly


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53987:168"/>
touch us, and should answerably affect
us; so that by intermedling with any
thing relating to their welfare, we can
hardly be said to meddle with what
doth not concern us.</p>
            <p>The condition of things also may
seem to require, that we so intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
for the Duties and Affairs of
Men are so entangled or interwoven,
that we can hardly prosecute any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of our own, without being
engaged in the Matters of others: In
discharging all Offices of Society, in
pursuance of any Traffick or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
in all entercourse and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
while we transact our own Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we cannot avoid the furthering,
or obstructing the Business of others,
who are engaged in the same, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Designs: Society doth subsist by
combinations of Care and Pain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
common Interests, so that it
seemeth impossible so to mind our own
Business, as not to meddle with the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of others.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding S. <hi>Paul</hi> injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

mind our own Business, or not to be
meddlesome in the concernments of

               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53987:168"/>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
which is emphatical, and signifieth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our own, or our proper Business;
and because it is joined with <hi>being
quiet,</hi> which respecteth others, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
not stirring beyond our own

also a practice expresly condemned by

so meddle as to invade any Man's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
or to assume the exercise of it.
A private Man should not presume to

to control those who are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

which are committed to the

No Man should set himself upon the

            <p>Nothing in this busy and licentious
Age is more usual, then for private
Men to invade the Office, to exercise
the Duties, to canvas and control the

Every one is finding holes in
the State, and picking quarrels with
the conduct of Political Affairs: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

according to Models framed
in his own Conceit: Things (saith
one) are out of order, the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is very defective, and ought to be
corrected; such a Law in all reason
should be repealed, and such an one
enacted: Here our States-men were
out of their Politicks, and there our
Law-givers failed in point of equity or
prudence: No, clamours another no
less eagerly, all things stand as well as
can be, nothing can be amended, or
ought to be altered; our establishment
in all respects is more perfect then <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s
Common-wealth, or the State of
<hi>Eutopia:</hi> Thus doth each Man appoint
himself Counsellor of State, and turns
Legislator without any Call from the
King, or Choice of the Country;
every one snatches at the Scepter, and
invests himself with the Senator's Robe;
Every one acteth a Prince and a Bishop,
or indeed is rather a Censor and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller

which naturally ensue upon such
demeanour; for to direct, or to check
Governours, is in effect to exauctorate

in their room; and what greater inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
can we do them, or the Publick?
to fix or reverse Laws, belongeth to
the highest Authority and deepest Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which 'tis enormous presumption

            <p>It is the business and duty of those

having by experience and constant

things, and a better skill to manage
them: whereas we being placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath

of their resolutions and proceedings;
we for want of sufficient use and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
cannot skill to ballance the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

to surmount the difficulties and rubs, to
unfold the knots and intrigues, which
occur in Affairs of that kind; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

we are altogether incompetent Judges,

things; it is great odds, that in doing
so, we shall mistake, and misbehave
our selves; we consequently do vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and naughtily to meddle with them.
If the love of Publick Good doth
transport us, let us restrain our selves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We should not indeed so much as
meddle with the Affairs of our Equals,
(those I mean not who do equal us in

not subject to our command or charge,
however otherwise inferior to us;
those I say we should not meddle with)
so as to control or cross them; to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
or check, or censure their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
against their will, or without

for this is also to usurp an undue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
this argueth self-conceit; this
containeth immodesty and arrogance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We should not, without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
or leave of Parties concerned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
in the smaller Temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests

prosecuting it in the method he
best liketh (consistent with Law and
Justice towards others) without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53987:178"/>
or control: Every man hath a
right to do so, every man desireth it,
every man commonly hath a capacity
sufficient for it; for each man is apt
to study his own Business, to weigh
his Case, to poise his Abilities, with the
Circumstances in which he standeth;
and thence is likely to get righter noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning the state of his Affairs,
to descry better ways of accomplishing
them, then others less regarding them
can do: Every man is best acquainted
with his own humour and temper, and
thence can pick his Business, and wind
the management of it, so that it shall
comply with them, or not grate upon
them. However, as every man in
point of interest and honour is most
concerned in the success, and suffereth
most by frustration of his endeavours,
so it is equal that a free choice of his
proceedings should be allowed him,
without impediment or disturbance;
which enjoying, he will more conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
bear any disappointment that shall
happen. This especially we say, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to matters of lesser consequence,
such as most worldly Interests are)
by the ill success whereof our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is not extreamly dammaged or

and arrogancy of medling, with the
vexation and trouble it is apt to work,
do commonly much outweigh any
benefit we can presume by our medling
to procure.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We should not indeed ever in
matters of indifferent and innocent
nature so far meddle, as without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
reason or need, to infringe any
mans liberty, to cross his humour, to
obstruct his pleasure, however discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
these may be to our Judgment
and Palate: Every man hath a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
gust for Diet, for Garb, for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements,
and Disports, (arising
from particular Complexion, or other
unaccomptable Causes) and fit it is
that he should satisfy it; it is enough,
that what he doth seemeth good, and
relisheth to himself; if we check him
therein, we shall seem impertinent and
troublesom, and therefore we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
be so; for it is not our Office to
be Tasters, to be Dressers, to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Sports to all Men: we in
such Matters would please our own
fancy, and therefore we should not
about them offend others; 'tis incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

6. We should never offer to put a
force upon any mans inclination, or
strive to bend it unto a compliance
with ours; in attempting that we shall
commonly be disappointed, and we
shall never come fairly off: for some
are so tough, they will never yield to
us, none will comply against the grain,
without regret and displeasure; if you
extort a compliance with your desire,
you thereby do lose their good-opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and good-will; for no man liketh
to be over-born with violence or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We should not in Conversation
meddle so as impose our Opinions and
Conceits upon others: In conversation
with our Equals, we have a liberty to
propound our Judgment, and declare
our Reasons for it; but if our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth not take, nor our Reasons
persuade, we should have done; to
press farther is rude, to be displeased
for it is vain, to be angry or violent is
unjust; for by the Law of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
every man taketh himself to have
an absolute right to use and follow his
own Reason; and he that affects to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
any man thereof, will pass for a
petty Tyrant, a Clown, or an Idiot;


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53987:180"/>
to retain the satisfaction, which our own
perswasion affordeth, is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
a just and sober Mind, without
triumphing over the understandings of
others.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We should not ordinarily in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
affect, or undertake to teach;
for this implies a pretence to a kind of
superiority, and a preferring our selves
to others in wisdom; which argueth
vanity, and is offensive to those with
whom we converse; who care not to
be dealt with as Disciples, or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.
We may with our Equals mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
dispute the Case, upon even
ground, as fellow Students of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,

for this is a rude way of dispossessing

Sober Men care not to be the Subjects
of Talk; no Man can endure to be
the Object of Sport; we should not

common refuge of Idleness, and the

nothing, will talk impertinently:

It is also grosly injurious to deal
thus; for it is a robbery of what is
most dear to men; which they with
more care reserve and guard, then
they do their Gold, or their Jewels;
so that to break open the Closet of a

a worse sort of Burglary or Theft, then

do understand them, 'tis yet undecent
to contest or dictate about them, in the
presence at least of those who profess
them: thus should private men beware
(at least in that magisterial or eager
way) to meddle with Political Affairs,
illiterate Men with Scholastical, Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

III. I shall now give some Directions
concerning particular kinds of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
And because they are many,
I shall at present only insist upon
three, (referring others to other
occasions) they are, <hi>Advice, Reproof,
Interposing in Contests,</hi> and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. As to medling in <hi>Advice,</hi> we may
do well to observe these Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Advise not (except upon Call)
a Superior, or one more eminent then
thy self in Authority, in Dignity, or
in Age: for he that offereth to advise,
doth thereby claim to himself a kind of
superiority, or excellence, above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and it is not well consistent with
the reverence and respect due to our
betters to seem to do so: they should
be wiser then we, at least it becometh
us not to declare we think they are not;
If they ask Advice, we may without
presumption give it, supposing it to be
not so much their defect of Knowledg,
as prudent Caution, which maketh
them willing to hear what any man
can say to the Case; but to obtrude it


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53987:185"/>
on them, argueth we think them to
need it, and our selves able to direct
them, which is presumption, and will
pass for arrogance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We should not indeed, with any
violence or importunity, thrust Advice
upon our Equals, or upon any Man
not subject to our charge, who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to receive it; for this is also an
exalting our selves in skill and wisdom
above him, and implieth a contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
opinion concerning his Knowledg;
that he is so weak as to need Advice,
and yet more weak in not seeking it
when needful from us; which practice
consisteth not with modesty, and needs
must breed offence, it is indeed injust;
for every Man of right is to be allowed
to act by his own Advice, and to chuse
his own Counsellors.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be not obstinate in pressing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
if he that asketh thy counsel, do
not like it, desist from urging farther,
and rest content: If thou hast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the part of a faithful Friend, of
a good Man, of a charitable Christian
in advising what seemed best to thee,
that may abundantly satisfie thee; for
the rest <hi>ipse viderit,</hi> 'tis his concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more then thine: If thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53987:186"/>
that he must follow thy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
or art displeased because he doth
not so, thou makest thy self a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
not a Counsellor; the which
to appoint thee, was beside his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he meant to seek thy help, not to
forfeit his own liberty; and thou art
not just in pretending to so much.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Affect not to be a Counsellor,
nor let any Considerations (except of
Friendship, Humanity, or Charity)
easily dispose thee to accept the Office;
it is not worth the while to undertake
it as a matter of Reputation, or because
it seemeth to argue a good opinion
concerning thy skill and ability; for it
is a critical and dangerous thing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise;
because if the Business succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
well according to thy Advice, the
Principal usually carrieth away the
Profit, and the Praise; his Judgment,
his Industry, his Fortune, are applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
little commendation or benefit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crueth
to the Counsellor; but if it
prosper not, the main weight of blame
is surely laid upon him that advised
the course; If you (saith the Party,
and say the lookers on) had not thus
directed, it had not thus fallen out.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:53987:186"/>
5. Wherefore it is commonly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
not to advise otherwise then with
reservation and diffidence: 'Tis, we
may say, the most probable course I
know, but I question whether it will
succeed; I hope well of it, but do not
thoroughly confide therein; this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and discreet way, what-ever the
event shall be, will shelter thee from
blame; yea, will advance the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thy sagacity; for if it fail, thy
Reason to suspect will be approved; if
it prosper, the goodness of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be applauded: whereas the
confident Director, if Success crosseth
his Advice, is exclaimed upon for his
rashness; if Success favoureth, he is
not yet admired for his wisdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he seemed to be sure; it being
more admirable to guess the best among
doubtful things, then to determine that
which is certain. So much for medling
about <hi>Advice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. For <hi>Reproof,</hi> (which is necessary,
and a Duty upon some Occasions) we
may do well to follow these Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reprove not a Superior;<note place="margin">Levit. 19. 17.</note> for 'tis
exercising a power over him,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5 11.</note> and a


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53987:187"/>
punishing him; we thereby therefore
do soar above our pitch, we confound
Ranks, and pervert the Order setled
among men; the practice containeth
irreverence, and presumption; it
seemeth injurious, and is ever odious.
What the Ministers of God, or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Pastors do in this kind, they do it
by special commission or instinct, (as
the Prophets in reprehending Princes
and Priests, as <hi>St. John Baptist</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<hi>Herod);</hi> Or as ordinary Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
in the case of Spiritual Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note>
being <hi>set over us</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and <hi>watching for our Souls,</hi> for
which <hi>they must render an accompt;</hi> yet
they must do it with great moderation
and discretion: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Rebuke not an Elder,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 1.</note> (or one more
aged then thy self) <hi>but entreat him as a
Father,</hi> (that is, advise him in the most
respectful and gentle manner) is the
charge of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to B. <hi>Timothy.</hi> In
case of grievance, or scandal, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
Inferiors not proudly or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
to criminate and tax, but
humbly to remonstrate and supplicate
for redress.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reprove not rashly, and without
certain cognizance of the Fact; for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53987:187"/>
for things not done, or (which in
moral reckoning is the same) for things
not apparent, is both unjust, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
a malignant disposition: 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
to punish so much as the modesty
of any Man without clear evidence
and proof; 'tis malignity to suspect a
Man of ill, 'tis calumny to charge blame
on him upon slender pretences, or
doubtful surmises.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Reprove not also rashly as to the
point of right, or without being able
to convince the Matter to be assuredly
culpable: to reprove for things not
bad, or not unquestionably such (for
things that are, or perhaps may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
and innocent) is also unjust,
and signifieth a tyrannical disposition:
'tis unjust any-wise to punish a Man,
without clear warrant of Law; 'tis ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
to impose upon Men our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
or to persecute them for using
their Liberty, following their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or enjoying their Humour;
which in effect we do, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them for that, which we cannot
prove blameable: 'Tis (S. <hi>James</hi> saith)
<hi>a judging the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 4. 11.</note> or charging it with
defect, when we condemn Persons for
things not prohibited by it: <hi>He</hi> (saith


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53987:188"/>
the <hi>Apostle) that speaketh against his
Brother, and judgeth his Brother, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
against the Law, and judgeth the
Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both these kinds of rash Reproof
are very inconvenient, as breeding
needless Offence, and endless Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for who-ever is thus taxed, will
certainly take it ill, and will contend
in his own defence; no man patiently,
for no sufficient cause or sure ground,
will lie under the stroak of Reproof,
which always smarteth, but then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth,
when it is supposed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
unjustly or maliciously: Even
those who contentedly will bear friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Reproof, can worst brook to be
causlesly taxed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Reprove not for slight matters;
for such faults or defects as proceed
from natural frailty, from inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
from mistake in matters of small
consequence:<note place="margin">Mitem ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, &amp; mores modicis erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus aequos. <hi>Iuv.</hi> Sat. 14.</note> for it is hard to be just
in such Reproof; or so to temper it,
as not to exceed the measure of blame
due to such faults; they occur so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that we should never cease to be
carping, if we do it upon such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
'tis not worth the while, 'tis not
handsome to seem displeased with such

little things; 'tis spending our Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon a Game not worth the killing:
Reproof is too grave and stately a
thing to be prostituted upon so mean
things; to use it upon small cause, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogateth
from its weight, when there is
considerable reason for it; Friendship,
Charity, and Humanity, should cover
such Offences. In fine; It is unseemly
to reprove Men for such things as all
Men, as themselves are so continually
subject unto: It is therefore better to
let such things pass without any mark
of displeasure or dislike.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Reprove not unseasonably; not
when a Person is indisposed to bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
or unfit to profit thereby; not,
when there is likely to be no good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
come from it; when thou shalt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thereby conjure up an evil spirit of
displeasure and enmity against thy self.
Reproof is a thing of it self not good
or pleasant, but sometimes needful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wholesome, and good in order
to the end; it should therefore be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
as Physick; then only, when
the Patient is fit to receive it, and it
may serve to correct his Distemper;
otherwise you will only make him
more sick, and very angry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:53987:189"/>
'Tis ever almost unseasonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
some Persons; as scorners, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
incorrigibly profligate Persons;
who will hate the Reprover, without
regarding the Reproof; <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
a Scorner,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 9. 7, 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 12.</note> 
               <hi>getteth to himself shame;
and he that rebuketh a wicked man, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
himself a blot. Reprove not a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
lest he hate thee.</hi> To be maligned, to
be derided, to be aspersed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and slander, is all one shall get
by reproving such Persons; it is both
prostituting good Advice, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
ones self to mischief; as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
intimateth in that prohibition;
<hi>Give not that which is Holy unto Dogs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 7. 6.</note>
               <hi>neither cast your Pearls before Swine, lest
they trample them under their feet, and
turn again and rent you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As such Men ever, so most Men in
some Seasons are uncapable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof;
so are Men in calamity, who
are discomposed by grief, the which is
rather to be mitigated by comfort,
then encreased and exasperated by
blame; so are Men in a passion, who
have no Ears to hear, no Reason to
judg, no Will to comply with Advice:
Reproof is apt to produce rather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and ill-blood, then any contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53987:189"/>
or kindly remorse in Persons so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>It is also usually not seasonable to
reprove Men publickly, when their
modesty is highly put to it, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
grievously suffereth; for this
is an extream sort of punishment, and
is taken for needless; 'tis extream, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men had rather suffer any way,
then in their honour; 'tis deemed
needless, because it may be ministred
privately.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Reprove mildly and sweetly; in
the calmest manner, in the gentlest
terms; not in a haughty or imperious
way, not hastily or fiercely; not with
sowr looks, or in bitter Language;
for these ways do beget all the evil,
and hinder the best Effects of Reproof:
They do certainly enflame and disturb
the Person reproved; they breed
wrath, disdain, and hatred against the
Reprover; but do not so well enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Man to see his Error, or affect
him with kindly sence of his miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
or dispose him to correct his
Fault; such Reproofs look rather like
the Wounds and Persecutions of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
then as Remedies ministred by a
friendly hand; they harden Men with


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53987:190"/>
stomach and scorn to mend upon such
occasion. If Reproof doth not savour
of Humanity, it signifieth nothing; it
must be like a bitter Pill wrapt in Gold,
and tempered with Sugar, otherwise it
will not go down, or work effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Affect not to be reprehensive;
seem not willingly to undertake the
place of a Reprover; appear to be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn thereto by sence of Duty, or
exigency of Friendship, or constraint
of Charity and Good-will. For to
affect reproving, is a sign of ill-nature
and arrogance; that we delight to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Faults, that we love to insult
upon the Infirmities and Infelicities of
other Men; which is the part of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering
and cruel humour. A truly
good Man indeed would be glad to be
excused from the Office; it is the most
unpleasant thing he can do to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in Mens Sores, and causing smart
to his Neighbours; far more gladly
would he be commending their good
Deeds, and cherishing their Vertue;
nothing therefore but Conscience and
Charity can put him on this Emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But so much for medling in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:53987:190"/>
III. Another kind of medling is,
<hi>Interposing in the Contests,</hi> and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of others. As to this, we may,
briefly, do well to observe these Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We should never meddle, so as
to raise Dissentions, or to do such things
which breed them; we should by no
means create misunderstandings, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasts
between our Neighbours; we
should not instil Jealousies, or Surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
we should not misconstrue Words
or Actions, to an offensive sence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence;
we should not conveigh
spightful Tales; we should not disclose
the Secrets of one to another: these
practices engender enmity and strife
among Men; and are therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane,
or rather Diabolical; for
the Devil is the great Make-bate in the
World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We should not foment Dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
already commenced; blowing up
the Coals that are kindled, by abetting
the strife, or aggravating the causes
thereof; it is not good to strengthen
the Quarrel, by siding with one part,
except that part be notoriously oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53987:191"/>
or abused; in such a case indeed,
when Justice calling for them, we may
lend our advice and assistance; and
may bear the inconvenience of being
engaged; as <hi>Moses</hi> honestly and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously
did, when he succoured his
Brother that suffered wrong; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
'tis adviseable to keep our selves
out of the Fray; that we do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
it by our taking part, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
our selves in the mischiefs of
it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Especially we should not make
our selves Parties in any Faction, where
both sides are eager and passionate;
for then even they who have the juster
cause, are wont to do unjust things, in
which 'tis hard for any Man engaged
not to have share, at least not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
the imputation of them: 'tis wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
therefore in such cases to hold off,
and to retain a kind of indifferency;
to meddle in them is, (as the <hi>Wise
Man</hi> saith) to <hi>take a Dog by the Ears;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 26. 7.</note>
which he that doth, can hardly take
care enough of his Fingers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We should not interpose our
selves (without invitation) to be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators
in Points of Difference: We
may cautiously mediate perhaps, or


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53987:191"/>
advise to Agreement; but not pretend
as Judges with Authority to decide the
Controversy; this savoureth of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Arist.</note>
this will work trouble to us,
and bring the displeasure of both sides
upon us; it is hard in doing so, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
becoming Parties, and offending
one side: Our Lord therefore did, we
see, wave this Office, and put off the
invitation, with a, <hi>Who made me a
Divider, or a Judg between you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If we would at all meddle in these
Cases, it should be only in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by the most fair and prudent
means, to renew Peace, and reconcile
the Dissenters; if we can by exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and persuasion to Peace, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
misprisions, by representing
things handsomly, by mitigating their
passions, bring them to good terms;
this is a laudable medling, this is a
blessed practice. So I leave this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and finish the directive part of
my Discourse.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I shall now further only briefly
propose some Considerations inducing
to Quietness, and dissuasive from Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticalness;
such as arise from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Properties, Causes, and Effects


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53987:192"/>
of each; serving to commend the
one, and disparage the other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider that Quietness is just
and equal, Pragmaticalness is injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
When we contain our selves
quiet, and mind only our own Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we allow every Man his Right,
we harm no Man's Repute; we keep
our selves within our bounds, and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
not on the Place or Interest of our
Neighbour; we disturb not the right
order and course of things: but in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pragmatical, we do wrongfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
others of their right and liberty
to manage their Business; we preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
their Credit, implicitly charging
them with weakness, and incapacity to
dispatch their Affairs without our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
we therefore upon our own
unequal and partial Judgment, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and advance our selves above them;
we assume to our selves in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
more then our due, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it from others. In fine; No Man
loveth that others should invade his
Office, or intrude into his Business;
therefore in justice every Man should
forbear doing so toward others.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:53987:192"/>
2. Quietness signifieth Humility,
modesty, and Sobriety of Mind; that
we conceit not our selves more wise
then our Neighbour, that we allow
every Man his share of discretion;
that we take others for able and skilful
enough to understand and manage
their own Affairs, but pragmaticalness
argueth much over-weaning and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance;
that we take our selves for
the only Men of Wisdom, at least for
more wise then those, into whose Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
we thrust our selves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Quietness is beneficial to the
World, preserving the general order of
things, disposing Men to keep within
their rank and station; and within the
sphere of their power and ability<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
attending to the Work and
Business proper to them; whereby as
themselves do well, so the Publick doth
thrive; but pragmaticalness disturbeth
the World, confounding things; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
the distinction between Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
Inferior, and Equal rendring
each Man's Business uncertain; while
some undertake that which belongeth


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53987:193"/>
not to them: One busy-body often
(as we find by experience) is able to
disturb and pester a whole Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Quietness preserveth Concord
and Amity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for no Man is thereby
provoked, being suffered undistur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedly
to proceed in his course, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his mind and pleasure: but
Pragmaticalness breedeth Dissentions
and Fewds; for all Men are ready to
quarrel with those, who offer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol
them, or cross them in their way;
every Man will be zealous in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
his priviledg of chusing and
acting according to his choice; and
cannot but oppose those, who attempt
to bereave him of it; whence between
the busy-body assailing, and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
their Liberty, Combustions
must arise.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Quietness to the Person endued
with it, or practising it, begetteth
tranquillity and peace; for he that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
others alone, and cometh in no
Man's way, no Man will be apt to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
or cross him; he keepeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53987:193"/>
out of Broils and Factions; but
the Busy-body createth vexation and
trouble to himself; others will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to molest him in his proceedings,
because he disturbeth them in theirs:
He that will have a Sickle in anothers
Corn, or an Oar in every Man's Boat, no
wonder if his Fingers be rapped; Men
do not more naturally brush off Flies,
which buz about their Ears, sit upon
their Faces or Hands, and sting or
tickle them; then they strive to drive
away clamourous, and encroaching
Busy-bodies.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Let</hi> (saith S. <hi>Peter) none
of you suffer as a Busy-body in other mens
matters;</hi> it is, he intimateth, a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
whereby a Man becometh liable
to suffer, or which Men are apt to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
soundly: and so the <hi>Wise Man,</hi>
implying the fondness and danger of
it;<note place="margin">Prov. 26. 17.</note> 
               <hi>He</hi> (saith he) <hi>that passeth by, and
medleth with strife not belonging to him,
is like one that taketh a Dog by the Ears;</hi>
that is, without any probable good
effect, he provoketh a Creature that
will snarl at him, and bite him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Quietness is a decent and lovely
thing, as signifying good disposition,


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53987:194"/>
and producing good effects; but Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticalness
is ugly and odious. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man gladly would be Neighbour to
a quiet Person, as who by the steady
calmness and smoothness of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
the inoffensive stillness and
sweetness of his demeanour, doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
all the pleasure of Conversation,
without any cross or trouble. But no
Man willingly would dwell by him,
who is apt ever to be infesting him by
his turbulent humour, his obstrepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
talk, his tumultuous and furious
carriage; who upon all occasions,
without invitation or consent, will be
thrusting in his Eyes, his Tongue, his
Hand; prying into all that is done,
dictating this or that course, taxing all
proceeding, usurping a kind of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over him and his actions; no
Man will like, or can well endure such
a Neighbour. It is commonly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that Pride is not only abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, but loathsome to Man;
and of all Prides, this is the most of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
and odious: for the Pride
which keepeth at home, within a
Man's heart or fancy, not issuing forth
to trouble others, may indeed well be


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53987:194"/>
despised, as hugely silly and vain; but
that which breaketh out to the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
and vexation of others, is hated,
as molestful and mischievous.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Quietness adorneth any Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
bringing credit, respect, and
love thereto; but Pragmaticalness is
scandalous, and procureth <hi>odium</hi> to
any Party or Cause: Men usually do
cloak their pragmatical behaviour with
pretences of Zeal for publick Good, or
of kindness to some Party, which they
have espoused; but thereby they do
really cast reproach, and draw preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
upon their side; if it be a good
Cause, they do thereby wrong it,
making it to partake of the blame, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to such carriage, as if it did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
or allow disorder; if it be a bad
Cause, they wrong themselves, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
the guilt of their adherence
thereto; for it is a less fault to be calm
and remiss in an ill-way, then busy or
violent in promoting it. Nothing
hath wrought more prejudice to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or hath brought more dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
upon Truth, then boisterous
and unseasonable Zeal; pretending in


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53987:195"/>
ways of passion, of fierceness, of rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to advance them: A quiet Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
doth to most Mens fancy appear
more lovely, then he that is furiously
and factiously Orthodox: The Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>of a meek and quiet Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>is</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Peter) in God's sight of great
price;</hi> and it is also very estimable in
the Opinion of Men.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Quiet is a safe practice;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

Men not only from needless encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of Business, but from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of it, or being charged with its
bad success: but Pragmaticalness is
dangerous; for if things go ill, the
Medler surely will be loaded with the
blame; the profit, and commendation
of Prosperities will accrue to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
immediately concerned; but the
disaster and dammage will be imputed
to those who meddled in the Business;
to excuse or ease themselves, Men will
cast the disgrace on those who did
project, or further the undertaking:
He therefore that would be secure,
let him be quiet; he that loveth peril
and trouble, let him be pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:53987:195"/>
9. It is consequently a great point
of discretion to be quiet, it yielding
a Man peace and safety, without any
trouble; and it is a manifest folly to
be Pragmatical, it being only with
care, pains, and trouble to seek dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to others, and danger to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
it being also to affect many not
only inconveniencies, but impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Is it possible for any Man to grasp,
or compass an infinity of Business? yet
this the Pragmatical Man seemeth to
drive at; for the Businesses of other
Men are infinite; and into that Abyss
he plungeth himself, who passeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his own bounds; by the same
reason that he medleth with any beside
his own, he may undertake all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in the World; so he is sure to have
work enough; but Fruit surely little
enough of his pains.</p>
            <p>Is it imaginable, that we can easily
bring others to our bent, or induce
Men to submit their Business to our
judgement and humour? Will not
he that attempteth such things, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
expose himself to disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53987:196"/>
and regret? Is it not therefore
wisdom to let every Man have his
own way, and pursue his Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
without any check or control
from us?</p>
            <p n="10">10. We may also consider, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

that we are to seek for divertisement,
and must for relief fly to curiosity;
yet is it not adviseable to meddle with
the Affairs of other Men; there are
divers other ways more innocent, more
safe, more pleasant, more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to divert our selves, and satisfie
curiosity.</p>
            <p>Nature offereth her self, and her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhaustible
store of appearances to
our contemplation; we may, without
any harm, and with much delight, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
her rich Varieties, examine her


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53987:197"/>
Proceedings, pierce into her Secrets;
Every kind of Animals, of Plants, of
Minerals, of Meteors presenteth Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherewith innocently, pleasantly,
and profitably to entertain our minds:
There are many noble Sciences, by
applying our minds to the study where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
we may not only divert them, but
improve and cultivate them: The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
of Ages past, or relations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Forreign Countries, wherein
the manners of men are described, and
their Actions reported, may afford us
useful pleasure and pastime; thereby
we may learn as much, and understand
the World as well, as by the most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
inquiry into the present Actions
of men; there we may observe, we
may scan, we may tax the proceedings
of whom we please without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or offence: There are extant num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless
Books, wherein the wisest and
most ingenious of men have laid open
their hearts, and exposed their most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Cogitations unto us; in perusing
them we may sufficiently busy our
selves, and let our idle hours pass grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
we may meddle with our selves,
studying our own dispositions, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53987:198"/>
our principles and purposes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on our thoughts, words, and
actions; striving thoroughly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
our selves; to do this, we have
an unquestionable right, and by it we
shall obtain vast benefit, much greater
then we can hope to get by puddering
in the designs or doings of others.
Pragmaticalness then, as it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and troublesome, so it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
needless; it is a kind of idleness,
but of all idleness the most unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
It is at least worse then idleness,
in S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi>'s Opinion:<note place="margin">

for, <hi>I had rather,</hi> said he, <hi>be idle more
then I should, then over-busy.</hi> Other
Considerations might be added, but
these I hope may be sufficient to restrain
this practice, so unprofitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy
to our selves, and for the most part
so injurious and troublesome to others.</p>
            <p>Now the God of Peace, make us perfect
in every good word and work, through
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for
ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
