            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>That the Present Publick
RESOLUTIONS
And Proceedings, do Import a Conjunction with the
MALIGNANT PARTY
In the Kingdome, and of the Sin, Danger
and Scandal of that way.</head>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Sect. 1. That there is a Malignant Party still in the Kingdom.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Entry to this businesse, the Importunity of not a few
makes it needfull to speak somwhat to a <hi>Question</hi> which unto this
time hath been unquestioned, as beyond all exception, That is.
<hi>Whether there be yet in Scotland a Malignant Partie?</hi> Or, Whether
there be at this time any Partie who may and ought in Reason
and Christian prudence be reputed and looked upon as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
and disaffected to the Covenanted Cause of God? It seems the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
needfull to speak somwhat of this. First, Because some Ministers are become
slack and silent in this point, as if now there were no need of Watchfullness
and Warning against any such partie. 2. Because the expressions of many of
the people of the Land run that way, that there are now no <hi>Malignants</hi> in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and that it is but a few Factious Ministers that will still keep up
these names, that they may more easily with, others of their oun stamp
weaken and divide the Kingdome for carrying on of their oun ends. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Inclinations and Resolutions of the Publick Judicatories in referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to most of the Party who carryed that name, doth clearly import that they
do think they are no more to be looked upon as <hi>Malignants,</hi> as appears from
severall of their papers; especially the Letter written for satisfaction to the
<hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Sterling.</hi> And therfore this must be laid down as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what follows. <q>That there is still in the Land, not only a few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
but a Party considerable for Number, Power and Policy, who are <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant</hi>
and dissaffected to the Covenant and Cause of God.</q> We would
joyn heartily in the desire of many, that these and other such like Odious
names of different parties and factions were taken away; But we cannot
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41269:3"/>
joyn in the Reasons of this desire which are ordinarly given. We wish the
name <hi>Malignant</hi> were Obsolete and antiquate, if so be the thing it self, which
is such a root of bitternesse, were extirpated out of the Church; yea though
the thing it self remained, if men would hate it for it self, and account it
more odious and hatefull than the name imports, we would be glad it were
no more heard of: Because we find this prejudice by all such Appropriated
Names, that People generally Looks upon that which goes under that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
as the only sin: and as if there were not that root of bitterness in all which
it grows out of in any; and so conceive themselves good Christians if they
fall not under that hatefull Appellation of <hi>Malignants.</hi> But seing this bitter
fruit of Enmity against Godliness and the Godly, comes to more ripeness and
maturity in many of this Generation than in others, who yet are unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And seing it hath been the Custome of the Church of God in all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
to discriminate many more Ungodly and knoun haters of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and his people from the common sort of naturall people, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them under these names, of <hi>Wicked,</hi> of <hi>Malignant,</hi> of <hi>Enemies,</hi> as
may appear in the old Testament, especially in the Psalms. And more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in our days, that name hath been appropriated to such who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
themselves in their words or Actions to be haters of Godlinesse and
the power thereof, and his People. Or have arisen to the height of Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Opposition against these; we cannot be blamed for using such a name still,
for distinctions sake. We proceed to some Reasons.</p>
               <p>(1.) The constant and Continued Proceedings of the Generall Assembly and
their Commissioners for many years past unto this day.</p>
               <p>There is not almost any of their Warnings, Declarations or Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which doth not Assert this, and warn against it, and that not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Kings home coming and taking of the Covenant; but also since that
time, as is evident by the Declaration emitted by the <hi>Commission</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> Last,
the Declaration of the <hi>Assembly</hi> it self a litle after, by the Declaration emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at <hi>Sterling</hi> since the defeat at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> the Causes of the Fast upon that
defeat, the Remonstrance to the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Perth</hi> after his escape, together with
the Remonstrance given in by them to the <hi>Parliament:</hi> All which doe clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold forth this Truth.</p>
               <p>(2.) Take Christs Rule, <hi>By their fruits ye shall know them.</hi> There is a great
<hi>Party</hi> in the Land that adhere to <hi>Malignant Principles,</hi> bring forth <hi>Malignant
fruits,</hi> and tread <hi>Malignant Paths.</hi> As may appear in these instances. (1.) A
great many of these who have been formerly engadged in such Courses, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Church Censures, did lately Conjoyne together and rise in Arms, and drew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the King from the Publick Counsels of the Kingdom, and refused to Lay
down Arms till they got Conditions agreeable to their mind, which Course of
theirs was justly declared by the Commission to carry upon it the stamp of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancie</hi>
in an Eminent way. (2.) The seeking to promove and Establish an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarie
Power in the Person of the King, as it hath been still the Endeavour of the
Malignant Party, so it hath been alwayes taken by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> as one
of their Characters, and that there is a Party now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who still hold that
Principle and drive this Designe of <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> is evident. First, Because the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41269:3"/>
same men who were Lately in Arms, did not only take up Arms upon the
Kings simple Warrant, and without the Knowledge and contrare to the mind of
the Committee of Estates; But also received the Act of Indemnity, and laid
down Arms, in obedience to the Kings Majesty, without so much as mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or Acknowledging the Committee of Estates, as it is to be seen in a Paper
Subscrived by them, and in the Remonstrance of the Commission of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Assembly dated at Perth Novr. 29. 1650. The words whereof are these.
<hi>Your Lordships would Likewise Consider, Whether it doth not Encroach upon the present
Constitution of Goverment of this Kingdom, and will not Involve your Lordships in the
Guilt of these mens Sin, if You shall accept upon their Laying doun of Arms, Meerly upon
the Profession of Obedience to the Kings Command, without any expression of their respect
and obedience to the Committee of Estates, or any Acknowledgment of their sin and Offence:
which we hope you will look upon as a most Unnaturall and unseasonable rending of the
Kingdom, in the tyme of this heavy Oppression by a common Enemy, and exposing the
Kingdom to all misery and ruine.</hi> 2. It may be remembred that in the first Modell
of the Aggreement which was made at <hi>Bredah,</hi> that clause which doth concern the
determining of Civil matters in the Intervall of Parliament, by such as are Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by Parliament for that effect, and the Kings Majesty hearkening to their
Advice, was wholly left out. And any who are aquainted with expressions and
Inclinations of sundry Great Ones in the Land, are not ignorant of their dislyke of
a Committee of Estates, and their desire to have the Administration of Matters in
the Intervall of Parliament wholly devolved upon the Kings Councell. And the
same spirit that would draw businesse from the Committee to a Cabinet Councell,
would at last draw them from the Parliament it self: Because that is also, if not
more crossing to private Interests and designes than a Committee of Estates. 3 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
There is a Party in the Land who as in their hearts they do envy, and in their
tongues doe Traduce men that have been stedfast and faithfull in the Covenant
and Cause of God; so do they Endeavour to the utmost of their power, to bring
them into Disgrace and Contempt, and to get them removed from Power and
Trust; And upon the other side study with no lesse diligence to get places of
Power and Trust in the Army and elswhere filled with such as either have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
enemies or secret underminers. 4 Instance. Be there not many who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the Kingdom of Jesus Christ and Work of Reformation? not only by holding
up that old Calumny of Malignants, concerning the seditious and factious humor
of <hi>Ministers,</hi> and their stretching of themselves beyond their lyne, and by moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all faithfull and free preaching of the Word, and by bearing down the power
of Godlinesse, deriding and hating all the lovers and followers thereof, by being
impatient of the discipline and Censures of the Church; But also looking upon
the Government of the Church with ane evil eye: And strongly enclyning, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of them, that Church Government be put in the hands of a few <hi>Prelates;</hi> most
of them that it may be wholly devolved upon the Civil Government. 5. Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
There is still a party in the Land that endeavour to have the state of the
Question altered, and to have <hi>Religion</hi> left out of the same; That it being sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon Civil Interest, they may take to themselves a greater Latitude in their
way of carrying on business. This was holden forth to be the designe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Party in the year 1648. as appears in the Declaration of the Commission
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41269:4"/>
that year in <hi>March:</hi> and there was a Necessary and Seasonable Warning given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it by the Commission in their Declaration of the date July 1650.</p>
               <p>(3.) Reason. Besides these who are Excommunicated, there be yet in the
Land a Considerable number of persons of Chief note, who do still ly under Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Church, some because of their Accession to the late <hi>Unlaufull En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadgment,</hi>
others because of their Accession to the late Course of Rebellion about
the time of the Kings escape from <hi>Perth;</hi> beside many others of less Note.</p>
               <p>(4.) We suppose that it is most certain and unquestionable, that there was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
a Malignant Party and faction in the Land very numerous and powerfull.
How many men of blood, Murderers of their brethren, as unnaturall and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
as the <hi>Irishes</hi> they once joyned with against their Countrey? How many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
watched all opportunities for troubling the peace of the Kingdom, and rejoyced
in the day of its Calamity? How many were the Oppressors of these who Called
on the Lords Name in the time of the Engadgment? What multitudes of profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and Ungodly mockers of all Godlinesse and Haters and Persecuters of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
suarming every where? If this be of truth, as it is indeed; We may say, who
hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such a thing? Shall a Nation be born at
once? And have they so soon Learned to doe well, who have been so accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to doe evil? When did this Catholick Conversion fall out? and by what
means? Hath the <hi>act of Indemnity and Pardon</hi> such Influence, to Justify these men
from all their Butcheries and Barbarous Cruelties? The adding of three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
to the Church in one day, was miraculous in the days of miracles. But Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a greater miracle than that, in the days when miracles are ceased! many
Thousands added to the Church of the friends of the Cause of God in one day,
and that not by preaching, which is the power of God unto Savation; Not by
spirituall weapons which are mighty through God: But by the Carnall weapon
of ane <hi>Act of Indemnity,</hi> and the example of one Man, the Kings Conjunction in
the Cause, which at the best hath not such evidence of reality as to convince any,
and change their mind. Sad experience, and the Constant Testimony of the
Church of Scotland proves, that <hi>Malignancy</hi> is a weed that hath deeper and
stronger roots than to be plucked up so easily; and that though there be some,
yet they be but few in the Land who have been once engadged in that way, that
have really and indeed abandoned and come off the same.</p>
               <p>The point shall more appear by taking off objections that are made to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
It is objected. 1. That these who were formerly esteemed Malignants,
did oppose the work of God because they could not be perswaded in Conscience,
That the Covenant and Cause were Contrived and Carryed on in a Warrantable
way, those who were most instrumentall in it, seeming to them not only to act wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
Authority, but against Authority. But so it is, that the King hath now
joined in the Covenant and added his Authority to it, and therfore it needs not
be feared that these men will any more oppose it; Nay it may be expected, they
will no lesse Zealously promove the ends thereof than they did formerly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the same.</p>
               <p>Answer. This Argument supposeth some things that are false, some things at
best doubtfull, and some things dangerous. It supposeth Tuo falsities. 1. That
it was a ground and principle of Conscience and respect to the Kings Authority
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41269:4"/>
that made these men to oppose the Covenant and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Reformation. If it
was the Conscience and Conviction of the Unwarrantablness of it for the want of
Authority, that stirred them up to oppose the Covenant and Cause; Then why
did they subscrive it and joyn in the defence of the same against the King? 2. It
supposeth that the only ground, why they did oppose and undermine the same,
was, because the King was of a Contrary mind and refused to joyn in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and Ratify the same by his Authority, which also is false; for there were
severall other Grounds and Causes of so doing besides this. We shall name a
few, leaving the rest to a further scrutinie. 1. The Naturall enmity that is in
the hearts of all men against the Lord and his Anointed, his work and his people,
and the power of Godlinesse, which doth effectually work in the Children of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sobedience.
2. An Enmity against the Power of Parliament and Laws. 3. An
Enmity against the Union of the Kingdoms. 4. An Enmity against the Power
of Presbyteries and the Discipline of the Church. To which are opposed, A
sinfull desire of breaking the bonds, and casting away the Cords of the Lord and
his Anoynte; A desire to establish an Arbitrary Power and unlimited <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi>
A desire to Establish a Lordly Prelaticall power in the Persons of a few,
or to have the Government of the Church wholly dependent on the Civil Power;
A desire to dissolve the Union of the Kingdoms, that they may be thereby
weakned and less able to resist Malignant Designs against Religion and Liberties;
A desire to live loosly without bands in regard of personall Reformation.</p>
               <p>2. It supposeth somthing that is at best doubtfull, to wit, That the King hath
really joyned unto the Cause of God, there being small Evidences of it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
presumptions to the Contrary. Especially. 1. His bringing home with him
into the Kingdom a number of eminent, wicked and known Malignants. His
countenancing of, and familiar conversing with such in this Nation since his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and Correspondence with others of them abroad. His deserting of the
Publick Counsells of the Kingdome, to joyn to a Partie of bloody and wicked men
raised in Arms with his Knowledge and by his warrand. 2. His not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of any guilt in his Father, because of his opposition to the Cause and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
notwithstanding of all the blood of the Lords people shed by him in that
opposition. For verifying wherof, we appeal to the Knowledge of some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
and Ministers who have occasion to know his mind, and to be serious with
him in this thing.</p>
               <p>3. It supposeth somthing that is of very dangerous Consequence 1. That the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
mens Zeal to the Cause or against it, doth ebb and flow according to the Kings
being against it or for it. Since they follow the Cause, not for it self but for the
King, will they not desert it when the King forsakes it? Can they be accounted
reall friends of the Cause who are knoun to favour it only <hi>ad nutum Principis?</hi>
As the Comaedian <hi>ait, aio, negat, nego.</hi> Is it not all one to follow the Cause for
the King and for a mans oun Interest and advantage? both are alike Extrinsick
and Adventitious to the Cause, both are alike Changable. <hi>Eccebulus</hi> under
<hi>Constantius</hi> was a precise Christian, under <hi>Iulian</hi> a persecuting Apostate, and
then again under the next Christian Emperor became a Christian: And it is
like if he had outlived that Emperour till a Heathen succeeded, he should have
Paganized the second time. 2. That very principle that is pretended to unite
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41269:5"/>
them to the Cause is in the self most dangerous, both to the Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Liberties of people, and to our Religion beside. Their principle of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
was, <hi>They conceived the way followed could not be warrantable without the
Kings Consent and warrant. That people might not vindicate their oun just Rights and
Liberties, and their Religion, without the Kings Concurrence, or against Him.</hi> Now then,
the principle of their conjunction to the cause must be this, <hi>Because it is now
cloathed with Authoritie which it had not before, and which now makes it warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
This principle therefore includes in the bosome of it, the establishing
of Illimited and Absolute Power in Kings, the Unlawfulness of defensive
wars against Tyrannie and Oppression, the Kings <hi>Negative voyce,</hi> and the
dependent Power of Parliaments upon his Pleasure: All which are principles
destructive of the Cause and our Liberties, and the very characters of our
Enemies from the beginning. Thus they have changed their way but not
their principles, and are now the more dangerous that they may not be
looked upon as Enemies, but as friends. Seing it is manifest, that it is not
the love of the cause that constrains them, and they know, it was not that
principle that persuaded the King, but meer Necessity, contrare to his oun in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
May we not certainly expect, that according to their principles they
will labour to set at freedom the King whom they conceive Imprisoned and
captivated by the power of necessity within the limits and bounds of a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<hi>Monarchie,</hi> and to loose from him all these chains of Involuntary
Treaties and Agreements, and rigid Laws and Parliaments, that he may then
act in freedom and Honour according to his oun inclination and theirs both.
And then farewell <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Objection 2. The most part of these who were formerlie Malignant, have
now repented of that sin, and make profession of their resolution to adhere
to the Covenant and Cause of God, and to bestow their lives and Estates in
defence thereof: Therefore they are not now to be esteemed Malignants.</p>
               <p>Answer. We would wish from our hearts that we had no answer to this
Argument, then should we yeeld the point in hand, and yeeld it cheerfully,
that there is no Malignant party now in Scotland. But, alas! that we have
so much evidence convincing our consciences and persuading them to deny
what is objected. We acknowledge some have indeed repented, and such
we desire to embrace and receive with all tenderness &amp; love, as Godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
worthy to be entrusted: But yet the most part of them do still
bring forth the same Malignant fruits. Their ungodly and wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
testify to their face that they have nothing <hi>to do to take his Covenant in
their mouth, seing they hate to be Reformed.</hi> The late rising in Arms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
to their solemne and particular engadgments; Their bearing down
and reproaching the Godly, and such as are of known Integrity; Their
studying to fill places of Trust with men formerly Enemies or Underminers;
Their continuing in their profane and loose walking. All these are more
convincing evidences of their retaining their Old principles, than any extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
confessions or professions, for sinister respects and ends, can be probable signs
of their repentance and change.</p>
               <p>We desire these things to be remembred. That the <hi>Engadgment</hi> was Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41269:5"/>
on, not by Open and professed Enemies; but such as had made publick
profession of their repentance, and were therupon admitted to trust. 2. That
upon consideration of the hypocrisy and instability of these men appearing in
that and other particulars, the Kirk and Kingdom of Scotland did take
upon themselves strait Bonds and Engadgments to exclude such from Trust,
untill such time as they had given reall evidences of the reality of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and of abandoning their former Principles and wayes; of which
this Kirk was to judge Impartialie as in Gods sight. 3. That it hath been
confessed and preached by manie Godly Ministers, and was given in by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
in the time of the search of the Lords Controversy against the Land, in
<hi>Novr.</hi> last at <hi>Perth,</hi> and hath been bemoaned and regrated by many of the
people who feared God; That there is a great deal of sin and Guilt Lying on
the Kirk of Scotland, for the sudden receiving of Scandalous persons, especially
Malignants, to the publick profession of Repentance before there was in them
any reall evidence of their forsaking their former Principles and wayes.</p>
               <p>Objection 3. None are now to be esteemed Malignants, in reference to
Employment and Trust, but such as stand Judiciallie Debarred by Kirk and
State to be so: for certainly, men are not to ly under the burden of so great
a reproach, upon the privat whisperings and Common reports of others;
otherways, honest men may be wronged, and there shall be no end of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
or terminating this Controversie, there being no certain Rule to walk
by in it.</p>
               <p>Answer. We Acknowledge that surmisings, whisperings and reports of
others are not sufficient, but that a Rule is needfull. All the Question will be,
what is that Rule? And though the Judiciall debarring of Judicatories be
not all, but it must be Ruled by another Rule, yet are we willing to take
it for so much: for even that will prove there is yet a Malignant Party in
<hi>Scotland:</hi> Because many are standing under Church Censures. These invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Late Rebellion, are standing under a sentance of the Commission,
declaring them to be following their old Malignant designes, few of them
are yet admitted to profession of Repentance. We desire it may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that the Rule holden forth by the Kirk of Scotland, 1648. for
admitting of Persons to Trust, is of larger extent than Judiciall sentence or
Censure. To wit, that they be such against whom there is no just cause of
exception nor jealousy. 2. Albeit a Judiciall tryall or Censure be indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
for inflicting punishment or Censure upon men: Yet it is not necessary
for avoyding Association with them, or debarring them from Trust. 3. If none
were to be accounted Malignants, but they who are Judicially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declared to be
such, what needed the Kirk of Scotland have frequently taken so much
pains, to give Characters to know them by; there being so clear and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
a way besyde? Hath there not been alwayes in the Land secret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminers
as well as open Enemies? And hath not faithfull men avoyded the one
as well as the other? 4. The Generall Assembly 1648. Declared the taking in
of these who followed <hi>Iame Grahame</hi> to be Association with Malignants,
though most part of them were then Released from Church Censures.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41269:6"/>
               <head>Section 2. That the Present Publick Resolutions, expressed
in The Commissions Answer to the Parliaments Quaere,
and the Act of the Levie, doe not exclude that Party.</head>
               <p>IN the next Place, Upon supposall and proof, that there is a Malignant Party
&amp; faction still in the Land; It is needfull to examine, whether the exceptions
contained in the Answer of the Commission to the Parliaments Quaere, and
insert into the Act of Levie, be so Comprehensive as to include all that Party.
The exceptions be four. <hi>First, Such as are excommunicated. 2. Such as are For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted.
3. Such as are Notoriously profane or flagitious. And 4. Such as have been
from the beginning, and continues still, Or at this tyme are, obstinate Enemies and opposers
of the Covenant and Cause of God.</hi> That these are not Comprehensive of the whole
Malignant Party in the Land, appears.</p>
               <p>First, The Rules of the Generall Assembly framed for the exclusion of all
such, as ought not to be employed in our Armies, are far more Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve.
The Rule is for employing of such only <hi>as are of a Christian and blameless
Conversation,</hi> which is turned over by their Commissioners into a Negative,
<hi>All that are not notoriously profane or flagitious.</hi> Another is, For entrusting only
these <hi>who have been of knoun Integrity and Constant Friends to the Cause of God, from
the beginning.</hi> Which is also turned over into a Negative; <hi>All that have not been
Constant Enemies.</hi> All such, by the answer, are Capable of some Trust and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Rules agreed upon by the Assembly, and Ratifyed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Anno 1649. And renewed upon occasion of this Invasion, was, That
no <hi>Officer</hi> nor <hi>Souldier</hi> that followed <hi>Iames Graham,</hi> should be permitted in the
Army; Nor any Officer that was on the Engadgment, except such as upon
Reall evidence of Repentance, were Particularly Recommended by the Church,
Nor any Common souldier, but upon sufficient Testimony of his Repentance.
Now since it is proved, that the most part of all such, continues still Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and retains their old Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that the bulk and bodie of the
people are Called forth by the Publick Resolution, without such exceptions
as were conceived before necessary, for the exclusion of that Party; It follows
clearly, that the Malignant Partie is not excepted in the present Resolutions.</p>
               <p>2. Few of these who were in the Late Rebellion, and declared, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
days since, to be following a most Malignant designe and Course, are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
under these exceptions; Because very few of them are Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or Forfaulted: and though moe of them be indeed flagitious and Profane;
Yet very few of them will fall under the Compasse of the Exception, <hi>Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
flagitious.</hi> Many wicked things will be said to concurr to make up a
Profane man; some acts will not serve; a habit must be demonstrated: and
though that were shewed; Yet there must be also Notoriety of it, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a man to be famous for Loosnes and Profanity; and there be none al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
if any, in the Land, who have been professed Enemies from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and Continue so to this day. <hi>Iames Graham</hi> was not such. It is the matter
of our sad Complaint, that whilst many are Enemies, they make Profession
and Semblance of friendship. 3. These exceptions doe not Comprehend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41269:6"/>
who are under Censure for Malignancy or Profanity, except such as are
under the sentance of Excommunication; And that even such may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
Lest the Rule be transgressed, by admitting and employing Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
Persons. 'Tis withall resolved, that these Persons shall be relaxed
from that sentence, that so they may be immediately in the same Capacity
of Employment with others, whatever formerly hath been their Opposition
or Defection. Some exceptions must be made, for Honesty and Credits sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke:
But the nearest and readiest way is taken to make them Ineffectuall. 4.
These exceptions do not only not reach these who were upon the Unlawfull
Engadgment, and have not as yet given sufficient proof of their Abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Malignant Principles and Courses; But come not the Length of
Comprehending these men of blood who followed <hi>Iames Graham,</hi> and in
the most barbarous and Cruell way, shed the blood of their oun Brethren and
Gods people; because the most part of these are not <hi>Ex communicated nor For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted.</hi>
Nor <hi>Notoriously flagitious and Profane,</hi> Nor such as <hi>have from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
been, and are still Enemies.</hi> If any will say, that such are Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
under these exceptions. Why did the Commission expresse the exceptions
in such terms, as to mens common Apprehension do not include many? es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
seing there are known Rules, particular and distinct, without Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity;
and seing there is such a Propension in Rulers to employ all without
Difference, which would undoubtedly take Advantage of any thing that seemed
to look that way.</p>
               <p>It is likewise manifest, that the second part of the Answer, relating to the
Capacity of Acting, is loadned with the same Inconvenience. 1. There is no posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
determination of the Qualifications of Persons to be intrusted, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times it was agreed on by the Assembly and their Commissioners: but
that is now referred to the discretion of the Parliament; Together with such
Diminutive termes, as gives them great Latitude to go upon. Before, No trust
was given to such persons; Now, it is allowed they shal have some trust:
and how much is not determined, nor what degree of it is prejudiciall to
the Cause; Which it appears, the Parliaments proceedings in Nomination
of Officers, unquestioned by the Commission, is a good Commentarie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
that they may have any trust, except to be Generall Officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Our
former Estalished Rule was, that no persons should be Entrusted, but such
<hi>as are of known Integritie, and have been constant friends of the Cause.</hi> But how
far is this diminished? They who are such, only recommended to be espcial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken notice of. Less could not be said by any, more ought to have been
said by the Commission. And though no such notice be taken of such by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
But on the Contrare, those who have been most faithfull, and
suffered in the late defeat at <hi>Hamiltoun.</hi> They are used as Enemies, worse than
Malignants in former times; yet there is no Testimony given against such
things. <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo Coetu qui quondam fuit!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we enter upon the Chief Question, We offer these manifest and known
Truths to Consideration.</p>
               <p>1. The Occasion of Contriving and subscribing first the Nationall Covenant,
and then the Solemne League and Covenant, was, The designes and Practises
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41269:7"/>
of the Popish, Prelaticall and Malignant Partie, against Religion and the Work
of Reformation in these Kingdoms. 2. Since the Contriving and subscriving
of the same, it hath been the continual endeavour of that Party, somtimes
by Undermining, and sometimes by open Opposition, to undo the same, and to
bear down all those that clave honestly thereto, and faithfully prosecute all
the ends thereof. 3. That there hath been these many years past, and still is,
such a Party, in all the three Kingdoms, Considerable for Number, Power and
Policy. 4. That that party, hath always prosecuted their designe, under a Colour of
gzeal and respect to the Kings Authority and Interest. 5. That that party hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been the Authors and Abettors of much bloodshed, many Miseries and
sad Calamities to these Nations. 6. That the People of God in these Kingdoms,
have taken upon themselves a most Solemne and Sacred bond of ane Oath and
Covenant to Discover them, and bring them to Condigne punishment. 7. That it
hath been one of the predominant sins of Scotland under the bond of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to Comply with them. 8. That Indignation and wrath from the Lord,
hath been following that Party and their Designes these years past. 9. That
Complyances with them hath alwayes been Cursed to us of God. 10. That
few of that Party, doe really Abandon &amp; forsake their corrupt Principles and way,
and joyn Cordially in the Cause and Covenant. 11. That many of them doe,
after the Profession of their Repentance for their opposition to the Cause and
Covenant of God, relapse frequently into the same sin. 12. That sudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of many of them to Fellowship and Trust, and too great Credulity
in beleiving their professions, hath often cost this Land very dear 13. That upon Consideration of the deep Treachery and Hypocrisie of these men, and
the sad Consequents following upon sudden receiving of them, without Evidence
of a Change, after long and renewed Experience, this Land renewed their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
more strictly in the Solemne Engadgment. 14. That there hath been
a Designe driven these two years past, to get that Partie again in Power and
Trust. 15. That this designe hath been testified against, by the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of the Judicatories unto this time. 16. That as it hath been driven
at very cunningly and Actively, by many Instruments and Arguments of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
sorts; so hath it gained ground peece and peece, untill at Length many
of them are brought into the Court, and to the Armie and Judicatories in
the Countrey: And now, by the Publick Resolutions, they are generally to be
employed and Intrusted. Thus the Designe is Accomplished. But 17. These
men do not satisfie themselves with some Degree of Power; But endeavour
to Ingross the whole power of the Kingdome into their oun hands, and
study to bring into Contempt, and Cull out these, who have been and do
continue Constant in the Cause of God. 18. That having power into their
hands, They must act according to their oun Principles, and for estalishing
their oun Ends. And Lastly, That these Principles and Ends, are destructive to
the Covenant and Work of Reformation.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41269:7"/>
               <head>That the Employing of, and Associating with the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Party, according as is contained in the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,
is Sinfull and Unlawfull.</head>
               <p>IF there be in the Land a Malignant Party of Power and Policy, and the
Exceptions Contained in the <hi>Act of Leviae</hi> doth Comprehend but few of
that Party; Then there needs be no more difficulty to prove, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Publick Resolutions and Proceedings, do import ane Association and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with a Malignant Party, than to gather a Conclusion from clear
Premisses. But that such a Conjunction is in it self sinfull and unlawfull,
and besides, A violation of our solemne Oaths and Engadgments; A backsly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from our Principles and Professions, And a walking Contrare to the
whole tenure and current of our former Resolutions and practises, is now to
be made manifest.</p>
               <p>First, We reason from that Constant, standing and perpetuall Rule, which the
Lord gives concerning the modelling and Carriage of the Armies of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in all their Wars. Deut. 23. 9. <hi>When the Host goes forth against their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
then Keep thee from everie wicked thing.</hi> And after. <hi>If there be among yow,
any man that is unclean, by reason of uncleanness that Chanceth him in the night, then
shall he go abroad out of the Camp, he shall not come within the Camp.</hi> (If for
<hi>Ceremoniall uncleanness</hi> he was to be excluded, much more for <hi>Morall,</hi> as our
Divines Reason from the Old Testament in the point of Excommunication;
and if for uncleanness not Voluntary, much more for Voluntary wickednesse.)
The Reason of all is given <hi>verse 14. for the Lord thy God walks in the midst of
the Camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine Enemies before thee: Therfore shall
thy Camp be holy, that he see no unclean thing in thee and turn away from thee.</hi>
Even as they would expect a blessing of the Lord, so ought they to keep their
Camp holy, as he is holy; He gives not such a strict Rule for the Competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Number, as for the Qualifications of the Persons, as being the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
thing. Therfore the present Conjunction with so many ungodly and
wicked men, that have formerly declared themselves Enemies to God and
his people, and to this day give no evidence to the contrary, is sinfull and
unlawfull.</p>
               <p>2. The Lord hath frequently in scripture declared his dislike and hatred of
such Associations and Conjunctions. The Scriptures cited in the Generall
Assemblies Declaration in the year 1648. against the Engadgment, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
proof of this. We shall take the Argument as it is formed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of that Assembly, In their Answer to the Observations of the
Committee of Estates upon the Assemblies Declaration. Pag. 7. <q>Every En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadgment
in War, that is pretended to be for Religion, and hath in it a
Confederacie &amp; Association with wicked men, enemies of True Religion is
sinfull and unlawfull. But the present Engadgment in War, as it is held
forth in the Publick Resolutions, is pretended to be for Religion; and yet
hath in it a Confederacy and Conjunction with wicked men, and Enemies
of True Religion.</q> Ergo. The second Proposition is evident from the two first
Sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41269:8"/>
The first Proposition is proved from these Scriptures forementioned, God
forbade Conjunctions and Confederacies with the Enemies of his Cause and
people. Not only the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> Exod. 34. 12. 15. Deut. 7. 2. and other
Heathens, Such was <hi>Asa</hi> his Covenant with <hi>Benhadad</hi> 2. Chron. 16. to verse
10. <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Confederacy with the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> 2 Kings 16. 7, 10. 2 Chron.
18. 16. But also with wicked men of the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Iehoshaphats</hi>
with <hi>Ahab</hi> 2 Chron 18. 3. <hi>And Ahab King of Israel said unto Iehoshaphat King
of Iudah, with thow go with me to Ramoth-Gilead? And he Answered him, I am
as thow art, and my people as thy people, and we will be with thee in the war.</hi>
Compared with Chap. 19. 2. <hi>And Iehu the son of Hanani the Seer, went out to
meet him, and said to King Iehoshaphat, Shouldst thow help the ungodly, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.</hi>
And with <hi>Ahaziah</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 35. <hi>And after this did Iehosbaphat King of
Iudah joyn himself with Abaziah King of Israel, who did very wickedly.</hi> Which
being reproved for, he would not again joyn with Ahaziah 1 Kings 22. 49.
<hi>Then said Ahaziah the Son of Ahab unto Iehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy
servants in the ships: But Iehoshaphat would not.</hi> And then Amaziah's Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
with 100000 of Israel 2 Chron. 25. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>But there came a man
of God to him, saying, O King Let not the Armie of Israel go with thee; for the
Lord is not with Israel, to wit, with all the Children of Ephraim.</hi> ver 8. <hi>But
if thow will go, do it, be strong for the battel: God shall make thee fall before the
Enemy: for God hath power to help and to Cast down.</hi> ver 9. <hi>And Amaziah said
to the man of God. But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Army of Israel? And the man of God answered. The Lord is able to give
thee much more than this.</hi> ver 10. <hi>Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the
Army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: Wherfore their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was greatly Kindled against Iudah, and they returned home in great anger.</hi>
The sin and danger of such Associations may further appear from Isay 8. 12,

Psal. 139. 21.</p>
               <p>The Committee of Estates at that time endeavoured to elude the strength
of these Scriptures, and vindicate their Engadgment from the falling within
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41269:8"/>
the Compasse of them. But the Commission of the Assembly that year
took the mask off their evasions. Would to God we had no other Party to
deal with now. It was the evil and Complaint of that time, that Church
and State was divided. But what ane evil time are we now fallen into, that
the union of these in this point, is the complaint of many of the Godly?
The Commission, in their Letter to <hi>Sterling Presbyterie,</hi> sets up the Committees
answer in a new dresse, and holds it out for satisfaction to our Consciences. All
that is answered may be reduced to three or four heads.</p>
               <p>1. There is made a great difference between ane <hi>Invasive</hi> and <hi>Defensive</hi> War,
as if in the one, Choise of Instruments ought to be sought: but in the case of
Just and necessary defence, all subjects may be Imployed.</p>
               <p>To which we answer. 1. That the Scriptures cited conclude most expresly
against Conjunctions of that Kind in defensive Wars. Such was <hi>Asa's</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
such was <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Confedracie. Was not the reproofs of the Prophets
directed particularly against the peoples seeking of help from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
in the Case of their oun Just and necessary defence? <hi>Ier. 2. 18. Hosea</hi> 5.
13. <hi>and 7. 8. 11. Isay, 8. 12, 13. 2 Chron.</hi> 16. to ver 10. 2. The Law and
Rule given Deut. 23. is Generall, regulating all their Wars whether <hi>Defensive</hi>
or <hi>Offensive;</hi> and it is strange that any should imagine such a difference whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the Law makes none; nay, when the ground of the Law is Morall and
Generall, equally respecting all Wars. Is there any Ground of Conscience,
why wicked persons may not be kept in the camp when we invade others,
and yet these may be employed and entrusted when we defend our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves?
If there be any Reason to preferr the one to the other in this point, we
conceive Defensive War should have the preference: Because when the Lord
brings upon us injust invasion, he is ordinarly pursuing a Controversie against
us: and therfore we ought to be most tender and circumspect, that there be
no unclean thing in the Camp, and put away every wicked thing from us,
even the appearance of evil; Lest we add oyl to the flame of his Indignation,
and he <hi>seeing such ane unclean thing in us, turn yet further from us.</hi> Except we
say, that we need not take a care to have God in the camp with us, when
we are upon Just and necessary defence, seing our Cause is so good. 3. There
is more hazard and danger to our Religion and Liberties, to have a wicked
Malignant Army at home among us, than abroad in another Nation. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
they are here, they have the power of the Sword, and can command all: But
there might be some hope and endeavour, for vindicating our oun Liberties and
Religion while they are abroad, as it fell out in the time of the Engadgment.</p>
               <p>2. It is answered, that there is a difference between this Case and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadgment:
Because there was then no necessity of choosing such Instruments,
a competency of power might be had: But now it is not so: And therfore
the Scriptures mentioned do not militate against the present case. Answer 1.
The Scriptures cited will obviate this. What made <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> run to
<hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Assyria</hi> for help, but their weakness and necessitie? Their wound
was incurable, and their bruise grievous, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> often Laments, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
Cap. 8. 20, 21, 22. and 10. 19. &amp;c. and yet this did not excuse them
for going to <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Assyria</hi> to heal their wound Hos. 5. 13. and 7. 8, 11.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41269:9"/>
The Scripture holds out Infidelity and Distrust in God, as the ground of
such Associations. 2. <hi>Chron. 16. 7, 8, 9. Isay.</hi> 8. 12, 13. Which proceeds from
the incompetency of Means as the occasion of it. 2. Suppose there were a
necessitie for the calling forth the bodie of the Common people, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, there is no necessity of Employing any such persons of whom the Question
is, and putting them in places of Trust: There is none can deny, but there
are, besides all secluded persons, many, that might fill the places of Trust and
Power: Therfore the plea of necessity is but a Pretence to cover some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
that under its specious and Plausible Covering, the power of the Land
may be Ingrossed into the hands of Malignants: And so by this means all
Power and Trust may return as the rivers to the sea or fountain (as they Judge)
the King; that so in his Person there may be established ane Unlimited and
Arbitrary Power. 3. Necessity is a very plausible Argument and strong plea
to Carnall reason for any thing; But it cannot be a good ground, in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
for that which is sinfull in it self. Now that this is sinfull in it self
appears from the Word of God, simply condemning such Associations upon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and so Generall and perpetuall grounds. Now in such a case of necessity,
we are called either to trust in God, in the use of competent means, seing in
such Cases we have so many promises; or, if all help be gone, which God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
us to make use of, we must wait on him till He bring Salvation with
his oun Arm.</p>
               <p>But because the plea of necessity is the strongest that is made use of for the
Present Publick Resolutions, we must consider it a litle more. It is aleadged,
that the best part of the Land is under the feet of the Enemie, and so no
help can be had from it; and for other parts of the Land which are yet free,
there is not much Choise of Persons; and the testimony of faithfull men in
the State, Declares, that when all that are called forth of these places, are
gathered, it cannot amount to a power Competent enough: And therefore
in such a Question of the Existence of second means, the knowledge whereof
immediately depends on sense and experience, these who are not aquainted,
should give Credit to the testimony of faithfull Witnesses. And that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency
of power must be had, according to the ordinary way of Providence, in
relation to which we must act, except we would tempt God by requiring of
him wonders.</p>
               <p>Answer. Suppose the Enemies Armie to Consist of 20000 or above, Are
there not moe sensible persons in the Shyres on the North side of <hi>Forth?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it who please, we cannot stop our oun Consciences, and put out our oun
eyes. Let the rolls of severall shyres be Looked to, and it shall confute that
Testimony. Nay, are there not moe persons not formerly secluded in all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
Shyres? What meant the <hi>Levie</hi> appointed immediately after <hi>Dumbar?</hi>
was not 10000 Foot and 1400 Horse put upon these Shyres which are not
under the power of the Enemy? and yet the Rules of exclusion was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned.
Now all these, or most part of these, are yet in the Countrey not
Levied. Money was taken in stead of men, the Levies obstructed; So that
there was litle Addition to the strength of the Forces that remained; the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
diverted by the insurrection of the Malignants in the North, at the Kings
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41269:9"/>
command or warrand. All which hath such pregnant presumptions of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
carryed on to Necessitate the Kingdom to Employ that Party, by the
cunning Polititians of the time, by obstructing the Levies, raising the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,
and then pacifying them by an act of Indemnity: and at last openly
and avowedly Associating with them. Thus the designe is accomplished which
was long since on foot.</p>
               <p>2. If satisfying Courses had been studyed by the publick Judicatories to
carry on all the Godly in the Land with their Resolutions, there had accrued
strength from the parts of the Land be-south <hi>Forth,</hi> which would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
all that competency of Power that the Conjunction of the Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnants
makes up: and it may be would have been more blessed of God. 3.
If there be no help required nor expected from these parts of the Kingdom
be-south <hi>Forth,</hi> wherefore did the Commission write to the Presbyteries in
these bounds that they might Concur actively in their stations for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Levies, and choose Ministers to go out with them?</p>
               <p>3. It is Answered That the Confederacies reproved were Unlawful, because
they were either with Heathens, or with Idolaters, strangers and Forrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gners.
This is answered to the Case of <hi>Amaziah</hi> &amp;c. and so it seems not to
make against the present Case, the employing all Subjects in the just and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
defence of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Answer. 1. This answer at one blow cuts off all the strength of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assemblies reason against the Association with Malignants in that year.
There might be some few persons Idolaters, but there was no party and
faction such; and yet they can deny Association with the English Malignants
from these Scriptures; Yea not only with them, but with our oun Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that was in Rebellion with <hi>Iames Grahame,</hi> who were neither Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
nor Forraigners. We need no other answer than the Commission at
that time gave to the Committee of Estates using that same evasion. pag. 10.
11. 2. The ground and reason whereupon such Associations are condemned,
is more generall and comprehensive. <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> was reproved for joyning
with <hi>Ahab,</hi> because he was <hi>ungodly and hated the Lord,</hi> which is properly in
our terms, because he was a Malignant and profane man. It were a strange
mocking of Scripture to Restrict Ungodliness, in that place to the sin of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Confederacie with the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and other Nations was forbidden on
this ground, <hi>that the people be not ensnared, and learn not their works.</hi> Now is
not the Company of, and Communion with ungodly men of the same ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
profession, but mockers and haters of the power thereof, as infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and ensnaring? Nay its more apt to ensnare because of the profession.
<hi>Paul</hi> would have as much distance kept with a <hi>brother</hi> walking Unorderly,
as a <hi>Pagan:</hi> for such a one as walks contrary to their profession of the true
Religion, do evidence more ungodliness and wickednesse, than a ignorant
and superstitious Papist that walks precisely according to his profession. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is some Principle of Conscience stirring in the one: but its seared in the
other with an hot iron. God ranks such, who are Uncircumcised in heart, with
the uncircumcised in flesh. Ought not his people to do so to? 3. The Rule
of modelling Armies and purging the Camp is most Comprehensive Deut. 23.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41269:10"/>
Not only of Idolaters and Forraigners, but every <hi>wicked thing</hi> and <hi>Unclean thing</hi>
was to be removed out of the Camp. Now seing these Examples
are transgressions of this Law, what reason is there to make the only ground
of reproving and condemning of them to be, because Idolaters were Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
with, as if any other might be joyned with that is not an Idolater. 4.
That Reason against <hi>Amaziah's</hi> Conjunction with <hi>Israel</hi> is wrested by some,
expounding it thus. <hi>God is not with them,</hi> is not understood <hi>in regard of a state of
grace, as appears, nor in regard of Gods prospering providence: because he was often
with them in that Regard: but it must be understood in regard of an Idolatrous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>
But we reply, that it is true it is not understood in regard of a state
of grace; nor simply in regard of his prospering Providence: But <hi>Ut plurimum,</hi>
the Lord for the most part crossing them till they were cutt off from being a
Nation. But especially it is to be meant in regard of a Course opposite to
God, according as the Lord speaks, 2 Chron. 15: 2. <hi>The Lord is with you while
ye be with him; but if ye forsake him he will forsake you.</hi> If any will restrict this
to Idolatry, he hath no ground from Scripture for such a Limitation; but being
engadged in the business, he wrests the Scriptures to his oun destruction. Sure we
are, there are many palpable forsakings of God, and Gods forsaking of men,
beside Idolatry and false worship. 5. That which is said, <hi>That God did not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Amaziah to dismisse any of his oun Subjects.</hi> Either it makes nor much
to the present business, or els it strikes against the Law of God it self, that
Commanded such strict purging of the Camp. From whom I pray you? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
from wicked Israelites, from wicked Countrey men: Therefore if there
was any such among the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> he ought to have put them out of
the Army as well as the <hi>Israelites.</hi> Nay the Command of dismissing the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
was, really and upon the Matter, a Command to Purge his Camp of all
that was of the stamp of the Israelites. It is strange that the Civil difference
of strangers and Citizens should make such Difference in the point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
Ought we not to hate the Lords enemies with a perfect hatred, not
as English-men, not as strangers, but as Enemies. <hi>Levi</hi> knew not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this was his honour; but many now for respect to their brethren, know
not God. It is the Moral Quality that the Law of God respects, without
respect of Persons and Countreys. To be a Citizen, if not qualified, doth
no more plead for employment <hi>in foro Conscientiae</hi> and before God, than
to be a stranger and qualified doth impede trust and employment <hi>in foro Conscientiae</hi>
and before God.</p>
               <p>5. It may be Answered (and it is by some) That these Scriptures plead, that
there should be no Conjunction with wicked men in a Quarrell of Religion:
but seing our present business is the Defence of the Kingdome, all subjects, as
subjects, stand in Capacity of employment for that end, though in reference to
the defence of Religion there must be a choise.</p>
               <p>Answer. 1. The Commission have vindicated themselves in a letter to <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
Presbytery from that Imputation, that it is said, they state the Quarrell
and Cause meerly upon Civil things in the Answer to the Parliaments Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
But Certainly there is just ground given to these that are watching for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41269:10"/>
any such thing, to state the Cause so: because they do contrare to all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Custom and Practise, mention the Defence of the Kingdom only, as it had
been of purpose, to make the employing of all members of the body or
subjects of the Kingdom for its defence more Plausible. But we answer to
the point, The Associations and Conjunctions that are Condemned in the
cited Scriptures, are some of them for Civil Quarrells, so far as we know;
some of them in the point of just and necessary Defence of the Kingdom,
and yet that doth not Justifie them. 2. The Rule given them <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. was
regulating all their wars, and clearly holds forth, that all subjects as subjects,
and members of the Politick body, though as such there is an obligation
lying on them to Defend the whole; yet they are not in actuall and nearest
Capacity to the performance of the Duty, if they be wicked and unclean. And
the reason is, because the Lord would have the Wars of his People his
oun wars, and all that they do, to his Glory; <hi>Num.</hi> 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20:
15. <hi>Col.</hi> 3: 17. More especially such solemne undertakings, there ought to be
a difference between his people, acting for Self-defence, and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
3. Although the Defence of the Kingdom and Defence of the Cause, be
Different in themselves, yet are they Unseparable. Whoever is entrusted
with the Defence of the Kingdome really and <hi>de facto;</hi> he is <hi>to ipso</hi> entrusted
with the defence of the Cause: Therefore the People of God, who ought
alwise to have Religion first in their eye, ought, especially in raising Forces
for self-preservation, levell at Religion, and direct the Choise of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Relation to that Mark, that they destroy not Christians while they save
Subjects, and preserve our bodies to destroy our souls.</p>
               <p>3. Reason. That which is dissonant from and contrare unto all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Resolutions and Proceedings, Oaths and Engadgments, Confessions and
Humiliations, must needs be most Unlawfull, or they themselves, as to that
point, were Unlawfull. But the present Resolutions and proceedings are disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
from, and contrare to all these. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Either our Present or our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Resolutions and Practises were Unlawfull; either we were wrong before,
or we are not right now. The second Proposition may be made manifest from
1. The present Resolutions are contrare to the Solemne League and Covenant
in the fourth Article and the sixth. To the fourth, Because we put power
in the hands of a Malignant Party, power of the sword, which is inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
in the oun nature of it with either actuall punishing of them, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring
to bring them to punishment. Unless it be intended to bring them all
forth, and expose them to the slaughter for a Sacrifice for the Land, which
may be the Lords mind indeed, howbeit they know not his thoughts. And
to the sixth Article, Because its a declyning to the contrary Party, even
that party against whom the Covenant was at the making expresly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And as the Declaration of the Generall Assembly 1648. hath it,
Its a joyning with one enemy to beat another, with a black Devil to beat a
white.</p>
               <p>It is most Ingenuously answered, that the present Resolutions are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
to the Covenant. Because such as are descrived in the Covenant are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41269:11"/>
not allowed to be employed, meaning, that these men are not now Malignants.
What needs men make such a Compasse to Justifie the Publick Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
seing there is so easy and ready a way straight at hand? This one
answer might take off all the Arguments made against them, that there is
no Malignant party now: which is the foundation that being removed, all
the building must fall to the ground. But we have in the First article evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that, which had been scandalous to have proved, if it had not been Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned.
If it were indeed true, that no Malignants are allowed to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
what needed the Commission in their Letter to Sterling Presbytery
take so much pains from Scripture and Reason to justify the present Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
when the clearing of that one point had cleared all? As for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the Assembly <hi>Anno 1648. It is answered, that none are to be employed,
that continue natourly in the Courses of Malignancy, which was done that year.</hi>
Wheras the Malignant Party that was then Associated with, would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged
to be faithfull to all the ends of the Covenant, many of them were
such as had been in Covenant, and made shew of their repentance for their
defection from it: and so there is no difference in this particular.</p>
               <p>2. The solemne Acknowledgment of Publick sins is so clear and peremptory
in this, that it makes us tremble to think on it Pag. 6 <q>Should we again
break his Commandments and Covenant, by joyning any more in Affinity
with the people of these Abominations, and take in our bosome these ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
which have formerly stung us almost to death? this, as it would argue
much folly and madness, So no doubt, it would provoke the Lord to consume
us till there be no remnant of escaping.</q> Let the 6th. Article also be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.
Joyn to this the Declaration of the Commission, upon report of this
enemies invading Pag. 6. where it is Declared, that Malignants shall not be
Associated with, nay not countenanced and permitted to be in our Armies.
The Generall Assembly after this, upon the enemies entry into Scotland, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
serious warning to the Rulers, to take heed of snares from that Partie:
and that the rather, because men ordinarly are so taken with the sense of
Danger, as not to Look back to that which is behind them &amp;c. How often
have we sentenced our selves unto Wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Consumption if we shall fall
into this sin again? All these and the like, are endeavoured to be taken off,
by saying that our Engadgments in this point, was conceived in a way of Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Cause; But to be no impediment of just and necessary defence
which we are bound to by Natures Law which no humane Law can Infringe.</p>
               <p>But we reply. 1. It is strange, our prosecution of the Cause these years
past, should be Contradistinguished from the defence of it and the Kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
It was conceived that our War in England was Defensive not Invasive,
that it was necessitated for the defence even of our Kingdom, but it seems
it is now questioned; But passing what was acted abroad, Certainly all our
Wars at home were meerly Defensive, both against unjust Invasion and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Insurrections. Now our solemne Engadgments were conceived, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to our actings at Home especially, and modelling our Armies for the
defence of our Liberties and Religion. We knew well enough that a just
invasive war is a rare accident in the world, and that the flock of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41269:11"/>
Jesus Christ are, for the most part, obnoxious to the violence of others, as
sheep among wolves: but are not often called to prey upon others. 2. To
call our Solemne Engadgments and Declarations, grounded upon our oaths
and upon the Word of God, Humane Laws and Constitutions, that must
cede to Natures Law, it is indeed ingenuous dealing: because to Justifie the
present proceedings, there can be no more expedite way, than to condemne
by past Resolutions for the peremptoriness of them, and to make them groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on Politick Considerations, which are alterable: But it imports a great
change of Principles. We conceive that all Humane Laws that are not for
the Matter grounded on the Word of God, that oblidge not Conscience but
in the Case of Scandal, and in regard of the generall end, are alterable, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable,
whenever they come in opposition to the Law of Nature, Self-defence,
Law of God written in the Word. And therefore that Act of Parliament
mentioned by the Commission, Discharging all subjects to rise without the
Kings Command, which was made use of against our first taking Arms, was no
wayes binding on the subjects not to rise in the Defence of their Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
when in hazard. And we wonder that that Law should be compared to
our Solemne Engadgments, which are grounded upon oaths and Gods Word,
as touching the very matter and substance of them, as if our Engadgments
did no more bind us now, in case of defence, than that Law did bind us
then. Royalists might be excused for preferring the Kings will to Gods;
but we cannot be pardoned for equalizing them. And especially while we
consider that that forementioned Act undoubdely hath been intended, for the
establishing of ane Arbitrary and Absolute Power in the Kings hand; that the
Subjects may not have Liberty to save themselves, except the King will. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
God hath given us Liberty by the Law of Nature, or his Word; No King
can justly ty us, and when God binds us and oblidges us by any of these,
No King or Parliament can loose us or unty us. 3. The Declaration of
the Commission and Assembly upon this invasion, Renues the same bond of
our former Engadgments; Yea and speaks expresly, in the Case of fewness
and scarceness of Instruments, against the Unbelief of people that are ready
in danger to choose any help. Therefore that which is said in answer, that
at that time there was a Choise of Instruments which now is not, it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
condemn and falsifie the Declarations at that time, in the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Paucitie of Instruments, and in the application of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and divine truth to that time; but it doth not speak any thing
against the application of that truth therein contained to our time; it
being more manifest, that we have greater necessity and less Choise of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and so in greater hazard of unbelief, and overlooking what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
us.</p>
               <p>3. It is of all Considerations the most Confounding, to reflect upon our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Humiliations and Fasts. How often hath it been Confessed to God, as the
predominant Publick sin of Scotland, <hi>Countenancing and Employing the Malignant
Partie?</hi> But when we call particalarlie to mind the first Solemne Fast after
the defeat at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> Astonishment takes hold on us, to think, that it is
now defended as a Duty, which, but some moneths ago, was Solemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41269:12"/>
as a sin, the not purging of the Army, the obstructing of that work,
and great inclinations to keep in and fetch in such Persons, and the repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at, and crying out against all that was done in the contrarie, was then
reckoned as the great Cause of Gods Wrath, and his sad stroak upon us.
What distraction may this breed in the hearts of the people of the Land,
to hear that same thing Complained of as great sin to day, and Commended
as a necessary Duty to morrow? Is not all the Land presently called to mourn
for the Kings sins, of which this is one, the designing a Conjunction with
the Malignant Party, and giving them warrand to rise in Arms for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Kingdome? Now, how shall they be able to reconcile these in
their oun minds, at the same time to mourn for that as a sin in the King,
which they hear commended as the Duty of the Parliament? To fast a day
for that as the Kings sin, which they must go about to morrow as their oun
Duty? <hi>Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in Ashkelon: lest the Daughters of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines
rejoyce.</hi> Heathens may rise in Judgment against this Generation. <hi>Semper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idem

                     </gap>elle atque idem nolle haec demum sapientiae est.</hi> If any wise man be <hi>ubique
&amp; semper sibi pay &amp; idem,</hi> what ought a Godly man to be?</p>
               <p>3. Reason. That which is an Uncertain mean of preservation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and a more Certain mean of destruction of Religion, is utterly unlawfull.
But the employing and entrusting of all men promiscuously, according as is
holden out in the publick Resolutions; is, at best an, uncertain mean of the
preservation of the Kingdom, and is a more certain mean of the destruction
of Religion. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is utterly unlawfull. The First Proposition cannot be
denyed. When any less good comes in opposition with a greater good, the Pesser
good in that respect becomes evil. We may not endanger certainly a greater
good, for the probable and incertain attainment of the lesser. The Second
Proposition I know will be Denyed, as it was denyed in the time of the
Engadgment by the Committee of Estates. They said, the Danger of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was not infallibile, that it might eventually fall out so: but not
by any Causality. And thus it is pleaded now. That the danger of Religion
is not inevitable; That the danger of the Kingdom is certain: and so these
being laid in the ballance together, we ought, to eschew a certain danger
of the Kingdoms Destruction, rather hazard on a probable danger of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>But we shall clear this and confirm the reason. 1. The danger of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is indeed great; but it is not so certain and inevitable in case of not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
the Malignant party: because there may be some competency of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
beside. Now the Delivery and preservation of the Kingdom from this
danger, by conjunction with that party, is either improbable; because we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
sentenced our selves to Destruction, if ever we should do such a thing
again. We are standing under a curse, whereto we have bound over our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
And beside, God is in a speciall manner parsuing that generation, and
hath raised up this Enemy for their destruction; so that we may with greater
probability expect, to partake of their plagues, and to fall under our oun Curse,
than to be Delivered, or be instruments of Deliverance to the Kingdom.
Or, at the best, it is uncertain: for what is more uncertain than the event of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41269:12"/>
War? The battel in this sense may be said peculiarly to belong to the Lord.
Now on the other hand, the danger of Religion is Certain and inevitable,
though not simply in it self, and absolutely: because the Lord doth in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth what he pleases; yet with a Morall Certainty and infallibility,
which is often as great as <hi>Physicall</hi> certainty. Suppose these men; having the
power of the Sword, prevail; will they not employ it according to their
principles, and for attaining their oun ends, which both are destructive
to Religion? What is more certain than that men act and speak from the
Abundance of the heart, when there is no outward restraint? It should be
a great wonder if they who are so accustomed to doe evil, should cease to
doe evil, when they have power and Convenience to do it. Power and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath Corrupted many good men, shall it Convert them? Can men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
other fruits from a tree than the nature of it yeelds? Will one seek
figs on thorns, or grapes on thistles? 2. We do not see what Defence it
can be, for the present, to the Kingdom, at least the godly and well affected in
the Kingdom, who will be as much troubled in their persons and Estates by
that Party, as by the Common Enemy. It is known what threatnings the
Countrey is filled with, which vents that inveterate Malice and hatred of
all the well affected in the Kingdom, which they have kept within their
breast of a long time: and now they find opportunity of outing it. It is as
clear as day light, that the most part of all the secluded persons looks upon
these that opposed them in the Engadgment, and shut them out of places
of Trust, and Capacity of Employment, as enemies, and as great Enemies as
the Sectaries. And that we may know what to expect when they have full
power in their hand; they have already so lift up their head, that no God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man can promise himself security in many places, And especially the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Gentlmen and people of the <hi>West,</hi> who have given more proof of their
Faithfullnesse to the Cause and Kingdom against the Common Enemie, than
any others in the Land; Yet are daily suffering violence from these preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators
of the Kingdom, while they are sufferers under the feet of the Enemy:
When they have no common Enemy, whom I beseech yow, will they prey
upon; seing they do it already while they have an Enemy.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed. That none of the least Suspition, are allowed to be in
such trust and power, as may be prejudiciall to Religion: And that ane oath
is to be taken of all, which is to be conceived as particular, binding and strict
as is possible.</p>
               <p>Answer. 1. What a manifest receding is it from former principles, that
it is now conceived, that all places of trust, excepting some few of eminent
note, may be filled with secluded and debarred persons, without the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of Religion? It is certain that most part of Officers, nominated by the
Parliament and Shyres, are not only such, of whom there is just ground of
suspition; but such as have been Enemies by actuall opposition to the Cause
of God, or known underminers thereof. Can it be said in good earnest,
that none, of whom is any suspition, shall have such trust as may be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall?
Sure we are, there are many just grounds of suspition and jealousie of
Generall Persons, who have Chief trust in our Armies: and this the publick
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41269:13"/>
Judicatories are not Ignorant of. 2. Oaths and Covenants are but like green
Cords about <hi>Samson</hi> to bind these men. Would we have them yet once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
perjured; Then may we tender ane oath to them. Put power in their hand,
and then make them swear to employ it well. Its as ridiculous as to give
a mad man a sword, and then perswade him to hurt none with it. There is
no more capitulation with such persons, retaining their old principles, than
with the floods or winds. These whom that SACRED BOND OF
COVENANT hath not tyed, what oath can bind? Except yow can change
their nature, do not swear them to good behaviour. Can a Leopard change
his Spots?</p>
               <p>5. Reason. That which gives great offence and scandal, and layes a stumbling
block in the way, both of the people of the Land and our Enemies, especially
in the way of the Godly: that is Unlawfull. But the present Association and
Conjunction, with all persons in the Kingdom (excepting a few if any) is scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and offensive to the whole Land, to the Godly especially, and also to the
Enemy. Therefore it is unlawfull. The <hi>Major</hi> is beyond all exception, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how peremptory CHRIST and his Apostles are in the point of offence,
which yet few Christians do consider. We ought not only to beware of the
offence of the Godly, but even of wicked men, even of our blaspheming
Enemies. <hi>Give no offence neither to the Iew nor Gentile, nor to the Church of God.</hi>
CHRIST would not offend and scandalize his malitious Enemies. The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
is proved. 1. There is great offence given to the Godly in the Kingdom
by the publick Resolutions, concerning that Conjunction with the Malignant
Party, under the Name and Notion of Subjects. 1. Because its known that
the most part of them are tender in that point, what fellowship they act
with: And this hath been Remonstrate unto the Commission and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of Estates, from severall Synods. Now the present Resolution layeth that
stumbling block in their way, that they cannot act in the defence of the
Kingdom: Because there is no way left them, for the performing of that
duty, but that which they in their Consciences are not satisfyed with. Its
a sad necessity and snare that is put upon them, that they cannot perform
their bound duty, which they are most desirous of, without sin: Because of
the way that is taken. 2. Is it not a matter of Offence and stumbling to
them, to be necessitated by Law to that which was their affliction? The
mixture that was in our Armies was their Grief: And their comfort was
that the Judicatories were minting at their duty to purge them: But now
there is no hope of attaining that: all Doors is shut up by the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions.
3. It undoubtedly will weaken their hands, and make their hearts
faint; So that they cannot pray with Affection and in Faith, for a blessing
upon such an Army, the predominant and leading part whereof have been
esteemed, and is really Enemies to God and his people. 4. Is it not a great
Offence that any thing should proceed from the publick Judicatories, that
shall lay a necessity upon many Godly in the Land, to suffer, because they
cannot in Conscience go along with it. Next it scandalizeth the whole
Land. What may they think within themselves, to see such dissonancy and
disagreement between present and former Resolutions and Practises? What
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41269:13"/>
may they judge of the inconstancy and levity of the Commission? And be
induced to give no respect and reverence to them in their Resolutions. Is
it not, at least, a very great appearance of evil to joyn with that Party, that
we did Declare and repute, but some few weeks since, to be wicked Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Religion and the Kingdom? and look hencforth on them as friends
without so much as any ackowledgment of their sin had from them? Shall
not they be induced, to put no difference between the pretious and the vile?
not to discern between him that fears God and him that fears him not, when
the publick Resolutions puts no difference? Then, how will it Confirm all
the Malignant party in their wickednesse? May they not think our Solemne
vowes and Engadgments, our rigid Resolutions and proceedings were but
all contrived and acted out of Policy; and that Interest and Advantage, and
not Conscience Principled them? Have they not ane occasion given them to
persecute all the Godly, and vent their long harboured malice against these
who have been most zealous for Reformation and purging of the Land?
Nay, they are put in the Capacity that they have desired, for acting all their
Resolutions, and accomplishing their Designes. And last of all, the present
proceedings will not onely encourage, and animate the Common Enemy:
but confirm them in all the Imputations and Calumnies they have loadned
our Church with. May they not have ground fothink, that we are but dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on a politick design and does not singly aim at Gods Glory? That it is
not Grounds of Conscience acts us, but some wordly Interest, when they
look upon the inconstancy and Changeableness of our way and Course, which is
so accommodated to occasions and times? Can they think us men of Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
that will join with all these men of blood, before we will so much as
speak with them? It is Replyed, that the Scandal is taken, and not given;
which must not be stood upon, in the Case of a necessary duty. But 1. we clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that there is no necessity of that Conjunction: therefore the scandal is
given; seing its known before hand, that it will be taken. 2. There are
many grounds of offence given by the present Resolutions, as appears by what
is said. If it were no more, its a great appearance of evil; Its very inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
of many evils; A most fit occasion of all thats spoken; And besides, its in
it self sinfull, contrare to Gods Word and to our oaths.</p>
               <p>6. Reason. That which makes glad all the wicked and Enemies of God in
the Land, and sad many, if not most part, of the Godly; hath much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and evidence, if not Certainty, of evill, <hi>is unlawfull.</hi> But the publick
Resolutions and proceedings are such. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Or thus. That which makes
glad all the wicked, and heightens the hopes and expectations of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Party, and makes sad none almost but the Godly, and discourages
their spirits; That, proceeding from the publick Judicatories, cannot be right
and Lawfull: But so it is, that that which proceeds from the publick Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories,
makes glad all the hearts of thewicked, and makes sad none, almost,
but the Godly, heightens the hopes of the Malignants, and makes them say
their Day is coming, <hi>Lo we have seen it:</hi> And discourages the Godly, and
makes them almost say, <hi>Our hope is cut off, our Glory is departed. Ergo,</hi> it
cannot be right, at least it hath a great and convincing Appearance of
evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41269:14"/>
This Argument may be thought more Popular, than either <hi>Philosophicall</hi> or
<hi>Scripturall:</hi> But such an argument the Generall Assembly 1648. made use of
against the Engadgment. It is no wayes imaginable, how the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
in the Land, would so insult and rejoyce in this day; if they saw not
some Legible Characters upon it, which were agreeable to their oun Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Ends. The Children of God, are, for the most part, <hi>Led by the
Spirit of God, and taught the way they should choose. Iohn.</hi> 16: 13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 25: 12.
So that readily they do not skunner at Courses approven of God: But the
Children of the world, being, at best, led by their oun carnal minds and senses,
and, for the most part, acted by a Spirit of disobedience and enmity against
God, they use not to rejoyce at things that do not suit with their Carnall
hearts, and are not engraven with the Character of that which is imprinted
in their Spirits. We see now <hi>that the wicked walk on every side, when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
men are exalted. And when the wicked rise, the Righteous is hidden, and when
they bear rule, the people mourneth: but when Righteous men are in Authority, the
people do rejoyce: and when the Righteous rejoyceth, there is great Glorie. Ps. 12. ult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Prov. 28: 12. and 29:</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>7. Reason. That which is the accomplishment and perfecting of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
designe, that hath been driven on these years past, especially since
the unlawfull Engadgment; it cannot be a Course approven of God: But
the present Course is the Accomplishment of that designe. <hi>Ergo.</hi> That there
hath been a designe, for a long time, driven and endeavoured, both at ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
and abroad, with much Policy and Industry, by many turnings and wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and by Arguments of severall kinds, as the exigence of the times did
furnish: and that the designe was, to have all such Persons in Trust and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
again, who had been secluded, that so they might compasse their oun
Ends, hath not been denyed hitherto: and we are perswaded, no man
that fears God, and observes the times, is ignorant of it. Let the publick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the treaty at <hi>Bredah,</hi> and the publick papers of this Kingdom and
Church at home, be Consulted; they bear witness for us. Was not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of it laid in Holland? Many of them in both Nations, brought home
with the King contrare to publick Resolutions, and by the prevailing influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of some in the State, kept in the Kingdome, Contrare to Publick Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Was not the work of purging Judicatories and Armies obstructed? The
Godly discountenanced and discouraged? great endeavours used to raise the
Malignants in the <hi>South</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> and since the Defeat to raise all wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
exception in the North? But when that could not be obtained, by the
withstanding of honest men in the State. The Levies appointed, which would
have been a Considerable force for the defence of the Kingdom, was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
wholly ineffectuall; Partly by taking moneys for men; partly by raising
the Malignant Party; and then pretending to go against them, they were
pacified by an act of Indemnity: the fruit and Result of all which, is this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Conjunction with them: and putting the power of judicatories and Armies
in their hand. Thus the Designe is Compleated.</p>
               <p>8. Reason. That which will increase the Lords Indignation and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
against the Land, yet seven times more; that is very unlawfull and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41269:14"/>
unseasonable; But so it is, that Confederacy and Association with the people
of these Abominations, will increase the Lords indignation and Controversie
seven times more. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Assumption was as manifest and uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
as the Proposition, a few moneths agoe, but it is begun now to be
questioned by some, <hi>qui quod sciunt nesciumn, quia sapiunt.</hi> But we shall evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
it. 1. We are standing under such a sentence, which we deliberately and
sincerely past upon our selves, in the days of our vows to God, that if we did
ever any more joyn with the people of these Abominations, the Lord would
consume us till there were no remnant. And this was not done in rashnesse
but in sobriety, and with a Scripture president <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9: 12, 13. 2. Our experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
hath made this clear to us. We never did mingle our selves among them,
but the Lord did pursue us with Indignation, and stamped that sin, as in vive
Characters, upon our Judgment. God hath set upon that Rock, that we have
so oft split upon, a remarkable Beacon. Therefore we doe not only in our
solemne Engadgments, bind our selves over to a Curse, in case of Relapsing,
but passes the sentence of great madnesse and folly on our selves. <hi>Piscator
ictu sapit.</hi> Experience makes fools wise, but it cannot cure madnesse. Did
not that mixture provoke God at <hi>Dumbar?</hi> And is this the way to appease
him, to revolt more and more. 3. Conjunction and Confederacy with that
party, doth necessarly inferr a Communion in blessings and plagues, we must
cast in our lot with them, and have all one purse. Now it hath been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
and Declared by this Church, that God hath a notable Controversie
with that Party, that this enemy is in ane eminent way to bear them down and
Crush them. Therefore if we joyn with them, we must Resolve to partake of their
plagues and have that Controversie pleaded against us also.</p>
               <p>It is answered, that Indignation needs not be feared simply on this accompt:
because the means are Lawfull and necessary; else, if this have any force, it
will conclude, that we should ly down and do nothing: because Gods Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is upon the whole Land.</p>
               <p>But we reply. 1. Though it be true, that this Enemy is the rod of Gods
Indignation against the whole Land; Yet it is Certain to us, and hath been
formerly unquestioned, that they are raised up, in a speciall way, to execute
Gods wrath on Malignants, and God doth arm them with Power in a signall
manner for that end. Besides, the Lords anger and indignation against his
enemies is such, as will burn and none can quench it: its of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than his wrath against his oun people, which is a hyding of his face for
a moment. He corrects us in measure and judgment, but leaves us not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unpunished: But he makes ane end of other Nations, Especially
these that rise up to actuall enmitie and hatred of his people, and sheding
of their blood. And therefore, if any man would not meet with Wrath
and sore Displeasure, he would stand at a distance with such, as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for destruction; we mean, as long as they carry in their foreheads the
<hi>mark of the beast.</hi> When God hath such a remarkable Controversie against a
people then <hi>be that helpeth and he that is helped, shall both fall together. Isay.</hi> 31: 3,
All that is in league with them, shall fall with them by the sword. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 30.
5. and 32: 21. 2. Since it is known, that the Malignant party have not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41269:15"/>
changed their Principles, and so they cannot but in prosecuting this War esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
their old Quarrell and follow it, to wit, the Kings Arbitrary power,
the Interest of man, above Gods or the Kingdoms Interest. We leave it to
be judged impartially, whether or not, these that Associate with them, do
espouse that Quarrell and Interest, at least expose themselves to all that Wrath
and Indignation, which hath hitherto followed that Quarrell, seing they must
have Common blessings and Curses? Will not that Quarrell holden up by
most part of the Army, be <hi>a wicked thing,</hi> an <hi>Achan in the Camp,</hi> that will
make God turn away from it and put <hi>Israel</hi> to shame?</p>
               <p>Having thus established the truth. In the next place, we come to take off what
objections are made to the Contrarie.</p>
               <p>First, it is argued from Humane Authority. The uncontroverted and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
practise of all Nations in all Generations, is, to employ all subjects
in the Case of necessary Just defence. It was the practise of our Reformers,
who took into the Congregation and received all, that upon acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their error, was willing to joyn, though they had been on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
faction. Such an universall practise of Christian Nations, though it be
not the Ground of our Faith; Yet it is apparent, that it cannot want Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it.</p>
               <p>Answer. I. This will plead as much against the exceptions added in the
answer to the Query and act of Levy; for seing other Nations except none,
in the Case of necessary Defence, why should we except any? And if once
we except any, upon good and Convincing Grounds; upon the same ground
we ought to except farr more. 2. <hi>Mr. Gillespy</hi> in his Treatise of Miscella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Questions makes mention that the City of <hi>Strasburg</hi> 1626. made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
League with <hi>Zurick, Berne,</hi> and <hi>Basil:</hi> because they were not only
Neighbours, but men of the same Religion. And the Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to take into Confederacy, these who differed from him in the Point of
<hi>the Lords supper;</hi> lest such sad things should befall him, as befell these in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
who used any means of their oun Defence. This Rule was good <hi>in Thesi</hi>
though in that case misapplyed. Now then, if they made Conscience of Choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
means of their oun defence, A Confederacy with forraigners. May not
the same Ground lead us to a Distance with our oun Countreymen as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified,
who have nothing to commend them but that they are of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
nation, which is nothing in point of Conscience. 3. The Practise of
other Nations, that are not tender in many greater points, cannot be very
Convincing. Especially when we Consider, that the Lord hath made light to
Arise in this Particular, more bright than in former times. God hath taken
occasion of Illustrating and commending many truths unto us in this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
from the darkness of error, and of making straight many Rules,
from the Crookedness of mens Practise and Walking. Is not the Lord now
performing the promise of <hi>purging out the Rebels</hi> from among us <hi>and them that
transgresse,</hi>
God hath winked at former times of Ignorance; but now the Lord
having Cleared his mind so to us, how great madness were it <hi>to forsake our oun
mercy, and despise the Counsel of God against our oun souls.</hi> As for that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of our Reformers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There could not have been any thing brought more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41269:15"/>
prejudiciall to that Cause, and more advantageous for us. After they were
twice beaten by the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Leith,</hi> and their Forces scattered, and the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Chief men of the Congregation forced to retire to <hi>Sterling.</hi> JOHN
KNOX preaching upon the eightieth Psalm, and searching the Causes of
Gods wrath against them, he condescends upon this as the Chief Cause, that
they had received into their Counsels and forces, such men as had formerly
opposed the Congregation: and sayes, God never blest them since the DU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KE
had come among them. <hi>See Knox Chron.</hi> 2. It cannot be shewed, that
ever they took in a party and faction of such men, but only some few persons;
which, though it was not altogether Justifiable, yet more excusable. But now,
the publick Resolutions hold forth a Conjunction with all the bloody mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
in the Kingdom (excepting very few) and these without profession of
Repentance in many, and without evidence of the reality of it almost in
any. 3. These persons were not such, as had once joyned with the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and relapsed, and became Enemies to it; but they turned to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion from Popery: But ours is a different Case.</p>
               <p>2. Its Argued from Scripturec Three Scripture Instances are brought to
Justify the present proceedings. First Instance is from the practise of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the book of Judges, who, when for Defection from Religion they were
brought under oppression, yet when any Governour was raised by God for
their Defence, they gathered and come all out promiscuously, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a great part of them had been in the defection; and yet it is not found,
that their Governors are reproved for this; but rather sad Curses on them
that came not out to the work. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 15, 16, 17, 23. The second instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
is from the story of the Kings, very like the first; when after Defection,
gracious Reforming Kings arose, and had to do against forraigne Invasion,
we find them not debarring any subjects, but calling them out promiscuously.
Neither is this laid to their Charge that they called out such and such Subjects,
though we may perceive by the story of the Prophets, that the greater part of the
body of the people were wicked &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We answer to these two Instances joyntly. 1. We may by the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
prove, that which is as yet uncontroverted (we know not how long.) That
we ought at no time to make Choise of Instruments, neither in case of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of the Cause and the Invasion of others, Nor yet in the time when
choise is to be had; and so, that all our former Engadgments, Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and proceedings, in the point of purging Judicatories and Armies, was
superfluous and supererogatory: Because we read not, that the reforming Kings
or Judges, when ever they had an Invasive war, and in the times that they had
greatest plenty and multitudes of people, did ever debarr any of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from that service, but called them out promiscuosly. Neither is this laid
to their Charge; though we may perceive, that the greater part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were wicked under the best Kings: Therefore we may lawfully employ
any Subjects of the Kingdom in any of our wars. And we may look upon all
indifferently, without any discerning of Persons that fear God and them that
fear him not, as in good Capacity to be entrusted, Even when otherwise
we have Choise of good Instruments. Certainly it follows by parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41269:16"/>
for if yow conclude, that from the calling forth all promiscuously, and
no reproof given for it in the Case of necessary defence; then we may conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
from the calling forth of all promiscuously, and in the Case of an Invasive
War, and no reproof Recorded, that neither, in such a Case, is it sinfull to
make no difference, and that with stronger Reason: Because, it being more
easie in such a Case to Choose instruments and no necessity pleading for it: if
it had been sinfull, the Prophets would have rather reproved it, than rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
them for using such means in a Case of necessity. 2. We may argue
after that manner, that in the Case of necessary Just Defence, there should be
no exceptions made at all of any persons: because we read not that the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
or Kings Debarred any Subjects, neither that they were rebuked for so
doing. Therefore the Instances militate as much against the exceptions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Answer to the Query, as against us; unless it be said, that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
was no such persons among that people, which were as groundlesse rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as to say that they gave all evidence of Repentance. 3. Seing the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and the Reforming Kings of Judah, were so accurrate and exact in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to the Law of God, and walking according to it in all other things;
it were more Charitable and Christian Judgment to say, that since they
are not reproved for any fault in this particular, that they were also exact to
walk according to the Rule <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. in so great a point as this. 4. Mens
Practise is often lame and Crooked: and therefore must be examined accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rule; but it were not fair dealing to accommodate the Rule
to mens practice. Seing then, we have so clear and perfect a Rule <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.
which must Judge both their practice and ours: We see not how their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
can be obtruded as a rule upon us, which it self must be examined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a Common and Generall Rule. If it be not according to that
Law, we hold it to be sinfull in it self, and so no president for us, albeit
the PROPHETS did not reprove it in express and particular terms (as
they did not reprove MAN-STEALING &amp;c.) Yet they rebuked it by
Consequence, in as farr as they rebuked the Kings for Association with wicked
Israelites, which is condemned upon grounds Common to this very Case in hand.
5. We see not any ground for such promiscuous calling forth of the people
by the Judges. <hi>Baraks</hi> business, as that of <hi>Iepthah</hi> and <hi>Gideon,</hi> were done by
no great multitudes of People, but a few Choise men. 6. As the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was heavy and Continued long; so the repentance of the people was
Solemne, and their deliverance a fruit of this. 7. Their Case and ours is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different; None of Israel or Judah, did fight against the Profession of the
true Religion, and shed the blood of their fellow-subjects who were for the
Defence of the same. <hi>Israel</hi> in the dayes of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> in the
time of the Reforming Kings, was not Divided the one half against the other,
upon opposition and Defence of the true Religion: And the better part, after
many experiences of the treachery and enmity of the most of the worst part,
Solemnly engadged to God, not to admitt them to Employment and trust, but
upon real evidence of Repentance, of which they should Judge as in the sight
of God. And last of all did ever <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Iudah</hi> in the days of their Judges and
Reforming Kings, admitt into their Armies, a party and faction of such, as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41269:16"/>
had given no reall evidence of their Abandoning their former Course; and
such a party, as had been long studying to get the Power of Armies and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories
in their oun hands for attaining their oun ends? But all these are in
our Case.</p>
               <p>The 3d Instance from scripture is from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. Which is aleadged to
be a clear practise and stamped with divine approbation: In the Case of <hi>Iabesh-Gilead</hi>
besieged by a forraigne Enemie, <hi>Saul</hi> Commands all to come forth
for defence of their brethren, under pain of a severe Civil Censure. Now,
what <hi>Saul</hi> did in this business, the spirit of God is said to act him to it, and
what the people did, was from the fear of God, making them obey the King:
And then <hi>Samuel</hi> in this acting concurrs joyntly, and makes no opposition;
and last of all, the people came forth as one man, and yet <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. 27.
many men of <hi>Belial</hi> were among them, who Malignantly opposed <hi>Sauls</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
contrare to Gods revealed will.</p>
               <p>To which we answer. 1. The stamp of divine approbation is not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to us, success doth not prove it; neither the spirit coming on <hi>Saul,</hi>
not the fear of God falling on the people, will import a divine approbation
of all was done in the manadging that War. That motion of the spirit is
no sanctifying motion; But a Common, though extraordinary, impulse of
<hi>Sauls</hi> spirit to the present work, which, doubtless was in the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
whom God raised up, fitted and sent for the destruction of many nations.
Albeit that work in his hand was iniquity. That fear of God that fell upon
the people, was but a fear of the King Imprinted by God, and it is more
peculiarly attributed to God, because the people did despise him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
him, which makes their reverence and fear to be a more extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing upon a sudden. Then, <hi>Samuel</hi> not opposing the Course in hand,
doth no more import his approbation of all was done in it, than his not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the men of <hi>Bolial</hi> doth prove, that he approved of their opposition.
2. It doth not appear, that the men of <hi>Belial</hi> were a great faction and party,
there is somthing in the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> speaks against it, It is not like, the people
would put a faction and party to death. 3. Neither doth it appear, that they
were in the Army; for that which is said, that all the people came out as one
man, doth only import, that the body and generality of them came forth;
and that it was a wonder so many came forth so suddenly, at the Command
of the King who was but mean and abject in their eyes. It is certaine that
all sensible Persons were not present, because the whole Army being num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<hi>ver</hi> 8. was but 330000. And who will say there was no moe men in
Israel, when they had 600000 such, and above, before their coming into
the Land? seing then, many have stayed at home; it is most probable that
these men of <hi>Belial</hi> would not come, seing they despised <hi>Sauls</hi> mean and
Low condition in their heart, and thought him unfitt to Lead their Armies,
till he should prove what was in him. That which is said ver 12. doth not
prove they were in the Camp; it might be conveniently spoken of absent
persons. 4. It is not certain, that these men were wicked and scandalous in
their Conversation, haters of Godlinesse and of their brethren; but that they
stood at distance only with <hi>Saul</hi> in the point of his Election; which indeed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41269:17"/>
was blame-worthy, seing God had revealed his mind in it: and therefore
they are called <hi>men of Belial,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> was called <hi>Satan,</hi> for opposing Christs
suffering.</p>
               <p>Some other Scriptures are alleaged by some, as <hi>Davids</hi> employing of
such men &amp;c. all which are cleared in <hi>Mr. Gillespies</hi> treatise of <hi>Miscellanie
Questions</hi> Quest 14.</p>
               <p>3. It is argued from reason. And. 1. That which any is oblidged to do for
anothers preservation by the Law of God and Nature, And which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ommit without the Guilt of the others destruction; that may the other
Lawfully require of him to do when hee needs it, and when it may be done
without the undoing of a greater good; But so it is, that every subject is
oblidged by the Law of Nature, Oath and Covenants, and the Law of God,
to endeavour to their Power, the preservation of the Kingdom against unjust
violence: And the safety of the Kingdome stands in need of many subjects
Assistance who were secluded: And it may be done without undoing a greater
good than is the preservation of Religion. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument hath an answer to it in the bosom of it. 1. We shortly
deny the Assumption, in Relation to the two last branches, both that the
Kingdoms preservation stands in necessity of these mens help. And that
their help tends not to the undoing of a greater good; seing there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
given to confirm these two points, wherein the nerve of the business lyes,
we referr to a Reason of our denyal of them given page, 22. Secondly, It is true
that the obligation to such a duty lyes upon all; But that obligation is to
be brought in act and exercise in an orderly and Qualifyed way, else what
needed any exceptions be in the Act of Levie? Excommunicated persons are
under the same obligation; Yet the Magistrate is not actually oblidged to
call such, but rather to seclude them. Are not all bound to come to the Sacrament
who are Church members? Yet many are not in a Capacity to come, and so ought
neither to presume to come, nor be admitted: are not all subjects oblidged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Cause of God, and to prosecute it? and yet many, because of their Enmity
to the Cause of God, are actually incapable of employment in the defence or
prosecution thereof. 3. The Law of Nature is above all humane Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
they must Cede when ever they come in opposition to it, <hi>Salus
populi</hi> is <hi>suprema Lex</hi> in relation to these: But in Relation to the Law of
God it is not so; sometimes the Law of Nature must yeeld to Positive
Commands of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> must Sacrifice his son at Gods Command.
The Law of Nature obliges us to the preservation of our selves; But it does
not oblidge to every mean that may be found expedient to that end, unless it
be supposed Lawfull and approven of God. Therefore the Lord in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word doth determine, what means we may use for that end, and what
not. But 4. we conceive that the Law forbidding Association and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
with known wicked and Ungodly persons, is included in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as well as the Law that obliges us to self-preservation; that is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on perpetuall reason, as well as this. Nature bids me preserve my self,
and Nature binds me to have one friend and foe with God. The Heathens
had a Notion of it; they observed, that <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> a wise vertuous man
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41269:17"/>
was therefore swallowed up in the Earth with seven men and seven Horses,
because he had joyned himself and associated with <hi>Tydeus, Capaneus</hi> and other
wicked Commanders marching to the seige of <hi>Thebe, Mr. Gill, Miscell. Qyest.
Chap. 14. pag.</hi> 171.</p>
               <p>2. The Second Reason is framed thus <hi>in Hypothes<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Such as are excluded are
a great part, if not the greater part, of the Remnant of the Land, if rules of
exclusion be extended impartially. Now, they having their Lives and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
allowed them, must either in these things be ensured by the interposing
of a competent Power for their Defence, or else they must have Liberty to
act for themselves. But so it is, that we cannot interpose a Competent power
for their protection. <hi>Ergo</hi> they must have liberty to act for themselves. <hi>Nam qui
dat vitam, dat necessaria ad vitam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We answer. 1. It is not certain that such as are excluded are the greater
part of the Land; However, it is certain, that though the Rule had been
kept and endeavours had been used to walk according to it, yet many whom
it excludes would have been taken in. There is a great Difference between
endeavour of Duty, and attaining its perfection. If the Rule had not been
quite destroyed, so great offence could not have been taken, though it had
not been strictly urged in all particulars. 2. We still affirm, upon evident
grounds to us, that there is a power Competent in the Land, beside the
Malignant party, which may protect the Land and ensure their lives and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
3. We are perswaded, many of that party who have been so deeply
involved in blood-guiltinesse and barbarous cruelties, should neither have lives
nor liberties secured to them: because they ought not to be permitted to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve.
But the not taking away so much Innocent blood from the Land by
acts of Justice, is the Cause that so much Innocent and pretious blood is now
shed. Our Rulers have pardoned that blood which God would not pardon:
And therefore would not pardon it to the Land, because they pardoned it to
the Murderers.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Sect. 4. That it is not Lawfull for the well affected Subjects
to concurr in such an Engadgment in war, and Associate with
the Malignant Party.</head>
               <p>SOme convinced of the unlawfulness of the publick Resolutions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
in reference to the employing of the Malignant Party; Yet do
not find such clearness and satisfaction in their oun Consciences as to
forbid the Subjects to concurr in this War, and Associate with the Army
so Constituted. Therefore it is needfull to speak something to this point. <hi>That
it is unlawfull for the Subjects to Associate and joyn in arms with that Party, as it is for the
Parliament to employ them.</hi> For these Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. The Scriptures before Cited against Associations and Confederacies with
wicked and ungodly men do prove this. The Command prohibiting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with them and Conversing &amp;c. is common both to Magistrates and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41269:18"/>
people: for the ground of it is common to both. <hi>The peoples ensnaring,
Helping of the ungodly</hi> &amp;c. It were strange Doctrine to say, that it is not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the Parliament to Associate in War with the Malignants, lest the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be ensnared: And yet it is Lawfull for the people to Associate with them
upon the Command of the Parliament, seing the ensnaring of the People,
hath a more immediate connexion with the peoples Conjunction with them,
nor with the Parliaments Resolution about it. Had it not been a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in all the people to have joyned with these men before the Parliaments
Resolution about it? How then can their Resolution interveening, loose the
people from their obligation to Gods Command? Shall it be no sin to me, because
they sin before me? Can their going before me in the transgression, exempt
me from the transgression of that same Law which obliges both them and
me? 2. The People were reproved for such Associations as well as Rulers,
though they were originated from the Rulers. The Prophets speak to the whole
body. <hi>What hast thow to doe in the way of Egypt &amp;c.? Ier. 2:</hi> 18. And <hi>Isay.
31. Wo to them that go down to Egypt. Psal. 106. They mingled themselves &amp;c.</hi>
The Lord instructed <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and in him all his oun people, all the Children
whom God had given him, saying, <hi>Say not ye, A Confederacie, to all them to
whom this people shall say, A Confederacy; Isay.</hi> 8: 12. When all the people was
going on in such a mean of Self-defence, the Lord instructed him and the
Disciples among whom the testimony was sealed, that they should not walk
in the way of this people. When <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> was reproved for helping the
ungodly, was not all his people reproved that went with him? They were
the helpers of the ungodly as well as he. If <hi>Amaziah</hi> had refused to dismiss
the Army of <hi>Israel</hi> whom God was not with, Doubtless it had been the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
duty to testifie against it, and refuse to concurr and act in such a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>3. If the Association and Conjunction with Malignants, be only the sin of
the Parliament, and not the sin of the people, who doe upon their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Associate with them: Then we cannot see how people can be guilty of
Association with Malignants at any time and in any Case. To Joyn with
them in an ill Cause is not Lawfull indeed: But neither may we joyn with
good men in an evil Cause. Suppose then the Cause be good and necessarie (as
no war is Just if it be not necessary) in what case or Circumstances shall
Association with them be unlawfull for the people? If it be said, in Case the
Magistrate Command it not; we think that strange Divinitie, that the solo
Command of the Magistrate should make that our duty, which in absence
of his Command is our sin; And that not because of the absence of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
but from other perpetuall grounds. Certainly, whenever Association
with them is a sin, it is not that which makes it a sin because the Mastistrate
Commands it not, but because God forbids it. And it is as strange, that the
unlawfull and sinfull Resolution of Parliament should make that lawfull to me
which otherwise had been lawfull. It is known that Humane Laws oblidge
not, but as they have Connexion with Gods Word. Now if that Law, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
a Confluence of all Subjects for the defence of the Kingdom, be
contrare to the Word, in as far as it holds out a Conjunction with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41269:18"/>
and bloodie men, how can it be lawfull to me, in obedience to that
ordinance, to Associate with these men? If it be said to be lawfull in the Case
of necessity, that same necessity is as strong a plea for the Magistrates em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
them, as for the peoples joyning with them: and if it doe not justifie
that, it cannot excuse this. If the Lawfullness of the MEAN must be
measured by the justice and necessity of the END: then certainly any mean
shall be lawfull in the Case of just and necessary defence; then we may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
Irish Cut-throats; then we may go to the Devil for help, if expediency
to compass such a necessar and just <hi>End</hi> be the Rule of the Lawfullness of the
<hi>Mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The whole Land is bound by the Covenant and Solemne Engadgment
not to Associate with the Malignant party: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is sinfull for the people
to joyn with them as for the Magistrate to employ them. Are we not all
bound by Covenant, to endeavour to bring Malignants to Condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to look on them as enemies? And is not Conjunction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
with them on the peoples part, as inconsistent in its oun Nature
with that Duty, as the Magistrats employing them is inconsistent with his
Convenanted duty? When all the people did Solemnly engadge themselves
not to joyn any more with the People of these Abominations, was the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, we shall not joyn untill our Rulers joyn first; Or, we shall not
joyn with them in an ill Cause? No indeed, but we shall not employ them in a
good Cause, or joyn with any party of them in it. If that Engadgment be
upon every one in their station, let us consider what every mans station in the
work is. The Rulers station and Calling is to choose Instruments, and levie
Forces for the Defence thereof. The Subjects station and Calling is, to
concurr in that work, by rising in Defence of the Cause and Kingdome.
Now what did the Subject then engadge unto? Certainly, unlesse we mock
God, we must say, that as the Magistrate engadged not to employ that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Generation in a good Cause, so the Subject engadged not to joyn
with any such party even in a good Cause. If this be not the meaning of
our ENGADGMENTS and VOWS, We see not how the Subjects is
in Capacity to break them, as to that precise point of Association.</p>
               <p>In Sum, All the Reasons that are brought to prove the unlawfullness of
the publick Resolutions, may with a litle Variation be proportionably applyed
to this present Question. Therefore we add no more but a Word to ane obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or two.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. A necessary Duty, such as Self-Preservation is, cannot be my
sin. But it is the Subjects necessary Duty to rise in Defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<hi>Ergo.</hi> Answer. A necessary Duty cannot be a sin in it self, but it
may be a sin in regard of some Circumstances, in which it ceases to be
a necessary Duty. It is a necessar duty to defend the Kingdome: But it
is neither a Duty nor necessary to do it in such a Conjunction and fellowship,
but rather a sin. If I cannot preserve my self, but by ane unlawfull mean, then
Self-preservation in such Circumstances, is not my Dutie.</p>
               <p>Object. 2d. JONATHAN did assist <hi>Saul</hi> in a war against the <hi>Philistines</hi>
invading the Land, and no doubt many Godly joyned and died in battel.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41269:19"/>
Now this is commended in Scripture, as may be seen in <hi>Davids</hi> funeral u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them; although it was known that <hi>Saul</hi> was ane hater of Gods people and
a perfecuter, and that God had a Controversie with him, and that these
3000 that assisted him against <hi>David</hi> were also ungodly and wicked men.
Answer. 1. These Scriptures speak nothing to commend that Particular act
of <hi>Ionathans</hi> Conjunction in war with his Father. <hi>David</hi> in his <hi>Epitaph</hi> speaks
much to the Commendation of both <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> as of excellent
Warriours; and of <hi>Ionathan</hi> as a kind and Constant friend to him: but there
is nothing touched of that point. If that place be pressed, it will follow with
much more evidence, that <hi>Saul</hi> was as good a man as <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and that the
People of God had great loss inhis death. But none of these must be pressed ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
from a speech wherin he vents his affection and grief. 2. Suppose
the naturall bond of <hi>Ionathan</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> his Father, and the Civil bonds of the
people to <hi>Saul</hi> their King, did oblidge them to joyn with him against the
Common Enemy; Yet we think they ought not to have Associated with the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
persecuting Servants and the 3000. that pursued <hi>David;</hi> But they ought
to have pleaded for a purging of the Army. 3. It is not Probable that there
was many Godly persons imployed in that Army. <hi>David</hi> complains of that
time <hi>Psal. 12. That the Godly man ceased, and the faithfull from among the Children
of men: and that the wicked walked round about when the Vilest men were Exalted.</hi>
4. Many of the Laws of God have not been much taken notice of, even by
Godly men, untill the Lord hath taken occasion to reprove them particularly
and so to mind them of their Duty. It is like the Rule <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. hath not been
Considered till the time of <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> and <hi>Amaziah</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Here are the Practises and designs of wicked men expressed in their oun na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but certainly they would colour them over with fair pretences; their
purpose is to undo men, especially Godly men that <hi>Classed</hi> and purged them.
Yea it is the profession of many, and they scarce <hi>ly privily,</hi> or have so much
wisdome as to conceal their designes till their fit opportunity: but before the
power be confirmed in their hand, they breath out Cruelty against all the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in the Land, and promise themselves great gain by it, and are already
dividing their Estates among them, saying, we shall find <hi>all precious substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
ver</hi> 13. But my Son, if thow fear God, though they entice thee with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
arguments of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Countrey Priviledges,</hi> yet Consent
not. Venture not thy stock in one Vessel with them, Cast not in thy Lot
among them. <hi>Walk not in the way with them, Refrain thy foot from their path:</hi>
for they are not come to the height of iniquitie, they are running on to it:
And if thow Joyn, thow wilt cast thy self in a miserable snare: for either
thow must go on with them to their Designed and professed evils, or be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to their Cruelty.</p>

Knowledge is pleasant to thy soul. 11. Discretion shall preserve thee, Understanding shall
keep thee. 12. To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
froward things. 13. Who leave the Paths of uprightnesse to walk in the ways
of darknesse. &amp;c.</hi> If thow take the WORD of GOD for a lamp to thy
feet, and it enter into thy Soul, and be received in love and affection: it will
certainly keep thee from the Evil mans way, who have already left the
Righteous paths to walk in the ways of darknesse, who rejoyce in nothing
so much as in the sorrows and miseries of the Godly, and delight in one anothers
wickedness. And it will keep thee Chast to thy husband CHRIST JESUS,
and preserve thee from Committing fornications with <hi>Egypt</hi> as <hi>Aholah</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holibah,</hi>
and joyning so nearly with the degenerated seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who
are but as <hi>strangers:</hi> for come near their house and Paths, and they will lead
thee to Destruction with them, or make thee a more miserable life. But these
that go to them return not again quickly; they are like fallen starrs, shall
they ever be set in the Firmament again? Its safest to walk with good and
righteous men: for Gods blessing and promise is on them. His Curse and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is on the wicked: therefore thow may fear wrath on that accompt, if thow
joyn with them.</p>
               <p>Chap. 4. ver 14. to 20. <hi>Enter not into the Path of the Wicked, and go not in
the way of evil men. 15. Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
16. For they sleep not except they have done mischief: and their sleep is taken away
except they cause some to fall. 17. For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink
the wine of violence. 18. But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

and they know not at what they stumble.</hi> It was said Chap. 3: 23. that the man
<hi>who keeps wisdom and the fear of God in his heart, should walk in the way and not
stumble.</hi> That safty hath ease in it here, their steps are not strained, as
when a man walks in steep and hazardous places, which cannot Choose but
it will be, if a man enter into the path of wicked men, he must either go
along in their way with them, and then its broad indeed; or, if he think
to keep a good Conscience in it, he will be pinched and straitned: therefore
its freest for the mind and Conscience for to avoid and pass by that way:
<hi>for they sleep not &amp;c.</hi> they will never be satisfied till they have done a mischief,
they will live upon the ruines of the poor Countrey, And how will thow
joyn in that? Or how can thow eschew it if thow walk with them? If it
were no more, its a suspected by-path, that thow never travelled into. O
pass by it; or, if thow be entered, turn out of it. If thow wilt enter upon
the Apprehension of some light and duty in it, know that its but evening,
Sun is setting, and thow wilt be benighted ere it be long: and thow shalt stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

eschew and pass by. Then from ver 25. to the end. <hi>Keep thy heart with all
diligence: for out of it are the issues of life &amp;c.</hi> Except thow keep thy heart

in, that thow run to no extremity either to one party or other. That thow
walk in the middle way between Profanity and Error, thow held these ways
hitherto for extreams, Ponder I beseech thee then, before thow walk in any
of them; see whether they be really come to thee, or thow to them. Mark who

are Consumed. 12. And say how have I hated instruction, and my heart despised
reproof? 13. And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor enclined mine ear

               <p>Chap. 6: 16, 17, 18, 24, 25. <hi>These six things doth the Lord hate, yea seven are

flattery of the tongue of a strange Woman. 25. Lust not after her beauty in thine
heart; neither let her take thee with her eye-lids.</hi> Descrives both our Enemies,
the <hi>Malignant</hi> Party and the <hi>Sectarian.</hi> Pride, Violence, Cruelty, Lying, is
the very Character of the one. Flattery, beauty of pretended Religion, and
false witnessing and Charging of the Lords people, and seeking to sow discord
among these that were one in heart and work, is the Character of the other,
Now keep thee from both these Abominations: and do not think, its in thy
power not to be infected with the Contagion of their fellowship. <hi>Can a man
take fire in his bosom and his Cloaths not be burnt? Can one go on hot Coals and not
burn his feet?</hi> So whoever Associates and goes in friendly to either of them <hi>shall

               <p>Chap. 7: 14. &amp;c. <hi>I have peace offerings with me, this day have I payed my Vows,</hi>
They pretend Religion on both sides. And our Church sayes, The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
have satisfied them, and repented, Even like the <hi>peace offerings</hi> and
<hi>Vows</hi> of the whore. She began with her devotion, that she might with more
liberty sin more, and have that pretence to cover it; and by means of her
offerings, she got a feast of the flesh. Even as they by profession of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are Admitted to Trust; and by offering for the like sin, a new sin is
Covered, and Vows undertaken never to be kept. Therefore take heed of
these snares: <hi>For she hath cast down many strong ver</hi> 26. Many tall Cedar hath

Chap. 10. Shews us the very different estate of the Godly and wicked, both
in regard of light and knowledge concerning Duty, and of blessings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.
vers 6. <hi>Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence Covereth the
mouth of the wicked. 9. He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely: but he that
perverteth his ways, shall be known. vers II.</hi> The <hi>mouth of a Righteous man is
a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. ver 20. The tongue of
of the Iust is as Choise silver: the heart of the wicked is litle worth. ver 23. It is
as a sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom &amp;c.</hi>
ver 24, 25, 28, 31, 32. Which shew us, That if the Lords mind be revealed
to any concerning the present Courses, it must be to his poor people that wait
on him, and not to all the wicked and ungodly in the Land, who almost
only are satisfied and clear in the Course, who yet before were never satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
And beside, though the Lord be Chastising his people, yet one may
Ioyn with them without fear of wrath and Indignation on that accompt, and
with hope of Partaking of their blessings, when he cannot and dare not joyn
with a wicked party pursued with wrath and Indignation in the same dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Which may be more clear from Cap. 11. ver 3, 5, 8. <hi>The Integrity
of the Upright shall guide them: but the perversness of Transgressors shall destroy them.
ver 5. The Righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall
fall by his own wickednesse. 8. The Righteous is delivered out of trouble and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
cometh in his stead.</hi> And ver 10, and 11. Shews the different Condition of
People under wicked Rulers and Godly. All the wicked now rejoyce, None
shouts but they, they think their day is come, the Godly generally hang their
head and are discountenanced. Even as <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. The 21. and 31 ver. shews
that when Godly men are Chastifed and punished in the Earth for their sins,
much more wicked, especially when the Godly were Chastised for partaking
with them, according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4: 17, 18. <hi>Isay. 10:</hi> 12. and 49: 12.</p>
               <p>Chap. 12: ver 13. <hi>They are snared by the transgression of their lips,</hi> their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar
Common speeches they drop out with, declare them and make their Cause
more hatefull than other pretences its covered with would permitt. Yea they
speak like the piercings of a sword against the Godly ver 11. If our State
and Church had a LIP OF TRUTH, they would speak alwise the same
thing, they would not carry in their talk and writings, as now every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
understanding perceives. We may find their writings made up of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions:
<hi>For a lying tongue is but for a moment</hi> ver 19. Its but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
indeed before the Judicatory, and then out of doors it contradicts it
self, as in the mock Repentances. But sorrow and anguish will come to the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
who before they would speak of terms of peace with one Enemy, would
Associate in war with another. <hi>But to the Counsellors of peace is joy.</hi> ver 20.
The present Course Contradicts this 26. ver. <hi>The Righteous is more excellent
than his Neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.</hi> They think these
Malignants better than the West-Coutrey forces; they would condescend to any
terms to get their help, though it were to ranverse the <hi>Act of Classes,</hi> to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
them Indemnity; yea not so much as to Condemne their way: but they
will not so much as clear the State of the Quarell, or choose a better Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for all their help. <hi>Their way seems good in their ouneyes</hi> ver 15. But it were wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

Chap. 13. 10. <hi>Onely by pride cometh Contention: But with the well advised is
wisdom.</hi> There is nothing keepeth up our Contention and Wars but Pride;
No party will condescend to another. We will not say, we have done
wrong in bringing in the King, they will not say they have done wrong in
invading: But it were wisdom to fall lower and quite these Interests. ver
16. <hi>Everie Prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly.</hi>
A wise man would count before the Warr, if he can accomplish it: and if
he cannot, then he would send <hi>Messengers of peace,</hi> and Cede in all things he
may without sin. If it be but more honour and wealth to our King, Should
we destroy the Kingdom to purchase that? Our rash and abrupt proceedings

               <p>Chap. 14. He that is accustomed to speak truth in private, will in his
common speech be a faithfull witness in publick: But a man accustomed to
Lying, Dissembling, Swearing in private, will not stick to forswear himself,
to make professions and vowes contrare to his mind in publick, ver 5. (which
is also Chap 12. 17. and 6. 19.) Such men seek wisdom and make a shew of
Religion, but find it not; whereas its easy to Godly men to find it, to find
Repentance and salvation, ver. 6. Go away from foolish men and break off socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with ungodly men, be not privy to their Counsels; Use them not as speciall
friends, when thow perceives that all means are used in vain to reclaime them
from their Damnable way and principles, ver 7. The knowledge a Godly
man hath, it serves to direct his way, and is given of God for it: But all
the wit and skill of such wicked men is Deceit, they themselves are begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by it in opinion and practise and hope. And they also beguile others,
ver 8. Sin makes fools aggree: But among the Righteous, that which is
good makes aggreement (in the old translation) ver 9. Its only evil will
unite all the wicked in the Land as one man: for its <hi>a sport to them to do
mischief (Chap 10. 23.)</hi> Albeit our way <hi>seem right in our eyes;</hi> Yet because
its a backslyding way, and departing from unquestionably right Rules, <hi>the

Chap 1. 31. <hi>The simple believeth every word</hi> giveth credit to every vain word
that is spoken. <hi>But a prudent man looketh well to</hi> mens <hi>goings,</hi> Ponders and
examines whether their professions and practises agree; What weight is in
their words, by the Inspection of their deeds, and of their ordinar speaking;
and does not account a Coined word before a Judicatory sufficient to testify
Repentance: and as he gives not present credit to their professions, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
so often proven treacherous; so he himself skarrs at <hi>every appearance of evil,</hi>
and keeps himself from it; Whereas <hi>foolish souls rage and are confident,</hi> think
any thing Lawfull if they can have any pretence for it, or use of it ver 15.
16. Then, what a great difference is between wicked men and Godly men,
both in their Lot, when God is Correcting both? And in their disposition,
wisdom that rests in the ones heart, is Manifested; Wickedness in the
others heart appears also. In the midst of such men there is no other thing

Chap 15. 8. <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord: but
the Prayer of the upright is his delight,</hi> Expresses how provocking a thing the
outward professions and sacrifices of wicked men, continuing in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
what ane Abomination that Commonly called PUBLICK REPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANCE,
or ECCLESIASTICALL HOLINESS is, when men
are visibly unholy and ungodly in their Conversation: And therefore he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
alwayes with that people, that his soul abhorred their externall Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<hi>because of the Uncleanness of their hands.</hi> He pleaded that he never Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, though indeed he did command them; Yet those were aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and departings from the expresse Rule and Command, to accept or
be pleased with these sacrifices and Ceremonies, when there was no eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of Real Repentance. To this purpose are <hi>Chap 21. 4. 27. Isay</hi> 1. 11. and
66. 3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 20. and 7. 22. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 22. All which shew that its but a
mocking of the Lord, and perverting of his Law, and profaning of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
to accept the profession of Repentance in those who walk contrary
thereto, and to count them Ecclesiastically Holy enough, who say, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
though a thousand actions witness the Contrary. Of such the Lord
says, <hi>what hast thow to do to take my Covenant in thy mouth; seing thow hates to be
reformed? Psal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. They have no right to it, they should not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to it: for its a taking the Lords Name in vain. The 16 verse tells us
That it had been better to possess our oun Land in quietness, than to venture
what we have for the uncertain Conquest of <hi>England,</hi> and Restitution of the
King, Parallel with <hi>Eccl</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>Chap. 16: 7. <hi>When a mans ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies
to be at peace with him.</hi> Can our STATES way then <hi>please the Lord,</hi> seing
they cannot find the way of Peace? They will not walk in it; and seeing
they make the Godly in the Land to fall out with them, and none to be at
peace but the wicked, who may thereby get opportunitie to crush the Godly.
ver 17. <hi>The High-way of the upright is to depart from evil.</hi> This is the high
way only to depart from evil, not Carnal policies, nor advantages. He
thinks the stepping aside to any of these is not the high way. Can then,
men change their way, and go cross to it, and keep the right way
in both? No, the Godly have this high way and keeps it. Chap. 17.
ver 11. <hi>An evil man seeketh only Rebellion: therefore a Cruel messenger shall be sent
against him.</hi> Evil men seek only Rebellion, and delights in no other thing:
But the KING of KINGS shall send a Cruel messenger, he arms men
with wrath and power against them. ver 13. Speaketh sadly to the <hi>English</hi> and
to our State, that rewarded the <hi>West Countrey</hi> evil for good, ver 14. and 19.
Tells us how we should advice before we begin a war, and leave no mean of
composing Difference and strife unassayed; we did more in it than the <hi>English:</hi>
but not all we might have done. ver 15. with Chap. 18: 5. Its a dreadfull
sentence against the publick Judicatories, that in all their Resolutions, Papers
and Practises, <hi>Iustifie the wicked and ungodly</hi> as honest faithfull men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
all approven Faithfull men, that cannot go along in such Courses, or
were earnest to have them Repent, as both Malignants and Sectaries. Doe
they not pronounce all Malignants friends, and absolve them from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41269:22"/>
and Classes they stand under? And do they not put the Godly in their
place? They relax the punishment of the one, and imputes transgression to
the other; and so brings them under a Law. See <hi>Exod 23: 7. Prov. 24: 24. Isay. 5:</hi> 23. and the 26. verse of this Chapter. Its not good to punish Godly
men, who have given constant proof of their Integrity, for abstaining from such
a Course, at least having so much appearance of evil, that many distinctions
will never make the multitude to believe, that we are walking according
to former principles: because their sense observes the quite contrarie practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Chap. 18: ver 2. (<hi>A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart
may Discover it self.</hi>) Shews, that if the present Cause and Course were of God,
and tended so much to his Glory, fools or wicked men would have no such
delight in it: for they delight in nothing but what; is agreeable to their humour,
to discover themselves &amp;c. <hi>Vers</hi> 3, gives the true reason, why our publick judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carories
and Armies are so base and contemptible; why contempt and shame
is powred on them; because, <hi>when the wicked comes, then also comes contempt,
and with the vile man, Reproach. vers 13. He that answereth a Cause before he hear
it, it is folly and shame unto him.</hi> Many pass peremptory sentence upon the
honest party in the <hi>West,</hi> before they hear all parties, and be throughly informed,
and <hi>this is a folly and shame to them.</hi> They hear the State and Church and what
they can say for their way; and indeed they seem just, because they are first
in with their Cause with them, and they will not hear another; but he that
comes after will make Inquiry, and discover these fallacies. <hi>Vers 24. There
is a friend that sticketh eloser than a brother.</hi> A godly neighbour, not so near in
naturall bonds to us, that is a surer friend than many brethren in the flesh.
These bonds of Countrey and Kinred, should all Cede to Gods Interest. See
<hi>Chap.</hi> 17: 17.</p>
               <p>Chap. 19: 22. <hi>A mans desire is his Kindness: and a poor man is better than
a lyar.</hi> The Godly, that cannot Concurt in the publick Cause being disabled
through an invincible impediment of sin lying in the way and means made use
of, are better friends, and have more real good-will to the stablishment and
peace of the Land, than any ungodly man, let him be never so forward in
the present Course. <hi>Vers</hi> 10, Pleasure and its attendants, are not comely for

21: 11. Ring-leaders of wickednesse, Refractory and Incorrigible persons
should have been made examples to others, and this would have prevented

               <p>Chap. 20: 6. and Chap. 21: 2. and Chap. 16: 2. <hi>Most men will proclaim

that Malignants say they Repent; and the State and Church say they
keep the same principles: for who will say any evil of himself? vers 8. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates

to them, looking down on them, How then do our Rulers gather them. <hi>Vers</hi> 3.
Shews, that war and strife should not be kept up but in extream necessity,
<hi>fools will be meddling. Vers</hi> 11, Shews that the best way of Judging of men
is by their Doings and fruits, not strained words and confessions. But these
who upon a bare profession, pronounce a Notour Malignant a friend; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no proof of their integrity; and will not have any judged such, but such
as judicially are debarred; yet they, contrary to all the testimony of works
and fruits, Judge and condemn honest men as Traitors, though not Judicially
convicted. Certainly <hi>Diverse measures are an Abomination to the Lord</hi> As in
<hi>vers</hi> 10. Then vers 25, Sacriledge is described, and Covered perjury, which

a cloak of them to bring in wicked men, contrare to the very nature

               </p>
               <p>In Chap. 21: 10. (<hi>The soul of the wicked desireth evil, his neighbour findeth
no favour in his eyes.</hi>) The wickeds principles can carry no where but to evil;
and to do evil to Good men. vers 8. His way and life is full of horrible and
tragicall chances: But a good mans work is easie and pleasant, directs to a
good and peaceable end <hi>Isay. 26:</hi> 7. In <hi>vers</hi> 12. A Righteous man should
have his witt about him, to consider ungodly houses and families, and persons.
that God hath visible controversies with, that he may not communicate with
them in their Judgments. <hi>vers</hi> 16. It is a sad wandring out of the way, when
a man leaves the Congregation of the Living to abide among the dead.
Dead in sins and appointed to Death. Its a great Judgment as well as sin.
Vers 27. with the 4. and places before cited, shew how Abominable the
externall professions and pretences of wicked men are, when contradicted by
their practise; especially if they doe it but out of a wicked mind, when they
Intend to effect some mischief, under the Colour of Repentance and being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to the Church. As <hi>Absaloms</hi> Vow at <hi>Hebron;</hi> as <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Balak</hi> and
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who under pretence of long prayers devoured widows houses; as
<hi>Iezebels</hi> fast; and as the people <hi>Isay.</hi> 58: 4. Who fasted <hi>for strife and debate, and to stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
with the fist of wickednesse.</hi> All men knows that the Church is the Ladder to step
up upon to go to preferment, and Repentance the door to enter to places of Trust.
Chap. 22: 3. (<hi>A prudent man forseeth the evil and hideth himself: but the
simple pass on and are punished.</hi>) He is a wise man that knows the Judgment
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41269:23"/>
of the Lord, and as the <hi>stork</hi> and <hi>swallow</hi> the time of his coming, that in
the Consideration of sins and threatnings, and comparing things spirituall
with spirituall, apprehendeth Judgment coming on such a Course and such a
party, and hydes himself, goes aside, retires to a Covert, by avoyding these
evils, and the least fellowship with them that bring it on, and eschewing such
a Society as hath the Cloud hanging directly above their head: but simple
Idiots and blind worldings go on head-long, and dread nothing and are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
vers 5. Most Grievous plagues and Punishments, and all manner
of unhappiness encumbreth their wicked life: Therefore he that would keep
himself pure and clean, 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5: 18. and save his oun soul, shall be far from

Thow shalt have more peace, and be more free from sin and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
But sound hearted upright men, who deal faithfully, not to please but to
profit; yow should choose these to entrust and rely upon; those should be
the friends of Kings. <hi>Vers</hi> 14, As a Harlots allurements are like pits to catch
men, so the Allurements of wicked ungodly men their Power, Policy &amp;c.
and their fair speeches and flatteries, is a deep ditch to catch men into this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
whoredome and fornication spoken of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. And he whom God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
with, by former wickedness, falls into it <hi>Eccl. 7: 26. vers 24, 25. (Make not
friendship with an angry man: and with a furious man thow shall not go &amp;c.)</hi>
And is not Association in Arms with such, as friends against one Enemie, a
making friendship with them we are sworn to hold as Enemies? If we may
not converse with a furious passionate man, how then with men of blood, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
whose inveterate malice hath now occasion to vent against all the
Godly? For thow wilt learn his wayes, as we have always seen it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
and thow wilt get a snare to thy soul: If thow go not in his ways yow
cannot aggree, yow will fall out and quarrell; and that is a snare to thee. <hi>Vers
28, Remove not the ancient land-mark which thy Fathers have set.</hi> If it be so
dreadfull and accursed to remove our Neighbours marks and bounds. O how
much more to change and alter Gods land mark, his Privileges, Oaths and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants

diligently what men ARE, not what they PRETEND and <hi>seem</hi> to be.
for as they <hi>think</hi> so are they, not as they <hi>pretend</hi> with their tongue and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
but as they think in their heart, which is better evidenced by their
Common 'and habituall speaking and walking, than any deliberate and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

not we sell the truth and Cause and all into the hands of the Enemies of all?
Whereas we ought to Ransom the Kingdoms libertie and Religions Interest,
with the loss of all extrinsick Interest that does but concern the accession of ones
honour; yet we sell, endanger and venture all for that.</p>
               <p>Chap. 24: 1. <hi>(Be not thow envyous against evil men neither desire thow to
be with them.</hi> Godly mens hearts are often tickled to be acquainted with, in
league and friendship with wicked men, when they have power: that they
may not be hurt by them; but seing there is no Society between light and
darknesse, let not the Godly desire to be with them, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 23: 17. But
rather to be in Gods fear alwayes, that is good Company. The Reason is
<hi>Vers</hi> 2. Their heart studies the destruction of the Godly, why then should
thow walk with thine Enemy? And you shall hear nothing but mischief in
their Lips. vers 12. Its not according to mens words but works they should
be judged, and why do not we follow that Rule in our Judging? Do we
mock God as one mocks another? <hi>Iob 34: 11. Psal. 62: 12, Ier, 32: 19. Rom.
2: 6. Vers</hi> 21. &amp;c. Men given to Change, false deceitfull men, meddle not
with such if thow either fear God or respect man; for such will be sure to no
Interest but their oun. Their calamity shall come suddenly: therefore have
nothing to doe with them: for who knows the Ruine of them both, of
them and all other wicked men, or of both them and the King if wicked.
Also to the wise and Godly this belongs, Its not good to have Respect of
Persons in Judgment, whither he be King or Noblman. A Righteous State
<hi>respects not the Person of the Prince and mighty</hi> saith <hi>Iob.</hi> But he that says to the
Righteous, you are wicked Sectaries, and also Malignants, because ye will not
approve all their Resolutions; and to the wicked, thow art Righteous, to
the Malignants, yow are the honest men; the blessed of the Lord, who did
ever to this day fall under Meroz Curse, Should the people approve him?
No Certainly, him shall they Curse, and the Nations abhor him or them: But
a blessing on them that would reprove our sins and search them out. <hi>Vers</hi> 29.
The Malignant party are even speaking so, As the Classers and purgers did
to us, even so will we doe to them. But God will render them according to
their work.</p>
               <p>Chap. 25. 2. <hi>(It is the honour of Kings to search out a matter.)</hi> Its a Kings
glory and Judges glory to search our a matter, to try dissemblers before they
trust them; Gods glory is to Pardon, Mans glory is to Administer Justice
Impartially. ver 4, 5. shews, what need there is of purging places of trust,
especially about the King. Dross cannot be melted, take what pains yow
will, it will not convert into a vessel and become usefull. This mixed in, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs
all Equity, Justice and Piety where it is. The Ruler should be the
Refiner to purge away this drosse, and the Army or Judicatory or Kingdome
is a vessell. You shall never get a fined vessel for use and service, till yow purge
away the drosse <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 4. Then <hi>Vers</hi> 8. we should follow peace with all
men as much as is possible, never to begin strife or draw the Sluse of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But if we be wronged, we should not for all that goe out hastily to

strife, till 1. the Justice and Equity of the Cause appear. 2. that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wherabout we contend be of great moment, a ground to found a Warr
upon. 3. that we first use all means of peace and aggreement possible. 4.
that we overmatch not our selves with these who are too strong for us, See Chap.
17. 14. Lest thow be brought to that extremity that thow know not what
to doe. Thus Christ adviseth <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 31. I am perswaded this would plead
much in Reason to yeeld security to <hi>England,</hi> so be it our wrong were repaired
and no more done, Verse 19 shews, what the employment of unfaithfull men,
who mean nothing less than they pretend, is, they fail when most is expected,
and hurts beside, as Jobs friends Chap. 6. 15. And <hi>Verse</hi> 26, A Righteous and
upright man, consenting with a wicked man in sin; or, through fear of him,
not daring to do his duty, turning to him and his way, or dallying and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
him in his Iniquity, <hi>is like a troubled fountain,</hi> is not good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Edification nor Correction, having troubled the purity of his soul
through the mudd of Carnall respects and Interests: Corruption within is
the mire, the wickeds seducements are like the beasts trampling it with his
foot; And he is like a corrupt, infected and poisoned fountain, more ready
to infect and draw others by his example. <hi>Verse</hi> 27, A man should not seek
Honour and preferrment, thats base and shamefull. None of the trees lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

               <p>Chap 26. 1. <hi>(As snow in summer and as rain in harvest; so honour is not seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Promotions and Trust to wicked men, as snow and much rain in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest;
a Reproach and punishment more becomes him, than honour the reward
of Goodness (as ver 3) a whip, rod and bridle for him, to restrain him from
wrong and provoke him to goodnesse ver 6. He that commits an errand or
business and entrusts a wicked man with it, is as unwise in so doing as if
he did cut off the Messengers feet he sent; he deprives himself of the means
to compass it; He sends a lame man to run ane errand; He is punished
by himself as if he had cut off his oun feet, and procureth sorrow and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
to himself, as if he were compelled to drink nothing but what is
contrare to his stomack. ver 7. All good speeches halt and limp in evil
mens mouths; For there is no constancy in their mouths: Within they are
very rottennesse. <hi>Out of the same mouth comes blessing and Cursing. I am</hi> 3. 10.
their very words aggree not; The publick and extraordinary Crosses the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
&amp; ordinary, and their actions have less harmony with their words. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
they know God, in works they deny him &amp;c.</hi> Ver 8, To give a mad man a
weapon, what els is it but to murder? To bring shot to an ordinance which
may do much mischief to himself and others, is to be accessory to that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
So to give honour to a fool, he hath given power to them, and put
them in a Capacity to do evil, and set them on work again to perfect their
designes against good men. <hi>Verse</hi> 9, As a drunken man, put a thorn in his
hand, he can make no use of it, but to hurt himself and others; so wicked
mens good speeches and fair professions, commonly tend to some mischief,
these but cover their evil designes: and yet the Covering is shorter than
that it can hide them. <hi>Verse</hi> 10, wicked Rulers (look the margent) grieve
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41269:25"/>
and molest the subjects; and the means to effect this is, to employ the fool and
transgressor, to give Offices and Countenance to evil men, which may be
Instruments of their Lust, so <hi>Abimelech Iudg</hi> 9. 4. so <hi>Iezebel, 1 Kings</hi> 21. 10.
so in <hi>Neh. 8. 15. Vers</hi> 11, The dog feeling his stomack surcharged, goes to
the Grass, as our Malignants to profess Repentance, and casts up that which
troubles him by a fained Confession: But because there is noe change in his
Nature, He is inwardly stirred by his old principles to lick up that vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
to Committ and practise what he professed Repentance for, yea and to
profess the same he pretended sorrow for: When Power is confirmed in
their hand they will return to their folly. <hi>Vers</hi> 17, What els is our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
our selves in the Kings Quarrell concerning <hi>England,</hi> though we have
Interest in it to endeavour it in a peacable way, if he were fit for it; Yet in
comparison of our Kingdom and Religions fafety, which may be ruined by
Warr, Its no such matter as belongeth to us: And so it falls out, we are
like a man taking a Dog by the ears to hold him; We have raised up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Enemies, and provocked them to byte us: We cannot hold them long
from destroying him: And we provoke them more by holding them, in
espousing his Quarrell, As <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> joyning with <hi>Ahab,</hi> We had done
well to interpose our selves between the King and them to make peace, but
to side to one party was not well done. Ver 18, 19. furious and bloody
men take all opportunities to hurt others, especially good men: and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
these imployed: But they do it under a pretence, as a scorner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth
under a pretence of sport; so they, under other pretences, of
wrongs done, of the Countreys defence &amp;c. Ver 20, 24, Shews the way
to prevent trouble and keep peace. As a contentious turbulent person, would
enflame a whole Countrey and put them by the ears; so a person, though
not contentious in his oun Nature, yet having many contentious Interests
following him, which he will not quite or committ to Gods providence, as our
King was, O it is the destruction of a Nation to have such a person among
them: He hath broken the peace of two Kingdoms. <hi>Verse.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26.
Burning Lips, Hot and great words of Love and friendship, and a wicked
heart, Revenging its enmitie, and minding nothing less than what is spoken,
is Like a potsneard, a drossie piece covered over with the fairding of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy;
Or like a sepulchre garnished and painted, he dissembles and speaks
vanity and flatters <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 3. But he laves up his wicked purposes close
within him till a time of venting them: Therefore when he speaks so fair
and Courteously, be not confident of him, trust him not too farr till thow
have proof of his Reality. Put not thy self and thy dearest Interests into his
mercy. This is wisdom and not want of charity <hi>Ier. 12. 6. Micah. 7. 5.
Cain, Ioab, Iudas,</hi> are proof of this. It may be covered a time, but not
long. <hi>Naturam expellas furcâ licet usque recurrat.</hi> All the World shall be
witnesse of it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 125. So then <hi>vers</hi> 21. The Calumniator and false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
who openly professes his hatred and malice, and the flatterer that
seems to be moved with love, both of them produce one effect, <hi>viz</hi> Ruine and
Calamitie.</p>
               <p>Chap 27. 3, 4. <hi>(A stone is heavy and the sand weighty: But a fools wrath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41269:25"/>
is heavyer than them both &amp;c.</hi> We see what we may expect of the enraged,
exasperated Malignant Party, their wrath against all the Godly, for their
faithfull secluding and purging them out of places of trust, is weighty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
like the sand of the sea; It will crush them under it if God sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
not. Its like a swelling River or a High spring-tyde, it goes over all
banks, since the State and Church have drawn the sluce and letten it out.
But when it is joyned with Envy and Malice against Godliness and Piety it
self, who can stand before that? No means can quench that heat. <hi>Verse</hi> 6,
faithfull mens Reproofs, Remonstrances and Warnings, applyed in Love and
Compassion, are better than an Enemies Kisses and flatteries, than his oyls
and oyntments is: Therefore we would Pray against the one, and for the
other; that God would smite us with the mouth of the Righteous, but keep
Us from the dainties of the wicked <hi>Ioabs, Iudases,</hi> and <hi>Achitophels. Verse</hi> 8.
Speaks sadly against Ministers that withdraw from their Charges so unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly,
as a bird that wandreth too long from her nest, the young sterve
for Cold or famine, or are made a prey; so these, who having no necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Call to be els-where, especially not being members of the Commission,
yet stay not with their flocks, are guilty of their souls Ruine. <hi>verse</hi> 10, O how
doth this speak against the present Course of Judicatories, they have forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their old faithfull friends, when they proved ever Constant, and have
gone in to their wicked Countrey-mens house in the day of their Calamity.
But a neighbour in affection and piety, is nearer than a brother in flesh and
near in habitation.</p>
               <p>Chap 28. 1. <hi>(The wicked slee when no man pursueth: But the Righteous is
bold as a Lyon)</hi> wicked men are now chosen for Stoutness and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
but they have no sure foundation for it. Its buts like the Rage:
and temerity of a mad man or drunkard: But Godly men, once satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
in grounds of Conscience about their duty, would have been bold
as Lyons. A good Conscience would have made them bold <hi>Psal. 112. 7, 8.
Levit.</hi> 26. 36. Now <hi>verse</hi> 2, Behold the punishment of our sins, our Governours
are changed, There is almost a total alteration, and we are <hi>Faces about;</hi>
which cannot but bring Ruine to the Land, especially when men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and piety are shut out. <hi>verse</hi> 4. with Chap 29. 27. Its a great point and
Argument of declyning and forsaking the Law of God when men Praise the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
Change their Names though they themselves be not Changed, and Leave
off contending with them or declaring against them, and doe rather plead for
them. But Godly men that keep the Law Contend with, discountenance them, and
oppose them; As DAVID, I hate them that hate thee, and earnestly contend with
them: Thus they are kept from partaking with other mens sins. Ver 5, Its not very
likely, that all the ungodly should now understand the duty of the times and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the right way, and that so many that fear God, understand it not, seing
the Lords secret is revealed to them <hi>Psal. 25. 14. Verse</hi> 6, 7. A poor man, and
weak means if they be of upright men, are better and stronger than manie
rich and strong perverters. A companion of evil men and a keeper of the
Law aggree not in one person, the one is a honour, the other a shame to all
that have interest in them. Vers 9. Their prayers and professions are Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41269:26"/>
no acceptation of those who turno away their ears from obedience to the
Law, who walks contrare to it. Vers 10. These Cunning and crafty men that have
enticed some Godly men, and led them on in the present Course, shall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
smart for it, when the Godly seduced shall see good things after all this.
<hi>Verse</hi> 12, When wicked men have Power and Trust, Good men hide and
Retire themselves from such a Congregation or Assembly of the wicked. See
<hi>Chap.</hi> 10: 10, 11. Should we thus choose our oun Plague, Tyranny, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
Calamity and Misery: and cast away our oun glorie? Then vers 13.
Repentance requires true and Ingenuous Confession, and real forsaking; If
both these joyn not, its but a Covering and hyding of sin. If a man confess
and yet walk and Continue in them, he is but using his Confession as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
to retain his sins: and such shall not find mercy of God, or prosper
before men, Vers 14, Its not so despisable a thing to fear alway, and to be very
jealous of sin as it is now made, Its counted a reproach to have any scruples
at the prelent Course: But happie is he that abstaineth from all appearance of
evil: But he that emboldneth himself, and will not Question any thing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
for advantage, falls into mischief. Vers 15, 17, Shews the Lamentable
Condition of a people under wicked Rulers, they are beasts and not men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the people, especially towards the best. <hi>Dam.</hi> 7: 4, 5. <hi>Zep.</hi> 3: 3. <hi>vers</hi> 17. How
doth that aggree with our sparing of bloody men, of our solliciting for their
Impunity, of our pardoning them? Are they not, by the appointment of
Gods Law, ordained for destruction and hast to it? Should any then stay them?
should they not then far less employ them? And (vers 24.) If it be
so heinous to take our Fathers goods upon this pretence, because they are
our oun; how much more sacriledge is it to rob God of his Interests? and give
over his money to bankrupts, and say its no transgression to rob the Land of
its Defence, and make them naked, as <hi>Ahaz</hi> his confederacy did: Certainly it
is murther. <hi>vers</hi> 28. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 29: 2. and 11: 12. and 28: 28 are to one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
We have forsaken our oun mercy and wronged our oun souls: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
our selves in choosing our oun Judgment, and making our oun Red
to beat us withall. <hi>Chap.</hi> 29: 1. We being so often reproved by his word
and providence for the sin of Association with the wicked, and being so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
punished for it; and having so lately reproved our selves for it in our
Declarations and Fasts, yet to <hi>harden our necks.</hi> What can we expect but utter
destruction and that without Remedie, as we sentenced our selves? <hi>Ezra</hi> 9: 13.
and 14: 13. <hi>Isay.</hi> 30: 13, 14. Shall not this Iniquity be to us abreach ready
to fall, even this Iniquity of going down to Egypt for help &amp;c. Then vers 6. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is a snare to entrap thy feet in the sins of the wicked; if thow be joyned
with them thow cannot well escape. Vers 8. Wicked Prophane contemners
of God and his people bring ruine on a City or Commonalitie, they set it on
fire and blows it up: But Godly men pacify wrath, turn away Judgments,
and purge all from provocations, which is the only means to turn it away.
Vers 16 Shews, when wicked men gather together and grow in State and
power, they grow worse, and sin with greater boldness: And transgression
then overflows the Land <hi>tanquam ruptis repagulis.</hi> There is no obstacle, see
<hi>Psal.</hi> 12. And vers 24 shews, He that is partner and fellow-receiver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a thief,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41269:26"/>
or conceals such offenders, endangers his oun destruction: and he that stays
with and Associates with wicked men, must hear cursing aed cannot bewray
it; he will see many Abominations, that though he would he cannot reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
Vers 25. Fear of man and of the Lands danger, hath brought many into
a snare, to run from the Lord to an Arm of flesh: but he that trusts in the
Lord shall be safe. Vers 27. Here is the deadly enmitie between the two
feeds, they cannot reconcile well, see vers 10. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 21: 3. Its no

               <p>Chap. 30: 11, 14. Descrives the Malignant party, who make nothing of
the Godly Magistrates or their mother Church and Land, but Curse, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne,
Oppose as much as they could, and are Oppressours, monstrous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
Mankind-beasts, or beastly men; the Subject of their Crueltie is the
Godly afflicted man, they eat up all and will not leave the bones: As the
Propher complains, I ly among men whose teeth are as spears and arrows,
and their tongue as a sharp sword. And then vers 12, 13, 20. Descrives our Enemies,
the Invaders, They think themselves Godly and Righteous, yet are not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from their filthinesse. They are given up to strong delusions to believe
lies; and there is no lie greater than this, that they are a Godly Party in
a Godly Cause and way. They wipe their mouth after all their bloodshed,
and sayes, <hi>I have done no evil:</hi> They wash their hands <hi>as Pilate,</hi> as if they

and men should be esteemed and praised according to their works and fruit of
their hands.</p>
