            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>Written by a Gentlewoman.</byline>
            <l>HAil Mighty Prince! whom Providence deſign'd</l>
            <l>To be the chief delight of Humane Kind:</l>
            <l>So many Virtues crowd Your Breast, that we</l>
            <l>Do almost queſtion Your Humanity:</l>
            <l>Sure every Planet that o're Virtue Reigns,</l>
            <l>Shed it's best Influence in Your Royal Veins.</l>
            <l>You are the Glory of Monarchal Pow'rs,</l>
            <l>In Bounties free, as are deſcending Showrs;</l>
            <l>Fierce as a Tempest, when engag'd in War,</l>
            <l>In Peace more mild than tender Virgins are;</l>
            <l>In Mercy, You not only Imitate</l>
            <l>The Heav'nly Pow'rs, but alſo Emulate.</l>
            <l>None but Your Self, Your Suff'rings could have born</l>
            <l>With ſo much Greatneſs, ſuch Heroick Scorn:</l>
            <l>When hated Traytors do Your Life purſue,</l>
            <l>And all the world is fill'd with Cares for You,</l>
            <l>When every Loyal Heart is ſunk with fear,</l>
            <l>Your Self alone, does unconcern'd, appear,</l>
            <l>Your Soul within ſtill keeps its awful ſtate,</l>
            <l>Contemns, and Dares, the worst effects of Fate;</l>
            <l>The Majeſty that ſhoots from Your bright Eye,</l>
            <l>Commands Your Fate, and awes Your Deſtiny.</l>
            <l>And yet thô Your brave Soul bear You thus high,</l>
            <l>Your ſolid Judgment ſees there's Danger nigh,</l>
            <l>Which with ſuch Care and Prudence You prevent,</l>
            <l>As if You fear'd not, but wou'd croſs th' Event:</l>
            <l>Your Care ſo Nobly looks, it doth appear,</l>
            <l>'Tis for Your Subjects, not Your Self You fear:</l>
            <l>Heavens, make this Princes Life Your neareſt Care,</l>
            <l>That does ſo many heavenly Virtues ſhare.</l>
            <l>If Kings may be allow'd to Copy You,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>CHARLES</hi> is the likest, Nature ever drew:</l>
            <l>Blast every hand, that dares to be ſo bold</l>
            <l>An impious weapon 'gainst His Life to hold;</l>
            <l>Burst every heart, that dares but think Him ill,</l>
            <l>Their guilty Souls with ſo much Terror fill,</l>
            <l>That of themſelves they may their PLOT unfold,</l>
            <l>And live no longer, when the Tale is told:</l>
            <l>Safe in your Care all elſe would needleſs prove,</l>
            <l>Yet keep Him ſafe too in His Subjects Love;</l>
            <l>Your Subjects view You with ſuch Loyal Eyes,</l>
            <l>They know not how they may their Treaſure prize.</l>
            <l>Were You defenceleſs, they would round You fall,</l>
            <l>And pile their Bodies to build up a wall.</l>
            <l>Were You oppreſs'd, 'twou'd move a generous ſtrife</l>
            <l>Who first ſhould loſe his own, to ſave Your Life:</l>
            <l>But ſince kind Heaven theſe Dangers doth remove,</l>
            <l>We'll find out other wayes to expreſs our Love.</l>
            <l>We'll force the Traytors all, their Souls reſign</l>
            <l>To herd with them, that taught them their Deſign.</l>
