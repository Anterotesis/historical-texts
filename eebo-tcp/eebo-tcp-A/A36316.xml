            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Humble
WARNING
From the Preſaging
<hi>Earthquake</hi>
               <date>

            </head>
            <p>PLague, Fire, and Earthquakes
are amongſt the moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judgments, whereby the
great and holy God doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
his ſore diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a ſinful People, and his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and hatred of their heinous and
crying Sins. <hi>Theſe three</hi> have befallen
<pb facs="tcp:59717:3"/>
               <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> in the GREAT
DYING Year, 1665. the <hi>ſecond</hi> in
the GREAT BURNING Year
1666. and the <hi>laſt</hi> in the GREAT
TREMBLING preſent Year 1692.
and the Month of <hi>September</hi> is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in all theſe. The <hi>Plague</hi> (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member)
being then at the higheſt, the
great <hi>Fire</hi> began on <hi>Septemb.</hi> 2. and the
<hi>Earthquake</hi> was on the Eighth of the
ſame Month; on which day of the
Month <hi>Joſephus de bel. Jud. lib. 7. cap.</hi> 18.
writes thus; Jeruſalem <hi>was taken the
ſecond year of</hi> Veſpaſian<hi>'s reign, on the
eighth day of</hi> September, <hi>and having
been already five times before ſurprized,
it was finally again deſtroyed.</hi> This was
<hi>London</hi>'s trembling, but (through the
great Power, Patience, and Mercy of
God) not its falling day.</p>
            <p>I call <hi>Earthquakes preſaging</hi> for theſe
Reaſons; what weight there is in them
I leave to others to judge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe Christ did aſſert them to
to be ſuch:</hi> Luke 21. 5. to 12. as <hi>ſome
ſpake of the Temple, how it was adorned
<pb facs="tcp:59717:3"/>
with goodly stones, and gifts, he ſaid, As
for theſe things, which ye behold, the days
will come, in which there ſhall not be left
one ſtone upon another, that ſhall not be
thrown down;</hi> they asked, <hi>Maſter, When
ſhall theſe things be? and what ſign will
there be when theſe things ſhall come to
paſs.</hi> Then Chriſt gave (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
Earthquakes as foregoing Signs
of ſuch future Ruins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe God hath made uſe of
Earthquakes (in former times) as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of great Calamities to come.</hi>So according to Chriſt's prediction, this
Sign went before the deſtruction of the
Temple. <hi>Joſephus de bel. Jud. lib. 7. c. 12.</hi>Amongſt the foregoing Signs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> mentioneth an
Earthquake: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Feaſt-day of</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,<hi>at night the Prieſts going into
the inner Temple to offer their wonted
Sacrifice, at first they felt the place to
move and tremble, and afterward they
heard a voice, which ſaid, Let us depart
hence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:59717:4"/>
3. <hi>Becauſe Christ ſaith</hi> (as of other
Judgments mentioned, ſo) <hi>of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
They are the beginning of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</hi>
If the beginning, muſt not others
follow? when an Earthquake is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
(let not Scorners deride) who
knows what ſhall be the middle and
the ending of thoſe Calamities, that
might take their beginning from an
Earthquake, <hi>Matth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 24. 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Becauſe I judge</hi> (if I err, let my
miſtaking thoughts be excuſed) <hi>that
this late Earthquake was from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
hand of God.</hi> And yet if it were
not, God can uſe the alleadged Natural
Cauſes of Earthquakes, to give warning,
and to fore-run other following Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
But my reaſon is this, becauſe it
did extend it ſelf ſo far, to ſo many
places in <hi>England,</hi> and beyond the Sea
(according to the Account that I have
heard) not only on the ſame day, but
at the ſame time of the day as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
at <hi>London, Sheerneſs, Sandwich,
Deal, Maidstone, Portſmouth,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other places beyond Sea, at <hi>Paris,
<pb facs="tcp:59717:4"/>
Marli, Verſailles,</hi> and in <hi>Normandy,</hi> at
<hi>Bruſſels, Cologne,</hi> and in moſt places of
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> Now if it did
ariſe from Natural Cauſes, there muſt
be exceeding great quantities of ſuch
Vapours in the Caves and hollow Places
of the Earth, which ſtriving all along
ſo far to get out, it ſeems very ſtrange
they did no where with great fury
break out, to the opening of the Earth,
and overthrow of ſome places, where
the Earth was weakeſt. If the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was leſs, taking its beginning in ſome
certain place, and proceeding forward,
ſeeking to get out, but could not, it
would have required more time to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
under ground to ſuch diſtant Towns
and Cities, as in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places beyond Sea, and ſo could not
have been at all, at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>And if it were from the immediate
hand of God, was it not for ſome great
end that God ſhould do ſo great a work,
which he doth more rarely do? Is not
the meaning of it, a warning to all
that have been ſhaken by it, to forſake
<pb facs="tcp:59717:5"/>
ſin, and turn to God by repentance and
reformation, or elſe look for ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtroke? while we go on in a courſe
of great provoking ſins, when God hath
ſhaken his Rod over us, might we not
fear it will ſome time fall upon us? But
whether it were Natural or Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
ſhould not all places that trembled by
it, without Reformation, fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the Judgments that may follow
it? when God begins to puniſh, and
Men not ſo much as begin to repent
and turn, doth not he threaten he will
go on to puniſh ſeven times more, and
ſeven to that? and many times ſeven
more to that, when a People ſtill walk
contrary to him? <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 15. to 40.</p>
            <p>Some would fain deny the matter of
Fact, but that there are ſo many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to teſtifie againſt them. Some
that own it, make light of it, and do
not at all think it portends any more
Calamity to come; even as the blinded
<hi>Jews</hi> ſlighted all the Indications of more
approaching Miſeries, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes
concerning them; ſaying, <hi>Theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:59717:5"/>
people were eaſily perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Impoſtors who did bely God, yet
would they not believe, nor give any ear
or regard unto certain Tokens and Signs</hi>
(of which an Earthquake was one) <hi>of
the ruin of their City: but as it were
blinded, neither having Eyes nor Souls,
they counterfeited themſelves, not to ſee
what God foreſhewed them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' I dare not undertake to tell
what particular Judgments (which are
at God's ordering) this Earthquake
doth preſage, without Reformation;
yet may I not ask this <hi>ſober</hi> Queſtion,
If this late Earthquake have not good
effect upon our Hearts and Lives, may
we not fear leſt thoſe Judgments may
follow, which we read in Scripture God
hath ſent upon a People for thoſe very
ſins which do raign amongſt us? as for
prophaning his Sabbaths, for exceſſive
Pride in Apparel, for profane Swearing,
fulneſs of Bread, Drunkenneſs, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
Robberies, Murders, Contempt
of Religion, Hatred of Godlineſs, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and hating one another, neglect
<pb facs="tcp:59717:6"/>
of Religious Education of Children, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
the Worſhip of God from our
Families, Blaſpheming, and Curſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Calling upon God, Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and a general Decay of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Godlineſs, Leaving of our firſt
Love, loſs of the Spirit of Prayer, yea
(ah ſinful Age) deriding of it, Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and Worldlineſs, Selfiſhneſs, and
abuſe of God's holy Ordinances, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
them to Carnal Deſigns and
Intereſts; and many more. That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(amongſt many <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.) may ſerve
for a Glaſs to ſee our ſins, and what
Judgments we may fear, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in; which are ſins that bring
Kingdoms and Cities to ruin. Verſe 8.
<hi>For</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>is ruined, and</hi> Judah <hi>is
fallen, becauſe their tongue and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are againſt the Lord, to provoke the
eyes of his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that Magiſtrates <hi>(Nehemiah</hi> like)
would not any longer ſuffer the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
to be openly profaned, or things
expoſed to Sale in <hi>Londons (</hi>late trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling)
Streets, or Parts adjacent, nor in
<pb facs="tcp:59717:6"/>
the Land. Where is <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage?<hi>Neh. 13. 15. In thoſe days ſaw I
in</hi> Judah, <hi>ſome treading Wine-preſſes on
the Sabbath, and bringing in Sheaves, and
lading Aſſes: as alſo Wine, Grapes, Figs
[</hi>and now in our Street-trade, Apples,
Pears, Plumbs, <hi>&amp;c.] on the Sabbath-day:
and I teſtified againſt them in the day
wherein they ſold Victuals.</hi> Verſe <hi>17.
Then I contended with the Nobles of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,<hi>and ſaid unto them, What evil thing
is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath
day? Did not your Fathers thus, and did
not our God bring all this evil upon us,
and upon this City? yet ye bring more
wrath upon</hi> Iſrael <hi>by profaning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.
—</hi>Verſe <hi>21. Then I teſtified againſt
them, and ſaid unto them,—if ye do
ſo again, I will lay hands on you. From
that time forth came they no more on the
Sabbath day.</hi> O that after ſuch ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of the City, ſuch things might be
done no more on the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>O that no more Oaths on other days
might be heard in our Streets, and no
more reelings by Drunkenneſs there,
<pb facs="tcp:59717:7"/>
leaſt the Earth reel under us again. O
that there might be praying to, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God in all Houſes that did ſhake,
and yet do ſtand. That all Men of all
Ranks, Callings, Qualities, Rich and
Poor, Magiſtrates and Subjects, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and People, Parents and Children,
Maſters and Servants, might ſearch their
hearts and ways, ſee what is amiſs, and
mend it, what is good, and continue and
grow therein, that God may be no more
provoked, diſhonoured, incenſed againſt
us, but glorified, pleaſed, feared by us,
that his Anger might be turned away
from us, that inſtead of Judgments and
Wrath, his Bleſſings and Mercies might
be poured upon us. <hi>Amen.</hi>

above, and of the Earth beneath,
with admiration of his Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Firſt; God's works have been aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
in the Heavens over our heads,
which becauſe they are too high, and
<hi>above our preſent Theme and Subject,</hi> I
ſhall but briefly mention <hi>three</hi> of them,
and thoſe concerning the Sun, the great
inlightener of this Earth whereof we are
to ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſtanding ſtill of the Sun.</hi> It is
the Doctrine of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> That <hi>Motion</hi>
doth as much belong to the Nature of
Heaven, as <hi>Immobility and Reſt</hi> to the
Nature of the Earth. The Earth is a
ſetled, fixed Body, and therefore it is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59717:10"/>
an act of mighty power in God to
<hi>ſhake</hi> it, and to make it move; but the
Sun is as a Bridegroom coming out of
his Chamber, rejoycing as a ſtrong man
to run a race, according to the ordinary
Law of Creation and Government in
continual motion, and therefore a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
work of God alone to cauſe its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ceaſe and ſtand ſtill. The making
of the Sun to ſtop, which naturally
cannot but move, and cauſing the Earth
to ſhake and move, which naturally
cannot but ſtand ſtill, is an effect of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
power. The command of God
doth change the Earths ſtation into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Suns motion into ſtanding
ſtill. <hi>Joſh. 10. 12. Than ſpake</hi> Joſhua
<hi>to the Lord in the day when the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up the</hi> Amorites <hi>before the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and he ſaid in the ſight
of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Sun, ſtand thou ſtill upon</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon,
<hi>and thou Moon in the valley of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jelon.
Verſe 13. <hi>And the Sun ſtood ſtill,
and the Moon ſtayed until the People had
avenged themſelves upon their Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Sun ſtood ſtill in the midſt of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59717:11"/>
               <hi>Heaven, and haſted not to go down about
a whole day.</hi> Verſe 14. <hi>And there was
no day like that, before it or after, that
the Lord harkened unto the voice of a
man, for the Lord fought for</hi> Iſrael.
Where is obſervable, (1.) That <hi>Joſhua</hi>
ſpake firſt to the Lord, and then to the
Sun; for it was not <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s voice, but
God's power that put a check to the
motion of the Sun. (2.) God hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the voice of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> praying that
the Sun might ſtop its motion. (3.) Then
the Sun hearkened to the voice of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi>
ſo that by God's commanding
voice, in anſwer to <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s praying
voice, <hi>the Sun ſtood ſtill:</hi> If all the men
on Earth with one concurrent voice,
ſhould ſay to it, Sun ſtand thou ſtill, it
would ſtill go forwards in its motion:
ſo that its ceſſation from motion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
the mighty, amazing work
of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Retrograde motion of the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
or its going backward, is no leſs a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
work of God in the Heaven
than its ſtanding ſtill. The motion of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59717:11"/>
the Sun is naturally progreſſive, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forward, and if it ſhould make more
haſte by many degrees in its diurnal
Motion, it muſt be by power Divine,
and not Humane; yet in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of men, it is a greater thing, that it
ſhould go backward, and would cauſe
more their obſervation of its motion,
and admiration of God's power. <hi>Iſai.</hi>
38. 7. <hi>This ſhall be a ſign unto thee from
the Lord, that the Lord will do this that
he hath ſpoken.</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>Behold, I will
bring again the ſhadow of the degrees
which is gone down in the Sun-dial of</hi>
Ahaz <hi>ten degrees backward. So the Sun
returned ten degrees, by which degrees it
was gone down. Hezekiah</hi> prayed, God
promiſed gives him a ſign for his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of the performance, and the
ſign (tho' miraculous) was effected, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ne mercy asked, was beſtowed: God
cauſed the Sun to go backwards to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the faith of his People in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
that his work for their deliverance
ſhould go forwards.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59717:12"/>
3. <hi>That at and from high noon-day
till three in the afternoon, the Sun ſhould
give no light,</hi> but darkneſs ſhould be at
the uſual time of its inlightening the
Earth, was the hand and power of God.
Ordinary <hi>Eclipſes</hi> are not miraculous,
yet there was <hi>one</hi> that was not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the courſe of Nature. When the
<hi>Lord of Glory,</hi> the <hi>Sun of Righeouſneſs</hi>
was crucified, the Sun hid its face, and
the Heavens put themſelves into mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his death. <hi>Matth. 27. 45. Now
from the ſixth hour there was darkneſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the Land until the ninth hour.</hi>
This was an extraordinary and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
work of God, upon the Reaſons
uſually alleadged. (1.) Becauſe it was
the <hi>full of the Moon,</hi> which cauſed a
great <hi>Philoſopher</hi> to cry out, <hi>Either the
God of Nature ſuffers, or the Frame of
Nature diſſolves.</hi> (2.) Becauſe (as ſome
affirm) it was <hi>univerſal,</hi> over all the
World. Or (3.) according to others,
becauſe it was only over the <hi>Land of
Judea,</hi> all other parts of the World ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the benefit, and enjoying the light
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59717:12"/>
of the Sun at that time; which ſome
judge to be the more ſtrange: that as
when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had light in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
were under the Plague of
Darkneſs; ſo at the crucifying of <hi>Chriſt,
Iſrael</hi> which dwelt in <hi>Judea</hi> ſhould be
under darkneſs, when the World beſides
enjoyed light. Thus it is manifeſt that
God doth great things in Heaven above,
the Sun moves or ſtandeth ſtill, goes
backwards or forwards, ſhines not, to
give light at noon day, and for ſome
hours together unto the Earth at all, or
elſe makes light in one part, when it
doth not in another; and all this at the
pleaſure of the great God. But our
preſent Task is to obſerve one extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
work of God, <hi>on and in the
Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; There is the amazing,
mighty work of God on and within the
Earth, which in the Text that ſuits the
occaſion, is <hi>God's ſhaking of, and making
it to tremble</hi> before him, and under men
that dwell upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59717:13"/>
This moving of the Earth is far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from that conſtant motion that
ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> aſcribe unto it; for
amongſt the ſeveral <hi>Syſtems</hi> of the World
which <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> have invented, <hi>three</hi>
are more famous, one by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the
other by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and the third by
<hi>Tycho Brache. Copernicus</hi> following the
<hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> aſſerts the motion of the
Earth, and the Sun to be in the Center
of the World, without motion; that the
Earth hath two motions, one <hi>Diurnal,</hi>
which is performed about its own <hi>Axis</hi>
in the ſpace of 24 hours, and from this
motion do ariſe our days and nights:
the other <hi>Annual,</hi> whereby it is carried
about the Sun, from the Weſt towards
the Eaſt, according to the ſucceſſion of
Signs of the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> Where then is
the <hi>miracle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Sun's ſtanding ſtill</hi>
in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s days, if it ſtand ſtill in all
Ages? where is the <hi>wonder</hi> of the Earths
moving, if it whirl about every 24
hours with ſo ſwift a motion? why
cannot all People diſcern this conſtant
motion of the Earth, that do perceive
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59717:13"/>
its ſhaking for a few minutes, and are
ſo much affrighted at it? Are the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
of the Earth turned into <hi>Wheels?</hi>
Some have denied all motion, ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
too much: but as when all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was denied, a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> to prove
it, roſe up and walked; ſo when the
conſtant, daily, and yearly motion of
the Earth is aſſerted, we may know by
our Senſes that it <hi>ſtands ſtill;</hi> but theſe
great men of reaſon (ſo they are) will,
give you this preſently for an <hi>Axiome,
Senſibus non eſt fidendum,</hi> you muſt not
believe, nor truſt your Senſes: which
yet for the ſake of the Doctrine of
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> I ſhould not readily
receive; but knowing that my Senſes
cannot err about their <hi>proper object,</hi>
when it is preſented at <hi>a due diſtance,</hi>
through a <hi>right diſpoſed,</hi> a <hi>Papist</hi> ſhall
not perſwade me that the Bread after
Conſecration is not Bread, and that the
Wine is not Wine, nor a <hi>Copernican</hi>
that the Earth doth naturally move,
when in the one, by my Senſes I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59717:14"/>
it to be <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> and not
real Fleſh and Blood carnally and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally
taken, and in the other, that
the Earth ſtands faſt and ſtill, ſo much
confidence I will put in my Senſes: a
drunken man that by exceſs hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
his head, might conceit the
Earth turns round, and the room where
he is doth move, when the motion and
turning is in his Brains, and when he
hath ſlept himſelf ſober will perceive,
what he thought before did move, doth
then ſtand ſtill. But it being not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
nor profitable</hi> to this Aſſembly to
debate <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Controverſies, I
ſhall diſmiſs them, and retain you with
what may be more advantageous for
your Souls, in treating of this <hi>amazing
work</hi> of God which you <hi>ſo lately</hi> did
diſcern, and <hi>then</hi> were ſo much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at, and affected with, viz. <hi>God's
ſhaking of the Earth under your feet,</hi>
and <hi>the Houſes over your heads;</hi> that
you did think the one did reel under you,
and the other would fall upon you. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
is full, and your own Experience

In the Text you may obſerve theſe
parts:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The motion or ſhaking of the Earth.</hi>
That which according to the courſe of
Nature <hi>ſtands ſtill,</hi> the extraordinary
workings of Providence cauſeth it to
<hi>quake.</hi> The Earth hath neither life, nor
ſenſe, nor motion in it, yet God can make
it <hi>tremble.</hi> As the <hi>Sun</hi> that moves, ſtands
ſtill at God's command; ſo the <hi>Earth,</hi>
that ſtands ſtill, ſhall move at his voice
and pleaſure: and yet men that have
life, and ſenſe, and reaſon, diſobey God's
commands, and will not hearken to his
voice, and do not tremble at the
thoughts of his Soveraign Power and
Infinite Majeſty. When ſinners upon
Earth do not, the Earth under them may
quake and tremble: and if while the
Earth trembles <hi>under them,</hi> they then
tremble <hi>upon it,</hi> yet when the Earth
ſtands ſtill again, they <hi>run</hi> as faſt to ſin
again as they did before: when the Earth
ceaſeth its trembling, they do not ceaſe
their ſinful motions. The great <hi>Pillar</hi>
that ſupports the Earth, whereby it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59717:16"/>
ſtands ſo faſt, is the <hi>power of God,</hi> for
<hi>he hath hanged it upon nothing,</hi> Job 26. 7.
Yet ſinners ſupported by the Earth,
without fear and trembling, do abuſe
the mercy and the patience of God,
tho' if he ſhould remove that ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pillar, the Earth would ſink under
them: but tho' he keeps it up, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he makes it ſhake, <hi>There was an
Earthquake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The greatneſs of this motion,</hi> or
<hi>ſhaking of the Earth:</hi> There was a
<hi>great Earthquake.</hi> Its greatneſs is ſet
forth by the greatneſs of its <hi>Effects</hi> and
<hi>Conſequents</hi> here named: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>ſhaking of the foundations of
the Priſon.</hi> The ſtrongeſt Priſons, the
moſt impregnable Places, Houſes built
with brick and ſtone, being founded on
Earth; when the one doth quake, the
foundations of the other muſt needs be
ſhaken: In exceeding ſtrong winds and
tempeſtuous ſtorms, the <hi>tops</hi> of Houſes
may ſhake, and rock to and fro, while
the <hi>foundations</hi> ſtand firm and are not
moved; but when the Earth it ſelf, on
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59717:17"/>
which they ſtand, doth quake, their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
are alſo ſhaken, and tho' your
Houſes then ſtood, yet they ſtood trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
foundations, floors and roofs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The immediate opening of the doors.</hi>
Priſon doors, eſpecially upon a ſtrict
charge given to the <hi>Jaylour</hi> for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his Priſoners, are faſt locked,
ſecurely barred and chained; but God
did cauſe ſuch an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> that no
Locks could hold them faſt, no Bars nor
Chains could keep them ſhut; for at
the ariſing of this <hi>Earthquake,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
all the Priſon doors were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The looſing of the Priſoners bands.
Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were faſt bound, ſhut up
in a Priſon within the Priſon, and their
feet made faſt in the Stocks, ſo that they
could not ſtand in the Priſon, nor the
ground ſtand ſtill under them, but the
Earthquake came, and was their <hi>Goal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivery.</hi>
Theſe be the great Effects
of this great Earthquake.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59717:17"/>
            <p n="3">3. In the words are expreſſed the
<hi>ſuddenneſs of this Earthquake.</hi> An Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
is ſometimes quickly cauſed, and
quickly ceaſed at the pleaſure and the
will of God. <hi>God ſpake, and the Earth
ſtood fast,</hi> Pſal. 33 9. God ſpeaks, and
he makes it quake and tremble.</p>
            <p>Tho' it is one Doctrine chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to ſuit the <hi>occaſion,</hi> yet I will
briefly mention more, which will not
be altogether alien from our deſign.</p>
            <p>Doct. I.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God many times works wonders for the
deliverance of his ſuffering Saints in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the propagating of the Goſpel.
Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were impriſoned becauſe
they did preach, God by an <hi>Earthquake</hi>
ſets open the Priſon doors that they
may go forth and preach. They by
preaching did make the Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſhake; they for preaching were
faſt bound in Priſon; the Earth where
they did lie ſo bound, falls a quaking
under them, as being weary of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59717:18"/>
of impriſoned Preachers; and doth
not reſt, and could not ſtand ſtill under
them, till they were enlarged and ſet at
liberty.</p>
            <p>God <hi>can</hi> do wonders for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his ſuffering Servants, of this
his Almighty Power is a proof. God
can deliver his Sufferers after ſuch a
manner, as none other can, their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
being Eye-witneſſes and Confeſſors
of it. <hi>Dan. 3. 28. Then</hi> Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar<hi>ſpake and ſaid, Bleſſed be the God of</hi>Shadrach, Meſhach <hi>and</hi> Abednego, <hi>who
hath ſent his Angel and delivered his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
that truſted in him, and have
changed the King's word, and yielded
their bodies, that they might not ſerve,
nor worſhip any God, except their own
God.</hi> Verſe <hi>29. Therefore I make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
that every People, Nation and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which ſpeaks any thing amiſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the God of</hi> Shadrach, Meſhach <hi>and</hi>Abednego, <hi>ſhall be cut in pieces, and their
Houſes ſhall be made a dunghil, becauſe
there is no other God that can deliver af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this ſort. Darius</hi> put the queſtion to<hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59717:18"/>
Daniel</hi> in the Den; <hi>Dan. 6. 20. When
he came to the Den, he cried with a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
voice unto</hi> Daniel, <hi>and the King
ſpake and ſaid to</hi> Daniel, <hi>O</hi> Daniel, <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the living God, is thy God whom
thou ſerveſt continually, able to deliver
thee from the Lions?</hi> Verſe <hi>22. My God
hath ſent his Angel, and hath ſhut the
Lions mouths, that they have not hurt
me.</hi> Then follows <hi>Darius</hi> his Decree,
Verſe <hi>26. I make a Decree, that in every
Dominion of my Kingdom, men tremble
and fear before the God of</hi> Daniel: his
reaſon why; <hi>for he is the living God,
and ſtedfaſt for ever, and his Kingdom
that which ſhall not be deſtroyed, and his
Dominion ſhall be even to the end.</hi>Verſe <hi>27. He delivereth and reſcueth,
and he worketh ſigns and wonders in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and in Earth, who hath delivered</hi>Daniel <hi>from the power of the Lions.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!
God <hi>can,</hi> for he <hi>hath</hi> wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered his Servants. <hi>Three</hi> in a
fiery Furnance, that the fire did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
nor ſinge them. <hi>One,</hi> in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Den, that they did not devour nor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59717:19"/>
hurt him. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that they ſhould be no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
there. He can make the fire not
burn combuſtible matter. He can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Lions from what they might elſe
have made their prey. And he can
cauſe the foundations of a Priſon by an<hi>Earthquake</hi> to be ſo ſhaken, that the
doors might open, and his Servants may
come forth. He can, he hath, and when
he pleaſeth, he ſtill will, <hi>he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
he doth deliver,</hi> and we may
truſt to him according to the Promiſes
that he hath made, that he <hi>will ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us, 2</hi> Cor. 1 10.</p>
            <p>Doct. II. <hi>God needs not length of time to
do the moſt great and wonderful works.
Suddenly</hi> there was an <hi>Earthquake.</hi> God
can make it move in an inſtant. When
its ſaid God in <hi>ſix</hi> days made this
World, it's not to be underſtood that he
did need ſo many days to make it in.
It was his pleaſure to take that time to
finiſh, beautifie and compleat it. When
God did create the Earth, and brought
it out of nothing, it was <hi>ſuddenly</hi> done
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59717:19"/>
He did but ſpeak, <hi>Let it be,</hi> and it <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly</hi>
ſtarted out of Nothing into Being.
<hi>Creation is an inſtantaneous action:</hi> he
that did ſo <hi>ſuddenly</hi> and ſo <hi>eaſily</hi> make
it, can as ſuddenly and as eaſily make
it quake and tremble. How ſuddenly
did God make the Earth to quake where
<hi>London ſtood,</hi> and after his ſhaking of
it, through his great mercy yet <hi>doth
ſtand!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When men thought of no ſuch thing,
not the <hi>Student</hi> in his Study, nor the
<hi>Trader</hi> in his Shop, nor the <hi>Workman</hi>
at his Work, nor the <hi>Drunkard</hi> at his
Cups, when none of theſe had any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of it. <hi>Suddenly,</hi> The <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
thought his Desk, on which he was
writing, to be removing from him, and
when he drew it towards him, it went
back again, ſeveral times: the <hi>Trader</hi>
ſuddenly ſeeth a motion in his Wares,
and the <hi>Workman</hi> the moving of his
Tools without hands, and the <hi>Drunkard</hi>
thought indeed the Earth did ſtagger
more than he: many ſuddenly felt their
Chairs to move under them, and could

not preſently diſcern the reaſon, but
thought ſome living Creature had been
under their Seats, and did diſturb them.
Suddenly, many, moſt that I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with, diſcerned a dizzineſs in their
Heads, and in the inſtant thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
motion was there, not imagining any
thing of the <hi>ſhaking</hi> of the Earth: <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly</hi>
they feared the falling of their
Houſes; but at firſt, particular perſons
thought there was ſome defect and fault
in their own particular dwellings, till
they did perceive the motion was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and heard other ſay of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as they found in their own: and all
this was <hi>ſuddenly</hi> done. In a minute, in
a moment. God can cauſe an unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ected
<hi>Earthquake.</hi> Men muſt have
time to do the <hi>ſmalleſt,</hi> but God needs
none to do the <hi>greateſt</hi> work.</p>
            <p>Doct. III. <hi>Tho' an Earthquake ſuddenly
come, and quickly go, and nothing is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby, yet it is and might be truly
called a great Earthquake.</hi> It is expreſly
ſaid in the Text this Earthquake <hi>ſuddenly</hi>
came, we do not read it laſted long, nor
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59717:21"/>
that the Priſon-houſe, or Perſons in it,
were deſtroyed or hurt thereby, yet we
read it was a <hi>great Earthquake.</hi> When
many Houſes are ſwallowed up, and
many Men, Women and Children (as
this preſent year in <hi>Jamaica</hi>) are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and go down alive into the
Bowels of the Earth by opening of its
mouth to eat them up as one morſel,
then Men will call it a great Earthquake.</p>
            <p>But ſuch a one as was ſo lately in
<hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> when not one Houſe was
deſtroyed, nor one Perſon conſumed,
ſeems to be ſo ſmall (eſpecially now it
is over and all ſafe) as is not worth their
obſervation, for People now are as little
concerned already, as if it had not been,
or they had quite forgotten that it was.
But let ſuch ſlighters of this la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e work of

and calling of it a little thing, tell me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Was not <hi>this a great Earthquake</hi>
that made <hi>ſo many Houſes</hi> as be in ſuch
a great City as this to move, and ſhake,
and tremble, tho' they ſtood? Is it not
a great thing to make one of <hi>London</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59717:22"/>
ſtreets, and the Houſes therein ſo to
quake? much more two or ten, much
more all and every one?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Was it not <hi>a great Earthquake</hi>
that did <hi>reach ſo far,</hi> and extended it ſelf
ſo many miles at the ſame inſtant of the
ſame day to ſo many places in <hi>England,</hi>
as we have heard?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet more, was it not <hi>a great
Earthquake</hi> when it did enlarge it ſelf,
and reached <hi>at the ſame time</hi> to ſo <hi>many
Cities and Towns beyond the Sea?</hi> Did
God ſtretch out his Arm ſo far, and do
you look upon it as a little thing, not
worthy your obſervation, remembring,
or ſpiritual improvement of it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. If it were ſo ſmall in your eyes.
<hi>what made ſo many to be in ſo great a
conſternation?</hi> why did ſo many run out
of their Houſes, and ſuch as were ſitting
at their Tables haſten from their Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with their Napkins in their hands,
to get into the Streets? why did ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
run from their Shops? what was
the reaſon of the ſudden, common cry,
by ſo many, one by one, <hi>My Houſe is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59717:22"/>
falling,</hi> and <hi>my Houſe is falling,</hi> and <hi>my
Children above will be diſtroyed,</hi> and <hi>yet
I dare not go up to fetch them down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. How little do you know, if this
<hi>late Earthquake had been a little more,
and had laſted a little longer, a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
more, how near you and your Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
would have been to a ſubverſion and
total overthrow?</hi> or how near the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Earth might have been to open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſwallowed up both you and
your Habitations? For all that you
know <hi>by this Earthquake</hi> you were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the brink of ruine, a little more
might have brought you down; and
yet will you ſlight this work of God, as
if it were a ſmall, a very little thing?</p>
            <p n="6">6. As ſmall a thing as you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it to be, <hi>could any man, or men, could
all the mighty men upon the Earth have
cauſed ſuch a ſhaking and trembling of
the Earth, and all upon it.</hi> Could all
the mighty <hi>Captains, Lord Generals,
Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> with all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
have had ſuch an Influence upon
the Earth? if they can batter down
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59717:23"/>
ſtrong Walls, and Cities, and Caſtles
with their Inſtruments of War, yet can
any of them, or all of them, cauſe ſuch
a ſhaking of the Earth as that <hi>ſo lately</hi>
was? do you aſcribe great things to
Men, and call them ſo, that are far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to this, and yet let this paſs by
with ſo little obſervation, as if it were
a work ſo ſmall?</p>
            <p n="7">7. If men <hi>could ſhake</hi> the Earth and
your Houſes as God did, could they ſo
ſecurely have <hi>preſerved</hi> them from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and you from hurt, as God did?
Was the ſhaking of your Houſes, ſo much,
and the preſerving of them ſo ſhaken,
ſo great a mercy, in it ſelf, and yet ſo
little in your eyes? and laſt no longer
with a due impreſſion in your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?</p>
            <p n="8">8. While you look upon <hi>this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi>
to be ſo ſmall a thing, can you
look upon <hi>your preſervation to be ſo great
a mercy as indeed it is?</hi> whilſt you leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
the <hi>work</hi> of God, the more you leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
the <hi>mercy</hi> of God? did God ſhake
you and your Houſes, and not overturn
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59717:23"/>
you and them, and was not this great
mercy? Oh! take heed you do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
this work of God's power in your
own apprehenſions, and conſequently
your danger <hi>then,</hi> and God's mercy <hi>now</hi>
in your ſafety. Lord! Let <hi>London</hi> ſo
tremble at thy Judgment with which
thou haſt ſo lately viſited it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it great, that their Repentance,
Reformation may be great. And tho'
it <hi>ſuddenly</hi> came, and quickly ceaſed,
and did no hurt, let not <hi>London</hi> account
that work a ſmall work, but thy mercy
great mercy, vouchſafed in ſo great a
Judgment, leaſt in thy wrath yet great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
thou cauſe the foundations of it to
ſhake and tremble more, and do that
execution that ſhould make all confeſs
and ſay (that deny this) that ſuddenly
there was a great Earthquake.</p>
            <p>Doct. IV. <hi>Tho' ſome Earthquakes have
their natural cauſes, yet ſome do ariſe
from the immediate hand and power of
God without ſuch cauſes. Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>
were impriſoned; in Priſon they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſang Praiſes, in teſtimony that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59717:24"/>
God heard their Prayers, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cauſeth <hi>this Earthquake</hi> under the
Priſon. Judicious Expoſitors aſſert this
Earthquake to be miraculous.</p>
            <p>In treating on this I ſhall take this

            <p n="1">I. Diſtinguiſh between <hi>Earthquakes
figurative</hi> and <hi>metaphorical,</hi> and ſuch as
are <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>real:</hi> becauſe both are

to remove the ambiguity of the

            <p n="2">II. Diſtinguiſh <hi>real Earthquakes</hi> into
<hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural.</hi> In reſpect of

may be termed <hi>contra-natural,</hi> but
in reſpect of the ſecond Cauſes in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which ſometimes produce ſuch
tremblings and quakings in the Earth are
called <hi>natural,</hi> in contradiſtinction from
thoſe which are cauſed by God's imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
hand, without ſuch cauſes, and are
therefore <hi>ſupernatural.</hi>

III. I ſhall give a ſhort account what
<hi>natural Philoſophers</hi> aſſert to be the
<hi>Cauſes</hi> of ſuch <hi>Earthquakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. Point at the ſeveral <hi>ſorts</hi> or <hi>kinds</hi>

Earthquakes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Earthquakes and movings of the
Earth, are often taken <hi>metaphorically</hi>
for <hi>great Commotions, alterations made
in States, Kingdoms and Church,</hi> and for
ſore and heavy Puniſhments inflicted
by God upon wicked and diſobedient
People. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Lord of Hoſts with Thunder,
and with Earthquake, and with great
Noiſe, with Storm and Tempeſt, and the
Flame of devouring Fire.</hi> A figurative

ſome Expoſitors ſay, this Earthquake

<hi>Iſaiah 24. 18. The foundations of

expounds it, he doth not mean the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Earth,</hi> on which Men tread, but
the People that tread upon the Earth;
or that Commonwealth wherein People
are united and governed; theſe ſhall be

<hi>Rev. 16. 18. And there were voices, and

ſuch as are cauſed by God's immediate

Cauſes in Nature;</hi> tho' <hi>theſe</hi> alſo are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and ordered and ruled by the
powerful Providence of God, and do
not come (as ſome call it) by <hi>chance.</hi>
Tho' the finger of God be in thoſe
Natural Cauſes, yet ſuch as have been
without them muſt be wholly and only
from God. And I ſhall gather theſe
out of the Scripture, that we might
learn to fear and tremble before this
great God that needs no winds and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
nor any kind of Creature to
make the Earth to ſhake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And they are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſhaking of the earth at God's
giving of the Law to</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the
Children of</hi> Iſrael. Exod. 19. 18. <hi>And
Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>was altogether on a ſmoke,
becauſe the Lord deſcended on it in fire:
and the ſmoke thereof aſcended as the
ſmoke of a furnace, and the whole Mount
quaked greatly.</hi> That this quaking of
the Mount was <hi>litteral</hi> and not <hi>figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
Rivet</hi> argues, becauſe it is joyned
with the ſmoke, and Thunders and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59717:27"/>
Lightnings <hi>properly</hi> to be underſtood,
and ſaith, That the cauſes of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the Earth, and of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as it were leaping at the preſence
of God, are not to be ſearched for in
Nature, nor ſhould we diſpute concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Phyſical</hi> Reaſons of this Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for when all things done here are
miraculous, the glory of God is obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

in an extraordinary manner, and that
altogether Divine, we enquire after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Cauſes, which in ſuch events are
none. <hi>Pſal. 68. 7. O God! when thou

Verſe 8. <hi>The earth ſhook, the heavens

Sinai <hi>it ſelf was moved at the preſence of
God, the God of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such a <hi>Supernatural</hi> Commotion
of the Earth is alſo recorded <hi>Pſal. 114.
per tot. When</hi> Iſrael <hi>went out of</hi> Egypt,
<hi>&amp;c. The Sea ſaw it and fled;</hi> Jordan
<hi>was driven back. The Mountains skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
like Rams, and the little Hills like

aſſerted. Then the Queſtion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
<hi>What ailed thee, O thou Sea,
that thou fleddest;</hi> what ailed thee, O
Jordan, <hi>that thou wast driven back?</hi>
What ailed them? did not God by his
mighty power, without natural cauſes
that could not have ſuch influx upon
the Sea and <hi>Jordan</hi> to divide them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
thoſe Miracles in the Sea and <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan?</hi>
When again it is asked, what ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ye, ye <hi>Mountains that ye skipped like

that ye skipped like Lambs;</hi> muſt not
the ſame anſwer be returned, as to the

Hills and Mountains.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A most tremendous miraculous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the Earth, cauſed by the Lord

into the pit, then ſhall ye underſtand that
theſe men have provoked the Lord.</hi>
Verſe 31. <hi>And it came to paſs as he had
made an end of ſpeaking all theſe words,
that the ground clave aſunder that was
under them.</hi> Verſe 32. <hi>And the earth
opened her mouth, and ſwallowed them up,

Verſe 33. <hi>They, and all that appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, went down alive into the pit,
and the earth cloſed upon them, and they
periſhed from among the Congregation.
Ioſephus</hi> relating <hi>Moſes</hi> his prayer at
large, records, that whilſt he ſpake thoſe
words, and intermixed them with tears,
the Earth inſtantly trembled, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
began to move (after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as when by the violence of the
wind a great billow of the Sea floateth
and waltereth) hereat were all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
amazed: but after that, a horrible
and ſhattering noiſe was made about
their Tents, the Earth opened, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59717:29"/>
up both them, and all that which
they eſteemed dear, which was after a
manner ſo exterminate, as nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
of theirs to be beheld: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
in a moment the Earth cloſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and the vaſt gaping was faſt ſhut,
ſo as there appeared not any ſign of that
which had happened. Thus periſhed
they all, leaving behind them an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Gods Power and Judgments
And this Accident was the more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
in that there were none, no not
of their Kinsfolks or Allies, that had
compaſſion of them; ſo that all the
People whatſoever, forgetting thoſe
things that were paſt, did allow God's

in Heaven, moſt brightſome and flame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by the force and power whereof
thoſe Two hundred and fifty (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Core</hi>) were ſo conſumed, that
there ſcarce appeared any relicks of

untouched, to the end it might appear
that this fire came from Heaven. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this might ſerve for ſtrong convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that as God ſent down fire by his
own immediate power, that was not of
any Creatures kindling, to the conſume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one Company; ſo he did as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſhake and open the Earth
without ſecond Phyſical Cauſes for the
ſwallowing up of the other. Let A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts
either contradict this Hiſtory
and Matter of Fact, or believe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of a Deity. And all Men fear and
tremble to provoke ſuch a juſt and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That there are <hi>Earthquakes</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cauſed by the <hi>immediate</hi> hand of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59717:30"/>
God, without thoſe Natural Cauſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
by <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> will be clearly
evidenced by the <hi>miraculous Victory</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Hoſt of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> obtained
by two Men, <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his <hi>Armour
Bearer,</hi> related 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. where to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the immediate workings of
God might be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>great number</hi> of the Hoſt of
the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſituation</hi> of their Camp or
Garriſon. <hi>Joſephus</hi> deſcribing it, ſaith,
That the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had pitched their
Tents on an high pointed Rock, which
extended it ſelf in length with three
Angles, and was each way begirt with
a Bank, as it were a Wall, and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
againſt the Incurſion of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
The place was fortified by
Nature, ſo that no Man might aſcend
or aſſail them, but with diſadvantage.
And Sacred Scripture records that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>
climbed up upon his hands and
his feet, and his Armour Bearer after
him.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59717:30"/>
3. That there were <hi>but theſe two
Men</hi> that invaded their Camp, who at
firſt ſlew about Twenty of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(as it were) about half an Acre of
Land, which filled their whole Army
with terrour and amazedneſs, who (as
<hi>Joſephus</hi> writes) caſting away their
Weapons, fled amain: ſome other being
ignorant, which were either their Friends
or Foes, invaded one another as Enemies:
for imagining with themſelves that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two <hi>Hebrews</hi> durſt never aſcend and
enter their Camp, they addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to their mutual Murder and
Slaughter; ſo that ſome of them were
ſlain, others fled to eſcape the Sword,
and fell head-long down the Rocks.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In this exploit of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> God
did miraculouſly work, in cauſing the
<hi>tremblings</hi> that fell out that day, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
1 <hi>Sam. 14. 15. And there was
trembling in the Hoſt, in the Field, and
among all the People: the Garriſon and
the Spoilers they alſo trembled, and the
Earth quaked, ſo it was a very great
trembling.</hi> Who made all the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59717:31"/>
Hoſt to tremble, the <hi>Garriſon</hi> and
the <hi>Spoilers</hi> to tremble, only <hi>Jonathan</hi>
and his Armour Bearer? was it not God?
and was it not the ſame power of God,
that then made the Earth to quake, that
made the other tremble? To put all out
of doubt, the laſt words declare the
true cauſe of all; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and <hi>it was a trembling of God.</hi> The
reaſon why the <hi>Tranſlators</hi> rendred it
<hi>a very great trembling,</hi> is, becauſe the
word [God] is added oftentimes to ſet
forth the greatneſs of things; as great
Mountains, great Ceders, great Fire,
in <hi>Hebrew</hi> are ſaid to be Mountains of
God, Cedars of God, a Fire of God. But
this is but the ſecundary and conſequent
ſignification of it; the Name of God
added to any thing primarily and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
denotes that God is the efficient
Cauſe of that to which it is added. It
was a trembling of God, that is a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
ſent and cauſed by God; the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the Earth, was from God: So
the Heathens were wont to attribute
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59717:31"/>
that fear and trembling, of which no
Cauſe did appear, nor could be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to ſome of their Gods, as to <hi>Pan,</hi>
whence came the expreſſion of a <hi>Panick
fear.</hi> This trembling then of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi>
and this trembling and quaking
of the Earth, was from the immediate
hand and mighty power of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From the <hi>immediate hand</hi> of God
was that terrible Earthquake that was in
the days of <hi>Vzziah:</hi> Amos 1. 1. <hi>The
words of</hi> Amoz—<hi>which he ſaw concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Iſrael, <hi>in the days of</hi> Uzziah <hi>King of</hi>
Judah—<hi>two years before the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake:</hi>
This is mentioned <hi>Zach.</hi> 14—
<hi>The Earthquake in the days of</hi> Uzziah
<hi>King of</hi> Judah. Concerning this ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Providence, I will take in theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Uzziah</hi> greatly provoked
God by going into the Temple to burn
Incenſe upon the Altar of Incenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Azariah</hi> the Prieſt, and Fourſcore
Prieſts of the Lord (valiant men) went
in after him, and withſtood him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>It appertains not unto thee,</hi> Uzziah,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59717:32"/>
               <hi>to burn Incenſe to the Lord, but to the
Prieſts the Sons of</hi> Aaron, <hi>that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
to burn Incenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Uzziah's</hi> wrath againſt the Prieſts
was greatly incenſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. While he ſhewed his anger againſt
the Prieſts, the Lord by his own <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi>
hand ſmote him with a Leproſie,
which appeared in his Forehead.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Upon this all the Prieſts thruſt
him out from thence; yea, he himſelf
haſted alſo to go out, becauſe <hi>the Lord
had ſmitten him,</hi> 2 Chron. 26. 16. to
22.</p>
            <p n="6">6. At the <hi>ſame time,</hi> and for the <hi>ſame
ſin</hi> was this <hi>Earthquake</hi> in the days of<hi>Uzziah.</hi> And why may not the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi>be attributed to the immediate
hand of God, as well as his being ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with Leproſie. That this was at the
ſame time, and for the ſame ſin, and ſo
from the <hi>ſame hand</hi> of God, <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in
his Hiſtory doth make plain: who wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
thus; Uzziah <hi>upon a certain ſolemn
Feaſt-day, wherein all the People were
aſſembled together, he attired himſelf in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59717:32"/>
the High Prieſts Veſtments, and entred
into the Temple to offer Sacrifice unto
God upon the golden Altar, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the High Prieſt</hi> Azariah<hi>(accompanied with fourſcore Prieſts) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
him the ſame, telling him that
it was not lawful for him to Sacrifice, in
that it was only allowed in thoſe that
were of the Poſterity of the High Priest</hi>Aaron. <hi>Whilſt after this manner</hi> Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah<hi>expoſtulated with him, commanding
him to go out of the Temple, and not to
contradict the Ordinances of God; the
King waxed wroth, and threatned to take
his Life from him, except he kept himſelf
quiet. Whereupon there fell a great
trembling and Earthquake, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cleft in twain, and a great Light of
the Sun entred thereunto, and reflected
on the King's face in ſuch manner, that
all his Body was inſtantly covered with
a Leproſie, and before the City (in a
place called</hi> Eroge<hi>) the half of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(that ſtood to the Eaſtward) brake
and fell, and rowled and removed for
the ſpace of four</hi> Stadia <hi>(or Furlongs)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59717:33"/>
towards the Oriental Mountain, where it
reſted: ſo that the publick ways were
ſhut up, and choked, and the King's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of Pleaſure were wholly ruinated
and disfigured. When the Prieſts beheld
the King's face covered with a Leproſie,
they told him what inconvenience had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to him, and enjoyned him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of the Town, according to the
cuſtom of Men that were polluted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
he (wholly confuſed at ſo grievous
an accident, and having no more audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſpeak) obeyed the Commandment
that was given him, enduring a pitiful
and lamentable puniſhment, for being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and proud, more than became huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and for that he committed ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
againſt God. Finally, he died
through grief and diſcontent—and was
only buried in his Garden.</hi> This Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
came, and this Leproſie was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on him for that ſin; the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
is expreſly ſaid in Scripture to be
from the Lord; why not alſo then the
Earthquake?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59717:33"/>
By the way, let this be obſerved by
many, that in our days, without the
way appointed by God in his Word, in
the pride of their hearts and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
thruſt themſelves into Sacred Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which is not lawful but for thoſe
that are competently qualified and duly
called thereunto, leſt for ſuch doings

Death of Chriſt, an Earthquake muſt be
acknowledged to be one:</hi> all of which
were Teſtimonies, not only of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
but alſo Demonſtrations of his
Deity. The whole Creation groaned
and travailed in pain, when the God of
Nature, (he that was God as well as
Man) tho' not as God, died a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
curſed, and painful Death; Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
wrought in Heaven above, in Earth
beneath; all Creatures ſympathizing
with a ſuffering Chriſt, except Man,
for whom alone he ſuffered. The Sun
was darkened, the Vail of the Temple
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59717:34"/>
was rent in twain, from the top to the
bottom, and the Earth did quake, and
the Rocks rent, and the Graves were
opened, and many Bodies of the Saints
which ſlept, aroſe, and appeared unto
many, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 45, 51, 52, 53. Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do affirm, that by this Earthquake
not only <hi>Golgotha,</hi> but the whole City,
and the Regions near were terribly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and ſome, that in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and
in <hi>Thracia,</hi> certain Towns were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown;
but how far this Earthquake
was extended is uncertain.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Amongſt theſe alſo muſt be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Earthquake at the Reſurrection of
Christ;</hi> Matth. 28. 2. And <hi>behold there
was a great Earthquake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Of the ſame Nature was that,
when the <hi>Apostles</hi> were praying, the
place where they were, was ſhaken, God
giving them, by this Miracle a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that their prayers were heard:
<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 31. <hi>And when they had prayed,
the place was ſhaken where they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
together.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> word
properly ſignifies to be moved up and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59717:34"/>
down, like the Waves of the Sea, and
is the ſame with that in the preſent
Text, where it is ſaid, by the Earthquake
<hi>the foundations of the Priſon were ſhaken,</hi>
which alſo I reckon to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe that are cauſed miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and immediately by God, without
thoſe Cauſes that others are produced
by.</p>
            <p>What may be inferred and learn'd
from this?</p>
            <p n="1">1. May we not learn the <hi>certain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of the Deity?</hi> Doth it not follow
there is, and muſt be a God? if we may
argue from an Effect to a Cauſe, when
there is an Effect that cannot be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to any Creature, muſt there not be
a Being that is, and is no Creature?
when things are done, that are not done
by finite power, muſt there not be an
infinite power by which they are done,
when there is no <hi>medium</hi> betwixt that
which is finite and that which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite?
when any thing is effected, of
which no natural Cauſe can be named,
muſt there not be a ſupernatural? <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59717:35"/>
at God's command ſtretched out
his hand with his Rod, and ſmote the
Duſt of the Earth, and it became Lice
in Man and in Beaſt; all the Duſt of the
Land became Lice throughout all the
Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and when the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
did ſo with their Inchantments to
bring forth Lice, and could not, did not
theſe Magicians themſelves ſay unto
<hi>Pharaoh, This is the finger of God?</hi> Exod.
8. 17, 18, 19. When there have been
ſuch ſhakings of the Earth that no Man
can ſay, and prove what he ſaith, that
they were done by ſecond Cauſes, may
not, ſhould not every Man ſay, in theſe
was the finger of God? If you cannot
gather there is a God by what he doth
by Creatures, cannot you conclude
there is a God, when things are done,
and not by Creatures?</p>
            <p n="2">2. May we not learn that <hi>this God
never wants means to effect whatſoever
he pleaſeth?</hi> What he doth not do by
ſecond Cauſes, he can do without them.
<hi>Jonathan</hi> (when one of theſe <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi>
happened) ſaid, <hi>It is all one with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59717:35"/>
God to ſave by few or by many,</hi> 1. Sam.
14. 6. So it is all one with God to
ſave by few or none; and to do what he
will with means, or without them.
When he doth not ſhake the Earth by
Cauſes got into its Bowels, he can and
hath ſhaken it without. And indeed, if
he brought it out of nothing without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inſtrumental Cauſe (for in Creation
there can be none) why may he not,
when it is created, ſhake it till it trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
without any inſtrumental Cauſe?
cannot he that doth the greater, do the
leſs?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hath God made the Earth to
tremble without any Natural Cauſes,
<hi>have not ungodly Men cauſe to tremble
even then, when there is no viſible ſign,
no reaſon from any Natural Cauſes to fear
puniſhment and ruine?</hi> Is not their own
ſin as meritorious of God's Wrath and
ſore Diſpleaſure, with the thoughts of
God's infinite hatred of it, and his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power to puniſh it, a ſufficient
reaſon why they ſhould fear, and quake
and tremble? what tho' they live in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59717:36"/>
ſuch places and parts of the World that
are not ſo ſubject to <hi>Earthquakes</hi> as
ſome other places are? Will they
ſay</p>
            <p>Firſt, We live upon that part of the
Earth that is <hi>only ſtony and hard,</hi> and
not ſoft and tender, and therefore no
fear the Earth ſhould quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
under us?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Will they ſay we dwell
upon that part of the Earth that <hi>hath
not thoſe Caverns,</hi> in which thoſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
that cauſe Earthquakes are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
therefore we are in no danger?
In the Body of Man winds and vapours
are ſooner and more ſtirred in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
and hollow parts thereof, than in the
hands, and bones, and more cloſe and
ſolid Members: In ſubterraneous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,
rather then in cloſe and rocky
places, is the matter of an Earthquake;
but ſuch is not that part of the World
where we inhabit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Will they ſay we live in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Towns,</hi> and not near the Sea, which
are moſt obnoxious to ſuch Earthquakes,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59717:36"/>
becauſe ſuch places are more eaſily filled
with Vapours, therefore we need not
fear?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Will they ſay, Let them
live in fear of Earthquakes where the
Earth they live upon is both ſoft and
full of Caverns, and near the Sea, as moſt
liable thereunto. Let them quake, when
the Earth doth not, becauſe it is ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in ſuch places to ſuch trembling
fits; but our Habitation is on hard and
rocky ſolid places, without ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities,
and in the midſt of the Land
remote from Sea, and therefore ſecure
enough. Did you ſpeak true before you
were aware, when you ſaid, you were
ſecure? Yes; and let me add, your
heart ſeems to be more ſtony, and rocky,
and hard than the place you boaſt you
live upon; as if God's Arm were ſo
ſhort, he could not reach you; as if
your Mountain ſtood ſo ſtrong, it could
not be moved nor ſhaken. Do not you
know, have you not heard, that God
hath ſhaken the Earth by his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
hand, without thoſe Natural
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59717:37"/>
Cauſes, and Rocks and Mountains too.
Fear to ſin, ceaſe to provoke the Eyes
of his Glory, for he can reach you with
his own hand, and ſhake your ſtrongeſt
Tower by his own might, without other
Cauſes.</p>
            <p>Queſt. III. <hi>What are the Natural
Cauſes,</hi> material and efficient, <hi>of an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
and how may it be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Concerning the <hi>Material</hi> Cauſe
there are divers Opinions amongſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.
Seneca</hi> in his ſixth Book of
Natural Queſtions reckons up many:
Some ſay the Cauſe is from <hi>Water,</hi> ſome
from <hi>Fire,</hi> ſome from the <hi>Earth</hi> it ſelf,
and ſome from <hi>Spirits</hi> [not Immaterial]
ſome, in <hi>more of theſe,</hi> and ſome <hi>in all
of them.</hi> Some of theſe <hi>Seneca</hi> doth
confute, and eſtabliſheth: his own
Opinion concerning Spirits. That you
may not miſtake the word [Spirit] in
this place, which is taken otherwiſe
than in Divinity, as the <hi>Souls of Men
and Angels are called Spirits;</hi> let thoſe
that are not acquainted with the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59717:37"/>
Phyſical</hi> acceptation of it; take
this Explication of it, according to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</hi>
Exhalations [or riſings up] are
either from <hi>water,</hi> and then they are
called <hi>Vapours;</hi> or from the <hi>earth,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which hath a <hi>fat</hi> or <hi>oiley</hi> moiſture,
and then are called <hi>fumes,</hi> or <hi>ſharp,</hi> tart,
<hi>moiſture</hi> and <hi>volatile Salts,</hi> and theſe
they call <hi>Spirits.</hi> And then ſaith, That
from theſe Vapours, fat or oily Fumes,
and Spirits, which being ſhut up in the
deep and large Caverns of the Earth, in
great abundance, and by ſome cauſe or
other, once, or oftner kindled, in one
or more places, ariſeth an Earthquake,
once, or often at ſeveral times, which
according to the variety of its cauſe,
maketh the Earth to tremble, or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
whereby ſometimes whole Cities
and Countreys are either overturned or
ſwallowed up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rohault</hi> in the third part of his <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks,</hi>
gives this account: If an hollow
Place or Vault under ground ſhould be
filled with Exhalation very groſs, not
much unlike to that which ariſeth from a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59717:38"/>
Candle newly put out, and at once
take fire, by the ſpreading and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it ſelf, it would raiſe and lift up
the Earth above it, much like to Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder
put into digged places, that lifts
up the Earth above it, but afterwards,
when the Exhalation is ſcattered, that
which was lifted up, by reaſon of its
own weight, muſt neceſſarily fall down:
and hence are theſe tremblings of the
Earth: yea, it might ſo happen, that
many ſhakings may follow one forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if there be more hollow places
that are near each other, or any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of way are ſo joyned as to make
the one partake of what the other hath,
and the Exhalations filling them, may
ſucceſſively take fire. Yea, there may
be an hollow place under ground ſo
large, and the fall of the Region above
it (being like an Arch or a Vault) ſo
great, that it might cleave aſunder in
the midſt, and gape, whereby the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
parts are depreſſed, and made
much lower than they were before,
whence it appears how whole Cities
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59717:38"/>
by one only Earthquake might be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtole Lib. 2. Meteor.</hi> proves that
Exhalations are the cauſe of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From a ſimilitude taken from Mens
Bodies, in which there are ſometimes
ſuch Convulſions, Shakings and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings,
that many Men can ſcarce hold
ſuch a one, the cauſe whereof are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
hot and dry. In like manner, when
the vaſt Body of the Earth is moved, it
is to be referred to Exhalations, which
are hot and dry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Before an Earthquake there is
ſomething diſcerned, as an aſcending
Fume, reſembling a long Line, which
Fume is the thinner Exhalation, which
begins to get forth: but the reſt of the
Exhalations, by reaſon of their greater
denſity and ſtraightneſs of the Paſſages,
are reſtrained within the bowels of the
Earth, from whence an Earthquake doth
ariſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſaith in his time there were
ſome Earthquakes in <hi>Pontus,</hi> before
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59717:39"/>
which the Earth did ſwell, and at laſt
did burſt, or was broke aſunder; which
was a certain ſign of Exhalations ſhut
up and ſeeking their way out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Derodon</hi> judgeth it more probable
that Earthquakes do ariſe from a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
inflammation of ſulphureous [Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone-like]
and bituminous [ſomething
like Pitch, or fat Slime] Vapours which
are kindled in the Caverns and hollow
Places under ground, not much diſtant
from the Surface of the Earth, which
according as the Caverns are, and as the
matter of the Flame is more or leſs, do
variouſly operate; for the moſt part
they effect nothing, if the Earth be
more looſe, and hath breathing holes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
which they may get out: ſometimes
they move it more gently, and make it
tremble, if the bulk above it be greater,
that this ſubterraneous Flame can aſſay,
attempt and do no more againſt it
ſometimes they ſhake and overturn, by
reaſon of their greatneſs, and reſiſtance
of the parts of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59717:39"/>
               <hi>Zanchy,</hi> although he embraceth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>'s
Opinion, yet ſaith it cannot be
denied, but that many Earthquakes have
been cauſed by <hi>Fire</hi> ſhut up in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
of the Earth, ſeeking a paſſage out,
and he inſtanceth, there was in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Veſuvius;</hi> and another Mountain,
from which in his time fire brake out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which, many days there were great
and many fore-going Earthquakes. He
denyeth not, but that alſo they may
ariſe from Air ſhut up in the Earth,
ſeeking a paſſage out, but cannot find
it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Natural <hi>Efficient</hi> cauſe is the
vehement ſtriving of ſuch Vapours in
the Caverns of the Earth, that they
may get forth, whereby they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
upwards and downwards, one while
this way, another, that.</p>
            <p>Beſides, what is ſaid before, an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
is commonly thus deſcribed: <hi>An
Earthquake is a Meteor ariſing from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
Exhalations ſhut up in the
bowels of the Earth, which while they
ſeek a paſſage out that they may aſcend,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59717:40"/>
but cannot find it, cauſe the Earth to
ſhake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. IV. <hi>What are the ſeveral ſorts
or kinds of Earthquakes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is difference amongſt <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi>
in this point, ſome making <hi>two</hi>
ſorts or kinds of Earthquakes, as <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidonius</hi>
and <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> ſome <hi>three,</hi> as
<hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Zanchy.</hi> Some <hi>ſeven,</hi> which
laſt they thus diſtinguiſh and nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Earthquake of one ſort is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or an <hi>Inclining Earthquake,</hi>
when the Earth is cauſed to incline one
way, like a <hi>Ship</hi> upon the Sea, or a
<hi>Boat</hi> on the River, when laden more
on one ſide than the other, leans that
way only, where the greater weight
and burden is laid. In this kind of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
a Room ſeems to be lifted up on
one ſide, and ſink down or depreſſed
on the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, An Earthquake lifting the
Earth upright, and by and by letting
it down again, after the manner of
boyling Water, or waxing hot.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59717:40"/>
3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Earthquakes cauſing
Chaſmes, Chinks, Openings of the Earth,
making Breaches in it, and tearing one
part from another.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Earthquakes, which by
force break their way, and the Vapours
and Winds do get out of the bowels of
the Earth, which ſometimes take with
them Rocks, or Mud, or open a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fountain, where there was none
before.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Earthquakes, which by one

overturn whatſoever they come
upon, or ruſh againſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Earthquakes which
make the Earth, and things upon it to
incline ſometimes one way, and then
another back again, without falling any
way, like the rocking of a Cradle,
by reciprocal motion or turning.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Earthquakes that come
with a great noiſe, roaring, and bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
much like to the lowing of Kine,
and ſometimes like the vehement and
fierce crying of Women.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59717:41"/>
Others reduce theſe to three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a trembling Earthquake,
when the Earth quivers like a man in a
fit of an Ague. This kind of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
is when the Vapour in the Earth
is not much.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is an Earthquake which
moves the Earth upwards, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
downwards. This by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s
followers is called <hi>Pulſus,</hi> like the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a man's Pulſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is an Inclining Earthquake,
when the Earth is ſo ſhaken, that the
Houſes may be diſcerned ſometime to
lean one way, and then to return back
again, moving ſide-long to and fro.
<hi>Zanchy</hi> relates, that this kind he ſaw at
<hi>Ravenna;</hi> when the Walls of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the upper part of the Houſe were
moved out of their place, and did ſo lean
one way, that they ſeemed as if they
would fall, but again they returned to
their own place. Oh this is (ſaith he)
the great and wonderful Providence of
God. <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Remark, that in the
<hi>Trembling</hi> Earthquake there is not ſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59717:41"/>
much danger, as in the ſhaking or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it <hi>upwards and letting it down,</hi>
nor ſo much danger in <hi>this</hi> as in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining</hi>
Earthquake, becauſe except the
motion be ſpeedily made back again
from the ſide to which it leans to the
other, the fall and ruine will neceſſarily
follow. And theſe Earthquakes of theſe
different and divers motions, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from different and divers cauſes.</p>
            <p>Queſt. V. <hi>What are the</hi> uſual Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Signs <hi>oſ an approaching Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
given by Natural Philoſophers,
which by Obſervation and Experience
they commend unto us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe ſigns of Natural Earthquakes
be ſure and conſtant, let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and let us reflect whether any
ſuch were taken notice of by any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the late Earthquake in <hi>London,</hi> and
in other places; if not, either theſe
Philoſophers are under a miſtake, or
we muſt judge, that this late ſhaking
of this City was from the more Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Hand of God; if there were, yet
the preſence and working of ſecond and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59717:42"/>
natural cauſes, ought not to take us off
from the minding and obſerving of the
firſt, for as much as all the ſecond are
at the Command, Ordering, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of the firſt, and are all under the
Government of the Providence of God,
and the Voice and Call of the firſt and
ſecond Cauſes is, that we ſhould Repent
and turn from thoſe ſins that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
him to ſuch ſore Diſpleaſure, to
ſo great Wrath and Anger, as to make
the Earth to ſhake and tremble under
us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One fore-going ſign of an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
they teach, is, a certain troubling
of Waters in the deepeſt Wells, and in
Fountains, having then a Tincture of
a Sulphureous taſte, and an infected and
ſtinking ſavour: Becauſe from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
commotions the Waters in
the Wells muſt needs be troubled.
Therefore it is reported of <hi>Pherecides</hi>
the Philoſopher, that by Water drawn
out of a Well, he fore-diſcerned and
foretold the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> the Ruin of
the City by an Earthquake.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59717:42"/>
2. When the Sea doth ſuddenly ſwell,
not being cauſed ſo to do by Winds and
Waves, when the Air is ſtill and calm,
and no blaſts of Winds, yet on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Sea ſwells, and the Ships there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
do ſhake: The reaſon is, becauſe
then the Earth in the bottom of the Sea
is moved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When Birds ſit trembling on the
ground, forſaking Trees, becauſe they
perceive a certain trembling, ſhaking
the Trees and the Roots thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When there are great and terrible

that the moment before they

be ſo very near. I leave to all to judge,
and to their own thoughts, whether
<hi>this Earthquake</hi> did ariſe from Cauſes

them exceeding dreadful where they
come?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reaſon may dictate to us what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Effects, what diſmal Work Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
when they have a full Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from God to execute his Wrath,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59717:43"/>
do make. Our Ears have heard the
Miſeries of multitudes of Perſons, the
overthrow and ruine of Towns, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Countries: But thoſe that
have ſeen them would ſpeak of them
more ſenſibly, and ſet them forth more
fully. It might make our fleſh to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to hear of the woful devaſtations
that the trembling, ſhaking, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Earth hath cauſed in many
Ages, in many places; but ſuch as did
ſee, and feel, and ſuffer by them, have
contended with the Earth, whether it
or they ſhould tremble moſt. Oh, the
Cries and Shriekings! Oh, the doleful
Lamentations! Oh, what bitter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
have been poured out, and wiſhes
in vain have have been uttered in the
time and places of devouring and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Earthquakes! When we ſhall hear
ſome of theſe effects (tho' not written
of according to the fulneſs of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
wherewith they are done) let us
ſympathize with the poor miſerable
People (yet left) in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and pray
that their Judgment might not come

their hearts with fear.</hi> When God
makes the Earth to ſhake under them,
he makes their hearts to tremble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them. When the Earth ſhakes and
moves they cannot ſtand upon it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

thouſand Heart-quakes. Did not
many thouſand People in <hi>London</hi> in its

or rented to ſhelter you from Storms
and Tempeſts, ſhould bring that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
upon you, which many Storms
and Tempeſts had not done? Have not
you of late years heard terrible and
roaring Thunderings, God thundering
with a Voice which none can imitate?
Have you not ſeen great Flaſhings of
Fire and Lightnings, which made the
Night like Day, that you ſaid you could
ſee to take up a ſmall thing from off
the ground, and were not you then
glad you had an Houſe over your head?
But when this late Earthquake was,
were not you afraid becauſe you had
an Houſe over your head, when you
thought it would fall upon your head
and whole body? And when this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
was, did you not make as much
haſt to get out of it, as in Storms and
Tempeſts you ever did to get into it?
Is this already forgotten? What! ſo
ſoon! It is hard to expreſs the fears
that many then were filled with, and
it is ſad to ſee how little God is feared
ſince by many that then did fear ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59717:45"/>
much. Beſides your own late Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Sacred Scripture, as well as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
Writers, do Record the fears
of Men in times of Earthquakes. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
14. 15. <hi>There was trembling in the hoſt,
in the field, and among all the people:
the gariſon and the ſpoilers, they alſo
trembled, and the earth quaked: ſo it
was a very great trembling.</hi> Behold!
a quaking Earth, and therefore a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
People. Behold! Valiant Men of
War, that are not afraid of Swords and
Bullets, but with undaunted Courage
aſſault their Enemies, and when many
lie dead on both ſides, fight on with
boldneſs, that fear not ſo much the
ſhaking of Spears and Pikes, as the
ſhaking of the Earth; the Hoſt tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the Gariſon trembled, and the
Spoilers themſelves did alſo tremble.
Spoilers tremble! What! thoſe that
had ſpoiled ſo many upon the Earth,
they tremble leſt they ſhould be ſpoiled
by the quaking Earth. The Hoſt, the
People, the Gariſon, the Spoilers, and
Earth did tremble, ſurely it was a very
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59717:45"/>
great trembling. <hi>Mat. 27. 54. When
the Centurion, and they that were with
him, watching Jeſus, ſaw the Earthquake,
they feared greatly.</hi> Captains, Men of
great Spirits, at the quaking of the
Earth are filled with great fear. <hi>Mat. 28.
2. Behold, there was a great Earthquake.
4. For fear of him</hi> (the Angel, whoſe
Miniſtry God uſed to cauſe that Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake)
<hi>the Keepers did ſhake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
as dead men:</hi> An Earthquake is ſo
terrible, cauſing ſuch frights and fears,
that makes Men (as the ſaying is)
look like Death. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 26. <hi>And ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
there was a great Earthquake.</hi>
29. <hi>He</hi> (the Jaylor) <hi>called for a light,
and ſprung in, and came trembling.</hi> The
Gaol trembled, and the Jaylour trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
When the Keeper ſaw he could
not keep the Priſon-doors ſhut, but
when he had ſhut, and lockt, and made
them faſt, the quaking of the Earth
did open, he could not keep himſelf
from trembling. An Earthquake will
make even a Jaylour to tremble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59717:46"/>
But why ſuch fear and trembling in
Men, when ſuch-ſhaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
in the Earth?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In ſome,</hi> it may ariſe <hi>from appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of the terrible Wrath of an
angry God.</hi> There have been ſome
Earthquakes that were Tokens of God's
Grace and Favour; as the Earthquake
ſhaking the Foundations of the Priſon,
in favour to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> teſtifying
that God had heard their Prayers made
in Priſon, and that by it he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them, as he did. And that in <hi>Acts</hi>
4. 31. the Apoſtles prayed, and at their
Prayers the place was ſhaken; the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the place made them ſtand the
faſter in their Faith in God, and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him. But uſually Earthquakes
are indications of God's Wrath and ſore
Diſpleaſure. When Men run on in ſin
againſt God, to ſhew his Indignation
againſt it and them, he ſometimes will
not ſuffer the Earth to ſtand ſtill and
quiet under them. <hi>Pſal. 18. 7. The
Earth ſhook and trembled; the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
alſo of the Hills moved and were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59717:46"/>
ſhaken, becauſe he was wroth.</hi> When Men
apprehend that God is provoked, and
they may apprehend it, when God in
ſuch a terrible manner doth ſhew it,
knowing they are no more a Match
for God, than a Worm is to an Angel,
or a Child to a Giant; it may put
them into ſuch amazing Frights and
Fears, ſaying, God is angry, what ſhall
we do? The Omnipreſent God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
whither ſhall we go? The Juſt
and Holy God is angry, with what can
we appeaſe him? He doth ſhew his
Anger, and we do ſee it, and how ſhall
we eſcape? God is wroth, and the
Earth trembles before him: God is
wroth, and is come down in ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
and the Earth quaketh at his
Preſence; our Heads are giddy, but
not with Wine; we reel, but not with
ſtrong Drink. <hi>O ſtay your ſelves, and
wonder; cry ye out, and cry, they are
drunken, but not with wine, they ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but not with ſtrong drink,</hi> Isa. 29.
9.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59717:47"/>
2. <hi>Conſciouſneſs of their own guilt:</hi>
When the Earth did quake, it did not
only wake the Jaylour out of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſleep, but alſo out of his ſpiritual
ſlumber; Conſcience was alarm'd, as he
was affrighted; his Eyes were opened
to ſee a terrible God above him, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
was awakened to ſee his ſins
within him, and that had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him, an angry God above, an
accuſing Conſcience within, and the
quaking Earth under him, filled him with
fear and trembling. When Men do
proſper upon Earth, they can ſwill, and
ſwear, and ſin in all their ways, and
Conſcience holds its peace, is quiet and
ſtill, doth not reprove, accuſe, judge or
condemn them; but when Judgments
come, an hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will cry
out, <hi>I have ſinned;</hi> a wicked <hi>Saul</hi> will
confeſs and ſay, <hi>I have ſinned:</hi> and when
an Earthquake comes, is not he an
hardened, ſeared Wretch, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
(though bad yet) is quiet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, when the Earth is not quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him? and whoſe Conſcience is not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59717:47"/>
moved and troubled for his ſin, when
the Earth is moved, as being reſtleſs
under the burden of ſuch ſinners? but
if Conſcience then doth ſtir, when the
Earth doth tremble, the ſinner trembles
(for the time) conſidering God's anger,
remembring his ſin, that did provoke
him to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If neither apprehenſions of God's
wrath againſt them, nor ſenſe of ſin
committed againſt him, doth fill them
with fears at the quaking of the Earth,
yet <hi>apprehenſions of death at that time
might make them tremble.</hi> Death is the
<hi>King of Terrors,</hi> Job. 18. 14. Shall not
that which is (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) the
moſt terrible, when it is approaching in
ſo terrible a manner, make the ſtouteſt
heart to quake? If they have no
thoughts of Hell and Damnation, yet
Death by the trembling of the Earth
preſents it ſelf unto their thoughts:
and though they would not think of it,
yet they muſt; though they would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
their minds from it, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
they cannot ſend theſe thoughts
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59717:48"/>
away till another ſeaſon: tho' many go
to Hell without fear of Hell, and ſeldom
think of it till they feel it, yet when
Death ſeems to be coming to them by
an Earthquake, it almoſt kills them with
the terrour of it, being ready to die
with fear of ſuch a death.</p>
            <p>There are theſe Circumſtances in this
Caſe that fill men with theſe ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
fears upon the account of
Death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſudden ſurprizal.</hi> An Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
comes ſuddenly in a minute;
many times without notice and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as this in <hi>London</hi> lately did; and it
ſeems to bring Death with it, and often
doth; now an Evil that ſuddenly comes,
doth the more amaze, when in a minutes
time, there is not ſpace for Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
their thoughts, and fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with actings of Reaſon, or Grace
(which alas! are not ſo ready) againſt
advancing Death. In ſickneſs Men have
time to prepare and make ready for it,
and to allay the fears thereof; but in a
moment to be in danger of Death, the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59717:48"/>
fears are more raging and predominant,
and leſs help againſt them. Fear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a remedy muſt be great fear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſuddenneſs of Death,</hi> and the
apprehended nearneſs of it. The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
did not only ſeize them on a ſudden,
but threatens to remove them ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
What! die ſo ſoon! what, within
a minute or two? will Death ſtay no
longer? can it not a minute more be
delayed? what! ſo ſoon ſtep into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
ſo ſuddenly, muſt I haſten into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
everlaſting World? I never did
ſo ſuddenly remove from one Houſe to
another, and muſt I now ſo ſuddenly
remove from one World into another?
from a temporal into an eternal World?
and yet not ready to leave this, nor to
go into that? It is hard to imagine the
power and ſtrength of fear that muſt
invade and fill them in ſuch diſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The unavoidableneſs of Death</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in an overthrowing Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
augments their fears, or torments
them with deſpair of Life. If a Man
be ſick, the means he uſeth keeps up
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59717:49"/>
his hope of Life, and the more he hopes
he ſhall live, the leſs are his fears of
Death. But in a deſolating Earthquake,
what hopes can Men have? whither
can they in a minute go to eſcape the
ruine? what preſent Friend can help
them, when they and their Friends are
in the ſame equal danger? when one
muſt not die without the other? If they
ſtay within doors they apprehend they
may be killed with the fall of their
Houſes: if they run out, they know
not but they may be deſtroyed with the
downfal of their Neighbours. Will
they haſten into the open Fields? what!
in a minute? alas! they have not time
allowed for ſuch an eſcape, or if they
had, there the Earth in an Earthquake
might ſwallow them up. No where ſafe,
every where in great fear.</p>
            <p>4 Apprehenſions of ſudden, unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Death, and this when <hi>they are in
health and ſtrong</hi> aggravates their caſe,
and augments their fears. What! am I
well, and yet muſt die? ſtrong, in health,
and yet now muſt die? hath Death for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59717:49"/>
its old way of ſending Harbingers
before it, before it came it ſelf? did it
uſe to ſend its Serjeants to arreſt, before
it caſt Men into the Priſon of the Grave,
and muſt I be haled away without Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons?
Some have been weaned from
the love of Life, and made weary of it
by long and languiſhing Sickneſs, by
wracking and tormenting Pains, and
muſt I in my Youth, or in middle Age,
under no pain, with my ſtrength firm,
yield to Death? All this doth fill with
greater fear.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This unuſual way of dying</hi> makes it
the more terrible. Others, in other
caſes, firſt die and then are buried, firſt
expire and then are carried to their
Graves; but in an Earthquake muſt I
be buried alive? firſt buried and then
die? others are carried from their houſe,
when dead, unto the grave, and muſt
mine own houſe be my grave, and that
while I do live? Behold! the Earth
quakes under me, my Houſe trembles
over me. Oh! what if my trembling
Houſe ſhould fall, and I in it? what if
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59717:50"/>
the Earth ſhould ſink under me? what
if this quaking Earth ſhould open its
mouth, and eat me up alive? what if it
ſhould cleave aſunder (as in its ſhaking
it hath ſometimes done) and ſwallow
me up as it hath done thouſands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
when others die another way,
doth this loving Mother lay their dead
Bodies in her boſom, muſt I die this way,
and go down alive into her bowels?
did I live in my Mothers womb before
I was born, and muſt I live (awhile) in
this common Mothers bowels, after I am
therein buried? This being not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
death of all Men, makes it more
terrible to thoſe that apprehend in an
Earthquake they muſt not die as others
do. All laid together, ſhews that Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
cauſe great conſternation of
mind, perplexing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fretting fears, which
is the firſt Effect thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly; Another Effect of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
is <hi>ſpeedy and precipitant flying,</hi>
if poſſibly Men might haſten from the
danger thereof. Tho' they leave their
Gods behind them in their Houſes, they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59717:50"/>
will attempt to fly to ſave themſelves.
<hi>Numb. 16. 32. The Earth opened her
mouth and ſwallowed them up, and their
houſes, and all the men that appertained
to</hi> Korah, <hi>and all their goods.</hi> Verſe 34.
<hi>And all</hi> Iſrael <hi>that were round about
them fled at the cry of them: for they
ſaid, leſt the Earth ſwallow us up alſo.</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5. <hi>And ye ſhall flee to the
valley of the Mountains—yea, ye ſhall
flee like as ye fled from before the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
in the days of</hi> Uzziah <hi>King of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.
Theſe were particular Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
and ſome by flight eſcaped
from them; but when it ſhall be more
general, or fall out in the place where
you dwell, and ſome miles about you,
when it comes in a minute, whither will
you flee? or to what place will you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten,
or in ſo little time how will you get
thither? however, Men ſhall endeavour
to flie, tho' it ſhould be in vain; when
the Earth ſo moves, they cannot, they
will not ſtand ſtill to be devoured and
ſwallawed up, if by flight they might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
which they will try, tho' they be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59717:51"/>
overtaken with it. Overtaken! alas!
in ſuch a Judgment, you may ſooner
run into it, than run from it; you may
think to leave the danger behind you,
and ſtill it is before you; you running
away from it, may run to meet it. But
the Danger is ſo dreadful, the Death ſo
formidable, the Miſery ſo great by
Earthquakes, that Men will flee from
them if they can, that they might not
periſh in them. But better repent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and turn from ſin to God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them, than to continue in the ſins
that do procure them; for when they
come, you will find it hard to flee from
them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; Another Effect is the
<hi>cleaving aſunder of the Earth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
and ſwallowing up many Perſons
in a ſhort time.</hi> In other Judgments
People die one after another, in this by
multitudes. When Death by ſickneſs
puts a period to Life, each one hath his
own Grave; in this opening the Earth
by Earthquakes, one great Grave is
made for many, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 31, 32, 33.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:59717:51"/>
Fourthly; Another Effect is the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Houſes, Towns, and Cities,</hi>
with the deſtruction of their Inhabitants
together. Hiſtory abounds with many
ſad and grievous Examples hereof. When
<hi>Trajan</hi> was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> there hapned a
moſt terrible Earthquake that deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many Cities and People, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it ſelf very far. Great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Lightnings were before it, then
great and unuſual ſtorms of Winds, then
ariſing a great and ſudden Noiſe, the
Sea wrought, the Waves ſwelled, the
Earth was ſhaken, Buildings trembled,
ſome did burſt aſunder, and others firſt
lifted up, fell down. A great and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Noiſe was heard, Walls by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
motions driven ſometimes this
way, ſometimes that were broken and
fell, the Sea with boiſterous ſtorms did
mount and toſs to and fro; the Earth,
where no Buildings were, was greatly
moved: ſuch a thick duſt was raiſed,
and ſo great a darkneſs upon all, that
that they could not ſee one another, nor
ſpeak, nor hear one the other, and by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59717:52"/>
reaſon of the violence of the Wind,
and greatneſs of the duſt, could ſcarcely
breathe. Trees pluckt up by the roots
were caſt down upon the ground, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
very many were covered with the
overthrow of Houſes and Walls, many
falling upon one another died, if any
hurt by wood or ſtone, went away thus
with their torn and wounded Bodies,
they were more miſerable than the reſt,
foraſmuch as they could not live long,
nor yet quickly die: of multitudes of
Men ſcarce any eſcaped without ſome
hurt. One might be ſeen to flee with his
Shoulder broke, another with his Arms
loſt; many laid dead with their Heads
ſeparated from their Bodies; ſome with
their bruiſed Breaſts vomited Blood. Still
the Earth continued to ſhake both by
Night and Day: in this great Calamity
they could find no remedy, nor way of
eſcape: thoſe that were hurt with the
fall of Houſes died in many places, and
tho' by the benefit of Vaults and roofed
Places ſome were preſerved, yet, the
Earthquake continuing, they periſhed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59717:52"/>
by hunger and famine, before any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
could be brought to them. When
the Earthquake ceaſed, ſome went upon
the Ruins, where they heard a Womans
voice, and the crying of an Infant; the
Ruins had covered both the Mother and
the Child; it was wonderful how the
Mother ſhould have Milk to nouriſh her
Child; but Mother and Child were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſafe out. But whilſt the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and fall'n Houſes were more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently

wind and motion to purifie it; this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when it doth exhale and breath out,
or break forth, doth infect the Air, and
Men by taking in that infected Air, are
inſected by it. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſhewing the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence
to be an Effect and Conſequent
of an Earthquake, mentions how that
after an Earthquake in <hi>Campania,</hi> ſix
hundred Sheep died of an Infectious
Diſeaſe. Wonder not at this, ſaith he,
for after great Earthquakes the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
doth uſe to follow, the Air being
corrupt thereby, and Sheep holding
down their heads ſo continually ſo near
the ground, and taking in the poiſonous
Air that is ſo near the Earth, are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with it. This alſo would have been
hurtful unto Men, if a greater quantity
of it had come up out of the Earth, but
the largeneſs of a more free and purer
Air purgeth that before it riſe ſo high
as to be drawn in by Men. In Scripture
Earthquakes and Peſtilence are ſet down
together, as ſore and heavy Judgments;
God grant that <hi>London, England,</hi> and all

places that have been ſhaken by this

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> Yet ſuch is the greatneſs
of the Power of God, that <hi>if he pleaſed
he could remove the whole Earth out of
its place.</hi> He that made it all, could
make it all to tremble and quake; yea,
he that by his Word brought it into Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
can by his Power ſhake it into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
What cannot be done by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59717:55"/>
Cauſes, might be done by Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Power. This is the meaning
of <hi>Job</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Who ſhaketh
the earth out of its place, and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
thereof tremble.</hi> An Earthquake
is the ſhaking of the Earth in its place,
and cauſeth it to tremble upon the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
thereof. We have no inſtance that
God ever yet removed the whole Earth
out of its place; but it is a <hi>Suppoſition,</hi>
if the Lord will, he is able to do it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Concl. How far an Earthquake may
extend it ſelf, cannot be determined.</hi>
Men, if they can give an account of the
extent of Earthquaks paſt, yet cannot
limit the ſpace of ſuch as yet may be
Tho' <hi>Seneca</hi>ſaith, an Earthquake never
reached above two hundred Miles, yet

wherein <hi>Aſia, Hungary Germany, France,</hi>
and <hi>Italy</hi> trembled almoſt in the ſame

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Concl. Sometimes there may be an
Earthquake in ſome particular place, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59717:55"/>
not in others near unto it.</hi> The Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
which ſhaked the Foundations of
the Priſon where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> lay,
did not extend it ſelf to other places.
God that can cauſe the Rain to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one City, and not upon another, can
make one City ſhake when he doth not
another.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Concl. The duration and continuance
alſo of an Earthquake is uncertain.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it may laſt but a Minute or two,
more or leſs; ſometimes it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
Weeks, Months, Years, as ſome
Writers do affirm. So ſome tremblings
of the Earth continued after the great
damage by the Earthquake in <hi>Jamaica</hi>
in <hi>June</hi> laſt paſt. If the Vapours ſhut
up in the Earth, be more groſs, they
do more ſlowly evaporate or get out,
and more difficultly find their paſſage.
If they be more cold, they are alſo more
ſlow. If they be in greater quantity,
the Earthquake may be of a longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
for much is not ſo ſoon eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated,
as a little. The Nature of the
place alſo wherein an Earthquake is, may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59717:56"/>
cauſe the longer or ſhorter duration of
it; for if the ſurface of the Earth, in
whoſe Caverns the matter of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
is contained and ſhut up, be more
ſolid, cloſe and leſſer holes, chinks, and
pores be in it, the Earthquake laſts the
longer, by reaſon of the more ſlow and
difficult evaporation of the matter that
cauſeth it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Concl. An Earthquake may in a few
Minutes deſtroy and overturn multitudes
of Houſes, and ſweep away thouſands of
People.</hi> Thus the Intelligence from<hi>Jamaica</hi> runs: <hi>On the 7th. of</hi> June, <hi>1692.
about 12 at Noon happened here [</hi>Port-Royal<hi>]
a moſt terrible Earthquake: It
was moſt violent on the Harbour-ſide,
where the Houſes all ſunk down in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
time, from the depth of three to
five Fathom Water; in the Streets next
the Wharf, the Earth opened it ſelf wide
and deep, and inſtantly guſhed out an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
of Water, ſo that many of the
Inhabitants were drowned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some People being ignorant of the
Nature of an Earthquake, and what
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59717:56"/>

off the ſenſe both of the Judgment and
the Mercy, becauſe it laſted ſo ſhort a

in being conſumed by Fire, when many
Houſes were preſerved, yet by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
in a few Minutes it might have
been all deſtroyed: The preventing
whereof was the wonderful Mercy and
Providence of God, never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Concl.</hi> Sometimes an Earthquake
<hi>may be once in ſome parts of the Earth,
and not return again, ſometimes it may
repeat its courſe, and often put the ſame
places into many trembling fits.</hi> When
the ſhaking is over once, the bitterneſs
of God's Wrath, and our Ruine might
not be paſt; if the ſhaking of <hi>London</hi>
ſhould be reiterated, the latter might
be more grievous than the former. All
theſe ſecond Cauſes are ordered and
over-ruled by the Providence of God:
All the Natural Cauſes of Earthquakes
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59717:57"/>
are ſubject to God's Power, and are at
his beck, command, and call; therefore
tho' <hi>London</hi> be ſafe after its late ſhaking,
yet let it not be ſecure, for the ſame
Hand and Power of God that did ſhake
it once, can again, and throw it down.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Concl.</hi> As all <hi>Places</hi> are liable to
be ſhaken by the Mighty Power of God,
immediately, or by Natural Cauſes at
his Command, ſo all, or any <hi>Seaſons</hi> of
the Year might ſubſerve his Providence,
and be the Seaſon of an Earthquake's
coming, whether Spring or Autumn,
Winter or Summer, Night or Day, or
hour of the Night or Day. Tho' Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts,
that do eye the ſecond Cauſes,
ſay, they more uſually happen in the
Spring and Autumn, but eſpecially in
the Autumn; and in the Night, and at
Noon-day oftner than at other times.
But let the Inhabitants of this Earth
fear and tremble before the great God
of Heaven and Earth, and not dare by
their hainous and provoking ſins to ſtir
up his wrathful Indignation againſt
them, who can by Earthquakes make
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59717:57"/>
the Earth to tremble, when and where
he pleaſeth.</p>

his hot Indignation againſt ſin and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

Peſtilences, and fearful Sights, and great
Signs ſhall there be from Heaven.</hi> Is <hi>War</hi>

and did eat him.</hi> Is the <hi>Plague</hi> a wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Viſitation of God? Thoſe that are

may remember the Terror of it. Is an

horror? Or doth it not in ſome reſpects
go beyond them? In <hi>War,</hi> ſtrong Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Fortified places, and firm Walls
may keep out a Beſieging Enemy,
which they cannot batter and overthrow
in many Months, and theſe overturned
by an Earthquake in a few Minutes.
Doth the <hi>Sea</hi> rage, and is tempeſtuous?
Mariners have their Ships, and Men on
Land have their Banks and Ports to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them: but an Earthquake tears up
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59717:58"/>
their Ports, breaks down their Banks, and
makes way for an overwhelming Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and drowneth many. Doth a
conſuming <hi>Fire</hi> burn and turn many
Houſes into aſhes, yet the Inhabitants
by flight might ſave themſelves. But
in an Earthquake, whither will you run
to eſcape the danger? the fire on your
Houſe will not follow you into the ſtreet
or fields, but there the Earthquake might
meet you. Doth the <hi>Plague</hi> go through
a City? doth it go from Houſe to Houſe,
doth it climb up in the Windows? yet
you have your Antidotes againſt it, and
ſome eſcape, being not infected, and ſome
infected, do recover: when it is moſt
ſevere upon the People, it leaveth their
dwellings behind them: when they fall
into their Graves, their Houſes ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their old foundation. But an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
devours Houſes and Inhabitants
too: doth not take them by tens, or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
in a week, as doth the Plague, but
ſweeps all clean away in a few moments.

would take this fair warning! It is his

            <p>In the year 1509. there was a great

            <p>A little before the Wars between the

ſhook ſo terribly, that parts of Rocks fell

               <hi>An. Chriſt. 1169. Febr.</hi> 4. there was
ſuch a vehement Earthquake all over the

<hi>Calabria,</hi> and the wealthy and ſtately
City of <hi>Catana</hi> was ſo utterly deſtroyed
by it, that there was not one Houſe left

Men, Women and Children periſhed in
the ruins thereof.</p>
            <p>In the year of Chriſt 1631. not long
before the troubles of <hi>Naples,</hi> there fell
out a terrible Earthquake in and about

many terrible bellowings, vomited

            <p>All theſe (and there are many more)
are dreadful inſtances of God's great

being more diligent to take up drift-goods than
People, by which baſeneſs many were lost, which
could have been ſaved. In the Afternoon many
Seamen, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> contented
themſelves with what was floating on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
tho' ſome inſtantly entred and rifled ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Houſes. But the following night and day
thoſe Villains were more ſavage and cruel than
many <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Negroes:</hi> robbed all Houſes,
broke in pieces all Scrutores, Boxes, Trunks, and
Cheſts of Drawers, Cabinets, and made ſpoil
of all that was of value in the Town; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to kill ſeveral of the Inhabitants, if any
durſt be ſo bold to ſay, this Houſe was mine.
Our Enemies could not have treated us worſe
than the Seamen. The remainder of us now in
the Town building little holes to ſhelter our ſelves
from the Weather; for all the Buildings are
thrown down in this Iſland, with the Sugar
and Indico Works. God in Wrath hath Mercy,
in ſending us very ſeaſonable Weather, which
we have not had theſe three Years—The Earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quakes
ſeveral times a day, tho' not ſo terrible,
as in the firſt day; for then the Thunders roared
over our heads, and the Earth trembled under
our feet, and the Rocks and Mountains fell, and
Fire-balls fell by day and night from Heaven,

which my Eyes ſaw; ſo that the moſt hardened
Atheiſt might have conſidered that there was
a God, who governed the World.</p>

                  <p>We have an Account from ſeveral parts
of theſe Iſlands of the Miſchief done by the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.
From <hi>St. Anns</hi> we hear of above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Acres of Wood-Land changed into the Sea,
and carried with it whole Plantations; but no
place ſuffered like <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> where whole
Streets were ſwallowed up by the opening Earth,
and the Houſes and Inhabitants went down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
ſome of them were driven up again by
the Sea, which aroſe in thoſe Breaches, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
eſcaped. Some were ſwallowed up to the
Neck, and then the Earth ſhut upon them, and
ſqueezed them to death, and in that manner
ſeveral are left buried with their Heads above
ground, only ſome Heads the Dogs have eaten,
others are covered with Dust and Earth by the
People which yet remain in the place, to avoid
the ſtench. The People tell me, that they hear
great bellowings and noiſes in the Mountains,
which makes ſome very apprehenſive of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Fire; if ſo, it will, I fear, be more
deſtructive than the Earthquake.—</p>

Hath God been ſo severe with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

declare he hath not? that you are yet
alive, doth not this manifeſt that in that
Judgment God remembred Mercy?
I had communicated to me a Letter ſent
by a Miniſter in <hi>Kent</hi> to his Father in
<hi>London,</hi> from which I will extract what
concerns this late Earthquake, that you
may ſee the different Dealings of God
with divers People, and the Relation of
this not like the former.</p>
            <q>—You have heard already (perhaps)
of the Earthquakes being in <hi>Kent,</hi> on
<hi>Thurſday</hi> last, as well as at <hi>London,</hi> and
at other places, but this may confirm you
that it is true, that it hath been here,
as we have been all Eye-witneſſes: and
this particular true Account I can give
you. It ſhook <hi>Leeds</hi> Caſtle (which is but
half a mile from me) ſo violently, that all
in the Caſtle, even the Lady her ſelf,
went out of it, and expected its falling.
One of my Acquaintance was out in a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59717:78"/>
Field at that time, the ground ſhook ſo
under him, that he could not ſtand, and
being forced to lie down on the ground,
was ſo toſſed up and down, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſeveral bruiſes. It was very
much at <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> the People general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leaving their Houſes, fearing they
would fall upon their heads; and it hath
been in moſt places of the County, which
puts us all into a great Conſternation,
but it laſted not above a quarter of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
hour.—</q>
            <p>But here is no downfal of Houſes, not
of one. Here is no Perſons killed, no,
not one. No openings of the Earth, no
breakings in of Waters, turning dry
Land into a Sea. Do not you ſee your
Mercy in the late Judgment? do you
ſay or think, God could not do to you
as he hath done with others heretofore,
or to <hi>Jamaica</hi> of late? inſtead of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Name of God, do not blaſpheme
it.</p>

               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:59717:78"/>
God's gracious proceedings with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and therein with <hi>London,</hi> ſhould
melt our hearts, whilſt his terrible
dreadful Strokes beats others to pieces;
and finding one inſtance of an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake

Mercy to this Land, as if loth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroy

add this before I do conclude, in the

            <q>On <hi>Eaſter-Wedneſday,</hi> being the ſixth
of <hi>Arpil,</hi> 1580. ſomewhat before ſix of the

Earthquake whereof this Diſcourſe treateth.
I mean, not great in reſpect of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of time, for (God be thanked) it
continued little above a minute of an hour,
rather ſhaking God's rod at us, then ſmiting
us according to our deſerts: nor yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of any great hurt done by it within

            <p>That I may conclude, I ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> a ſerious
conſideration of three years (amongſt
others) exceeding remarkable, always to
be remembred and improved by all that
have ſeen them all, and by thoſe that
have been born ſince the firſt and ſecond
of them, but have been told by others
of God's dealing with this City
then</p>
            <p n="1">1. Forget not the Dying year in this
City in 1665. when God did viſit it
with the Plague: Have you forgot,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59717:82"/>
have you not heard how Death raged
then? how it rode triumphant like a
mighty Conquerour, that ſo many durſt
not meet it in the Streets as were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to keep the Graſs from growing in
<hi>Cheapſide?</hi> did it not ſlay heaps upon
heaps, that the living were put to day-labour
to bury their dead? ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
in a week cut off, cut down, and
changed time for eternity: ready or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
muſt away. Death was then in
ſuch haſte, in ſo ſhort time to ſlay ſo
many, that if it did find unprepared per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
it did not, it could not be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with by ſighs and ſobs, by tears and
groans, to ſtay till ſome made themſelves
ready for another world. You that lived
Then and Now, have cauſe to remember
Gods Judgment to others (eſpecially if
unconverted) that died, and his Mercy
to you that live now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Forget not that dreadful burning
year 1666. when the tops of <hi>London</hi>'s
higheſt Houſes were brought down to
fill their Cellars: when the devouring
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59717:83"/>
Flames marched without controul from
Street to Street, drinking up the Water
caſt upon them, and ſcorning all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
that could for ſome days be made
againſt them, till God that ſet bounds to
the proud Waves of the Sea, ſet limits
to the inſulting Flames, ſaying, <hi>Hitherto
ſhall ye go, and no further.</hi> Let the ſight
of your new Buildings put you in mind
your old were burnt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The trembling year 1692. when
your Houſes by an Earthquake trembled
as if they would fall; and you in them
then trembled for fear they ſhould fall.
I have heard there were tremblings of
the Earth in <hi>Jamaica</hi> ſome years more
then once, before the great ſit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion
came by which it was deſtroyed.
Let us take warning by one. In the
year 65, God by one Judgment ſwept
away the Inhabitants, and left their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
in 66 he deſtroyed your Houſes,
and preſerved your Perſons: in 92 by
an Earthquake he threatned both your
Dwellings and your Perſons, but (in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59717:83"/>
mercy) he ſpared both. Oh give praiſe
unto the Lord that he ſpared you and
your Houſes in this Earthquake, and
pray that he would ſhake them ſo no
more.</p>
