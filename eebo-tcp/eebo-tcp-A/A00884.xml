            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Perauenture I gyue them theſe names here, as is vſed in my countre, and yet in other countreyes they haue other names: wherfore ye ſhall knowe, that the ploughe beame, is the longe tree aboue, the whiche is a lytel bente. The ſharbeame is the tre vnder neth, where vpon the ſhare is ſet, the ploughe ſheth is a thyn pece of drye woode, made of oke, that is ſet faſt in a morteys in the plough beame, and alſo in to the ſharebeame, the whiche is the keye and the chiefe bande of all the plough. The plough tayle is that the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande holdeth in his hande, and the hynder ende of the ploughebeame is put in a longe ſlyt, made in the ſame tayle, and not ſet faſte, but it maye ryſe vp and go dowe, and is pyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned behynde, and the ſame ploughe tayle is ſet faſte in a morteys, in the hynder ende of
<pb facs="tcp:22958:9"/>
the ſharebeame. The plough ſtylte is on the ryghte ſyde of the ploughe, whervpon the reſt is ſet, the reſt is a lyttell pece of woode, pyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned faſt vpon the nether ende of the ſtylt, and to the ſharebeame in the ferther ende. The ſheldbrede is a brode pece of wodde, faſt pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ryghte ſide of the ſhethe in the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende, and to the vtter ſyde of the ſtylte in the hynder ende. The fenbreds is a thyn borde, pynned or nayled moſte commonly to the lyft ſyde of the ſhethe in the ferther ende, and to the ploughe tayle in the hynder ende. And the ſayde ſheldbrede wolde come ouer the ſayde ſhethe and fenbrede an inche, and to come paſt the myddes of the ſhare, made with a ſharpe edge, to receyue and turne the erthe whan the culture hath cut it. There be two roughe ſtaues in euery ploughe in the hynder ende, ſet a ſlope betwene the ploughe tayle and the ſtilt, to holde out and kepe the plough abrode in the hynder ende, and the one len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the other.

               <head>¶ The temprynge of plowes.</head>
               <p>NOwe the plowes be made of dyuers maners, it is neceſſarye for an houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, to knowe howe theſe plowes ſhulde be tempered, to plowe and turne clene, and to make no reſte balkes. A reſte balke is where the plough byteth at the poynte of the culture and ſhare, and cutteth not the ground cleane to the forowe, that was plowed laſte
<pb facs="tcp:22958:10"/>
before, but leaueth a lyttell rydge ſtandynge betwene, the whiche dothe brede thiſtyls, and other wedes. All theſe maner of plowes ſhulde haue all lyke one maner of temperyng in the yrens. Howe be it a man maye temper for one thynge in two or thre places, as for depnes. The fote is one: the ſetting of the cul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture of a depnes, is a nother: and the thyrde is at the ploughe tayle, where be two wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that be called ſlote wedges: the one is in the ſlote aboue the beame, the other in the ſaide ſlote, vnder the plough beame, and other whyle he wyll ſet bothe aboue, or bothe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernethe. but alway let hym take good hede, and kepe one generall rule, that the hynder ende of the ſharebeme alway touche the erth, that it may kyll a worde, or elles it goth not truly. The temperynge to go brode and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe is in the ſettyng of the culture: and with the dryuinge of his ſyde wedges, forewedge and helewedge, whiche wolde be made of drye woode. and alſo the ſettynge on of his ſhare helpeth well, and is a connynge poynte of huſbandry, and mendeth and payreth moch plowyng: but it is ſo narowe a point to know, that it is harde to make a man to vnderſtande it by wrytynge, without he were at the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration therof, to teache the practyue. for it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22958:10"/>
muſte leane moche in to the forowe, and the poynt may not ſtande to moch vp nor downe, nor to moche in to the lande, nor into the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe. Howe be it, the ſettynge of the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture helpeth moche. Somme plowes haue a bende of yron tryanglewiſe, ſette there as the plough eare ſhulde be, that hath thre nyckes on the farther ſyde. And yf he wyll haue his plough to go a narowe forowe, as a ſede fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe ſhulde be, than he ſetteth his fote teame in the nycke nexte to the ploughe beame. and yf he wyll go a meane bredth, he ſetteth it in the myddell nycke, that is beſt for ſturrynge. and if he wolde go a brode forowe, he ſetteth it in the vttermoſte nycke, that is beſte for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowynge: The whyche is a good waye, to kepe the bredthe, and ſoone tempered, but it ſerueth not the depeneſſe. And ſome men haue in ſtede of the plough fote, a piece of yron ſet vpryghte in the farther ende of the ploughe beame, and they calle it a coke, made with. ii. or thre nyckes, and that ſerueth for depenes. The plowes that goo with wheles, haue a ſtreyghte beame, and maye be tempred in the yron, as the other be, for the bredth, but their moſt ſpeciall temper is at the bolſter, where as the plough beame lyeth, and that ſerueth both for depnes and for bredth. And they be
<pb facs="tcp:22958:11"/>
good on euen grounde that lyeth lyghte, but me ſemeth, they be farre more coſtly than the other plowes. And thoughe theſe plowes be well tempred for one maner of grounde, that tempre wyll not ſerue in an other maner of grounde, but it muſte reſte in the dyſcretion of the houſbande, to knowe whanne it gothe well.</p>

For yf ſhe be rydden vppon, and ſette vp hotte or tourned out and take cold; ſhe wil caſte her foole, the whiche woll be a greatte loſſe to the houſbande. For ſhe wyll labour, and beare whan ſhe hath fooled, and drawe whan ſhe is with foole, as well as the horſe. It is conuenient for the huſbande to knowe, whanne his mare wolde be horſed. It is the
<pb facs="tcp:22958:48"/>
common ſayenge, that ſhe wyll take the hors within. ix. or. x. dayes, nexte after that ſhe hath fooled: but that ſaying I holde not with, for and ſhe ſo do, ſhe wyll not holde therto, for the hors dothe dryue her to it. But. xx. days after, is tymely ynoughe to brynge her to a hors for ſhe wyl not holde to it, excepte ſhe be kene of horſyng, and that ſhal ye knowe by her ſhap, for that wyll twyrle open, and cloſe agayne many tymes in an houre: and than brynge her to a hors, and let her be with hym a day or a nyght, and that is ſuffycyent. For it is better, to kepe the horſe frome the mares, than to go with them, for dyuers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſpecyally he ſhall be more luſty, and the moo horſe coltes ſhall he gete. But he that hath very many mares, maye not alway attende them, but let them go to gether, and take as god ſendes it. Some men holde an opinion, that if the horſe be put to the mare in the begynnynge of the moone, after it be prime, he ſhall gete a horſe foole. And ſome men ſaye the contrary: that if he be putte to the mare in the olde of the mone, he ſhoulde gete horſe fooles. And I ſaye, it maketh noo matter, whether: for this cauſe I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

And me ſemethe, that thoſe men, that holde that opinyon, ſpeke ſophyſtycallye, that if ſoo be, they layde any wagers thervppon, that they ſhoulde bothe wynne in theyr owne conceyte by this reaſon. Whether it were gette in the newe of the mone or in the olde of the mone, it is a horſe foole, bycauſe a horſe gate it, though it be a felly fole and it is a mare fole, bycauſe a mare fooled it, thoughe it be a horſe colte. And ſo <hi>(Diuerſis reſpectibus)</hi> theyr opynions maye be trewe. But of one thynge I am certayne, that ſome one horſe wyll gette more horſe fooles, than other horſe wyll doo and lyke wyſe, a mare wyll beare moo mare fooles than ſome other mare wyll do, thoughe they be horſed bothe with one horſe.

As if I had a. M. ſhepe to ſell, and dyuers men come to me, and bye euery manne a. C. of the ſhepe, all of one price, to paye me at dyuers dayes. I am agreed, and graunt them theſe dayes. ſome of the menne be good, and kepe theyr promeſſe, and paye me at theyr dayes, and ſome of theym doo not paye me. wherfore I ſue theym at the lawe, and by courſe of the common lawe, I doo recouer my duetie of them, and haue theyr bodyes in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone for execution, tylle they haue made me payment.
