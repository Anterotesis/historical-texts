            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

modeſtly, ſoberly, and chaſtly: That, vpon cauſe of offences, they ſhould ſtudie mildneſſe; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards good men oppreſſed, and patience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt their miſeries: That, by the bond of peace, they ſhould retaine vnitie of ſpirit; And finally, that caſting away the care of earthly eaſements, they ſhould meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indure pouertie, and worldly diſpleaſures, that thus by their doctrine, and example of life, Chriſt might be glorified, the Church increaſed, and their Miniſterie admired.</p>
            <p>And ſurely the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, in all their trauailes ouer the face of the earth, thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the commandement of their Maſter, ſo beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues in all occurrances, but eſpecially in this obſeruancie of difference betweene politicall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement and Eccleſiaſticall orders, that by this note onely they were acknowledged to bee the true Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and followers of their glorified Maſter. For they not onely Preached with puritie the euerlaſting will of God (without intermingling of humane fancies) but alſo, in all places accuſtomed to teach; That vpon earth <hi>Caeſars</hi> (Kings) were to bee acknowledged next vnto God, and to be reuerenced before all other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men; They ſtiled them <hi>their Lords,</hi> payed them tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, made interceſſion vnto God for their welfare; And vnto ſuch as ſpake euill of the Magiſtrate, they threatned reuenge from aboue. From all worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, eſpecially from the abuſe of Armes, they abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Knowing that the twofold ſword of the Church was intruſted to ſaluation and regeneration, and not for diſtruction. So farre were they euen from imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to thinke it lawfull to diſenthronize any King

or Potentate, though a moſt wicked one; either to <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue</hi> his people from their Othes of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> or to proue maſteries with him about <hi>Precedencies.</hi> But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thought it a worke worthy their calling, by the ſpace of two hundred and ſeuentie yeeres, to ſuffer moſt bitter and terrible perſecutions, and thoſe too rather to bee indured by ſtedfaſt faith in Chriſt Ieſus, by zealous calling vpon his Name, and by glorious Martyrdome; then by rebellious impatiencie,<note place="margin">Sanguis marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſemen Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae.</note> and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Meditation of requitall; And all this, not without admirable increaſe, and good ſucceſſe to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For in what Age was the face of the Church more amiable, or liker the head thereof, euen Chriſt Ieſus, then when after his aſcenſion, his Diſciples (ſtriuing to fulfill his Teſtament; and their ſucceſſors, treading in the very ſame footeſteps) Preached faithfully and purely the Goſpel through <hi>Iudaea, Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine?</hi> After that, when ſo glorious and conſpicuous, as when with their fellow labourers, taking their Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes towards other Nations, but eſpecially towards <hi>Rome</hi> (at that time the chiefe Seate of the Empire) and the bordering Regions, they imployed their times in dreſſing, in Planting and in watering the Lords vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, <hi>viz.</hi> From the time of <hi>Linus</hi> to <hi>Siluester,</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Conſtantine</hi> by the ſpace of two hundred and fiftie yeeres, vnder moſt vnſufferable Perſecutions, euen to the loſſe of their liues and deareſt bloods?</p>
            <p>But aſſoone as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> by the diuine prouidence had giuen peace to the afflicted Churches, and that the Biſhops being deliuered from their lurking cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, from Vaults and from dennes, wherein during
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19533:6"/>
the time of Perſecution they had ſafe conducted their bodies, then, I ſay, ſhamed they not to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer to the delights of the world, to vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idleneſſe: to liue a pleaſurable life; to degenerate from the wayes of their predeceſſors, through neglect of Gods word, being wholly ſeduced with carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Then began they to giue coulorable cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Decretals,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> Then began they to deuiſe new appellations of <hi>Dignitie</hi>: To <hi>preferre</hi> one Church before all other, and finally bluſhed not to confound all orders both Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall. Whereupon preſently followed ſo vniuerſall a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Doctrine, Diſcipline and Order, that they no longer ſeemed to repreſent the late Paſtours of the Lords flocke, but rauening Wolues; not Prieſts but blaſphemers; not Doctors but deiectors of ſoules from the ſweete aſpect of the face of God.</p>
            <p>For ſurely, they did not onely obſcure in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maner the ſinceritie of the Chriſtian doctrine by their humane traditions; gaue it ſo great a ſcandall by ſuperſtitious impietie, and heatheniſh inuocation of Soules departed; and ſo wickedly polluted it with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Idolatrie; But all honeſtie and diſcipline be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troden vnderfoote, in all ſeducement and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of veritie, they ſpent their whole dayes in Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticall abuſes, in Wantonneſſe, in Luxurie, in Ribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, in Whoring, in Sacrilege, in Contention, in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancie, in Charmes, in Homicide, and ſuch like tranſgreſſions: And that more is, being poſſeſſed with a diabolical affectation of Gouernment &amp; pride, cleane contrarie to the Diuine commandement, they began
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19533:6"/>
to buſie themſelues in ſecular affaires; to withdrawe their faiths from the ſubiection of Kings, to vſurpe vpon other mens patrimonies; to thruſt in their croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Syckles (and that at aduenture) into another mans Harueſt; to arrogate both Preſences; to challenge the iuriſdiction of both Swords; to tollerate no equall, much leſſe no Superiour; to defraude one of his right, an other of his Honour; to giue Law to Kings, and preſcribe them ordinances; baſely to eſteeme of Emperours, as if they reigned at will; to accurſe them and murder them; To ſet Princes together by the eares; to ſow diſſentions; to patronize factions; to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue Subiects from their Othes of Allegiance; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by their nouell and ſlie Policies, to mooue them to vnlawfull Rebellions: So farre forth, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had once pleaded preſcription in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochments, they more defaced the Maieſtie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, by their diſsimulations, ſlaughters, warre, and ſuch varieties of wickedneſſes, then any forraine or barbarous enemy could haue done by the Sword or violence.</p>
            <p>For to let paſſe the Empire of the Eaſt, ruinated by the cunning and ſlie cariage of the <hi>Romane Biſhops,</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> being firſt expulſed <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and preſently (they againe being oppreſſed by the French) called in againſt <hi>Aſtulphus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> for calling vpon <hi>Steuen</hi> the ſecond for his Subſidy money: Euery man that is any thing ſeene in Hiſtorie, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (the Romane Empire being by the prowes of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, transferred from the <hi>Grecians</hi> to the <hi>Germanes</hi>) how the Emperours of <hi>Germanie</hi> haue beene harried by the incredible ſubtilties and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations

the Popes ſtomack burned againſt <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Apulia,</hi> by <hi>Palcologus</hi> his Orator and Embaſſador, he offereth vnto the Pope his voluntary ſeruice; and withall, to expulſe <hi>William</hi> out of <hi>Italie</hi>; vpon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, If the buſineſſe tooke expected iſſue, that then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the treaty; the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſhould inioy three maritime cities in <hi>Apulia.</hi> Doubt not, I beſeech you, but that he who had already depriued <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> for contemning ſuch religious wares, as are Popiſh Bulls and Curſes, did not ſtraine much curteſie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Articles. Whereof <hi>William</hi> taking notice, and withall ſomewhat fearefull, by his Embaſſadours moueth his holineſſe to hearken vnto peace; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing not only to reſtore vnto the Church, whatſoeuer he had taken away, but alſo that he would adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of his owne thereto: Moreouer, that hee would thencefoorth containe the Romans, rebells to the Church, in their due obedience.</p>
               <p>Theſe were honourable conditions, but that the Pope ſhould not accept therof, the Cardinalls diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, like true men of armes, hoping to reape more crownes by war, then by peace. Whereupon, warre is proclaimed againſt <hi>William.</hi> Hee leuieth an army throughout <hi>Sicily,</hi> landeth in <hi>Apulia,</hi> waſteth the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by ſword and fire, and finally routeth <hi>Emanuel,</hi> who had pitched his Tents not far from <hi>Brunduſium</hi> vnto <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neuent,</hi> where at that time the Pope with his Cardinalls reſided, he gaue ſuch ſharpe aſſaults, that in deſpaire of their liues, he inforced them to ſue for peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> accordeth, and is receiued into fauour, and proclaimed king of both kingdoms, on this ſide and beyond <hi>Pharum</hi>; but vpon oath, that from thenceforth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19533:31"/>
hee would neuer againe infeſt the territories of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thus, as you heare, matters being ignominiouſly compounded, the Pope riding in viſitation through the territories of the <hi>Casſinates, Marſi, Reatini, Narnien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Tudertini,</hi> at laſt ariueth at <hi>Ouieta</hi>; and there is giuen to vnderſtand, that Rome is in combuſtion, the Conſuls doing their vtmoſt to reſtore the City to it former liberty.</p>
               <p>Hereupon groundeth He his deadly hatred againſt <hi>Frederick,</hi> moſt greeuouſly complaining, that being in diſtreſſe between the ſwords of the Romans and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> that contrary vnto his ſuperabundant promiſes, againſt all right, he had forſaken him; yea, that he was now ſo incircled with perils, that he could not liue in ſecurity at Rome: As if the Emperor were a veſſell eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially choſen rather to patronize the Popes wilfull errors and ouerſights, then to defend the innocency of the Chriſtian flock committed vnto his tutelage.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fredericke</hi> taking in euill part many the Popes actions, but eſpecially <hi>the alienation of Apulia, being an appendancy of the imperiall dignity, without his conſent or knowledge:</hi> As alſo calling to remembrance, <hi>That the Pope had wreſted from the late Emperors the right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſtiture of Prelates:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nauel. Gen. <hi>39.</hi>

                  <hi>That by his miniſters hee had impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the ſubiects of the Empire, and by their ſubtill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions of treaſonable practiſes, had done what in them lay, to raiſe ſedition throughout the Empire:</hi> Vpon theſe grounds, I ſay, the Emperours Maieſty now thought it high time to put remedy vnto theſe violent intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon the regalties of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Hereupon hee exacteth an oth of fidelity of all the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19533:31"/>
Biſhops of <hi>Germany</hi>; The Popes Legats (ſuch as were not called in by his good pleaſure) he commandeth to depart the Teutonick kingdom: prohihiteth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple either to appeale or trauaile to the Romiſh Court and in his mandats cauſeth his name to be inſerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Popes.</p>
               <p>Vpon the proclaiming of this Inhibition, it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that a certaine Biſhop in his way from Rome,<note place="margin">Radeuicus li. <hi>3.</hi> ca. <hi>9.10.</hi>
                  </note> (whether as a contemner of the Emperors edict, or vpon any other cauſe, I know not) was taken priſoner, and committed to ward.</p>
               <p>Now hath the Pope found an occaſion by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Biſhop, to fulminate his long-conceiued diſpleaſure againſt the Emperor, and by a proud Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie, ſeemeth only to be agreeued, that the Biſhop is not deliuered from Captiuity; but withall interlaceth, both in his letters, as alſo in the ſpeeches of his legat, many blundering <hi>Items</hi>; which did abundantly inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in what manner he deemed the Emperor to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged vnto him.</p>
               <p>For by his letters he wiſht him to re-conſider, how from him he had receiued the confirmation of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall crowne; and yet did his Holineſſe nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it, had the fauours which he had beſtowed vpon him, been far more beneficiall.</p>

his Empire, if not of the Pope? By the election of the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he hath the name of a king, by conſecration of the Pope, the ſtile of an Emperor, and</hi> Caeſar Auguſtus, <hi>Ergo per Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam imperat.

               </p>

                  <hi>Rome is the ſeat of the</hi> Pope, Aquis <hi>in</hi> Arden <hi>is the Emperors: Whatſoeuer the Emperor poſſeſſeth, he holdeth it whollie of the Pope. As</hi> Zachary <hi>transferred the Empire from the Greeks to the Teutonics: So may the Pope retrans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it from the Almans to the Grecians. Behold, it is in his power to giue it to whom he pleaſeth, beeing onlie conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God ouer Kingdoms and people; to deſtroie, to pull downe, to build and to plant.

Of theſe abuſes the Emperor or euer after made vſe, pretending that the cauſe of his ſo and ſo doing, took originall from theſe ſaucy and malepert ſpeeches of the Popiſh miniſters. And thereupon cauſing the Legats to be ſafe conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their lodging, at break of day hee commaunded
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19533:32"/>
them to be packing; with eſpeciall caution, that they ſhould not rome hether and thether vpon the liuings of the Biſhops &amp; Abbots: but that they ſhould keepe the high way towards the Citie, without declining therefrom either to the right hand or the left. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall reaſon was, that according vnto the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med dog-trick of the Romaniſts, they ſhould not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe their conceiued poyſon of diſcontent ouer all the Churches and Pariſhes of the Kingdome; neither ſtrip the Altars, nor carie away the vtenſils of Gods houſe, nor fliece the croſſes.</p>

Turne ouer the Cronicles, and if you pleaſe not to belieue what I write, there ſhall you finde as much as we affirme. What ſhould then let vs, that we ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act homage and oathes of allegeance from them, which are Gods by adoption, yet hold of vs in regaltie: ſithence that</hi> He, <hi>who was ours and your Master (taking nothing from

Yet, when we ſhall finde them, ſuch as the Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth them; meſſengers of peace, lights to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and impartiall aſsistants to the cauſe of the Humble, then will we not deferre to relieue them with competent ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and neceſſarie prouiſions: meane time you wrong hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, the Princeſſe of vertues, and mightilie ſcandalize your ſubmiſsiueneſſe, by terrifying the conſciences of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, with poſitions wholy impertinent to religion. Let your fatherhood therefore take heede, leſt while you mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion points of ſuch nature (whereof we make light account) that you offend not thoſe, who would otherwiſe euen in hast open their eares as willingly vnto the words of your mouth, as vnto a preſage of a ioyfull accident.

               </p>
               <p>What humane ſpirit can ſcandalize theſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors letters? What ſcruple of equity, of piety, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe can any man ſay is wanting in them? Who

               <p>What followed? Peace I warrant you: nothing leſſe.

that dare but imagine, that this ſtroke procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from caſualty, and not from the finger of God, conſidering that that throat which had but now bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out ſo iniuſt an execration againſt a moſt godlie and innocent Emperor, was alſo appointed the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to confound his ſpirits? Yea this vnſhamed rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being nothing terrified with ſo miraculous a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, could by no meanes be diuerted from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended conſpiracy.

               <p>The Pope, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirteenth was wonderfull deſirous to haue the Emperour performe his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Popeſhip. For, <hi>that it ought ſo to be,</hi> he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <p>Letters hereof were ſent vnto his Maieſty, and meane while <hi>Turner</hi> was eagerly aſſaulted by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals to change opinion; but he was conſtant.

               <p>As for the Emperour, the world knoweth, that here he made it manifeſt, that hee was not bound to giue obedience vnto a Biſhop, his ſubiect, from whome hee expected ſubiection and fealtie: At leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he layde an excellent foundation, towards the reſtitution of the decayed Honour of the Empire, by others to be perfected as God and time ſhall offer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.

For what a greater bleſſing can a Chriſtian man wiſh, then to ſee a Biſhop praying and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abhorring to preſcribe lawes vnto a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Emperour?

Or at leaſt, of ſome ſuch eminent perſon, who for the Honour of his place, or the reputation of vprightneſſe, was of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to aſſemble and ſtirre vp the ſouldiers and people to ſo iuſtifiable an action.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:19533:97"/>But that the Act was executed as well by <hi>perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as <hi>commaund</hi>; It appeareth by that which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: <hi>Ioada the high Priest ſent,</hi>

Beſides, the words, <hi>we will,</hi> or <hi>command,</hi> are accuſtomably vſed by thoſe, who in faction, or in any other publique buſineſſe obtaine the prime-place of imployment.</p>
               <p>What then may be found in this example to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force <hi>Ioadas,</hi> or the Popes omnipotency, for innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of States or Kingdoms?

the fourth. <hi>Otto Friſingenſis</hi> alſo (whom <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> not vndeſeruedly, for his parentage, his learning and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of life, tearmeth <hi>Most noble</hi>) doth relate vnto you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But what miſchiefes, what warres, what hazarding of battailes followed hereupon? How often was miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Rome <hi>beſieged, taken, and ſacked? It greeueth mee to record how a Pope was ſet vp against a Pope, a King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a King. Finally the turmoyle of this tempeſtuous ſeaſon produced ſo many miſeries, ſo many ſchiſmes, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhipwracks of ſoules and bodies, that thoſe times onely, what by the maſſacres of perſecution, and what by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of miſchiefes,</hi> gaue ſufficient arguments to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the infelicity of humane miſery. So that, thoſe daies were compared by a certaine eccleſiaſticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the palpable and darke miſts of Aegypt. For the foreſaid Biſhop <hi>Gregory</hi> was inforced from the Regall City, and <hi>Gibert</hi> of <hi>Rauenna</hi> was thruſt into his place.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto, ſaith one of the tender hearted Romaniſts, that it mought be that <hi>Gregory</hi> did this vpon a good intenſion of the heart, let God iudge; but it can not be defended, that he did it iuſtly, diſcreetly, or by warrant of his calling; but that he erred foully following the humours and counſels of men, in arrogating that vnto himſelfe which was none of his due. Where by the way our aduerſaries may learne in auoiding of ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſtian bloud, that notwithſtanding all the Pope could do by his excommunications, and curſes, for fiue and twenty yeeres ſpace, a great faction of the Clergy and Laytie ſided with the Emperour, ſo that <hi>Gregories</hi> ouerſight could be no ſmall fault, in that he called not into his conſideration; <hi>That it was the office of ſo eminent a pastor to haue ſtudied all the points of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:19533:104"/>
peace and humility, by ſuffering the faults of one man rather to eſcape vnpuniſhed, then to haue ingaged the innocent and harmeleſſe people through his priuate deſire of reuenge, in an Ocean of misfortunes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is manifeſt that all which we go about in the feruour of zeale, and to good intents, is not alwayes done to good purpoſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> in zeale to his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſlew the Egyptian, yet he ſinned. <hi>Oza</hi> in zeale to vphold the Arke of God touched it, and dyed. <hi>Peter</hi> in zeale to our Lord and his maſter ſtroke off <hi>Malchas</hi> his eare, and yet he was blamed. An inconſiderate zeale doth oftentimes produce miſchief and inconuenience.</p>
                  <p>In regard whereof, he ought not to haue excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the Emperour,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi> cont. ep. parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani.</note> in participation of whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſuch multitudes of Chriſtian ſoules were inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed, that without apparant ſchiſme, and diſunion of vnity in the Church and common weale, it could not be remedied. This is but the ſame Councell which for many Ages paſt, that great light of the Church <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> did religiouſly and aduiſedly admoniſh vs of, and prooued the warrant thereof out of the writings of <hi>S.

                  <p>For confirmation whereof let vs take notice how <hi>Hildebrand</hi> behaued himſelfe after the feeling-ſmart of theſe monſtrous miſeries, by his troubled conſcience, and the teſtimony of antiquity, with reiection of bare aſſertions, and cauills of <hi>dubiae fidei.</hi>
