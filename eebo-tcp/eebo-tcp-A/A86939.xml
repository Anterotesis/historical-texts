            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
REPLY
OF
Richard Hutchinſon, Eſquire,
TO
Sir Eliab Harvey's
ANSWER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliab</hi> begins his Anſwer with an Inſinuation, as if the Printed Caſt
was only <hi>In the Name</hi> of <hi>Richard Hutchinſon</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> when it is well known,
that it was Written, Printed, and Publiſhed, by his Direction. Next,
Sir <hi>Eliab</hi> pretends, That the Objection againſt thoſe who Voted for him
without Right, was, That they were made by the <hi>Preſent Bayliffs</hi> to Serve
a Turn: Whereas, the Objection was, That they were made at ſeveral Times,
contrary to a known <hi>By-Law.</hi> And though he ſuggeſts, that but One was made
while theſe Men were <hi>Bayliffs;</hi> it is in Proof, That many were made in their
Time without Right, and that in favour of Sir <hi>Eliab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He affirms, That <hi>None were denied the Taking up their Freedoms which had Right
to require them:</hi> When it will be proved, that ſeveral were denied their Right
till an Action was brought by One of them for ſuch Denial.</p>
            <p>He ſays, the Sixteen <hi>Clergy-men</hi> that Voted for him had Freedoms by Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
(<hi>or otherwiſe</hi>), yet cannot ſhew, that more than One of them had any
Right, but from the Free Gift of them who, by the <hi>By-Law,</hi> were reſtrained
from giving away any Freedoms. Beſides that, it was contrary to the Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptional
Right of the Town; which appears by Record to have been a <hi>Borough</hi> in
the Time of <hi>Hen.</hi> I. and the Indentures of Returns to Parliament have been by
the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> of the <hi>Borough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſays, That <hi>Clergy-men</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformiſt Preachers</hi> Voted for Mr. <hi>Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon;</hi>
when there were but Two, one of which was made Free before the <hi>By-Law,</hi>
and the other as his Son, born after his Freedom.</p>
            <p>He ſays, Every Freeman was called over <hi>according to his Seniority:</hi> which is
quite otherwiſe; it being by a meer Contrivance; by which Sir <hi>Eliab</hi> had Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
One at the Beginning, when there were but Five on the other Side. Nor
was ever any thing with leſs Colour than his Aſſertion, That Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>'s
Friends preſſed <hi>to have the Books of Freedom in their Cuſtody for a Week:</hi> When 'tis
well known, that he was chiefly inſiſted upon it, proffered to proceed to the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
upon the Place immediately, if he might have an Inſpection of the Books
of Freedoms to compare with the Poll; by which it would have appear'd, that
Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> had a conſiderable Majority of True Votes.</p>
            <p>He ſays, All the reſt of Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>'s Paper will appear <hi>Falſe and Frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons.</hi>
But if <hi>Bribery,</hi> among other Things, be proved, as it is not doubted but
it will, certainly this will not appear <hi>Frivolous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it is to be obſerved, That Sir <hi>Eliab</hi> did very prudently,
not to deny that there is ſuch a <hi>By-Law</hi> as is urged againſt him; becauſe, though
it is not to be found in the Books, he cannot but believe, that the examining
into the Tearing it out of the Book, will not make for his Cauſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it was beſt to ſay nothing of it.</p>
