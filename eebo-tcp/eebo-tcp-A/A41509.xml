            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO Two Letters.</head>
            <div n="1" type="answer">
               <p>HAving lately publiſh'd a Book againſt the preſent great grievance of the Nation in Matters of Religion, <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> I mean, and knowing how the Pen-men of that Party are now fallen in a courſe of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from time to time againſt what comes out in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to them, I indeed looked for an Anſwer, but thought they would have gone about to refute my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as 'tis the uſual way of thoſe who follow the School Rules; but I therein find my ſelf diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and am apt to believe that theſe Men do ſo far depend upon what their great Maſters have done, as to think they now may ſit ſtill under the ſhadow of their Works; for <hi>It is plain,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that the moſt polite and rational Modern Sermons and other Moral Diſcourſes, are extreamly beholden to</hi> Socinus <hi>his Works.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 18.</note> Yet inſtead of what I expected, out comes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Curtain and in diſguiſe, one of thoſe Fancies which our <hi>Ideiſts</hi> are ſo fond of, under the name of <hi>An Apology for the Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. and this <hi>in Two Letters by different Hands.</hi> I muſt need fear what will become of me! But Sirs, it is not in you the part of generous Enemies, tho' to ſupport a weak Cauſe, to come Two againſt One; yet for what they have done, 'tis no matter, for Truth and I againſt any two or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108605:3"/>
twenty ſuch Hands: And the Truth now in queſtion, tho' they would have driven it into Corners, hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the upper-hand, and is ſo ſtrongly ſettled, that it hath diſheartened its Adverſaries from making any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon it; and they have choſen to meddle with other things, and leave that untouched.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer no Anſwer, this Apology or Two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, having been ſent me down into the Country, I fell on peruſing of them, to ſee what they contained as to Matters in queſtion and the Cauſe in hand, but 'twas not to be found, and ſo I concluded it to be loſt among them, hardly any Steps thereof being left, only inſtead of it, I lighted upon Reflections and Invectives (which that ſort of Men are full of and very free to beſtow) againſt the Author of the Book: they fly off from the Point and avoid coming to diſcuſs it: What Notion of theirs, can this way of deciding Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, be grounded upon? No Anſwer in the leaſt to any of my Arguments, tho' I had given them a large Field: They being a People not uſually Mute, may not I reaſonably infer, that ſeeing upon things in queſtion they ſay nothing, then they have nothing to ſay, and ſo yield the Cauſe, if not poſitively, yet by a good Conſequence; thus they ſave me the trouble to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute any thing, or to add to what I ſaid upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tho' about it I have many more things to ſay. The Author of the Firſt Letter gives a convincing and ſhort Reaſon, why he Anſwers none of my Arguments, <hi>I thought you an unfit Writer on behalf of the Trinity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 15.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore did not ſo much as read over your Book;</hi> tho' in another place he ſaith, <hi>I have dipp'd into it here and there, and have ſtaged it over.</hi> This is magiſterially<note place="margin">Page 4.</note> enough decided; but there is in ſuch Deciſions more Mercury than Salt: You ſay I am an unfit writer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Matters, and yet you did not ſo much as read over my Book; this is wiſely and learnedly ſpoken, 'tis an unanſwerable Argument, but if you had given any for me to anſwer, I might well have deſired the Reader, by this Paw of yours, to have judged of the Lion, how great a Logician you are to draw Concluſions out of Premiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:108605:3"/>But what would ye have done if there had been no Epiſtle nor Preface to carp at? Then 'tis likely you would have taken no notice of my Book, or elſe why do ye leave the Principal for the Acceſſary? Such a Carriage gives me cauſe to ſuſpect, that ſeeing you take no notice of it, you look upon't as a Morſel of too hard a digeſtion for your Stomach, therefore you meddle not with it: ye Anſwer it not, but Invectives againſt the Author muſt do the work; for indeed whilſt in theſe Letters I was ſeeking for what I could not find, I found what I was not looking for, ſoft Words and hard Arguments from Men who would ſeem to have engroſs'd all Reaſon unto themſelves, I ſought for, but found very ſoft Arguments, if any at all, yet hard Words: Truly Sirs, to Anſwer in your own way, I could almoſt ſay, I have happen'd to tread upon a Neſt of Waſps, ſo had cauſe to expect ſome of them would come out Buzzing about my Ears, that's all the harm they can do me, if they intend any thing more, then I hope they loſt their Point and miſſed their Aim.</p>
               <p>I think that what I ſaid to prove my Aſſertions, might in ſome degree have been taken notice of: but ſeeing they have no mind to meddle with nor remove the Weight, there let it ly for me; yet tho' as to the Matter they offer'd nothing to Anſwer, rather than to be altogether ſilent, we muſt turn to what they other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have ſtarted up, tho' not belonging to the Subject of my Book: They act like thoſe who ſhot at a Man from behind a Hedge, and ſo think they may with ſafety to themſelves wound their Enemy who cannot well cloſe up with them; for they, with being name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and in their holes, have taken ſufficient care to provide againſt it, and none can ſwear againſt them. Ye are the Men: However, becauſe ſuch Men would call one dumb, who ſhould ſay nothing to their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations and Miſconſtructions, tho' never ſo groundleſs, I ſhall by the grace of God take notice of moſt things in the Letters, and therein hope to clear my ſelf of their Aſperſions, alſo to demonſtrate how they are guilty of ſome things which they would charge me with, or of the ſame nature, and I ſhall examine what here and there they ſay about Matters in queſtion: Sometimes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108605:4"/>
I ſhall Anſwer both Letters together in thoſe things which tend to the ſame purpoſe, and at other times aſunder and as I ſhall ſee cauſe: however I ſhall not do't in order, but here and there according as I light upon the things in the Letters, which I intend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine one after another.</p>
               <p>With an idle and ridiculous Fancy of an <hi>Apology,</hi> they would bring me under a neceſſity of making my own: <hi>Fervency of Zeal for the Glory of God,</hi> is the<note place="margin">Page 3.</note> firſt thing and in the firſt Line, laid to my charge; but this, <hi>Paul</hi> brings me off when he ſaid, <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected always in a good thing:</hi> And that<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 18.</note> the thing in queſtion which I appear for, is Good, very Good, I appeal not only to Scripture, but alſo to the Teſtimony of the whole Primitive Church, of all Chriſtian Proteſtant Churches, ſpecially of our Church in this Kingdom; and if according to their Principles of a private Judge I muſt have it within me, I want it not; for in my Conſcience I am ſo fully ſatisfied it is Good, that thorough God's Grace ſtrengthning me, I am ready to lay down my Life, and that's for the ſame Cauſe for which my bleſſed Saviour laid down his, and ſo many more after him, namely that he was truly, that is in a true and proper ſenſe, God's own and only begotten Son: and when upon this Cauſe of his, Men are <hi>neither cold nor hot, he ſpueth them out of his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, out comes a volley of Traſh, the product of an elevated Fancy and inflamed Imagination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by things of Moment are wreſted and ridiculed, tho' may be, the Party takes it for a great piece of Wit: and whether I will or not, he would make me to ſay that which I never ſo much as thought upon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would make of it a Stage-Play, tho' very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid and profane, he brings me in as <hi>Poſtponing the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Glory of God,</hi> as he ſaith, to Temporal Concerns; how this can agree with what he ſaid juſt before of my fervent Zeal for that Glory, let him declare: I think by means of the word <hi>Poſtpone,</hi> I may underſtand ſomething of the Writers meaning, and I believe ſome among them could tell News, how it came to paſs that my Book which was intended to have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108605:4"/>
by <hi>Candlemas</hi> Term, for all the endeavours uſed to haſten it out, came forth only the day before the Prorogation: I have cauſe to ſuſpect there was ſome tampering by a ſort of Men diligent in their Concerns and of unwearied Endeavours to promote their Cauſe, for <hi>the Children of this World are in their generation</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>wiſer than the Children of Light:</hi> I doubt ſome of them plowed with my Heifer, however let none boaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time, for thorough God's direction that which laſt Year was not done, as indeed for that reaſon it could not be, may happen to be done this; however to God we leave the Succeſs.</p>
               <p>Yet as in my Preface I gave an account of the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Care which the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> had taken to put a ſtop to your damnable Hereſies in that Kingdom; ſo now I muſt tell that which ye know well enough, but may be every one elſe doth not, how in <hi>Ireland</hi> about the beginning of <hi>September</hi> laſt, the Committee for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion having examined the Carriage of one of your Gang, M. <hi>Toland,</hi> who, no doubt, was gone over to promote the Cauſe, and made their Report to the Houſe, immediately they paſſed a Vote, that his Book ſhould be burnt by the hand of the Executioner, and his Perſon taken into Cuſtody to be proceeded againſt; but he finding the Place too hot for him, made a ſhift to eſcape and come over, or elſe he had been laid up, but we hope here he ſhall either be followed by divine Mercy, or meet with human Juſtice; for we have ground to think that the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> with as much Zeal as thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> and of <hi>Ireland,</hi> will appear for the Cauſe and Honour of God, and as one of the Wolves hath been unkennel'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo that ſame and others, ſhall here be ſo too: and 'tis but what all obſtinate Leaders of ſuch miſerable wretches who deny the Lord that bought them, do juſtly deſerve, to be branded with B, that every one might know them for Blaſphemers by reaſon of the blaſphemous, heretical, and impious Opinions, which thoſe deſpiſers of God, with impunity, whereat they grow bolder, do daily publiſh and ſpread abroad, and that in ſo bold and licentious a manner, as was hardly ever allowed in any Chriſtian State. The Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> left a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108605:5"/>
Precedent in ſuch caſes, for by a Law he ordered the fifteen Volumes which impious <hi>Porphiry</hi> had written againſt the Chriſtian Religion, every where to be burnt and deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>And indeed 'tis but what the Anti-Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of ſuch Miſcreants as were <hi>Celſus, Porphyrius, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Apoſtate and the like deſerve to be: their Works were levelled againſt the true God in the moſt Holy Trinity, and againſt the Perſon and Divinity chiefly of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, and are not the <hi>Socinian</hi> Books ſo too? The like Crime deſerves the like Puniſhment; this I ſpeak in commendation of the Zeal and Juſtice of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Something more I muſt ſay, and tho' I am ſure to be diſowned by <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Socinianizers,</hi> yet I hope not ſo by thoſe who are really concern'd for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the glorious Trinity and for their Religion; 'tis this, It were but Juſtice and Chriſtian Prudence, if the Pen-men of the <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Doctrines were burnt at the Fingers end, to diſable them from dropping their Poiſon upon Paper: if only paring their Nails could do't, it would be well; but I am of opinion, that alone will not do't, nor Goſpel-Arguments, but the Authority of the Law muſt: and this the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> in their Wiſdom have found neceſſary, and being ſatisfied how things of that nature come within the compaſs of their Juriſdiction, tho' M. <hi>Toland</hi> in his Letter to a Member of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> there, <hi>pag.</hi> 32. declares he is a perfect ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to any ſuch Power claim'd by that Honourable Body, tho' in himſelf, he was conſcious he might not ſay ſo in the Original Copy: and his Apologiſt is of the ſame opinion, tho' he more cunningly meddles with it, and brings it in as the Judgment, as he ſaith, of ſeveral Members of the Committee, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. Which are but Reflections inſinuated againſt the Right of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in general, and ſo reaches every Parliament whereſover. But there are ſeveral Flaws in that Apology.</p>
               <p>Here I meet with ſome Apologiſt whom I know well by the Stile, tho' others of the kind make uſe of the ſame Ink; ſuch are in jeſt Apologiſts for Parliaments,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108605:5"/>
but in earneſt, againſt; indeed I think that to ſtudy that common place, and to erect themſelves into Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts, conſiſts with their own Intereſt; for on their ſide, there is more need of Apologies than of Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks. But I muſt ſpeak of other things.</p>
               <p>Both Writers come upon me with a Charge indeed, I am a Sanguinary Man, a Brother to Papiſts, a <hi>Bonner,</hi> a Perſecutor, a bloody-minded Believer, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words to the ſame purpoſe: I ſhall not ſay this is much Duſt, but great Thunder-claps, which ſhall end like crackling of Thorns under the Pot. The ground of all this is my Humble Addreſs to both Houſes of Parliament, that they would be pleaſed to take ſome care of the Cauſe of Chriſt, and to put a curb upon his Enemies; ſuch I call thoſe who would rob him of his Divine Nature and Attributes, and attempt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the firſt Article of our Faith, of One God in Three Perſons. There are ſome Men in the World, that if one doth but look them in the Face, they are apt to cry out, Murther, whether or not at that time a guilty Conſcience flies into their Faces, God knows; That ſame may happen ſometimes to diſturb them ſo far, as to make them groſly miſtake in their Judgment as about Things ſo about Perſons, as they are very much in me, who in my Heart and Opinion am as much againſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution upon account of Religion, and for a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to tender Conſciences, as any Man in the World. When the Queſtion is about indifferent and not very material things, then for Peace and Charity's ſake, Gentleneſs and Meekneſs ought to prevail, but it muſt be otherwiſe when Fundamentals are not only ſhaken but overturned; and when Religion it ſelf is pulled up by the very root, as 'tis when humane Reaſon is made a ſtanding Rule whereby to judge of Revelation, when the Doctrines of the moſt Holy Trinity, of the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath by the Sacrifice of himſelf made for our Sins, with other things thereupon depending, and what Scriptures with the received <hi>Creeds</hi> of the Primitive Church do affirm about it, and what our Church believes; I ſay it ought to be otherwiſe when all theſe lie at ſtake and are blown up at onc<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108605:6"/>
we ſee, how boldly and openly theſe things are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on: We uſe to ſay, <hi>There is a difference between mad and ſtark ſtaring mad;</hi> People diſtemper'd in their Minds, are dealt withal according unto the nature and degree of their Diſtemper; ſome confin'd to their Chambers, others to their Beds, others bound and chained up: The like we obſerve in the Diſtempers of the Politick Body; he who raſhly ſpeaks ill of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment deſerves ſome Puniſhment, but not ſo great as he who violently attempts to overthrow it, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Perſons in whoſe hands God hath lodged the Power; ſo it muſt be in ſpiritual Diſeaſes which affect the Body of the Church; and theſe ſeveral ways I mean, when I ſpeak of a true and proper Remedy, whereof the applying depends upon the Skill of the Phyſician; 'tis not any effect of Cruelty, to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions, and cut off dead Fleſh out of a Wound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Gangrene, nor to reſtrain People that have the Plague from coming among thoſe that are free from it, for fear of infecting them: So 'tis no Perſecution to take care that Hereticks, (ſuch all Orthodox Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches take <hi>Socinians</hi> to be) do not come in among thoſe that are ſound in the Faith: This great Danger may in a due reſpect and humble way be repreſented to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Power, whoſe Office is to prevent and remedy Inconveniences. This I humbly conceive to be a Branch of the Right of the Subject, and it may not be called, To preſcribe them what to do; they cannot be every where, nor know every thing, therefore ſtand in need of being informed: this is the uſual courſe of Juſtice; for no Redreſs when no Complaint is made; and I was ſo far from preſuming to preſcribe therein, that in my Epiſtle, <hi>pag.</hi> 18. I declare againſt it.</p>
               <p>All that are no <hi>Socinians</hi> are agreed how their Tenets about the moſt holy Trinity are heretical, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently contrary to the Doctrine of the Church, as by Law eſtabliſhed: Now the Laws of the Land do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any thing to be publiſhed that is contrary to it; it is known to all, how <hi>Socinians</hi> do in Print, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, daily publiſh their blaſphemous and heretical Opinions, whereby they break the Law, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is good to ſay, they deſerve to be puniſhed, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108605:6"/>
do all Law-Breakers; and I hope they cannot pretend to come in within the Act of Indulgence; tho they deny their Opinions to be heretical, yet that's not enough for them to be accounted innocent; for 'tis very rare to ſee a guilty Man, when he is lyable to, and ſure of Puniſhment, to confeſs his own Guilt, yet his bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal doth not free him from it; for if to deny was enough to clear, no Man could be found guilty.</p>
               <p>Both Authors of the Letters are very angry, and much cry out againſt what I ſaid about a Field of Honour, which is, in relation to the Cauſe, to be defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its Enemies, and not to any capital Puniſhment, which had been an imprudent thing of me, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my inclination, to have ſuggeſted againſt Hereticks; but theſe Gentlemen, who often call me hot and fiery, haſtily skipp'd from the <hi>Second</hi> Page of my Epiſtle to the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> of the ſame, to make the Field of Honour to be <hi>Smithfield:</hi> Theſe two things are written too far aſunder, to be joyned together, as indeed there was in my thoughts nothing like <hi>Smithfield,</hi> when I was inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, that as God's Work is glorious, ſo the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offer'd to promote it is as a Field of Honour, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the place, and what there I mentioned of one who for <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> ſuffered in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> was not of my own, but in conſequence of a Citation out of <hi>Sir</hi> Thomas Ridley'<hi>s View of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Laws,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Againſt ſuch is provided Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:108605:7"/>The true and ſhort account of the buſineſs is this; Things being in the ſtate and condition as I repreſent in my Epiſtle and Preface, I looked upon it as a Duty incumbent upon me as a Chriſtian, with what little ſtrength God hath given me, to lay it out in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the moſt juſt and beſt Cauſe in the World, namely, the due Honour of the moſt holy and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Trinity, and the Divinity of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, and of the Holy Ghoſt, which ſo many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Martyrs have freely ſhed their Blood, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly laid down their Lives for: I went not about to ſupport it with <hi>enticing Words of Man's Wiſdom,</hi> or with ſtudied, affected, pompous Expreſſions, which only bad Cauſes ſtand in need of; but as <hi>our Faith</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>doth not ſtand in the Wiſdom of men, but in the Power of God,</hi> ſo I endeavoured with good Arguments drawn out of his Word, which hitherto remain unanſwered, to confute Hereſie and Sophiſtry: One muſt not ſo much mind Words and Stile, when the Queſtion is about Things. Thoſe Men who mind more how they ſay than what they ſay, deſire their own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more than the Good of others: In a Declamation one hath more Freedom of Stile than in difficult and deep Points of Divinity, Philoſophy, and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; certain Matters are not adapted to a lofty Stile; they that are ſo fond of this more than of the other, are like thoſe who prefer the Shell before the Oyſter, or the Stone before the Kernel. Now to come to that which concerns me, I ſay, it being no evil thing to promote a good Cauſe by all lawful means, for Right and Favour to countenance it, are not incompatible, not to be wanting in any thing depending upon me; the Parliament then ſitting, and I knowing how there are ſeveral honorable and worthy Members who lay to Heart the Glory of God, wherein the good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth conſiſt, with all due Reſpect in an Epiſtle Dedicatory I humbly commended and offered it to the ſerious Conſideration of both Houſes, in hope that this might happen to be a means, amidſt their application to the great National Concerns of another nature, to draw their Eyes towards this Cauſe, thereby to bring a Bleſſing of God upon their Proceedings; for the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108605:7"/>
greater the Emergencies and Occaſions are, the more need of God's Favour, which may be procured no better than with doing ſuch things as are acceptable in his ſight, as is the care of his Honour and Service.</p>
               <p>After I had done the moſt, and in my Book about ſeveral Points proved the Falſhood of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> I thought I might ſhew the Neceſſity of a Remedy, and endeavour to ſet to work as many Hands as I could; and as no Man may deny it to be the Concern of a Parliament (for every new one doth appoint a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Religion) to look into things belonging to't; always neceſſary, but ſpecially when the moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental part of the Doctrine of the Church by Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, is daily, publickly, and in print ſtricken at; ſo I thought I might humbly addreſs to both Houſes, as the undiſputably competent Judge of ſuch things, wherein I think I have done nothing contrary to the Laws of God and of the Land, nor to the Rules of Charity, and ſo deſerve not the hard Names nor ill Language given me, by thoſe who have no better Argument to defend a bad Cauſe, for all their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good nature, and to throw Duſt into Peoples Eyes, only to ſhuffle off the matters in queſtion.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that Society of Men are againſt all manner of reſtraint in matters of Religion, they would have every one believe and profeſs what ſeems good in his eye; and ſo of the Church, which is the Houſe of God, to make a meer <hi>Babel</hi> and Confuſion without Order and Rule, which Frame will at laſt rend in in pieces and ruin it: In the Church there muſt be ſome Authority of the Rulers of it over the Members; Chriſt hath formed and given it a Being, and left Rules for the preſervation and well-being thereof, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of which he hath committed to her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; and to what purpoſe ſhould thoſe Laws be, if there was no Executive Power, there is an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Juriſdiction with a Coercive and Expulſive Power; there are Pales and Walls to hinder Wild Boars and ranging Bears from coming in, and Doors to turn out thoſe who offend, infect, diſhonour, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and would undermine it: And <hi>Convocations,</hi> which I ſee they care not for, are neceſſary from time to time
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108605:8"/>
to promote her good, and to remedy or prevent Inconveniences, chiefly thoſe which relate to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and tho' we attribute an Infallibility to none of them, as there is none upon Earth, yet 'tis their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince for their own Members to declare about Hereſie, Blaſphemy, and other things contrary to ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Piety: To me there appears none more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges in ſuch things, than thoſe who have Chriſt's Commiſſion to feed and to rule over his Flock, and in the right adminiſtration of this Office, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Powers called the <hi>Nurſing Fathers</hi> of the Church, are bound to protect and aſſiſt them againſt the Enemies of the holy Trinity, and of the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch are <hi>Socinians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' according to Times and Places, Men have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Notions of divine Truths; yet a real divine Truth is ſuch at all times and in all places; 'tis not the Opinion which Men have of it that makes it to be Truth or not Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can the ſeveral contrary Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations change it; ſo if the 39 Articles, ſpecially thoſe that relate to Faith, were true at firſt, they muſt be ſo at laſt, and no following Convocation can make them not to be what they are, or to be what they are not; 'tis not the ſtamp of any human Authority that may make a divine Inſtitution to be divine or not; and tho a new Convocation ſhould repeal what in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals a former one ſetled, yet ſome reaſons for it ought to be produced: About doubtful things Advice may be asked, as it was in the Diſpute about Circumciſion, when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> Counſel about it; nothing muſt be omitted that may lawfully contribute towards clearing of the matter; but when after a ſerious Examination by the Rule of God's Word, according to the true ſignification of the words in the Original, the ſcope of the place, and the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Faith, Articles of Faith once are declared, 'tis fit to ſtand to them, and the Church by which they are received, is enabled to judg of what is or is not contrary thereunto, and to keep from coming in thoſe who would againſt her mind, and turn out her own Members, which hold Doctrines contrary to the Truth ſhe profeſſeth: So the Church of <hi>England</hi> being
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108605:8"/>
ſatisfied that the <hi>Socinian</hi> Tenets are quite contrary to the 1ſt. and 2d. Articles of Faith ſhe believes, hath right to turn out <hi>Socinians</hi> that are within her Pales, and hinder thoſe who would come in from without: And if ſhe wants a ſufficient Power, ſhe may very well ſue for help from the Civil, which is the legal way for Relief; and when this takes an effectual Courſe about it, 'tis Wrong and Injury to the Right and Liberty of the Subject, no more than 'tis Injuſtice to hinder one Fellow-Subject from hurting another: This is no <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principle, nor contrary to thoſe of <hi>Reformation:</hi> But where a National Church is ſetled, to allow every Man a liberty to frame unto himſelf what Notions he pleaſes of Religion, then to promote, vent and publiſh it, to the Diſturbance of what is already ſetled by Law, you thereby introduce Confuſion into the Church, which may ſoon become Anarchy in the Government, which to prevent in my humble Addreſs to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I thought the Laws now in being about ſuch things might be executed, and, if in their Wiſdom they thought fit, new ones be enacted.</p>
               <p>What Papiſts believe or do, as to Authority, about Interpretation of Scriptures, is no Rule nor Precedent for us; there is a ſad Experience in the World of the nature of the Spirit which they are acted by, and of the Methods they have taken to ſupport their ſpiritual Tyranny over the Conſciences and Souls, yea, Lives of Men; they made themſelves Parties and Judges, and would admit or hear of no Reaſons contrary to theirs, which were grounded not upon God's Word (tho' in ſome things they pretend it) but their own Traditions and Practice to their Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now among us you find no ſuch thing, the Law is open for you, if you take Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be it, whereof you ſadly wreſt the Words, contrary to their natural Senſe, without giving any good Reaſon for it, and you ſtand by your ſelves in defiance and oppoſition of the general Conſent of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, which condemned thoſe unſound Men, when they appeared againſt the Perſon of our Saviour and Lord. And here I muſt ſay, we, no more than you, receive the Authority of Antiquity or of Fathers upon their own bottom; for we agree they were fallible,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108605:9"/>
when they ſaid ſo and ſo; but whether in ſo ſaying they ſpake truth, is well worth enquiry into; I will compare them with Scripture, and if they agree with it, I will agree with them: And this is to me a ſtrengthning Evidence, that I am not ſingular, ſeeing others as well as I, could in the Word of God find thoſe Truths which I do believe: <hi>Wo be to him that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>is alone,</hi> abounds in his own Senſe, and thinks he knows more than all the World beſides; for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Scripture Truths, it may be every ones Right to direct himſelf by his own Reaſon enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit; as to the Explication, a very great care ought to be had, and ſtill according to the Rule of God's Word, with all the help he can get beſides; but when they have Opinions which they find are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally oppoſed, People ſo modeſt, ſo quiet, and of the Character they give of themſelves, not to diſturb o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhould keep it within themſelves, and not be ſo ſervent as ye are, to ſpread it abroad, whether your Zeal be without or againſt Knowledg: And if every one who pretends to be a Member of the Church be ſo buſie as ye are to promote their Opinions, and no Curb be put upon Interpretations, then no end of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, Blaſphemy, or of all ſorts of the worſt Opinions.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed, I think fit to pull down that Strong-hold of theirs, as they take it to be, tho' rather Sandy Foundation of a free liberty for every one to make what interpretations they pleaſe: and that I ſhall the more willingly do, tho' as briefly as I can, becauſe 'tis a Matter controverted between them and us, which I had no occaſion to meddle with in my Book. To begin, I ſay, as there is a Right, ſo there is a falſe Interpretation of Scripture: The Right is that which gives the true ſenſe and meaning the Falſe on the contrary: Now if every private Man might In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scripture, what monſtrous Interpretations would there be, as we ſee it too much in the World; and this is the ground of Hereſy, Blaſphemy and Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm; which to prevent, the Lord Jeſus, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in thoſe <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>and</hi> Epheſ. 4. ii.</note> two places, where he mentions the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Church, hath ſettled <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers:</hi> Every private Man may Read but not Interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108605:9"/>
which in this Caſe, is the firſt thing to be known; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>knowing this firſt, that no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 20, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Scripture is of any private Interpretation,</hi> ſo the Interpretation muſt come from whence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation came, 'tis but one and the ſame Spring; therefore in the next Verſe he clears the Matter, <hi>For Prophecy came not in old time, by the Will of Man; but holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which doth exclude as humane private Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſo alſo humane private Interpretation: And herein <hi>Paul</hi> joineth with <hi>Peter,</hi> when he puts this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Do all Interpret?</hi> Which contains an Excluſive how all do not, no more than all are no workers of Miracles,</p>
               <p>Furthermore we muſt know how Scripture hath a binding Power not only directive but alſo deciſive over the Conſcience; ſo that thereby the Conſcience, far from having that free liberty, is tied and bound to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Word; or elſe no Man that believes an Opinion contrary to ſound Doctrine and never ſo heretical and blaſphemous, could be guilty of Sin: But we are aſſured of the contrary, for <hi>they who wreſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the Scriptures, do ſo unto their own deſtruction;</hi> tho' a man muſt be very cautious not to go againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yet where there is a Competition between God and Man, the Word of God and the Judgment of Man; when each challenge of us a Conſent, we muſt give it the Word which certainly is true and infallible, preferably before the Conſcience, which may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and erroneous, which happens often when 'tis guided by humane Reaſon. In Scripture is in matters of Faith a convincing and conſtraining Power, which in Conſcience we are bound to ſubmit to; in Humane things, the Judge is not properly Judge, except he Judges according to the Law; for he hath no power to alter or corrupt, but to declare the true ſenſe of it. The Interpretation of the Divine Law which the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is now about, may happen to be miſtaken, but the Law never, for 'tis Infallible, as being the Word of the True and Infallible God; hence is derived its Divine and Undiſputable Authority, beyond that of any thing elſe, and it ſhould work upon men more than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108605:10"/>
Miracles, even than raiſing from the Dead, which may<note place="margin">Luke 16. 31.</note> be called the greateſt of all; for, <hi>they that hear not Moſes and the Prophets, will not be perſwaded tho' one roſe from the Dead.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe therein the Spirit of God ſpeaks, and thereby leads us into all Truth: And indeed, if Scripture was not the end of Debates in matters of Religion, our Conſcience could never be ſettled nor quiet; for that ſame thing, no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, Power or Judgment, is able to effect; but we aquieſce to, reſt and depend upon the Word of the God of Truth: and if at the Bar of Conſcience there was no ſuch binding Rule, but men were left to their own private Judgment, none would be bound to believe Scripture, but always live amidſt Doubts, Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Conjectures, not to ſay, ſingular Notions, Fancies and Dreams; and ſo we could never be at a certainty: Beſides, that after this, there were no Sin in any man to receive any ſenſe of Scripture, tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo contrary to the intention of God's Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and, as ſaid before, never ſo Erroneous and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, only becauſe it is according to a man's own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinion and deluded Imagination; which is to take away the Obligation whereby Conſcience and the whole Soul are bound to believe the Truth of Scripture only, and not falſe Interpretations.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is in Scripture ſome matters of Faith which are not ſo obvious to the Soul and to Reaſon, as matters of Fact are to the Eye and Ear; as alſo there are others not to be Interpreted according to the plain and literal ſenſe as they ſeem to be: Out of the number and variety of ſuch afforded in the Word, I ſhall bring only two Inſtances: Can they think that this Conſequence by our Saviour, <hi>God is the God of the living, and not of the dead; therefore there ſhall be</hi>

               <p>What he brings in of <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Latimer,</hi> about<note place="margin">Page 8.</note> the Interpretation of the Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> cannot anſwer his purpoſe; that Inſtance indeed can ſhew how a Text may differently be interpreted, and that one may happen wrongfully to ſuffer for a good Cauſe; and how the ſtrongeſt ſide and moſt ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not always the beſt: But this cannot prove, that becauſe one has unjuſtly ſuffered, the other may not juſtly ſuffer; that ſort of Men who are always wholly bent to provide for their ſafety, would infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate how no Man ſhould be called to account for any wreſting of, or putting falſe interpretations upon Scripture, tho never ſo falſe, blaſphemous, impious, and heretical, becauſe he who doth ſo, believeth them not to be ſuch, which is their own caſe: it doth not follow, that a Truth, tho made doubtful, becauſe to day 'tis ſupported, and to morrow ſhall be oppreſſed, muſt not be owned, and a Reſtraint put upon thoſe who oppoſe it: The Merit of the Cauſe is impartially to be enquired into, and when Truth is found out, not only it muſt be exalted, but alſo its contrary is to be kept under: Tho Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſupported a bad Cauſe and ſuppreſſed a good one, it doth not follow but that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did well to ſuppreſs a bad Cauſe and ſupport a good one: Tho an innocent be brought to ſuffer, yet the guilty muſt not go free for all that: Becauſe formerly innocent Blood was ſhed, muſt not Juſtice now be executed upon Criminals? 'Tis not the Opinion of Men but the Truth of the Thing which makes any one guilty or innocent; the Law is judge of it: So in Matters of Religion, 'tis not the Interpretation of the Text, nor the Opinion which the Interpreter hath of the Soundneſs of his Interpretation that makes it Orthodox and ſound, but the Word which explains it ſelf; for what in one place is dark, is plain in ſome other; and when ſome Men, contrary to thoſe Lights, will ſet up heretical and blaſphemous Opinions, and therein grow obſtinate, only becauſe they think to be in the right; upon ſuch account the Word of God authoriſeth Men to enact
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108605:11"/>
ſuch penal Laws as they ſhall think moſt conducing for the glory of God, and to have them put in execution, chiefly when the Parties againſt the known Laws of the Land do publiſh, and in defiance of all, at the Parliament Doors, offer their heretical Books with words to this purpoſe; <hi>I put a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Book into your hand, pray read it with attention, and when you are Converted ſtrengthen your Brethren;</hi> thus profanely abuſing God's moſt holy Word.</p>
               <p>They are by no means pleaſed with my way of Writing, but I like it the better for their diſliking it:<note place="margin">Page 4. 16, 18.</note> They find fault <hi>firſt</hi> with the Matter, Order and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> with my often uſing Scripture; <hi>thirdly,</hi> with my Sallying, as they call it, into ſundry Metaphors. The firſt of the two ironically talks of <hi>depth of Learning, height of Fancy,</hi> &amp;c. which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Fantaſtical Men, who would transform Fancy, yea all Religion into Reaſon. The other calls it, <hi>A World of School Cant, which now adays goes for deep Learning:</hi> So both, tho' in a different way, talk of depth of Learning; that People would have others like themſelves, to build upon no Foundation but Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, which is not allowable, chiefly in things of the nature of thoſe now in queſtion: what they call <hi>Cant,</hi> is out of Scripture, Writings of Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and out of Schools; which, as I think, are the proper Store-houſes whence to draw our Materials; but with them every thing is <hi>Cant</hi> which doth not ſuit with their Tunes: thoſe Men would have all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things, manner of Expreſſion and Stile, to be but one and the ſame; but theirs to be the Original for others to go by; which, eſpecially in Men who ſo highly pretend to Reaſon, is as unreaſonable, as if one would have all features in the Face, all ſhapes of the Body, all humours and inclinations of the Soul, to be alike; a thing impoſſible: For <hi>every man,</hi> ſaith the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 7.</note> Apoſtle, <hi>hath his proper gift of God; one after this manner, another after that.</hi> However, theſe great Maſters of Wit, Learning and Reaſon, find fault with the way of other Mens Writing, if it be not as they would have it, that they call Nonſenſe, and what elſe they pleaſe; for their Tongues and Pens are their own,

wherewith they will do what they have a mind to. Their Ironical Expreſſions may well be retorted upon them; yet they ſhould know how Truth is better when naked, and needs no painting as doth Falſhood; to Paint is the part of an Harlot, not of a vertuous Woman. I ask<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is not Gold, Gold ſtill, and good, tho' it be not Enamel'd, or otherwiſe curiouſly wrought? If they have their way of Writing, I have mine, which they ſhall not put me out of, but will keep to't till I ſee a Law enjoining others to Conform to theirs: I thank God my ways are different from, and would not change them for theirs, tho' they would ſet up for Cenſors and Reformers of other Mens Works, but by what Patent, I cannot hear nor ſee; and if I could help it, I would have nothing Common with them, becauſe <hi>their Plague is in the Head;</hi> and to give them their due, in what they ſay there is more of flaſhy Wit, than of ſolid and ſound Reaſon; they prefer the Bark before the Body of the Tree, and the Cloaths before the Perſon who wears them.</p>
               <p>They diſlike my Quotations or <hi>Fragments</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as one of the two calls them; and good reaſon they have, for they are ſo many ſtrong and deſtructive Batteries againſt them; they would not ſee the Mouth of that Cannon which ſhatters their falſe Opinions to pieces: If to Quote Scripture be a Fault, they are not guilty of it; they travel not much into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and when they do, 'tis with a Cup of Venom in their Hand, if poſſible to poiſon the Springs. Their Reaſon is the God-Idol, for whoſe ſake they ſlight Revelation; but, ſaith he, thoſe Fragments are ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: I ſee you had more Curioſity than your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (which of the two is <hi>Simeon</hi> and which <hi>Levi,</hi> I cannot tell, however one calls himſelf a Lay-man) for you read the Book; but what's the reaſon you give not one Inſtance of theſe Fragments of Scripture being ill apply'd; ſurely you are apt enough to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage if any was offered, and I cannot believe you would have ſo much Charity as to ſpare me; for by the ſowrneſs and gall of bitterneſs which I find in the Letters, I have cauſe to think ſo, you cannot ſo ſoon have forgotten all thoſe Portions of God's word ill

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108605:13"/>
either break or bend; this laſt they chuſe to do, and would ſeem to yield; not becauſe they believe it, but only for Peace-ſake; Peace to themſelves, to avoid the Penalty: They think the word <hi>Perſon</hi> not ſo proper as another might be; ſtill they reſerve a Back-door, why do they not name the word which is in their opinion more proper than that of <hi>Perſon?</hi> that word remains in <hi>petto</hi> in their Breaſt, till there be a fair occaſion to declare it. Their ſpeaking of Peace is well, if with it they join Truth, for they ought not to be aſunder; no Chriſtian is to betray Truth for Peace-ſake. Now if a Perſon of the Godhead be deſcribed as it is by an incommunicable Subſiſtence of the Divine Eſſence, the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſhall not be acquitted as he pretends: It is not my work, neither is this a place to ſhew how frivolous that Plea would prove at the Bar of the Law; but I am ſure in my Book I ſufficiently demonſtrated it to be a vain Subterfuge and againſt the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>That trimming Spirit in them, which, becauſe they have not the upper hand, one may eaſily perceive to Rule throughout in both Letters, puts me in mind of the Popiſh Methods in ſuch Caſes, as among other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it appears by what paſſed in 1561, in that great Aſſembly at <hi>Poiſſy</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which the then French King <hi>Charles</hi> IX. appointed to meet, and in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence therein to have free Conference about Religion, between ſome of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy and ſome of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters: Becauſe as yet things were not ripe for their Deſigns, they by means of thoſe Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences would try whether ſome way might be found out to plaiſter things over, and for the preſent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Differences; in order thereunto, after ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes about the Sacraments, which between the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> had happened in the K. of <hi>Navarr</hi>'s Chamber, where they met ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally; the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party being not willing to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their Cauſe upon Diſputes, firſt by the Doctors of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and laſtly by the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> in the name of the whole Clergy, deſired the King and Queen-Mother to give the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> no Hearing, who by the Mouth of <hi>Beza</hi> had already made a Speech in the Aſſembly, and given an account of their Confeſſion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108605:14"/>
of Faith: So then theſe Publick Conferences not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work, they did ſet up Private ones; firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Two and Two, then between Five and Five<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of both Religions, and among theſe for the Proteſtants <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> was one; the Point was about the <hi>Lord's Supper:</hi> On the Popiſh ſide the deſign was, not to find out the Truth, but only ſuch words as each ſide might Interpret on his behalf: To that purpoſe ſeveral For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mules, which here I need not to inſert, were by the Papiſts offered the Proteſtants, but being ambiguous, captious, and ſuch as might be underſtood in a double ſenſe, <hi>Beza</hi> for Concluſion ſaid, <hi>We muſt ſay all or nothing,</hi> becauſe indeed the Myſtery of that Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be explained. The like was practiſed in their Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where happened great Heats between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans</hi> about ſeveral Points, wherein they differ, but to diſpleaſe neither ſide, their Canons about thoſe Matters, before they were paſſed, they ſhewed to both Parties, and penn'd them in ſuch Words and Expreſſions, as each ſide might favourably Interpret for his own Opinion.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Socinians</hi> would follow the ſame way, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſuch words as may be taken in their Senſe and ours too; yet tho' we ſhould agree about the Terms, they know we do not in the Signification; <hi>they for Peace ſake ſubmit to the Phraſe of the Church, and own Three Perſons,</hi> yet Interpret it not as the Church doth: Again, <hi>They ſeem deſirous to waſh their hands of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm,</hi> yet defend it as much as they are able: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the prudent Explication which hath been given of ſome obnoxious Terms, they weave the Diſpute and come in as Brethren,</hi> yet ſtill believe not as the Church doth; nay, if we will believe them, we are <hi>all of a perfect Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but if we examine it will be found, if by theſe pretended laſt Conceſſions of theirs we agree, 'tis about ſome Words, when the difference about Things ſtill remains. And as then Papiſts were only to have things quiet for the preſent, ſo I perceive <hi>Socinians</hi> are now content it ſhould be ſo between us, to ſee whether Times may happen to turn for them, then indeed they would declare, by the word <hi>Perſon</hi> they mean not an Incommunicable Subſiſtence of the Godhead, but only
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108605:14"/>
an Attribute as Wiſdom, Love; that Chriſt is God and Son of God by Favour not by Nature and by eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But all ſuch Trimmers, to ſpeak in <hi>Job</hi>'s Words, are <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of no value, and ſuch Remedies cannot<note place="margin">Job 13. 4.</note> cure the Wound but it will break out again, and this I call <hi>daubing with untempered Mortar,</hi> 'tis not enough to eaſe of the Pain, but the cauſe muſt be removed, which is the only way to cure for certain, and to prevent Relapſes: this I bring in to ſhew how <hi>Socinians</hi> are not ſo averſe from ſuch <hi>Popiſh</hi> Practices as they pretend to be; and if we narrowly inquire into it, we ſhall find they are willing to join with them in the Practice of the following Maxim, where they are the weakeſt, they firſt pretend for Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Toleration, then for an Equality, afterwards ſtruggle for Superiority, and at laſt deſtroy any one that to a hairs Breadth would not come up to what they would have: for as <hi>Papiſts</hi> brag of a Spirit of Infallibility intailed upon their Church, ſo <hi>Socinians</hi> are of opinion that the Spirit of God, (if they own any ſuch thing) is departed from other Chriſtian Societies only to be among them, who look upon themſelves as the only true Interpreters of God's Word, as <hi>Socinus</hi> doth applaud himſelf in his new fangled Expoſitions, therefore they deſpiſe all Antient Doctors of the Primitive Church, and I think, in <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s Words againſt <hi>Montanus,</hi> we may ſay it to be the <hi>Socinians</hi> opinion, <hi>Truth waited for their Coming, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it had been quite loſt:</hi> yet according to their Principles we muſt all be Scepticks and <hi>Pyrhonians</hi> always doubting of every thing and never ſure of any, then in the Word of God is no Truth that we can be certain of: we know no Man hath dominion over the Faith of another, nor ought to impoſe his Opinion upon others, neither could they who went before us be Maſters of our Faith, nor we of the Faith of thoſe who are to come after. You ſee I make uſe of your own Expreſſions, but withal I muſt tell you that if any one would in former or preſent times offer to force things of their own upon us to believe, we would reject it, by their own, we mean any thing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from or contrary to the Word of God, 'tis not their offering to us, or of us to others, can bind the Conſciences, but the things offered do, if they be the Word of God; no human Authority doth <hi>per ſe</hi> and of it ſelf tye my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but God's Word doth, therefore if any thing be propoſed as an Article of Faith, we muſt ſee whether it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108605:15"/>
be contained in the Word of God, which bears Record of it ſelf, and ſo ſtands in no need of the Teſtimony of Man: 'tis not the hand that gives Alms which can make Gold to be Gold or Silver to be Silver, nor the Lawyers quoting the Law that can make it to be Law, 'tis ſo in it ſelf, ſo is Goſpel Goſpel in it ſelf, without any human help, or elſe you make the Gloſs and Interpretation more than the Text, and as according to your Principles you may alter your Interpretation one to day and another different from it the next, what a Confuſion would you leave us in, when you are ſo ſickle and cannot agree with your own ſelves? as indeed you make an Alteration in the Queſtions from what they were in <hi>Socinus</hi>'s days.</p>
               <p>By what they ſay of Doctrines which according to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of times may be convenient or inconvenient, I find them inclined to blame the times to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but the Faults which too often are committed, the Times are not to be accuſed of but the Malice or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men, there being no Seaſon ſo troubleſome as can keep a good Judge from doing Juſtice, or a good Divine from giving a good Interpretation of Scripture, ſo Mens Faults ought to be chaſtiſed, and not the Times, which are as Men govern themſelves, to be complained of; but good and holy Laws ought to be enacted by thoſe whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to, having the Glory of God, and the Good of the People before their Eyes: new Diſtempers require new Remedies, and new Laws are neceſſary againſt new Crimes, wherefore I lay hold on this new occaſion, and once more make bold, to both Houſes of Parliament, humbly to commend the Cauſe of God, and of his Son the Lord Jeſus, (according as I formerly beſought them in my Epiſtle) in earneſt to mind it, or elſe with <hi>David</hi> I ſay, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe O God plead thine own Cauſe.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>However, as to Faith and Practice, they give a good Character of themſelves; as to the firſt, they believe all the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed, but ſtill they reſerve unto themſelves to give what Interpretation they pleaſe; but ſure we are, 'tis not that contained in the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds: Still there is a Jeſuitical Jugling, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and Mental Reſervation. Ask them which is the true ſenſe of the Words in Jeſus Chriſt <hi>his only Son,</hi> they will not ſay, 'tis of his own Nature and Subſtance and from Eternity; which <hi>Creed,</hi> ſay they, <hi>was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought a full and ſufficient Summary of Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:108605:15"/>
till ſome Men perverted the true and Orthodox Meaning, and brought falſe Gloſſes upon't, contrary to the plain and natural Interpretation received by the Univerſal Church; then indeed to refute unſound and Anti-ſcriptural Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and wreſting of the true Senſe, to explain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large was found neceſſary: <hi>'Tis their Principle thankfully to lay hold on the Meſſage of Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> This ſeems fair, but is very defective; for according to them, Chriſt came into the World as a bare Meſſenger, a meer Man, to declare the Will of God unto us, which others, tho not ſo fully and plainly, had done before, to die only for our good, but not in our ſtead, nor to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe us by the Merits of his Death: So they ſay the Lord Jeſus is God by Favour, not by Nature, robbing him thus of his Divinity. When we ſeriouſly come to the matter, they are full of Quiblings and Cavils: As to the receiving the Meſſage of Redemption, 'tis according to them by ſtrength of Reaſon and not of Faith, for no true Faith in Chriſt, except Men believe him to be true God as well as true Man. As to <hi>Practice,</hi> this Character they give of themſelves, <hi>They fear God, walk humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, hold no Correſpondence with any known Sin, &amp;c.</hi> This is well, but not enough; for the moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Heathen carryed ſome of them as far as this: But a ſound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knowledg in the Mind is required, and no ſound ſaving Knowledg of Chriſt, except one knows him for ſuch as he is, that is, God and Man, or elſe he is but half a Chriſt, an imperfect Mediatour, whole Chriſt is the true Object of Faith. <hi>Theſe things are written that ye</hi>

               <p>The Author of the firſt Letter hath a touch upon the<note place="margin">pag. 8.</note> matter and that's all: 'tis about the interpretation of what <hi>S. John</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Word was made Fleſh,</hi> I confeſs there is a great difference in the interpretation, we ſay according to the natural Signification, <hi>the Word</hi> or Son of God took upon him our human Nature; they ſay <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which we tranſlate <hi>the Word,</hi> ſignifies Reaſon rather than Word, and they infer that the Reaſon or Wiſdom of God was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto Jeſus Chriſt; this is a very much forced In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation and fetch'd afar off, for all along <hi>the Word</hi> is ſpoken of as a Subject, and they would make a ſhift to turn it into the Predicate. Now what ſhall we do, of theſe two Opinions to find out the true one? for if every Perſon or Party be allowed ſuch a Latitude as to interpret things after their own Fancy, there will be no end of falſe Gloſſes and wrong Interpretations: how doth the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith do to know true Gold or Silver from that which is falſe? he brings it to the Touch-ſtone, ſo muſt we in this caſe; between them and us is a Difference, the Party muſt not be the Judge, 'tis not juſt they ſhould be Judges in their own cauſe, nor we in ours: then we muſt agree about a Judge, ſuch as is impartial and infallible, and none but God is ſuch: now God doth not immediatly ſpeak from Heaven, for he doth it in his Word, that is his Will and ought to be our Law and Rule: in matters of Faith I will believe no Man's Aſſertion, except out of Scripture he proves it to me, the like he may juſtly expect from me; but in caſe of that Text of Scripture he and I give diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Interpretations, what's to be done? we ought ſtill to keep in the ſame Court, and wait for a Deciſion from the ſame Judge; then I muſt prove my Interpretation by ſome other place of Scripture or elſe he muſt not believe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108605:17"/>
me, nor I him except he doth the like: and if Men will but lay aſide Prejudices, and be acted by a real and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſire to find out the Truth, God will not leave them, but therein afford ſuch Helps as ſhall anſwer their Good; for <hi>all Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us come to our Point, and reduce the Rule to a Practice; the Queſtion is, Whether by <hi>the Word</hi> is meant a Perſon as we ſay, or a <hi>Quality</hi> as they would have it? there is a great Difference between Perſons and Things; now to find out the Truth, this Text muſt be compared with others, we need not to go far, for in the firſt Verſe of the Chapter we read thrice the ſame Name: in the beginning <hi>was the Word</hi> (was, ſignifieth exiſted, had a Being, which relateth to a Perſon, and not to a Thing) the ſame <hi>Word was with God</hi> and <hi>was God;</hi> what? a Quality with God and a Thing God? doth the Evangeliſt begin his Goſpel in ſo high a ſtrain only to tell us how Reaſon was in the beginning, how Reaſon was with God, and Reaſon was God, or in plain Words that God was Reaſonable, which is a Truth known to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo no need to tell it, but he would acquaint the Readers with things before unknown to them; beſides doth this hold any proportion with the Nature and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Goſpel and great Tidings of Salvation? this indeed is to exalt Reaſon, and becauſe they make a God of their Reaſon, therefore for Name's ſake Reaſon muſt be deified: then, according to their Principle, this Reaſon muſt be an efficient Cauſe of all, for <hi>all things were made</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made;</hi> to create and make things is the Property and Act of a Perſon, and not of a Thing, <hi>in him,</hi> as in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and not as in a Thing, <hi>was Life;</hi> and the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls him <hi>the Word of Life,</hi> that Life which was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, and <hi>that Eternal Life which was with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> firſt, and then <hi>was manifeſted unto us;</hi> as if he had ſaid, the living God, according to an uſual way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Scripture, when the Abſtract is put for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, thus God is called <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs;</hi> that ſame Word that was God, was made Fleſh, and <hi>dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us,</hi> to dwell denotes a Perſon; <hi>and we Beheld his Glory,</hi> not the Glory of Reaſon or Wiſdom, but the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108605:17"/>
Glory <hi>as of the only begotten of the Father,</hi> here is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Son to a Father, and ſurely a Son is a Perſon not a Thing; and of this ſame <hi>John bare witneſs of him,</hi> ſaying <hi>this was he of whom I ſpake, he that cometh after me is preferred before me,</hi> read on till <hi>ver.</hi> 19. all along <hi>the Word</hi> is ſpoken as of a Perſon, and in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. he declares who that Word is by a Compariſon between Perſons, <hi>the Law was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This Jeſus Chriſt he hath been ſpeaking of all this while, and his Deſign is to ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt is the Word ſo often by him mentioned, and to that effect he ſpeaks of <hi>John</hi>'s Evidence about him, if the <hi>Word</hi> be a Thing and not a Perſon, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo, and ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> who was a Perſon, and Chriſt after he was made Fleſh is compared to him: O the Perverſeneſs of ſome Mens Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! who read Scripture, not to find out Truth or be guided by it, but out of it to wreſt ſome things to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Prejudices: <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to ſet up the <hi>Pope's</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, think after much ſeeking to have found a Text to ſerve their turn, <hi>he that is ſpiritual judgeth all things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>yet he himſelf is judged of no Man,</hi> with them the Pope is that Spiritual Man: the <hi>Socinians,</hi> whoſe Deſign is not to ſet up one, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, but to pull down and deſtroy the great Work of Incarnation, ſay, becauſe it ſerves their turn, no Word or Divine Perſon, but only the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God was made Fleſh. Out of what I have ſaid I think it plainly appears how the Scope of the Place, and the Deſign of the Evangeliſt is to ſpeak of a Perſon and not of a Thing.</p>
               <p>But to prove our Interpretation, let us further ſearch into Scriptures, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to our purpoſe, for as <hi>John</hi> ſaith the Word that was God was made Fleſh, ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that <hi>God was manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> which he calls<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3 16.</note> the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, and the whole Verſe, tho in different Branches, <hi>as preached unto the Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on in the World, received up into Glory,</hi> do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate the Lord Jeſus to be that God or Perſon of the Godhead manifeſt in the Fleſh: and in another Place he ſaith, <hi>when the Fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>forth his Son, made of a Woman:</hi> that Perſon which in another place is called <hi>God,</hi> in this is called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and in another God's <hi>own</hi> Son or <hi>proper</hi> Son: in<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> theſe ſeveral Texts mention is made of an Incarnation, or of being made Fleſh, manifeſt in the Fleſh, made of a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108605:18"/>
Woman, and God ſent his own Son in the <hi>Likeneſs of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fleſh,</hi> and the Subject is called the <hi>Word, God, Son of God, God's own</hi> and <hi>proper Son:</hi> is there in all this any Metaphor, or any Ground to ſay that the Word made Fleſh ſignifieth Reaſon communicated to Jeſus? all this proves that our Interpretation is according to the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of Faith, and ſhews a ſweet Harmony of ſeveral Texts of Scripture, to demonſtrate the adorable Myſtery of the Incarnation of the Son God.</p>
               <p>Thus far we proved our Interpretation of that Text of Scripture, we do not perceive they are in a Condition to do the like for theirs, for if they could we ſhould hear of it, they have not one Text to do it: <hi>Magiſter dixit</hi> is no Reaſon with us, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> may ſay, but that is not enough, what he ſaith he muſt prove, upon true Grounds and to the purpoſe: well, for want of Scripture the Author of the Letter gives a Reaſon of his own, which is this, <hi>And we all know that Divine Wiſdom may be communicated to Man without the Incarnation of God:</hi> Did ever any one read ſuch a pitiful coming off in ſo weighty a matter as this is? how ſawcy with God are ſome Men in the World, in ſetting out their fooliſh and wandering Fancies, and where is a due Reſpect for his Holy Word? hath not God made fooliſh the Wiſdom of theſe Men, if ever they had any? doth this Interpretation hold any proportion with that high and noble Idea which the Evangeliſt would give us of the Perſon whoſe Hiſtory he writes? firſt of all we defy them to ſhew that this is the Senſe of any Text concerning this Matter? <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they could, yet it being againſt the uſual Meaning, they ought to ſhew reaſon why in this place it ſhould be taken otherwiſe, and then muſt ſuch a ſilly Reaſon weigh down the Authority of ſo many Texts of Scripture? what will become of all the glorious Attributes and Prerogative of the Lord Jeſus over Angels and Men? what of that Name which is above every Name, God's <hi>own, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son</hi> in whom he is well pleaſed, if all comes only to this, God's Reaſon and Wiſdom were communicated to him, which God in a high degree did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and to others of his eminent Servants, whereby he muſt make them equal with his Son and he with them: we all know that God, if he pleaſes, can create another World, muſt we conclude therefore he hath not created this; God, if he had pleaſed, could have delivered his People out of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108605:18"/>
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> otherwiſe than by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> muſt we ſay therefore he delivered them not by his hand? Out of what God can do we muſt not infer that he hath not done what he hath done; becauſe God can communicate Reaſon to Man, therefore the Word the Son of God was not made Fleſh: Ye great Logicians, is this a good Conſequence, <hi>riſum teneatis,</hi> I could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſay, if the thing in queſtion was not of the higheſt importance.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this Point, I ſhall skip over to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">p. 12, 13.</note> place of the Letter; for tho' he there ſpeaks not to me, but to another, whoſe Notions I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for, yet what he ſaith relating to the Cauſe, I ought to take notice of, the more becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it belongs to that Text of <hi>John,</hi> which hitherto we were upon; 'tis ſaid, <hi>Tke Incarnation of God is no where expreſſed in Scripture, it can be no more than meerly a deduction from thence.</hi> 'Tis well you are ſo kind, as to grant 'tis in't in ſome way: As to the firſt part, if you ſay in ſo many Letters, according to your cavilling way, we know't; for the word Incarnation is Latin, and ſo none of the Books of Scripture being originally written in that Language, we muſt not think to find it in't, but we ſay a word altogether equivalent, and which ſignifies the ſame thing is in't: Doth not to <hi>be made Fleſh</hi> and to be incarnate, being made Fleſh and Incarnation, ſignifie the ſame? May be you will deny it, 'tis but what ſome of yours do in a thing of the like nature, as that to <hi>make</hi> and to <hi>create</hi> the World, ſignifie not the ſame thing: If the <hi>Word,</hi> which as S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>was God,</hi> was made Fleſh, I think, that according to all Rules of Logick, out of thoſe Premiſes we may conclude, how God was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate or made Fleſh, and that Act we may well call Incarnation. As to the other part, that it is only by Deduction, you cannot be ignorant how there are ſuch Deductions as are equivalent or next to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; for when the chief Aſſertion contained in Scripture is true, ſo muſt alſo be whatſoever is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in included, and in the Explication of it drawn by a true and right Conſequence. Thus, tho' in the <hi>Sixth</hi> Commandment, to give one Poyſon be not expreſſed,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108605:19"/>
yet by a true and certain Conſequence, 'tis deduce out of theſe Words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> ſo ſtarving one to death is adjudged Murther, and puniſhed as ſuch: Tho Inceſt be not expreſſed in the <hi>Seventh,</hi> yet none will deny it to be forbidden under theſe Words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery;</hi> ſo is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; and ſo of every other Precept wherein when a Sin is forbidden, all of the ſame kind are ſo, and alſo the Virtue contrary to the Sin is preſcribed: And tho there were ſome difference in the Nature of the thing, yet hence we infer this certain Truth, that tho ſome things be not expreſly ſet down in Scripture, yet are therein contained, and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a true and lawful Conſequence: Of this ſort are the words Trinity and Incarnation; and if the Names, then alſo the Things; for the Uſe of Words is to ſignifie Things.</p>
               <p>As to what is added in Anſwer to the Aſſertion, that the Son of God was made Man, how the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> will ſay, <hi>The Son of God doth not always ſignifie God,</hi> 'tis thereby implyed that ſometimes it doth, and that grants what we deſire; for thus we know, that when it is ſimply and abſolutely attributed to Chriſt, which is never ſo to any Angel or Man, we may conclude, that then it neceſſarily ſignifies God. As to what is anſwered to the other Text, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh;</hi> that <hi>the Word</hi> doth not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie God, I only ſay this, how <hi>John</hi> ſaith <hi>the word was God,</hi> I leave them in his hands, and let them come off as they can: As to the Third Text, <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian will ſay,</hi> what he ſaid before; That God may be manifeſt in the Fleſh without being incarnate; he may ſay what he pleaſes if he proves nothing, nay, not ſo much as go about it; ſurely they claim a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to be believed in what they ſay upon their bare word; but ſeeing they give no reaſon for what they ſay, we may ſuppoſe thoſe great Maſters of Reaſon have none to give, their Reaſon fails them, and is ſucceeded by Paſſion; I ſee they found out a ſhort way to anſwer all Arguments againſt them; either with not taking notice of them, and thus they anſwer my Book, or with denying every thing without giving
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108605:19"/>
any Reaſon for it: This puts me in mind of a common Saying when I was in the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> School, <hi>Plus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabit aſinus quàm probabit Philoſophus.</hi> The dulleſt Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the World can deny more, than the greateſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher is able to prove; do but always deny, and at laſt the Philoſopher will have nothing to ſay: There is no arguing againſt thoſe who deny Principles; now this is a great one for Men to give Reaſon as for what they affirm, ſo for what they deny; this is the part of Rational Men: We attack them out of Scripture, and they ought in our way to anſwer us out of the ſame, as their School-Arguments we anſwer in their way.</p>
               <p>But to return to what the Unitarian ſaith, that <hi>The Son of God doth not always ſignifie God,</hi> I ſay 'tis not always neceſſary to our purpoſe it ſhould: And to ſtate the Queſtion well, theſe two things ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Queſtion is not at all about Angels or Men, but about the Perſon of the Lord <hi>Jeſus:</hi> The <hi>Second,</hi> The Name <hi>God</hi> is not improperly taken. This being premiſed, I ſay, how the words <hi>Son of God</hi> when ſpoken of Chriſt, do ſignifie God; which to prove out of many Texts, I ſhall bring only two in S. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, and if in the whole Bible there was but one, yet it would be ſufficient, for every word therein is Truth; and if once the Holy Ghoſt therein declares the Son of God to ſignifie God, 'tis not in the power of Men or Devils to make it otherwiſe: Beſides that, the two Texts are ſo plain, that there is no ground left to Cavil: The firſt place is about the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given ſome words ſpoken by our bleſſed Lord, whereby, ſaid the Jews, <hi>thou makest thy ſelf God,</hi> which<note place="margin">John 10. 33, 36.</note> our Saviour rendered by theſe, <hi>I ſaid I am the Son of God.</hi> So that the words <hi>God, Son of God,</hi> ſignifie juſt the ſame: The Queſtion between our Lord and the Jews, was not about the meaning of what he had ſaid, they were agreed about it; but the Diſpute was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe words were Blaſphemy? which they affirmed, and he denied. Thoſe words in queſtion ſpoken by our Saviour are in ver. 30. <hi>I and my Father are One,</hi> which becauſe they are moſt material to the Queſtion, I ſhall thereupon obſerve this, How therein <hi>Chriſt</hi> expreſſes Two Perſons, Himſelf and the Father; the word I

Work: And ye are much miſtaken, to ſay they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted their Opinions into Articles, for the Articles of our Faith are not Mans Opinions, they extracted them out of the Word of God, which ſupplied them with the Materials, only they diſpoſed it into the beſt Order they thought fit, as God enabled them: After this rate you attempt to give our Religion a fatal blow; you would have us to pin our Faith on Mens Sleeves and Opinions, ſo they might lawfully be repealed this Year, the next, or at any time: Thus if <hi>Popery</hi> under King <hi>James</hi> had prevailed, we had quite been at a loſs, our Articles had been declared Heretical, (tho' if we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them according to the Rule of God's Word, they are as ſound as any can be) and our Religion in ſome ſenſe had been loſt, and we put to ſeek for and ſet up another: But, I ſay, that tho' the whole <hi>Popiſh,</hi> falſe Chriſtian and <hi>Mahometan</hi> World, ſhould condemn them, yet ſtill they would be True and Orthodox, not becauſe they were formed by a <hi>Convocation,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are collected out of God's Word the Rule of Truth: Suppoſe <hi>Socinians</hi> here had the upper hand, which I hope I ſhall never live to ſee, then they would get a <hi>Convocation</hi> of their own to wreſt and turn our Articles into their Channel, and for all their plea for a private Interpretation, they would ſet up a publick one of their own, and like another Council of <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> which revoked what that of <hi>Nice</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt <hi>Arians,</hi> have an Aſſembly to Condemn, or at leaſt to give our ſaid Articles their <hi>Socinian</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.

is a Synagogue of Satan, and that the Devil hath his Martyrs as well as the Lord Jeſus; ſome have been ſo far hardened, as to dye for denying there is a God; therefore 'tis neither the Manner, nor the Place, but the Cauſe of Death which makes the Martyr; 'tis neither <hi>Smithfield</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> nor <hi>Campo di Fiori</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> for as the moſt honeſt Men, ſo the greateſt Villains may happen to be executed in both; neither muſt we believe thoſe who falſly would call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Diſciples of Chriſt, and inſinuate as if they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for his Cauſe, when 'tis for their Hereſies and Blaſphemies: I remember the Apoſtles words, how <hi>falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Workers would transform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>

               <p>HAVING done with one Antagoniſt, I muſt now turn to the other: Between them both they ſhar'd the Task, to try which of the two could moſt wreſt and miſ-repreſent things, and give a Man ill Language. wherein it muſt be owned, this laſt yields it not to the firſt (for they writ after the ſame manner) and whoſe ſteps about my Epiſtle he follows in his firſt Page, and part of the next, wherein he would ſeem to ſoar high in his politick Enthuſiaſms, and then falls down right into a Nonſenſe, which he would<note place="margin">page 17.</note> father upon me; certainly a Man hath little to ſay or do, that ſtumbles at the Threſhold, and falls a gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Straws, when there are ſolid and good things to mind; and inſtead of examining high Matters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity offered, he to put off the Blow, and for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſake, turns to be a Grammarian, and pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls upon cavilling at Words: This, like the Dog in the Fable, is to ſnap at the Shadow and leave the Body: My words are theſe, <hi>To time things well, is one of the beſt parts of Prudence:</hi> To ſay it is the part of a prudent Man to act in due time and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is there any thing contrary to Senſe and Reaſon? By the word Part is not meant any ſuch thing as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108605:26"/>
we call <hi>Eſſential</hi> part, as the Soul is to Man, or what we call <hi>Integrant</hi> part, ſuch are an Arm or a Leg to the Body, but 'tis an uſual way of ſpeaking to ſay, 'Tis the part of a Wiſe Man not to be Haſty, 'tis the part of a Chriſtian to Forgive, to ſignifie how 'tis proper for, and belongs to a Wiſe Man not to be Raſh, and to a Chriſtian to Forgive: I add, <hi>and one of the moſt Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Circumſtances of our Actions,</hi> the meaning is plain, how Timing things well, is one of the chief and moſt neceſſary Circumſtances of our Actions. This is no juſt cauſe for any Man thereupon to entertain ſuch idle and extravagant Fancies as we ſee him to do: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being a great Philoſopher, one may know there are ſeveral Circumſtances belonging to every Action: An ordinary Rhetorician can tell the Rule—<hi>quis, quid, ubi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.</hi> I take Agent, Time and Place, to be three Concomitants of any Action, and without the three no Action, ſo then the prudential part of an Agent in the Act, and to make it ſucceed, is to chuſe a fit and proper Time; to apply a Remedy, take Phyſick or be let Blood; if done in due time, is to obſerve one of the chief and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Circumſtances If the word <hi>Eſſential</hi> joyned to <hi>Circumſtance</hi> doth diſquiet you, then by the word <hi>moſt Eſſential</hi> is improperly underſtood the Circumſtance moſt neceſſary to be obſerved; we uſe to ſay a thing moſt Eſſential, or moſt Neceſſary, moſt to the purpoſe, moſt Important and moſt Material, to ſignifie the ſame thing or near upon't; I take the Eſſence, whether Phyſically or Metaphyſically, to be the ſame with the Nature of the thing: And do you not think that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have their Nature, and that there is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Accident as of a Subſtance? and that to the end one may Act well, there is that which is Neceſſary and moſt Neceſſary. God forbid, when we ſpeak of Gods Nature, or even of matters of Philoſophy, we ſhould make no difference between Eſſence and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; but in Diſcourſe 'tis uſual, as you know too well, to make uſe of ſuch improper and figurative Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. Doth not our Grammar tell us, that Nouns Adjectives are compared, and that there are three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Compariſon, have ye ſo far forgotten it? Thus
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108605:26"/>
the word Eſſential is an Adjective, whereof the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative we call moſt Eſſential, and we may ſay Eſſential, more and moſt Eſſential: Surely ye <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>acute</hi> Sophiſters, if ever you learned Logick, were taught, that there is a Predicament called <hi>Proprium,</hi> and that there is a <hi>Proprium</hi> not only <hi>primô,</hi> but alſo <hi>quartô mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dô; Quod convenit ſoli, ſemper, &amp; omni,</hi> which in Grammar words we may call moſt proper in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative degree: And ye Gentlemen, for ſo I muſt call you, (tho' I would have call'd you by your Names if ye had ſubſcrib'd your Letters) ye Gentlemen <hi>Socinians,</hi> who are ſo much for <hi>Tropes</hi> and Figures, might know how 'tis uſual by an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> to repreſent things with exaggeration as whiter than Snow, blacker than Pitch; and if ſuch manners of ſpeaking with exaggeration be admitted in a common Diſcourſe, much more may this improper one now in queſtion: So ſometimes a thing which we like well, we call beſt of all; thus if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſaying Eſſential I ſaid moſt Eſſential, I did uſe the Superlative degree inſtead of the Poſitive: But theſe are but Quibbles of your own, which argues, that ſeeing you ſtick at ſuch things, you have little elſe to ſay for your ſelves; ye leave things for Words, and like drowning Men, lay hold upon any thing that lieth in your way to ſave a ſinking Cauſe, when no ſerious Man but would think it below himſelf to ſtay upon ſuch things; all your Obſervations and Inferences are an effect of a diſtemper'd Imagination, and not of a ſound Reaſon, whereby you deſerve the name of the <hi>Ridiculer ridiculed:</hi> As well as you, we know Eſſence to be one thing and Circumſtance another; but that were tolerable, if ye did not as ye do, jeſt with Holy things. But I think to know where the Sore lieth; ye do not like the words Eſſential nor Eſſence, derivative nor primitive; and tho' in the Schools of Divinity and Philoſophy they be uſed, yet ye diſlike them, becauſe in ſo many Letters not to be found in Scripture; but here you might ſee I uſe it not in a Religious but Civil account. I own I am at a loſs to find a way how to pleaſe ſuch nice Spirits as ye are; for of one ſide ye would not have us to uſe the words Eſſence, Trinity, Perſon, becauſe you ſay they are not in the word of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108605:27"/>
God, yet ye both find fault with me for making uſe of Scripture ſo much as I do againſt you in my Book: So ye Gentlemen, prodigies of Learning, may now ſee, (which if you do not others do) how ye ſin againſt very common Rules; what then will become of <hi>the four things you learned,</hi> after you put your Wits to the rack to make others paſs for Nonſenſical Scriblers, who hardly can write three words of good Senſe? Thus if your witty Premiſes do fall, how can your learned Inferences ſtand? Theſe miſerable Shifts, which every ſolid Man would ſcorn to trouble his head with, do tend only to ſhew how in you is an earneſt deſire, but want of power to make others who differ from you, to paſs for Silly and Ridiculous: ſo take to your ſelves what you had prepared for others: But what's all this to the Cauſe, but a putting it off and running away from it?</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed how, when I penned my Epiſtle, I thank God, I was in my right Senſes, the next thing I muſt do, is to prove my Charge againſt <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> which he calls <hi>falſe and diſagreeing,</hi> yet I make no doubt but it will ſtick. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I call it <hi>Blaſphemous,</hi> and I ſhall prove it out of better Authority than that of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Knight or <hi>Bidle</hi>'s, or what the Reaſons<note place="margin">pag. 19.</note> to the contrary of the Authors of both Letters, can come to. In order to't, I ſay, there is a twofold Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,<note place="margin">pag. 18.</note> one <hi>Poſitive,</hi> when Men call or otherwiſe make God a Liar, and to deny himſelf, or the like; and the other <hi>Negative,</hi> when Men deny him to be Infinite, Almighty, or Eternal; the firſt when God is made to be what he is not, the ſecond when he is deny'd to be what he is: That Blaſphemy is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Injury, directly againſt God's Nature, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes or Works, is ſo plainly and frequently ſet down in Scripture, that I think unneceſſary for me to prove it; and if the ſame offence committed againſt God's Nature, Attributes and Works, be called Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and that committed againſt the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Perſon be called Blaſphemy; it follows firſt, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is true God; then ſecondly, that whoſoever denies Chriſt to be God in his Nature, Attributes and Works, he is a Blaſphemer: Now <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> denieth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108605:27"/>
our Saviour, Divine Nature, and Eſſential Attributes of that Nature; therefore <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> is a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Opinion and Doctrine, as much for denying Chriſt to be true God by Nature, as by denying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, Almightineſs and Eternity.

That Chriſt was the Son of God; which to prove, he made uſe of the words of <hi>Pſalm 2. Thou art my Son,</hi> &amp;c. in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Senſe; their ſpeaking againſt this is call'd <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting and Blaſpheming;</hi> upon the ſame account in another place 'tis ſaid, <hi>they oppoſed and blaſphemed.</hi>

               <p>The next Charge againſt <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> is <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Deiſm;</hi> he doth couple them thinking to ſhew a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, but there is none: I ſay to worſhip the true God not in a true manner is Idolatry, as well as to worſhip a falſe God: <hi>Jeroboam</hi> for worſhipping the true God in an undue manner, is branded with Idolatry, and provoked God as much as <hi>Ahab</hi> for worſhipping <hi>Baal,</hi> or a falſe God, or elſe with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts we muſt take away the Second Commandment: In like manner, I ſay, not to know the true God in a true manner is <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> as well as not to know
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108605:28"/>
him at all; and the true way to know God, is to know him in Chriſt, without whom no true knowledge of God; to that purpoſe the Apoſtle ſaith unto the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that at that time when they were without Chriſt, they alſo were without God in the world:</hi> That is, they were <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> and is it truly to know God in Chriſt, only to know him there in a Creature? (ſeeing the very Heathens can tell us, <hi>Praeſentemque refert quae li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet herba Deum</hi>) and not rather as in him <hi>in whom dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> Theſe<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 9.</note> fragments of Scripture pleaſe not <hi>Socinians,</hi> for they not knowing God in Chriſt, as his Eternal and Natural Father, are thereby branded with Atheiſm. As for <hi>Deiſm,</hi> I take it in the Senſe wherein it is taken now adays, for a <hi>Deiſt</hi> is he who prefers Humane Reaſon before Faith and Revelation; ſo you own my Charge is not a perfect Nonſenſe, tho' in ſome degree you would have it ſtill to be a Nonſenſe; for you are pleaſed thus magiſterially to decide, <hi>Now I confeſs this</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>ſort of Charge is not ſo perfect a Nonſenſe as the other;</hi> however I ſtill lay under the Laſh, for <hi>it is a ſilly Calumny,</hi> as you ſay, yet 'tis no Calumny but a Truth, and that no ſilly one: (I ſhall anon take notice of your Stile.) <hi>Deiſm</hi> is not only an abſolute denial of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, but alſo 'tis a giving the preference to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon before Revelation; which is done when you ſet up your own Reaſon to be a Judge of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and here I hold you faſt, for elſe you would give the Slip. Tho' you have not the face to deny Chriſtian Religion to be of Divine Inſtitution, yet your own Reaſon, which your Brother calls the only Guide which God hath given us to Judge and Interpret that Revelation, you exalt above it; Is not this to ſet up a Tribunal over and above the Word of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible God, and to make your poor ſilly Humane Reaſon the Oracle or Revealer of the true Senſe of that Revelation? So I leave you to refute this Charge of <hi>Deiſm</hi> as well as you can, the <hi>Racovian</hi> Catechiſm ſhall afford you no help, except you mince it as you uſe to do other things, which by and by I ſhall, by the Grace of God, take notice of. A <hi>Deiſt</hi> we call him who makes a God of his own reaſon, as you do, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108605:28"/>
is, ſets up a falſe God; now between ſuch a one and an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> there is not the direct oppoſition which you imagine, for in theſe Times <hi>Deiſt</hi> is taken in an ill Senſe, and in a way of Reproach; but to believe a God is no Reproach, and ought to be taken in a favourable Senſe; ſo 'tis the uſe of the words that ſhews their ſignification: Beſides, as there are two ſorts of Atheiſts, the one in Theory the other in Practice; for as there<note place="margin">Pſal. 53. 1.</note> is a <hi>Fool,</hi> whom <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, who <hi>ſaith in his heart there is no God,</hi> ſo there is a Fool that ſaith ſo in his Actions, and lives as if there was no God: The like we ſay of <hi>Deiſts,</hi> ſome are Speculative, ſuch as believe as you do, their own Reaſon to be the only guide in Matters of Religion; others are Practical <hi>Deiſts,</hi> who accordingly own no other Senſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but what is their own Interpretation. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers through-paced, I may add, who are both Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Theorical <hi>Deiſts,</hi> and I make no doubt but<note place="margin">pag. 22.</note> that ye know well where they live, tho' <hi>you queſtion much whether we have any of theſe</hi> Socinians <hi>in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Profaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Immorality</hi> follow next: Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I call a handling of Holy things without a due Reſpect, which in a high degree is the guilt of <hi>Socinians,</hi> as in ſeveral places of my Book I made it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; how bold and ſawcy are they with God's Word? How contrary to the analogy of Faith, the deſign of the Spirit of God, and the natural, uſual and proper ſignification of the Words, do they wreſt Scripture to make it ſerve their own turn? They irreverently uſe it as a Stalking-Horſe to anſwer their ends, and by forcing unuſual and far-off-fetch'd Interpretations, as much as in them lieth, would make it contradict it ſelf: This, and prefering Humane before Spiritual and Heavenly things, like <hi>Eſau,</hi> whom Scripture calleth <hi>a profane perſon, for ſelling his birth-right for a morſel</hi>

in any of your Books you do not ſay ye are Profane, but out of what you ſay in your Two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how that, as to your ſelves, you are the Judges of Scripture, and that your Reaſon is your only Guide in giving ſuch Interpretation as ye think fit, is not this to make bold with Holy things? Tho' I had no other Evidence (which yet I am full of) I ſay, that only is a ſufficient ground for me to conclude your Principles to be Profane, which make you prefer your own Reaſon before the Teaching of the Holy Ghoſt out of that ſame Scripture, and thoſe who embraced your Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, are thereby led into Profaneneſs.</p>
               <p>What you ſay about the Means uſed by ſome Men to promote Hereſies by high pretences to Piety and Vertue, may be true, and what I ſay too, every Bait is not proper for every ſort of Fiſh, ſo Men have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways to get Proſelytes, according to the ſeveral Tempers of thoſe whom they would draw to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; do but find the predominant Paſſion of a Man, and, except God be pleaſed to ſtrengthen him, ye are like ſoon to draw him into your Snare, according as they are acted by Worldly Conſiderations.

                  <hi>As to what concerns Idolatry, it muſt be confeſſed, that</hi> Socinus'<hi>s Syſtem of Divinity is not abſolutely free from it;</hi> and he gives his reaſon thus, <hi>for he maintaineth that Divine Worſhip is to be given to Jeſus Chriſt, tho' he be not the true Almighty, and the eternal God, but only ſomething I know not what, more than a meer Man;</hi> which is but what themſelves make of him and no more. To render the Creature a Religious Worſhip only due to the Creator, is certainly Idolatry; <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I queſtion much whether we have any of theſe Socinians in</hi> England; he is beſt able to tell, being no doubt, well acquainted with moſt <hi>Socinians</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> He thereby declares that there is more than one kind of <hi>Socinians,</hi> and what a kind of them he himſelf is of, namely a <hi>Davidian:</hi> Among the promoters of this Hereſie, I in my Book took notice of one <hi>Francis David,</hi> who tho' in every thing elſe he agreed with <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> yet herein he differed from him, that he denyed any Religious Worſhip ſhould be rendered unto <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that the Author of the Letter is of that Sect of <hi>Socinians,</hi> I am confirmed in my opinion by what he ſaid before, how <hi>Socinus lies under the ſuſpicion of having</hi>

                  <hi>contributed to the Perſecution of</hi> Francis David: Here appears his Partiality for this laſt againſt the firſt; ſo <hi>Socinus</hi> was a Perſecutor, ſo may <hi>Socinians</hi> be upon occaſion: His Syſtem was not abſolutely free from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, but <hi>David</hi>'s was; however that diſtinction cannot clear him, for tho' according to the <hi>Socinian</hi>

Hypotheſis the <hi>Davidian</hi> Opinion be free from Idolatry, yet according to ours, 'tis the worſt of the two, for they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deprive our Saviour of the Worſhip which the others yield him in ſome way: in the mean time he would give us the ſlip thus, <hi>It is not unlikely but that Socinianiſm may get clear of the Charge of Idolatry, either by the help of her own Logick, or by virtue of the Authority of the Church:</hi> as if the Church was bound to defend their Errors.

among you not only all Excrements of Chriſtian Religion, but even <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> for you think the way to Heaven broad and eaſie, there being, as ye ſay, but very few things neceſſary to Salvation to be done and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, contrary to what our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leads unto Life,</hi> and his Apoſtle ſaith <hi>the Righteous is ſcarcely ſaved.</hi> By<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 18.</note> what I ſaid it may appear whether my Charge was diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, falſe and incredible, or whether the Attendance I gave <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> doth not belong to it.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the two ways whereby you think <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm</hi> may get clear of the Charge of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> the firſt you ſay is <hi>by the help of her own Logick,</hi> the ſecond <hi>by virtue of the Authority of the Church;</hi> its Logick is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined enough according to this World, as far as <hi>Mode</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> can ſtretch, you will; if <hi>Barbara</hi> cannot do, may be <hi>Celarent, Ceſare, Feſtino,</hi> or ſome <hi>Bocardo</hi> will, all theſe are at the command of your <hi>Logicians,</hi> then <hi>Sophiſm,</hi> as <hi>Sorites</hi> or the like, will come in apace and in courſe, and when an Argument in its own <hi>Mode</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, then you will be mincing, for out of your own Letters I find ye are excellent in that Art; now your Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick is this, if nothing elſe can ſerve, you will ſay ye are no <hi>Socinians,</hi> ye take it an Injury to be ſo called, for ye ſay ye <hi>are very injuriouſly termed Socinians,</hi> yea twice in<note place="margin">p. 22, &amp; 33.</note> the ſame Page; ſo ye poſitively deny your ſelves to be <hi>Socinians,</hi> do ye ſay ſo out of ſhame or out of fear? one would think there is cauſe for both: Men who call themſelves and pretend to be Chriſtians ſhould indeed be aſhamed to go about robbing Chriſt of his due, and afraid of Puniſhment, if not from Men, yet at laſt from God, the Avenger of his Honour: not only (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him) he is no <hi>Socinian,</hi> but ſaith he, <hi>if there be any in</hi> England <hi>'tis more than I know;</hi> ſometimes ſome Men in the World know not themſelves, however they will not confirm their Denyal with an Oath.

the account of the moſt holy Trinity they put to us; a thing is or is not? ye are <hi>Socinians</hi> or ye are not? if ye be, why are ye ſuch Hypocrites as to deny it? if not, why do you concern your ſelves for them? let them maintain their own Quarrel and defend their own Cauſe, and why do ye take up the Cudgels for them? why in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, contrary to good Nature, Breeding and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do ye write ſo paſſionatly and angrily, that one would think your Letters to be dated from <hi>Billingſgate?</hi> if ye be <hi>Davidians</hi> ye are <hi>Socinians</hi> ſtill, and the worſt of them too: Sirs, 'tis not the Change of Name that can alter the thing, if ye hold <hi>Socinus</hi> his damnable Opinions, ye are <hi>Socinians,</hi> call your ſelves never ſo much by the Name of <hi>

the Harlot was Mother to the Child, whom ſhe pretended to be Mother to, tho ſhe was not, content ſhe was that the Child ſhould be divided and cut to pieces.

               <p>However 'tis worth the inquiring into, what they ground upon their calling themſelves Members of the Church? we already have taken notice of one place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſpeaking of themſelves in the third Perſon, they ſay, <hi>For Peace ſake they ſubmit to the Phraſe of the Church,</hi>

                  <hi>As for thoſe late</hi> Engliſh <hi>Writers ſometimes called</hi> Unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, <hi>and very injurioſly termed</hi> Socinians, <hi>they ſeem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to waſh their hand of it: and their diſputing ſome of the Articles of our Church, hath proceeded chiefly from their Apprehenſion that it would be Idolatry to admit them.</hi> Thus ſtill under diſguiſe, and of a third Perſon, they are thoſe late <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers who call themſelves <hi>

are none of the leſs fundamental, which they ſuſpected as leading into Idolatry, and therefore they would not admit them: See what Members of the Church theſe are, who publickly and in Print own that ſome of the Articles of the Church do tend to Idolatry; doth not this very thing deſerve Puniſhment according to Law? and to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their diſputing of ſome of the Articles, they would infinuate as if the Church, or ſome part of it, had owned they were in the right, <hi>Therefore upon the prudent Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which hath been given</hi> (he doth not name by whom) <hi>of ſome obnoxious Terms, they wave the Diſpute and come in as Brethren:</hi> This is as good as to ſay, that in our Articles thoſe that are the moſt Fundamental, are in terms juſtly obnoxious, that is to their Cavils: And to ſhew they had cauſe to take Exceptions, an Interpretation hath, according to their Senſe, been given thoſe Articles, and ſo, upon their own Terms, they are come in as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; if they are come in, then they were out before, and ſo no Members: Thus it ſeems they had Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in the Church with ſome who, as they term it, <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> made way for them to come in: Now doth not this Confeſſion juſtifie what in my Epiſtle I ſaid, <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> is gotten into the Church; and conſequently ſhew a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to turn it out: Thus having, as he thinks, twiſted <hi>Socinians</hi> with the Church, he moſt judiciouſly draws this Inference, and Ironically bids me defiance; <hi>I hope Mr.</hi> Gailhard, <hi>will not in anger againſt them, impute Idolatry to our Church, as by Law eſtabliſhed.</hi> Can any thing in relation to the Church, be ſpoken more inſolently in the face of the whole Nation?

Beſides, they would have the Diſpute to be only about Words, and ſo of no Importance; thus whether there be Three Perſons in the moſt adorable Trinity, and whether the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt be truly God, they make it to be a Diſpute only about a Word and a Trifle: What a Confidence is it for ſuch Men ſo publickly to vent their Impieties? Thereupon they declare to be ſatisfied upon this ground, that a conſiderable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the Church ſeem to be agreed with them in their Senſe; ſo according to this, a conſiderable Majority of the Church is become <hi>Socinian:</hi> Let him that can, believe this, for my own part I am not ſo Credulous; however, I humbly deſire of the Church, eſpecially of that leſſer part which this Man owneth not to be Socinian, to mind what he ſaith ſo openly, and to take it into their ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I bring it to their Door and there leave it: They are highly concerned to take in hand their own

of Religion I have no ſquint Eye, I am neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed nor afraid openly to own a Truth, if I was not ſatisfied it is ſo, I would not own it, but it being, I will do't, by the grace of God, as long as I live, till I ſee cauſe to the contrary: Therefore 'tis but time and labour loſt for ſuch Adviſers; their wiſe Counſels let them keep for themſelves, for ſome things which they call Senſe and Reaſon, others upon better grounds call Senſual Reaſon. And here, Sirs, I muſt tell you, how you talk ſo much of want of Learning in others, as if ye were the only great Doctors of the World; if, as ye ſay, I am a Myſtery to you, ſo is your Learning a Myſtery to me; by your Letters I cannot find where it lies, nor no Man elſe I think: But to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, to lodge all Brains in the World within your own Skull, to outface Men, to wreſt and miſrepreſent what others ſay, and to ſet up for Judges of all good Senſe, Wit and Learning, that indeed ye ſufficiently learned, and every one may well be ſatisfied how great proficients ye are in that kind of Learning: But to take my turn to Adviſe you, do not always truſt your own Looking-glaſs, for it doth but flatter you, and repreſents not after Nature; ye would appear unto the World as if all Wit, Parts and Learning were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoliſed to your ſelves, and all beſides you lying in Blindneſs and Ignorance: That Original Sin derived from, and inherent in <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Family, that old Leaven in you ought to be purg'd, but God knows when it will be, if at all, for ye look very big upon all others, like the proud <hi>Phariſees, This people who not knoweth the Law are Curſed,</hi> but we ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Seat.</p>
               <p>Matters of Grace and Providence I believe to be of the higheſt Importance, and ſuch as our Salvation depends upon, and in my judgment I am fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Arminians</hi> to be much in the wrong; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever if a Compariſon be made between the <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Principles, no Man that is acquainted with both can but make a difference; for tho' in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things they agree, yet in others of the moſt Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, as about the Trinity and the Perſon of our bleſſed Saviour they differ from them, and therein join with us againſt that common Enemy, <hi>Socinians</hi> lay under

               <p>However, to ſhew you what a difference we ought to make between Adverſaries and Adverſaries; we have ſome Diſputes both againſt <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet much more and greater againſt the laſt than againſt the firſt; certainly we will not carry our ſelves equally towards both, for there is cauſe to make a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between them, which to ſhew, upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we keep Communion with <hi>Lutherans</hi> when we may not with <hi>Papiſts;</hi> yet the former are in a groſs errour to think the Subſtance of the glorified Body of Chriſt which is now in Heaven, and ſhall be until he comes to Judge the Quick and the Dead, to be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in, with, and under the Bread and Wine; yet becauſe they declare they adore not the Bread nor the Wine, we do not look upon them as Idolaters, as we take <hi>Papiſts</hi> to be, for they adore a Wafer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion that it is turned into the Subſtance of the Body of Chriſt, and we are forbidden to have Communion with Idolaters: Thus we ought to make a difference between <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts;</hi> ſo we muſt between thoſe who would deſtroy the Grace of God in Chriſt (which is very ill) and thoſe who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly fly againſt his Perſon, as ye do; nay I ſay <hi>Socinians</hi> in ſome things are worſe than <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who own the Article of the Trinity of Perſons in the Unity of Divine Nature, and the Divinity of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt, which ye deny: Ye are the worſt of all Chriſtian Societies, which Name ye are unworthy of, becauſe ye reject, deſpiſe and undervalue the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whom we are called Chriſtians, and will not take his Word nor

He highly commends that Man with the name <hi>Celebrated,</hi> in hopes upon occaſion of the ſame return of Flattery from him, for <hi>Aſinus aſinum fricat.</hi> The very Man whoſe Letter I now am about examining, would charge me with ſlurring the Honour of the Lords Biſhops, and deſperately wounding the Honour of the chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the Orthodox Faith: Would not one think that this Man is highly concerned for, and hath a great Honour for the Biſhops, whom he well calls the Chief Defenders of the Catholick Faith; but this muſt needs be either out of Hypocriſie to ſerve, as he thinks, his preſent turn againſt me, or by an <hi>Irony,</hi> for <hi>Socinians</hi> love neither Biſhops nor Convocations; for will they ſincerely call Defenders of the Orthodox Faith, thoſe who writ againſt them? And for proof of this, let us obſerve how in the fore-quoted place of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, they uſe one of our moſt Eminent and Learned Biſhops; when I ſpeak thus, the Reader will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know I mean my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who by them is named in the place: <hi>I know not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what it was to his Lordſhip's purpoſe to fall upon Mr.</hi> Toland'<hi>s Book;</hi> but if he knows it not, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did, and we may ſuppoſe it was to ſome purpoſe, or elſe he might as well ſay, the Lord Biſhop knew not what he did: One would think they cannot have the face to teach him what he muſt do: but here follows that which is worſe, <hi>but if he would needs attack the Book, he ſhould have dealt fairly.</hi> Which plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough implies the Biſhop hath not dealt fairly; and to ſhew herein that I am not miſtaken, he adds, <hi>and not carp'd only at a few Paſſages, and thoſe too ſo mangled and deformed by his repreſentation of them, that I dare to affirm, Mr.</hi> Toland <hi>doth not know his own Book in the Biſhop's repreſentation of it.</hi> Is not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108605:40"/>
this a plain demonſtration of the great reſpect which ſuch Men have for the Lords Biſhops, and of the Reaſon this Man hath to accuſe me for ſlurring and deſperately wounding the Honour of the Biſhops?</p>
               <p>But let us turn leave, and ſee in how different a Stile that <hi>Socinian</hi> ſpeaks of Mr. <hi>Toland</hi> and his Book, him he calls the Learned and Ingenious Author, and of the Book he ſaith, <hi>I do not perceive, to ſpeak truly, but that Book ſtill ſtands in its full ſtrength:</hi> and not only ſo, but, if we believe him, <hi>it hath alſo acquired a farther reputation,</hi> by what hath been written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, which that great Maſter of Learning doth deſpiſingly call <hi>an unſucceſsful nibling at it.</hi> But this kind of compariſon between two ſo highly different Perſons, is odious, for it carries along with it a great diſparagement to one of them againſt whom is given the preference, and is an invincible proof of want of judgment in ſuch Men as pretend to make it: but the commendation or diſcommendation of that ſort of People, being ſo miſapply'd, are inſignificant; and it would be no Credit, rather the contrary, for an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Perſon to be commended by them: But to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their Confidence to the utmoſt they challenge the Lord Biſhop <hi>to anſwer the Reaſons in their own Books againſt the Trinity.</hi> Yet for all this, and after their great Commendation of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Book, thoſe wiſe and cautious Men being afraid of any thing that ſmells of the Fire, as that Book doth, they declare about it, <hi>in which, and for which, we are not in the leaſt concern'd:</hi> But I think they were for one which ſomewhile ago was burnt, whilſt many more of theirs which now are abroad deſerve the ſame Fate. But as we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they will follow the Example of thoſe who brought in their Books (among which we may well think were no worſe than ſome of the <hi>Socinians</hi> are) and burnt them, which theſe will not themſelves do of theirs, for<note place="margin">Acts 19. 19.</note> indeed 'tis the proper work of the common Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, far from it they ſet them out and commend as much as they can, nay they are ſo bold as to let the World know there were ſuch Books of theirs abroad, and we find it many times, witneſs Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Apology among the Advertiſements in the <hi>Poſt-Boy,</hi> and ſuch
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108605:40"/>
printed Papers, and this in defiance of Laws and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, whoſe Authority in Matters of Religion, as obſerved before, they deny: So that it were but fit that on this occaſion that Illuſtrious Body would be pleaſed to aſſert and vindicate their Right. For that ſort of Men if they had Power, would in the denial of this Authority ſoon paſs from Religious to Civil Matters, wherefore 'tis the Intereſt of Church and State to ſupport one another, for they are like the Twain Children, born and bred together, between which was ſuch a ſympathy, that when one was Well, Sick, or Strong, the other was ſo too, and as they were born, ſo they died together.</p>
               <p>He who but a little before ſaid that the <hi>Socinians will agree to the</hi> diſputed <hi>Article if they may explain it,</hi> meant after their own way, is ſuch a ſtranger to Scripture, that if it be not the Printer's fault, I am apt<note place="margin">p. 31.</note> to believe, becauſe in the Margin I quoted not the place, he knew not whom I meant when to <hi>Socinians</hi> I apply'd the Character which Scripture gives of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi>

Tho' I do not mind the nauſeous ſtuff wherewith he hath fill'd up the reſt of that Page and the following, yet I well know and take notice how he is not ſatisfied to miſrepreſent me to the Lords Biſhops, but moſt maliciouſly would traduce me as one <hi>who makes impudent Reflections on the King and Parliament,</hi> thereby to make me obnoxious: To be Impudent were an invaſion upon his Property, which I never was nor ſhall be guilty of.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108605:41"/>
believe Scripture, Chaſtiſements or Puniſhments of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Families and Perſons, come from the hand of God; for as he is moſt Juſt, ſo leaves nothing unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; if in the World there was any Perſon free from Sin, that very ſame ſhould alſo be free from all manner of Pains; but Puniſhment is tyed to the tail of Sin, and when we feel God's Chaſtiſements, and we know they are inflicted for Sin, then the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, the greateſt and moſt frequent Sins are obvious to our Eyes, as the two in queſtion muſt needs be, and thereupon we ſhould ſay, <hi>Lord we have ſinned againſt Heaven and againſt thee.</hi> About this Point, I ſhall out of Scripture, bring a Precedent of what muſt be done in ſuch Caſes: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are ſmitten at <hi>Ai,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon<note place="margin">Joſh. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Joſhua</hi> rent his Cloths and fell upon his Face, and God ſaid unto him, <hi>Iſrael hath ſinned, I will be no more with you, except ye deſtroy the accurſed from among you;</hi> the Accurſed, both Perſon and Thing, at that time were deſtroyed; and now if not the Perſons, at leaſt the Thing ſhould be, if we will have God among us; and what things in the World more accurſed than Blaſphemy and Idolatry? wherefore I then did, and now do conclude, that all Chriſtian and prudent care ought to be uſed to remove Blaſphemy and Idolatry out of the Kingdom, but how to effect it, 'tis to be left to thoſe whom it belongs to, but ſtill the thing ought to be done; Now I ask, Is this to make an impudent Reflection againſt King and Parliament? But they make a real one, for under the notion that he is no Perſecutor, they would proclaim his Majeſty and the Parliament to favour and protect Blaſphemy and Hereſie, that is <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi>

               <p>But this Gentleman, according to the Spirit which they all are originally acted by, would profanely ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule the diſpenſations of God's ſpecial Providence and diveſt that infinite Majeſty of his being the juſt Judge of the World, who doth execute Juſtice and Judgment: After this rate the Old World was Drowned by Chance, tho' the Flood had been foretold 120 Years before: Thus <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were conſumed by Accident, and without God's ſpecial Appointment, tho' he out of Heaven rained Fire and Brimſtone: So

by Hazard <hi>Nadah</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were conſumed, tho' Scripture ſaith, <hi>There went out Fire from the Lord and devoured them.</hi> Likewiſe, without a ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the Earth opened her mouth and ſwallowed up <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> tho' it was a ſpecial Judgment of God; as was that of the 14700 Men, who for their murmuring againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as we read in the ſame Chapter, died of the Plague. In the like manner, after their Principles, the Famine in <hi>David</hi>'s days of three Years, Year after Year, came meerly according to a general courſe of Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a particular Cauſe, and ſpecial Providence; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly when <hi>David</hi> inquired about it, the Lord aſſigned the particul Cauſe, and anſwered, <hi>It is for Saul and his</hi>

But why ſhould I bring a Candle to light the Sun, and in a thing which God's Word doth ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully demonſtrate, how to puniſh National, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Perſonal Sins, God ſends the Plague, Famine, the Sword, venomous Beaſts, the Locuſt, the Canker-Worm,<note place="margin">Joel 2. 25.</note> the Catterpillar, and the Palmer-Worm, which the Lord calls <hi>his great Army which I ſent among you:</hi> Did the Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> come at a venture, or were they inflicted by God to puniſh that Nation for their Sins? God threatned the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Diſobedience, <hi>to ſend upon them Curſing, Vexation and Rebuke; the Peſtilence, a Conſumption, a Fever, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, an extreme Burning, the Sword, Blaſting, Mildew, the both of Egypt, the Emerods, with Scabs and Itch, Madneſs, Blindneſs, Aſtoniſhment of heart, &amp;c.</hi> as expreſſed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. Are not all theſe Judgments of God upon Men for their Sins? Have I then ſpoken any harm, that you ſhould Cavil at what I ſay, that to the Toleration of Blaſphemy and Idolatry, we may chiefly attribute the cauſe of the Chaſtiſments which make the Nation uneaſie through loſſes by Sea, by Land, by Fire, or any other way you named or can name? Blaſphemy and Idolatry ('tis a ſad truth) do
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108605:42"/>
abound in the Land, and a flood of all Evil in Doctrine and Practiſe hath overflowed it; and tho' it be againſt Goſpel and Law, yet no viſible effectual care is taken to ſuppreſs it: Can we be unconcerned when we hear God by his Prophet ſpeaking thus, <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? ſhall not I be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi> Jer. 5. 29. With ſuch a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in my hand, I am neither aſhamed nor afraid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to declare, that winking at Blaſphemy and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, we may well reckon among the chief Cauſes which have drawn God's Rod upon the back of the Nation, and the more, becauſe the Sins which there move God to ſpeak by his Prophet, are againſt Men, but theſe we now complain againſt are directly againſt God: And if God be angry for their not judging for Men, will he not be ſo if Men neglect to Judge for him? Do but read the laſt Verſe of the ſame Chapter, where mention is made of Diſtempers, if not exactly the ſame in relation to Perſons, yet in Nature much like ours, and take notice of God's Expoſtulation there, <hi>What will ye do in the end thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Miſdemeanour they would wrongfully charge me with, I may juſtly retort upon them: With all due Reſpect I addreſſed to both Houſes, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly repreſented things as 'tis uſual in points of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, whereof ſome are of a Spiritual as others of a Temporal nature: I then ſaid, and now ſay it again, that according to Divine and Humane Laws, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy ſhould be rooted out and Blaſphemers puniſhed: To ask for Juſtice is not to preſcribe the Judges any thing what they ought to do, and there is nothing like this in my whole Epiſtle, as theſe words of mine which the Author of the Letter hath taken notice of, do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Thus having laid open the Diſeaſe, I leave it for your Piety and Chriſtian Wiſdom to find out, and apply the true and proper Remedy:</hi> We know 'tis for the Supreme Judges to do Juſtice in what manner and degree they pleaſe: no Man of ſenſe will deny it to be in the power of, and to belong to the Magiſtrates Office to puniſh Delinquents againſt God as well as thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Men, of the firſt as well as of the ſecond Table, Blaſphemers, Idolaters, Profaners of God's Holy Name,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108605:42"/>
as well as Murtherers, Adulterers and Thieves: S. <hi>Paul</hi> was no ſanguinary Man, yet in one place, after an enumeration of ſeveral things, whereof ſome are leſs grievous than Blaſphemy, concludeth, <hi>That they which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>commit ſuch things are worthy of death.</hi> For my part, I neither in my Epiſtle nor in the Preface have ſaid, or deſigned to ſay ſo; yet if I had, without being a Sanguinary Man, I here have a Warrant for it.</p>
               <p>But having ſpoken of my ſelf, I now muſt come to you and ſay, Ye both have been much wanting in your due reſpect for that Illuſtrious Aſſembly of <hi>Parliament:</hi> For one humbly to Addreſs or Petition the Supreme Judges to redreſs things which are amiſs, is no diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; but to pretend to be their Apologiſt and make uſe of their Name in an Ironical way, as ye, I may ſay, ſaucily have done in the Title of your Pamphlet, is certainly to want a due reſpect and to deſerve Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: To call a Libel againſt the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Law eſtabliſhed by the name of <hi>An Apology for the Parliament, moſt humbly repreſenting, &amp;c.</hi> is a great Abuſe, and a piece of high Impudence in you, which hangs together with your whole Carriage; for contrary to the known Laws of the Land, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdictions, you do print, publiſh, and moſt inſolently go about to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate your Heretical and Blaſphemous Opinions in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to and the diſturbance of the Church by Law eſtabliſhed. And when ye are not able to defend your bad Cauſe, to give the thing a wrong ſide, the Superior Power to be your drudges, muſt by you be brought in, but 'tis in you a high preſumption to think you can impoſe upon them: Now for my part I muſt tell you, that when I am engaged in any Controverſie I ſtick to the Point, beg for no Foreign help, and Anſwer not with Injuries but with good Arguments, ye do the contrary. But over and above what I have ſaid, to ſhew how with humbly Addreſſing my ſelf to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to ask Juſtice againſt you, and towards prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the growth of Socinianiſm, I did nothing but what is according to Law, I here lay down an undeniable proof of it, with a Copy of the Preſentment of the Grand Jury of <hi>Middleſex</hi> on the laſt day of the laſt

Property and the Perſon of the Godhead, but you do confound them, and would have it to be but one and the ſame: Now if with us you will ſay, that in one and moſt ſimple Nature of God are three diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom the infinite and ſingular Nature of one only God is common, and that theſe three diſtinct Perſons, the Attributes of that one God do belong to, then you ſay ſomething to the purpoſe, or elſe, like the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> you come in to us only to deceive us: We aſſert three Perſons and not barely three Properties in the Godhead; we ſay the Father is a Perſon, the Son a Perſon, and the Holy Ghoſt a Perſon, and ſo three Perſons; but we don't ſay, the Father is an Attribute, the Son an Attribute, and the Holy Ghoſt an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, thereby of three Perſons to make three Attributes: We cannot ſay the Son of God to be a Property or Attribute; we cannot ſay an Attribute of Divine Nature was made Fleſh; we cannot ſay three Properties appeared in our Saviours Baptiſm, or that we are baptiſed in the Name of three Properties: Therefore ye may ſee we are not ſo far agreed as you ſaid; if you will have us to be agreed, you muſt come to us, for we declare we cannot go to you, that's the eaſieſt and ſureſt way of the two, for we are tyed by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and may go no farther than it doth allow us; but your Human Reaſon is a Latitudinarian which can ſtretch a great way; we may not, we cannot go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds which God in his Word hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed us, but ye are Free-willers and at liberty; to day your Reaſon may teach you one thing, to morrow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; for as you ſay your ſelves, <hi>a Doctrine which at one time may be convenient, may be otherwiſe when Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi>

But as for <hi>Socinus</hi> he was a moſt excellent Man, very ſound in the Faith, and who, if we will believe this Man, hath by his Works laid a great Obligation upon the World, and he ſubſcribes to what one of the Gang ſaid of him, That <hi>none ſince the Apoſtles hath deſerved</hi>

accordingly, the beginning, progreſs and end of our Salvation, and from firſt to laſt, we attribute to God's free Grace, which in that matter we can never yield too much nor too little to any thing of our own; we do not, like the Phariſee, boaſt in our Prayers, that we Faſt twice a Week, give Tithes, and are not<note place="margin">Luke 18. 11, 12, 13.</note> Extortioners, Unjuſt, and make no Compariſon with our Neighbours as being better Men than they, but we ſay, God be merciful to us miſerable Sinners; for we are commanded to <hi>truſt in the Lord with all our hearts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 5.</note> and forbidden <hi>to lean unto our own underſtanding,</hi> which is as good as to ſay, depend not upon your own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; therefore in any thing we go about, we are to call upon God for his help, and the gracious influence of his Holy Spirit, being ſure that without it we can do no good; and we be ſufficiently taught in Scripture to truſt to no ſtrength or abilities of our own; and when in the World we meet with Men of Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe, we find it not ſtrange, for we know that <hi>there muſt be alſo Hereſies among us,</hi> or thoſe called Chriſtians, <hi>that they which are approved may be made manifeſt among us:</hi> Wherefore as long as we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe Matters ſuch a Foundation as <hi>Paul</hi> the great Preacher of Free Grace hath laid, we need not to care for all Exceptions or Cavils of Men or Devils: Theſe are ſuch Truths, as we hope through Grace, never to be aſhamed or afraid to own unto the end, even to lay down our Lives, as he did his, for ſo Glorious a Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Grace are ſo linked together, that no Man ſtrikes at one, but the other feels it; tho' may be in a different degree, they have a common Enemy, ſo he who is againſt one is againſt both, which I poſitively affirm of <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; Grace and Truth,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>came by</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 1. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who coming into the World brought Grace along with him, for he is the Spring of it, which he manifeſted in framing and redeeming of his Church, the Foundation whereof and of our Chriſtian Religion lies in this great and fundamental Truth whereof <hi>Peter</hi> made a Confeſſion, how Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is the Son of the living God;</hi> upon the verity<note place="margin">Matt. 16. 18.</note> whereof, there our Saviour declared that his Church
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108605:46"/>
ſhould be built, and at the ſame time ſignified that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it:</hi> For this is <hi>the Houſe built</hi> upon a Rock which, tho' <hi>the Rain</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 7. 24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>deſcendeth, and the Floods come, and the Wind blows, yet it falls not, for it is founded upon a Rock.</hi> In that Promiſe of his the Lord Jeſus declares two things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Gates, that is the Power of Devils in Hell, would afterwards make ſome attempt againſt that fundamental Truth of his being <hi>the Son of the living God.</hi> As indeed, it hath from time to time raiſed its ſtrongeſt Batteries againſt it, as not long after his Aſcenſion, even in the life time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſciple, and after his death, the Aſſaults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus, Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and afterwards by other Helliſh Inſtruments: But in <hi>Arius</hi>'s time great ſtrugglings happened with ſo prodigious a ſucceſs, that all the World was ſaid to be <hi>Arian;</hi> hence came the Saying, <hi>All the World againſt</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>and</hi> Athanaſius <hi>againſt all the World;</hi> ſo afterwards for the ſame Cauſe againſt our Saviour's Divinity, ſeveral fought under the Banners of Hell, as now, tho' more cunningly, <hi>Socinians</hi> do, having taken up the Cudgels; and as thoſe Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Opinions were exploded out of the World, ſo ſhall be, in God's due time, thoſe which are raging for the preſent, notwithſtanding all the Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, Malice and Power of Hell, and all Antichriſts, of Devils and Men: This my ſo poſitively ſpeaking, is grounded upon Chriſt's Promiſe, how the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the truth of his being the Son of the living God, which his Church is built upon; and this is the <hi>Second</hi> thing, not only deduced from, but plainly contained in thoſe words of the Lord Jeſus, whoſe Perſon is a fit Object of Adoration, as his Grace is of Admiration. Theſe Truths one may abundantly be ſatisfied with out of Scripture, which I much have made uſe of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome places prove a Truth directly, others col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterally, and others are brought in to illuſtrate and give a light to the thing, ſo that Scripture is of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral uſes, nothing therein without ſome uſe; 'tis of it as of the Rivers in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> they all did not run one and the ſame way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:108605:47"/>But now to conclude, I in the firſt place put you in mind to Anſwer my Book, and then take this Occaſion which you give me, in caſe ye knew it not before, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, how upon thoſe Matters I have written a<note place="margin">A Plea for Free Grace againſt Free-will.</note> Book hitherto Unanſwered; if you have ſuch an averſion for them as you <note n="*" place="margin">p. 9, 20, 33.</note> expreſs, do but give us in Print your Thoughts about it, 'tis a fair Field I offer you, but be not afraid, for 'tis not <hi>Smithfield:</hi> but if ye can defend that Cauſe no better than the <hi>Socinian</hi> about the Holy Trinity and Perſon of the Lord Jeſus, then it will be in you but Time and Labour loſt in vain. And if you go about it, be more Serious in a Buſineſs of ſo high a nature, and leſs Virulent and Malicious; For ſhame leave off Jeſting with Holy things, and let it be without giving ill Language, for therein I yield you know to do't more than my ſelf, and write like Scholars and Gentlemen, without breaking the Bonds of Humanity, with Arguments as hard as ye pleaſe but ſofter Words, and make no more haſte than good ſpeed; if ye come in that way, then by the Grace of God I will fairly Anſwer you in the like manner; and tho' already there is Work enough cut for you, I doubt more than ye are well able to compaſs, yet ſeveral new Arguments I have to bring in: but if in the uſual Scolding Reviling way, I will leave you to chew your Cud: May be your Bantering way of Writing hath ſucceeded againſt ſome, but be not miſtaken, with others it will never do, come with good Arguments and then I am for you; however come which way you will, I declare I ſhall not in the leaſt care whether you come aſunder or both together.</p>
