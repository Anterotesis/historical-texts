         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Inquiry, till I have
not only commended
but encouraged your

<pb facs="tcp:61513:3"/>
it being an excellent piety
to endeavour to reduce them into
the right way, who are ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

moſt men expreſſeth it ſelf by fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

that all whom you converſe with,
were as happy in the choice of
their Faith, as you know your ſelf
to be: wherefore that I may as
well quicken your generous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
as invite ſome others to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
ſo good an example, I will
propound theſe few conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:61513:3"/>
1. The relation in which the
Engliſh Romaniſts ſtand to us
ſhould excite our care; for they
are all Natives of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Subjects of the ſame Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and are called by the ſame
general name of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> many
of them our kind Neighbours, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Acquaintance, or near Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and ſome of them (where
their Prejudice doth not blind
them) perſons of great reaſon, and
of ſo good inclinations, that they
are not made vicious by the evil
liberties which their principles do
allow: and ſhall we for want of
affection or courage ſuffer them
to be kept in ignorance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on at preſent, and to be led
blindfold in ſuch a way as will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
hazard the Salvation of
their precious Souls hereafter? If
all the relations they bear to us do
poſſeſs us with any real affection
<pb facs="tcp:61513:4"/>
for them, we cannot but do our
utmoſt to undeceive them. The
frauds indeed of the Guides of
that Church are daily more and
more laid open, but for want of
ſuch a charity as yours is, they
who are chiefly concerned, ſeldom
come to the knowledge of them:
I am ſure thoſe excellent pens
which diſcover'd them, did not
deſign we ſhould make their delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
the ſubject of our mirth, but
the means to convert the Souls of
thoſe who are linked to us in ſo
many bonds, that it is a ſhame we
ſhould ſuffer them to be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But we uſually excuſe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs,
under the pretence that
it is impoſſible to convert them:
Had our Anceſtors ſo eſteemed it,
the World had wanted the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Reformation: I grant
'tis difficult, becauſe of their rooted
<pb facs="tcp:61513:4"/>
prejudice, and the policy of their
Leaders, yet not impoſſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
many have undertaken it,
and prevailed. So that as <hi>Seneca</hi>
ſaith in another caſe, <hi>it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the difficulty that we do
not attempt it, but becauſe we do
not attempt it, therefore it ſeems
difficult,</hi> Ep. 104. The Philoſopher
tells us <hi>where there is no difficulty,
there is no opportunity to exerciſe
either art or vertue:</hi> and if we
were once willing to take ſome
pains for ſo noble an end, it would
much allay the trouble thereof, to
conſider the advantages which it
may bring not only to the party
which is the object of our charity,
but to the Church, yea and to our
own Souls alſo: for <hi>He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth
a ſinner from the errour of
his way, ſhall ſave a Soul from
death, and ſhall hide a multitude
of ſins,</hi> Jam. 5. 20. <hi>and they who
<pb facs="tcp:61513:5"/>
turn many to righteouſneſs ſhall
ſhine as the Stars for ever and
ever,</hi> Dan. 12. 3. Nay moreover if
ſuch Pious endeavours ſhould want
ſucceſs on Earth, they ſhall not fail
of a reward in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And finally, if we conſider the
unwearied induſtry of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in ſeducing, methinks it ſhould
awaken our diligence, in ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the weak, and reducing ſuch
as are out of the way. It had been
very ſtrange if the Apoſtles ſhould
have been unwilling to travel for
the propagation of the right faith,
and the winning Souls of Heaven,
when the Phariſees compaſſed Sea
and Land to reconcile a Proſelyte
to their particular Sect; and yet
alas 'tis too often ſeen, <hi>that the
children of this world are wiſer
in their generation than the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of light,</hi> S. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 18. The
Hermit <hi>Pambo</hi> accidentally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<pb facs="tcp:61513:5"/>
a theatrick woman dance
exquiſitely before a looſe aſſembly
at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is ſaid to have wept
abundantly, to conſider how much
more pains ſhe took to ſerve evil
ends, than he himſelf did to ſerve
God. Had we as much tenderneſs
as that holy man, doubtleſs we
have as great occaſion for our
ſhame and ſorrow, when we ſee
others more active to advance the
Myſtery of iniquity, than we are
to promote the glory of God, and
the ſalvation of your brethrens
immortal Souls.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations, <hi>worthy
Sir,</hi> I know have excited your
charitable reſolutions, and I hope
will prevail with many others to
endeavour the reformation of
their deceived friends: wherefore
that I may anſwer your deſires,
and contribute my poor aſſiſtance
to ſo pious and generous a deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:61513:6"/>
I have ſent you the following pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
wherein the deluſions of that
party are diſcovered as plainly,
yet as modeſtly as may be, that
they may ſee in a little room how
much it is their intereſt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to embrace the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion of the Engliſh
Church. I know all theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
have been more fully hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by better pens, but moſt of
theſe writings have been by way
of diſpute, and intended rather to
convince than perſwade. So that
they may be very proper to give
fuller ſatisfaction in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
doubted of, when their great
Prejudices are firſt a little remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
beſides there are many
through unavoidable buſineſs,
company, or other divertiſements,
who either have no leiſure or no
inclination to read a larger vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
being of <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s mind,
<pb facs="tcp:61513:6"/>
that <hi>A great book is a great evil</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> apud A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenaeum.</note>, who yet may
be prevailed with
to ſpare one hour
for ſo ſmall an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract as this. The
Jewiſh Talmud tells
us of a noble Heathen, who came
to Rabbi <hi>Hillet,</hi> and offered to
become a Proſelyte, if he could
teach him the whole Law at one
leſſon, <hi>Tract. Sab. fol.</hi> 31. and if
you meet with any of his mind,
they may perhaps be gratified
with this little Abridgment,
wherein the miſtakes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Perſwaſion are put into as
narrow a compaſs as they can
well be reduced to; ſo that even
thoſe who are yet reſolved to be
of that Church may perhaps not
be unwilling to peruſe it, that they
may at one view ſee, what their
Religion is charged with. And if
<pb facs="tcp:61513:7"/>
it do not gain ſuch perſons, yet it
will teach them to cenſure mildly,
and to diſſent from us with more
moderation: and as the volume is
ſmall, and ſo may invite thoſe to
its peruſal who are delighted with
brevity, ſo the ſtyle is as mild as
the matter would allow, and can
give no juſt offence to any: the
particulars are ſo plain, and ſo
fully proved more at large by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that the Author reſolves
not to diſpute, but in pure charity
to adviſe the Romaniſts not to
reſiſt apparent truth and reaſon,
having no worſe intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them than to ſet them into
the beſt way to Heaven; and if
any be angry at him or you for
this, they are the greateſt enemies
to themſelves, and more concerned
for their preſent Opinions, than for
their everlaſting Salvation; but
it is to be hoped the ſincerity of
<pb facs="tcp:61513:7"/>
your intention to do good may
oblige ſome kindly to accept this
Manual, at leaſt as a teſtimony of
your love; to whom, if you have
the liberty of diſcourſe, you ſhall
do well to clear thoſe exceptions
which Prejudice may ſuggeſt, and
at leaſt to obtain from them a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
impartially to enquire into
the truth of that which they ſo
confidently do believe: and ſure,
it is infinite pity that perſons of
excellent reaſon ſhould be ſo much
enſlaved, as not to dare to ask the
right way to bliſs of any, but thoſe
who have an abſolute dominion
over them, nor once to go about
to judge for themſelves in a caſe of
ſo great Concernment.</p>
            <p>I would be loath to think ſo
hardly of their Superiours, as to
ſuppoſe they interdicted their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
from all converſe with us;
for this were the exact parallel of
<pb facs="tcp:61513:8"/>
the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> policy, where it is
death for any to travel out of their
own Kingdom without eſpecial
licenſe, for fear they ſhould never
endure their former bondage,
when once they have ſeen the
freedom of other Nations: and if
once you can prevail ſo far, that
they will impartially compare
their own Opinions with ours, it
is probable they may become our
friends. I ſhall add no more but
to wiſh this Token may be as
kindly accepted as it will be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
offered by you, and to

Ends, I have been content
to obey your Requeſt, in review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in order to another Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which (You tell me) is now
deſired. In which Review, I
have rectified the Method of the
whole, and illuſtrated and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
every part, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of ſo many of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Inſtances and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as could be put in without too
much ſwelling the Bulk. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I did ſuppoſe the things to be
ſo evident, and ſo plainly proved
in larger Diſcourſes, that I was
not curious before, always to bring
Proofs for my Aſſertions: But
now your Letter acquaints me
both that ſome Romaniſts (who
<pb facs="tcp:61513:9"/>
reſolve boldly to deny, what they
cannot otherwiſe evade) have
queſtioned the Truth of ſome parts
of this charge; And alſo that thoſe
Proteſtants whoſe Charity hath
invited them to ſeek their Friends
Converſion, have deſired I ſhould
add my Authors to confirm theſe
Allegations: Therefore for the
full ſatisfaction of both Parties
I have proved all the particulars
by the Teſtimony of ſuch Authors
whoſe Evidence is unqueſtionable,
chuſing uſually the plain Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Popes and Cardinals, or
other approved Writers of the
Roman Church, that ſo thoſe of
that Party may believe theſe
Matters from the mouth of thoſe
whom they esteem their beſt
Friends, which they would ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
if we related upon our own
Credit, whom they unjuſtly account
their Enemies; And though their
<pb facs="tcp:61513:10"/>
preſent Romiſh Prieſts ſhould deny
thoſe things, which the moſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Writers of their own
Church have formerly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
they are not to be doubted
of upon that account, ſince the
Confeſſion of former Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their own Party is better
Evidence, than the denial of the
later can be for it; for <hi>No man
will lye</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian) to his
own diſgrace, but rather for his
credit: And it is more fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſuch as confeſs againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
than ſuch as deny for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">

none can justly
doubt of theſe
Truths thus atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted:
And he that once believes
them, and yet retains the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of <hi>Rome,</hi> must be of a humor
differing from the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who cannot chuſe a known
<pb facs="tcp:61513:10"/>
deluſion, nor delight in ſitting
under apparent abuſes. I muſt
expect the Admirers of that once
famous Church will entertain
theſe juſt and neceſſary Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof with ſome little heats
of Paſſion; but I hope it will calm
thoſe haſty motions when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
conſider, that ſince I
ſay no more than Truth I do no
injury to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Charity
which I have for them obliges
me to ſay ſo much. <hi>And why</hi>
(ſaith the Philoſopher) <hi>art thou
diſpleaſed at me, who have done
no more than a</hi> Looking-glaſs <hi>doth
to the deformed, having only
ſhewed thee to thy ſelf as thou

I hope that
I have undertaken
<pb facs="tcp:61513:11"/>
the office of a <hi>Friendly Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>

if in compliance
with this Rule I
ſhall ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
them to their Advantage,
I ſhall not only obtain a Pardon,

be convincing and perſwaſive, I
deſire them not to reſist their own

ſincerely ſeeks their good; but
if they abſolutely reſolve the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:61513:11"/>
rational and juſt Motives ſhall
not perſwade them to alter their
Old Opinions, I ſhall pity and
pray for them, but can uſe no
other Methods in this caſe; for
it is <hi>Counſel</hi> and not <hi>Command</hi>

her Opinions upon the world
by any other means, but theſe

her Neighbours then would not
have had ſo juſt cauſe to complain

might almoſt diſcourage ſuch an Attempt,
it being generally believed, that a <hi>Roman

<hi>Auguſtine, who (being deſcended of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing

But I know many of you

<hi>It is not the part of wiſe men</hi> (ſaith

And it is the advice of
the great Apoſtle, <hi>to
prove all things, and hold
faſt that which is good,</hi>
1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 21. becauſe it is a <hi>zeal without
knowledge,</hi> and a fooliſh obſtinacy to be
confident of that which we never did
examine. I can eaſily believe your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Guides will eſteem no ſin more
mortal, than to enquire into thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which you receive from them, and
they will ſcarce allow you the liberty to
peruſe a few lines preſented by ſo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a hand: But their Prohibitions (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks)
ſhould make you more ſuſpicious
and inquiſitive, and cauſe you to reſolve
to try that Coyn which ſhuns the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
knowing that <hi>Truth ſeeks no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and that which is Real fears no Teſt.</hi>
The Church of <hi>England</hi> puts no ſuch
Reſtraints upon her adherents, nor is ſhe
unwilling to have her Doctrines tried by
Scripture and the beſt Antiquity; becauſe
ſhe finds thoſe are her beſt Sons that have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61513:14"/>
enquired moſt narrowly. <hi>Evil needs a
mask and a diſguiſe</hi> (ſaid the brave <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus)
but Light makes true goodneſs to be
more illuſtrious and more lovely.</hi> And a
greater than he ſaith, <hi>Every one that doth
evil hateth the light, neither cometh to
the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved:
but he that doth turth cometh to the light.
S. John</hi> iii. 20. 21. If therefore you have
but ſo much conſideration as to ſuſpect,
and ſo much courage as to examine, I
ſhould not be without hope, that my
<hi>Advice</hi> might take place, ſince (as <hi>Plato</hi>
notes) <hi>Every ſoul is unwillingly deprived
of Truth, which men cannot reſiſt when
once it appears unto them:</hi> I ſhall ask no
more of you than to ſearch impartially,
whether the Doctrines wherein you dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> deſerve
ſo firm an aſſent as you give them;
and he that dares not do this, is not a
Diſciple, but a Slave. It may be thoſe
Counſellours may pleaſe the heady <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots</hi>
of your Perſwaſion better, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
them to eaſe their mind by reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Laws and the Government, or to
attempt the ſhaking off their Grievances
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61513:15"/>
by more deſperate courſes: But I do not
believe the wiſer and more ſober <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi>
can approve ſuch curſed motions,
there are many of them too noble to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſuch thoughts. It is the <hi>Stoicks</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in <hi>Galen, That they would rather
betray their Country, than renounce their
Maxims:</hi> But I take thoſe of your
Party to be generally of a better temper,
and therefore I hope you will account it
to be far more Friendly and Seaſonable
<hi>Advice,</hi> to try theſe your Principles ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly,
before you expoſe your Country or
your Selves to ſuffer all the ill-conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of your rigid maintaining of them,
and if you once rightly underſtand them,
I hope you will diſcern they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be retained at ſo dear a rate: ſo
that it is poſſible you may reſolve to quit
your miſtaken Opinions and your real
Sufferings together. However, though
your Enquiry ſhall not have this effect,
yet this Trial of your Principles ought
not to be wholly declined; for I would
adviſe you to examine the <hi>Roman</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
if it were but only to declare, that
your Religion is not a blind and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61513:15"/>
choice, and to vindicate your ſelves
from the charge of the Old <hi>Samaritans,
who worſhipped they knew not what.</hi>

               <p>I doubt not, but theſe who have been

theſe are a <hi>New Religion;</hi> and yet theſe

In all the Principles which are truly the

the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for the Doctrines in

The taking the <hi>Cup from the Laity</hi> is
contrary to our Saviours Inſtitution, as

where the Greek only hath, <hi>We

17. The Veneration which you give to
<hi>Images,</hi> ſeems to all impartial eyes direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrary to the Second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and though your Prieſts will not
directly confeſs it, yet their general
leaving out the <hi>Second Commandement</hi> in
your Catechiſms, and cutting the <hi>Tenth</hi>

conceal the omiſſion from the Vulgar, is
a fair Evidence, they themſelves ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that this Commandement made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and feared others would
apprehend it ſo. To theſe you may add,
<hi>Praying in an unknown Tongue</hi> which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61513:18"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns in one whole Chapter,

<hi>Mediators to God,</hi> when the ſame Apoſtle
poſitively ſaith, <hi>There is but one Mediator,</hi>
viz. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 5. All theſe
therefore cannot rightly be accounted
any part of the <hi>Old Religion,</hi> properly
ſo called: But if we ſhall deſcend lower,
theſe, and many other Points of your
Religion are ſo far from being the <hi>Old
Religion,</hi> that the Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church do acknowledge, they were not
known to the <hi>Primitive Fathers;</hi> yea,
they record the very time when moſt of
them were impoſed. The Doctrine of

of thoſe fabulous Dialogues attributed
to <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt; or if they were his
(which many doubt) this was ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

or elſe it might be ſhewed, that the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi>

claim, <hi>Veneration</hi> of <hi>Relicks, Invocation</hi>
of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin, Pilgrimages, &amp;c.</hi>
were wholly unknown to the three firſt
<hi>Centuries,</hi> as the ingenuous <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
will confeſs, and our Writers have largely
proved. By all which it appears, that
the <hi>Old Religion</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for the firſt
three hundred years, had no formal <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
of <hi>Saints</hi> nor <hi>Angels;</hi> no <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
nor <hi>Prayers</hi> to be delivered thence;
no <hi>Images,</hi> no <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> no <hi>half

no conſtrained <hi>Coelibate,</hi> no Prayers in an
<hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> no cuſtomary <hi>Auricular
Confeſſion,</hi> no <hi>Apocrypha</hi> in her Canon of
Scripture, nor the reſt: Now if you
ſtrip your Church of theſe Doctrines, ſhe
retains ſcarce any thing, but the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Articles of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
But if you take <hi>Rome</hi> with theſe Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
her Religion is not ſo <hi>Old</hi> by far
as the Religion of this Church. Perhaps
it will be pretended, <hi>Though theſe Decrees
were made in later Ages, yet the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
were made by vertue of Apoſtolical
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61513:21"/>
Traditions preſerved in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church
from the very beginning;</hi> and upon this
Pretence your Late Writers of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
have generally laid aſide all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from Scripture and Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and reſolve all into <hi>Oral Tradition</hi>
and the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church: But what is this but to confeſs,
that the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi>
and all <hi>written Records</hi> (which are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
witneſſes) do make againſt them?
only theſe <hi>unknown Traditions,</hi> which are
only in their own keeping (and may be
of their own deviſing) theſe, they ſay,
bear witneſs for them, which is to make
themſelves Judges in their own Cauſe;
and may juſtly occaſion your enquiry,
whether the <hi>former Popes</hi> knew of theſe
Traditions or no? if not, how then came
the <hi>later Popes</hi> to the knowledge of them?
If they knew of them of <hi>old,</hi> why did
they let them ſleep ſo long, and ſuffer the
Church to erre for ſo many years for
want of them? Did they diſcharge their
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Headſhip</hi> well in this Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

and the <hi>later Popes</hi> have invented
them to ſupport their New deſigns; which
appears by the <hi>Ancient Popes</hi> declaring
directly contrary to theſe pretended <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Traditions,</hi> of which take a few

retains neither the <hi>Old Religion</hi> of the

omitted ſome Points, added others, and
altered ſo many, that though <hi>Rome</hi> keep
the <hi>Old</hi> Name, it doth not keep the <hi>Old</hi>
Faith. <hi>We may now ſeek</hi> Rome <hi>in the

to ſave them from thence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore, Why may you
not juſtly deſert them, who have in ſo
many things departed from the <hi>Old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
believed by the Ancient Fathers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the firſt and beſt Biſhops of
that ſame Church? If you deſire to be
really of the <hi>Old Religion,</hi> nay, if you
would hold the Faith of the Primitive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61513:23"/>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Church, you may come much
nearer to it, by embracing the Religion
of your own Country, than by retaining
the Opinions of the Modern <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> which are moſt of them meer <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations:</hi>
And though you have reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
them while you ſuppoſed them
<hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> yet we hope
you will now renounce them when they
are evidently diſcovered to be <hi>Gibeonites</hi>
diſguiſed on purpoſe to deceive, and (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their <hi>mouldy</hi> Pretences, as
if they had come <hi>from far,</hi> and were
deſcended from <hi>Ancient Times</hi>) their
true Original is much later and nearer to
this preſent Age.</p>
               <p>And now, Secondly, it will be eaſie to
determine, That as the <hi>Roman</hi> is not the
<hi>Old Religion,</hi> ſo neither ought the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of it to appropriate to themſelves
the Name of <hi>Catholick.</hi> For whether we
take it in the Primary and Grammatical
ſenſe for <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal],</hi> or in its common
acceptation for <hi>[True Believers,]</hi> The
<hi>Romaniſt</hi> hath no peculiar Right to this

<hi>Faith</hi> in thoſe Points wherein it differs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61513:24"/>
from the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal;
for as the judicious Mr. <hi>Brerewood</hi>
computes, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> holding the

thus makes out the
Account: <hi>The</hi> Greek
<hi>Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in
number exceeds any other—, and the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<hi>in number and circuit of Territory
are very near equal to the</hi> Papal <hi>part,</hi> theſe
are two fourth parts: to which if we
add the <hi>Oriental Chriſtians,</hi> which are not
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, and thoſe
under <hi>Preſter John</hi> or the <hi>Abaſſine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
we have another fourth part of the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> people; and then the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>
are but <hi>one</hi> fourth part of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
only. And it is very odd to ſay, that the
fourth part is the whole: And ſurely

that upon the whole Enquiry, the <hi>Church</hi>

<hi>What ends the</hi> Roman Church <hi>could have

The firſt decay of that <hi>Church</hi> began in

it, we could ſhew
out of <hi>Platina, Onuphrius,</hi> and Others of

might diſcover, that the <hi>Roman

But to be more particular, let us look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſome Inſtances of ſuch <hi>New Doctrines</hi>
as are taught in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> for
Secular ends.</p>
               <p>We begin with the Doctrine of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Faith</hi> or <hi>believing as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,</hi>
a Doctrine unknown in S. <hi>Cyrils</hi>
time, who ſpeaking to his <hi>young Chriſtians,
Bids them not meerly believe the things he
ſpoke becauſe he affirmed them, unleſs he did
demonſtrate them to be ſo out of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

truly this <hi>Novel Doctrine</hi>
may agree with <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>'s
<hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> and is a good ſhelter for
<hi>Paganiſm,</hi> the beſt Argument for which,

<hi>They muſt believe whatever they

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61513:29"/>
is below the Honour of true Religion to
deſire to be taken upon Truſt; ſo that
this Doctrine is a policy of your Prieſts
to ſecure their evil Principles from being
enquired into, and a device to make you
depend on them as <hi>Infallible Oracles,</hi> who
can by this means lead you blind-fold
whither they will, and impoſe any thing
on you which ſerves their Intereſt, under
the pretence of <hi>true Religion.</hi> 2. <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Confeſſion</hi> to a Prieſt was <hi>voluntary</hi>

But it is now made neceſſary at ſtated
times, in all probability to make the
Prieſt maſter of every mans <hi>Secrets,</hi> to
diſcover the leaſt inclination of their
<hi>Proſelytes</hi> to leave them, to keep the
<hi>Laity</hi> in awe, and make them venerate
and depend upon their <hi>Spiritual Guide,</hi>
who hereby hath them at his Mercy:
And their <hi>Doctors</hi> do affirm, <hi>that in ſome
caſes it is lawful to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what is revealed
to them in Confeſſion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if it concern the</hi>

the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and the making its
moſt <hi>inferior Prieſts</hi> revered: But becauſe
the Honour of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be maintained without <hi>vaſt riches,</hi> it
is obvious to all, that many of their <hi>New

or if <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi>

it is certain <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> hath been an
officious Nurſe unto them. As in the caſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61513:30"/>
of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Prayers to deliver Souls
from thence,</hi> a <hi>Novel fancy,</hi> feared and
ſuſpected at firſt by ſome, but countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and Decreed by that Church, thereby
to oblige the people to give liberally for
<hi>themſelves</hi> or their <hi>deceaſed Friends,</hi> to
thoſe who ſell their <hi>Prayers</hi> ſo commonly
that they occaſioned that Proverb, <hi>No

was one main Impediment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
the <hi>Pope</hi> from yielding to a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
To theſe may be added the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi>
with the reports of <hi>Miracles</hi> done at

whereas you are by Providence

               <p>NOw though it be altogether unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe Principles ſhould be either
true or good, which ſtand in need of ſuch

becauſe you have been ſo long accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to call theſe things Religion, and it is
not eaſie to lay aſide our rooted Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
we will paſs to the Third En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<hi>viz. Whether the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
be good in their own nature, and
Parts of true Religion?</hi> Now we may
try this by conſidering what are the ends
of True Religion, and whether theſe
Principles ſerve to advance thoſe ends?
True Religion therefore hath three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Ends: 1. To advance the honour
of God. 2. To aſſiſt us in the Devout
worſhipping of him. 3. To teach us to
imitate him by a holy life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61513:47"/>
Let us here therefore examine,
whether the peculiar Articles of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church do not hinder rather than
promote theſe Ends: For if it appear
theſe Principles are diſhonourable to
God, impediments to Devotion, and
hindrances to a holy life; then thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are alſo Evil in their own nature,
and they can be no real parts of a good
or True Religion: Nor muſt you retain
them becauſe you have once judged them
good, if upon Tryal they prove to be
otherwiſe. <hi>We muſt be firm to our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
(ſaith</hi> Epictetus) <hi>yet not to all of
them, but only to thoſe which are right;
we muſt begin at the right end, and firſt
lay the foundation by conſidering whether
our Principles be good or evil, and after
build upon that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
and firmneſs of
Reſolution</hi>

man to contradict his Laws by contrary
Conſtitutions, I fear your Church will
hardly be found innocent: For do they
not command things which God hath
forbidden in as plain words as can be
ſpoken, as in the caſe of <hi>Images, Exod.</hi> xx.
4? and <hi>Prayer in an unknown Tongue,</hi>
1 <hi>Con.</hi> xiv. 28. Do they not forbid things
which God hath allowed, as in the caſe
of <hi>Prieſts Marriage? Heb.</hi> xiii. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
vii. 2 <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 2. 12?
and taking the Cup from the People?
which they have decreed with a <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante,</hi>
that is, notwithſtanding our Lord
Jeſus appointed the contrary. Do they
not preſume to diſpenſe with the very
Laws of God, in many caſes of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Divorce, of Vows, Oaths,
Leagues and Contracts? So that <hi>laying
aſide the Commandment of God, ye hold the
Tradition of men,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks,

doth all this may think himſelf the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

               <p>Secondly, Is it not a great derogation

Your praying to Angels and Saints,

made Prayers to God by Jeſus Chriſt to be

who ſay ten times as many <hi>Ave Mary</hi>'s

there it ſhall ſtand for
ever to reprove thoſe,
who divide Religious
worſhip between <hi>God</hi>
and his <hi>Creatures,</hi> thereby diminiſhing
that Devotion which intirely belongs to
the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> ſince affections are
moſt vigorous when placed upon one <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61513:51"/>
and if they be diſperſed among
many, grow <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>trifling;</hi> whence
we may conclude, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
who worſhips none but God, is the
greater lover of him, and worſhips with
a more united and ſervent Devotion.
As for your Publick worſhip, it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with ſo many Ceremonies as
muſt needs diſturb the Devotion as well
of the Prieſts as the People, there is
ſuch frequent <hi>bowing, croſſing, proſtration,
ſprinkling</hi> with <hi>Holy water, beating the
breaſt, ſmoaking with Incenſe, &amp;c.</hi> that
the mind is taken off from a ſteady in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
upon the inward and main part
of the Duty, while it is entertained with
ſuch variety of outward Rites. <hi>For our
mind</hi> (ſaith <hi>Quintilian) cannot ſincerely
intend its whole ſelf upon many things at
once, whatever new object it looks upon,
it gives over the thoughts of that which
it firſt propounded to it ſelf:</hi> And this is
moſt evident where the Objects are ſo
different as ſenſible and intellectual things
are. <hi>For where the Senſes and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
are vigorouſly employed, there the
Intellectual Powers ceaſe to act</hi> (as a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61513:52"/>
great Philoſopher ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Porphyr.</hi> de Abſtin. lib. 1. §. 41.</note>). So that it
is your Paſſions and
your Fancies that are
wrought upon, not your Mind nor the
higher faculties of your Soul, by theſe
numerous <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and therefore
that which you think Devotion, I doubt
is but a fantaſtical and falſe fire, not
kindled by the love of God, nor warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your nobler Powers at all, and thoſe
ſteady, rational and ſpiritual deſires,
which flow from an undiſturbed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the <hi>Divine Goodneſs</hi> and
are the very <hi>life</hi> of Prayer, I fear you
are ſtrangers to, being ſo often taken
off and diverted by variety of <hi>ſenſible</hi>
Repreſentations. Again, the making all
your Publick prayers in an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown
Tongue,</hi> deſtroys all true Devotion in
the People; S. <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alex.</hi> tells us of
ſome Heathens <hi>who thought thoſe Prayers
moſt effectual which were uttered in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Language</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Clem. Alex. <hi>Stromat.</hi> 1.</note>. But
Chriſtians know, that
<hi>Prayer</hi> is the deſiring
ſomething of God, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61513:52"/>
if the Mind be not exerciſed in this
deſire, it avails nothing; but where the
words are not underſtood, the mind
cannot deſire the things mentioned,
ſo that none can properly pray in an
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue,</hi> nor ſo much as ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

in <hi>joyning</hi> with the Prieſt or <hi>Praying.</hi> And
becauſe the people have no employment

<hi>By S.</hi> Paul'<hi>s Doctrine</hi> (ſaith Card. <hi>Cajetan)
it is better for the edifying of the Church,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61513:53"/>

your admired Church
will oppoſe Reaſon and
Scripture, and deprive
all the Common people that are of her
Communion, of the exerciſe of their
Devotion in her Offices, rather than ſo
far ſeem to confeſs a fault, as to amend
it; chuſing rather to let you loſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

if that Church will not pray in ſuch a

go over to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where
you may <hi>Pray with the Spirit and with

your <hi>Private Prayers</hi> are not ſo good a

no help, but an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance

ravel into the body of

Author of the <hi>Reflections on the Romiſh

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61513:54"/>
                  <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and the name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
ſo many times over, as in thoſe fifteen
little Prayers in the <hi>Pſalter</hi> of Jeſus,
where the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is thrice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in each Prayer, and each Prayer
is ordered to be ſaid <hi>Ten</hi> times over;
and thoſe numerous names of <hi>Saints</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in your <hi>Litanies</hi> with no petition
annexed but <hi>Ora pro nobis:</hi> This way of
Praying is ſo far from agreeing with the
Primitive worſhip of God among the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that it is evidently derived
from that <hi>Heatheniſh ſuperſtition</hi> of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>by repeating a hundred names of their

this manner <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts
are ſuppoſed to pray,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> xviii. 26. But
to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Jeſus ſaith,
<hi>When ye pray uſe not
vain repetitions as the Heathens do, for
they think that they ſhall be heard for their
much ſpeaking:</hi> Matth. vi. 7. Wherefore
though you have admired this trifling
way of <hi>worſhip,</hi> when you knew no
better, yet if you would acquaint your
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61513:55"/>
ſelves with the ſolid and rational way of
praying preſcribed in the Church of
<hi>England</hi> (wherein Great things, in an
exact method, in plain and proper
phraſes, and in a <hi>known Language,</hi> are
asked of <hi>God</hi> alone in the name of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi>) you would eaſily leave off thoſe
<hi>formal, vain</hi> and <hi>ſuperficial Devotions,</hi>
which can neither be acceptable to God,
nor profitable unto your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let us paſs to the laſt of
theſe particulars and enquire, If the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Rome,</hi> differing from thoſe of
<hi>England,</hi> do tend to promote our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
God by a holy life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
without which all our worſhip is in
vain; <hi>For it is a folly and miſerable errour</hi>
(ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine) to humble your ſelf
before him in adoration, to whom you
chuſe to be unlike in converſation, and to
give him religious worſhip, whoſe Example
you will not follow; ſince the ſum of all
Religion is to imitate
him you worſhip</hi>

Now there are ſeveral
Principles of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church which ſeem to hinder an
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61513:55"/>
                  <hi>holy life,</hi> as firſt, The cuſtome of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
to a Prieſt</hi> weekly or monthly, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Abſolution</hi> following
of courſe upon this <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> this is (I
fear) a great hindrance to amendment
of life, at which it pretends to aim, for
while men relie on this remedy, they go
on without fear in thoſe ſins for which
they have ſo eaſie a <hi>cure</hi> at hand, like
thoſe who venture without ſcruple on
dangerous Meats, becauſe they have their
<hi>Phyſicians</hi> beſide them: 'Tis true there
is a <hi>Penance</hi> enjoyned ſometimes, but
it is ſuch a one as the <hi>rich</hi> may buy off
and the <hi>poor</hi> may undergo, and yet both
retain the ſin, becauſe the <hi>Penance</hi> is
not its proper cure; the going in <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages,</hi>
giving <hi>mony,</hi> ſaying or reading
over ſuch proportions of <hi>Legends</hi> or little
<hi>chiming prayers,</hi> with others far more
impertinent, tend not to rectifie a <hi>vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
habit,</hi> and a plaiſter on the Toe may
as ſoon cure the Head-ach, as theſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
effect a Reformation, or obtain
a pardon at Gods hands. And yet all
men ſee, when the day of <hi>Confeſſion</hi> is
over, and the <hi>Penance</hi> paſt, that you are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61513:56"/>
generally confident of a <hi>Pardon,</hi> and
fancy you begin upon a new ſcore. It is
not eaſie to enumerate all the devices
which your Church hath invented to
convey <hi>pardon of Sins, Holy water, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of Saints,</hi> viſiting ſome certain
<hi>Churches,</hi> ſaying ſome certain <hi>Prayers,</hi>
making <hi>Oblations of mony</hi> to ſuch and
ſuch uſes, <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and other ſuch
things, ſo that he that hath <hi>mony</hi> need
never want <hi>Pardon</hi> from <hi>Rome;</hi> but alas,
theſe things can never really take away
the <hi>guilt</hi> of one ſin, and yet they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
men to commit many; <hi>For the
multitude of Sinners increaſeth, when
hope is given that ſin may be bought off,
and men eaſily fall into thoſe ſins for which
Mony will purchaſe their pardon:</hi> as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius</hi>
ſaid to the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who relied
on ſuch like fantaſtical
means of <hi>Remiſſion</hi>
                  <note n="w" place="margin">
                     <hi>Arnob.</hi> adv. Gentes, lib. 7. pag. 216.</note>:
and we may ſay of the
<hi>Guides</hi> of your Church,
as <hi>Seneca</hi> in a like caſe, <hi>They ſin more in
ſuch Abſolutions, than
the Offender doth in the
Crime</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Senec. <hi>Ep.</hi> 97.</note>. For by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61513:56"/>
men they can have <hi>Remiſſion</hi> on
ſo eaſie Terms, they make them ſecure
before they are ſafe, becauſe Almighty
God, who only finally can Remit, never
promiſed <hi>Pardon</hi> on theſe Terms, and it is
only thoſe who <hi>forſake</hi> as well as <hi>confeſs</hi>
their ſins to whom he will ſhew <hi>Mercy,</hi>
Prov. xxviii. 13. And if either the <hi>Pope</hi> or
any of his <hi>Subſtitutes,</hi> pretend to have
power to <hi>forgive ſins</hi> on any other
Terms, they abuſe thoſe who are ſo
weak to believe them, and make them
forfeit their Souls (I doubt) for the
ſad price of this Credulity: S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith
truly, <hi>The power of Abſolving was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
given, but upon condition of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents
Reformation</hi>

                     <hi>Baſil.</hi> reg. brev. qu. 15.</note>.
And we tell our People
more ſincerely, that if
a Prieſt <hi>Abſolve</hi> them
a thouſand times over, and if they give
ever ſo much <hi>mony,</hi> without <hi>amendment</hi>
of life they can have no pardon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as Scripture it
ſelf teaches<note n="z" place="margin">Mich. vi. 7.</note>, and
the Holy Fathers alſo;
<hi>If thou giveſt all that thou haſt, and doſt

not forſake thy ſins, thou art twice deceived,

Again, as if the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church deſigned to
make men think their own actual <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
were never neceſſary, they have other
devices to perſwade you into a belief of
coming off well at the end of your life,
howſoever ill you have ſpent it: The

you are told it is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way of Salvation to
die in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, and if you can but receive the
<hi>Sacraments</hi> of that Church, and be
<hi>Abſolved</hi> by one of their Prieſts, you
ſcarce doubt of obtaining Heaven at
laſt; and if you have no <hi>good works</hi> of
your own, they perſwade you the
Church can ſell you the <hi>Merits</hi> of the
Saints; or if you ſhould drop into <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi>
by the way, the pains of that
(they ſay) are not <hi>endleſs,</hi> and if you

many <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Murtherers,</hi> debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and prophane perſons to take <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, becauſe the
<hi>Tenets</hi> thereof ſeem not to oblige them
to forſake their evil ways, but reconcile
<hi>wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> together: ſo
that this Religion tends not to perſwade
men to <hi>Holineſs of life,</hi> and therefore
is no good Religion: I grant there are
ſome Perſons in that Church who
live better than theſe <hi>Opinions</hi> engage
them to do, and do not draw thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions

that is only an evidence of the excellent

theſe men be <hi>Holy</hi> in a Religion which

they would be more holy by far, if
they were taught better things: I ſhall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61513:58"/>
only add, that as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is
<hi>too looſe</hi> in matters pertaining to <hi>Gods
Laws,</hi> ſo ſhe is <hi>too ſtrict</hi> in matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to her <hi>own Conſtitutions,</hi> like the
Old <hi>Phariſees</hi> who <hi>Tithed Mint and
Anniſe, and neglected the weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Law: Matth.</hi> xxiii. which is
a great obſtruction to <hi>real Holineſs,</hi> when
men place Religion in <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and
ſlight things, for while they are curious
in theſe matters, they neglect greater,
and think by obſerving the <hi>Rules</hi> of the
Church, they compenſate for paſſing by
the <hi>Laws</hi> of God, your own Ordinary
Gloſs ſaith, <hi>That is Superſtition, when
Religion is placed in obſerving the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of men</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Gloſſ. Ordin. ad <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.</note>.
And if ſo, then your
wonderful ſtrictneſs in
<hi>Croſſing, Bowing,</hi> uſing
<hi>Holy Water, Abſtinence</hi> on certain days,
wearing <hi>Croſſes, &amp;c.</hi> in which you have
placed ſo much Religion, are no better
than <hi>Superſtition.</hi> It cannot be denied,
that moſt <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are more
afraid to eat <hi>fleſh</hi> on a Faſting-day than
to <hi>curſe</hi> or <hi>ſwear;</hi> they will be <hi>drunk</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:61513:59"/>
on a Holy-day which God forbids, but
not <hi>work</hi> on it becauſe the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
it; many of them dare <hi>fornicate</hi>
and <hi>debauch,</hi> who dare not neglect <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
nor read a book written by a
ſuppoſed <hi>Heretick:</hi> And generally, they
are punctual in <hi>croſſing, ſprinkling,
bowing</hi> and obſerving all Orders of
the Church, even ſuch as live in the
open breach of Gods <hi>Commandements,</hi>
and yet fancy themſelves more ſure of
Heaven than the moſt pious and holy
<hi>Proteſtant:</hi> Thus this Religion is <hi>too
ſtrict</hi> where God gives us more liberty,
and <hi>too remiſs</hi> where his Holy Law hath
bound us with <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Indiſpenſable
bonds;</hi> and it is deſigned to promote
<hi>Obedience to the Roman Church,</hi> rather
than <hi>Inward holineſs towards God:</hi> The
effect of all which Conſiderations is
this, That whoſoever ſincerely deſires
to glorifie God and worſhip him with a
<hi>rational Devotion,</hi> and whoever would
imitate him by a <hi>Holy Life,</hi> ought not
to chuſe or retain ſuch a Religion whoſe
<hi>Principles</hi> tend ſo evidently to the

of true Devotion, and to the

as it was proved before, that the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated

not Ancient, nor induced for pious ends,
nor propagated by honeſt means: ſo now
it is evidenced, the <hi>Articles</hi> are not good

is no reaſon why you ſhould not renounce

Reverence to the Authority of the <hi>Pope</hi>

               <p>THe Laſt, and almoſt the only ſhelter
that your Doctors flie to at this day
for the defence of your <hi>Principles</hi> is,
<hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>is the ſole Vicar

adviſe you not to lay ſo much ſtreſs upon
theſe Titles and Authority, till you have
ſeriouſly examined by what Right the
<hi>Pope</hi> laies claim to them; for his Power
had need be very great and his Proofs
very good, upon the Credit whereof
you receive ſo many new and ſuſpicious

we ought not to receive though preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

though we ſtand not much upon Titles,
you may note that the name of <hi>Vicar of
Chriſt</hi> is never given to the Pope in the
firſt Ages, and when this Title came into
uſe, it was not appropriated to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> but other Biſhops and
Prieſts are ſtyled <hi>Vicars of Chriſt</hi> alſo,
even by a Pope of

So that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for the <hi>Roman</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
to challenge any
propriety in this Title,
or any ſpecial Priviledge by virtue
thereof. Secondly, As to his being an
<hi>Infallible Judge</hi> and the <hi>Supream Head</hi>
of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> throughout the
World, you may remember we have
proved, there are more Chriſtians in the

<hi>Rome,</hi> than there are who do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

it: And if the belief of this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Headſhip</hi> be the reaſon why you
receive other Articles of Faith, this then
is the moſt fundamental Article of all
others, and ought to be the beſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted:
And if our Lord Jeſus had
deſigned to make S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his
Succeſſors at <hi>Rome</hi> (not at <hi>Antioch</hi>) ſuch
<hi>Supream Infallible Judges,</hi> we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
he would have ſet down this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle

Church of Chriſt near five hundred

one ſyllable of this foundation-Article
of the Modern Faith of that Church,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the Pope'<hi>s <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Supremacy:</hi>
It is alſo certain the Church of <hi>Britain</hi>
was not ſubject to <hi>Rome</hi> at the time of
the Firſt General Council at <hi>Nice;</hi> And
in the Sixth Canon of that Council it is
decreed concerning the three <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
Juriſdictions, <hi>That the Ancient cuſtom
ſhould be eſtabliſhed, that</hi> Aegypt, Lybia
<hi>and</hi> Pentapolis <hi>ſhould be ſubject to the

Ancient Cuſtom and
Priviledge of this
Church of <hi>Britain</hi> then was to govern
it ſelf without ſubjection to any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Patriarch, and the Pope could not
uſurp any <hi>Dominion</hi> here afterwards
without tranſgreſſing this Canon of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61513:67"/>
moſt famous <hi>General Council;</hi> eſpecially
if we conſider how this Canon was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in <hi>Ruffinus</hi>'s daies, <hi>viz. That</hi>
Rome <hi>ſhould have the Government of the</hi>
Suburbicarian <hi>Churches</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Hiſtor. Eccleſe. lib. 1. c. 6.</note>. And the Ancient

what the <hi>Suburbicarian</hi> Region was, <hi>viz.</hi>
Three Iſlands, <hi>Sicily, Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica,</hi>
and part of <hi>Italy,</hi> from the Eaſt
end to the border of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> Weſtward:
And this was all the Ancient extent of

of <hi>Italy</hi> being under the Metropolis of
<hi>Millain,</hi> which Church of Old paid no
<hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> much leſs could any

An.</hi> 431. it was decreed, <hi>That in all
Dioceſes and Provinces it ſhould hereafter
be obſerved, That no Biſhop ſhould hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward

the Pope muſt break alſo, before he
can aſſume a power over the Church of

and ſome other places, was its own
head (as thoſe Times phraſed it) and
ſubject to no <hi>Patriarch:</hi> So that when
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk (coming over to
convert the Pagan <hi>Saxons</hi>) required the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops to profeſs <hi>Subjection</hi> to
the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> They did by virtue of
theſe Canons refuſe it, telling him, <hi>They
had a Patriarch of their own, to whom
alone they were ſubject in Spiritual things
under God,</hi> and <hi>Dionothus</hi> Abbot of
<hi>Bangor</hi> by divers Arguments ſhewed,
<hi>they owed no Subjection to the</hi> Roman

And accordingly the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops retained
their Old Rites different from <hi>Rome,</hi>
and kept their Old Priviledges, being
conſecrated by the Archbiſhop of S.
<hi>Davids,</hi> and he by his own Suffragans,
<hi>making no Profeſſion of Subjection to any

asked Advice of the Pope, as of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent

Biſhops never profeſſed <hi>Subjection</hi> to

Pope's means, meerly for writing, that
<hi>you of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church ought to be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61513:77"/>
Loyal to the King in all matters of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
cognizance;</hi> a clear evidence, that
(whatever your Church may pretend)
they will not endure that any of you
Catholicks ſhall hold the <hi>King's</hi> power
to be above the <hi>Pope</hi>'s in any thing; and
conſequently they will not allow you to
be good Subjects. Now to ſum up all
theſe particulars, how grievous an abuſe
is it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a Forreign Prelate, whoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
had no Authority here at all,
to uſurp ſuch a power over you as to
impoſe New and inexpedient Articles
upon you? Why ſhould you enſlave
your ſelves to him that cannot have ſo
much as a <hi>Spiritual Juriſdiction</hi> here
without breaking the Canons of the
moſt famous <hi>General Councils?</hi> Why
may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you not take the ſame liberty to
oppoſe his <hi>Decrees,</hi> that your Anceſtors
in all Ages have done? they whom you
account good Catholicks rejected his
<hi>Doctrines</hi> ſometimes, deſpiſed his <hi>Bulls</hi>
and <hi>Excommunications</hi> frequently, and
always oppoſed his pretended claim of
a <hi>Supremacy</hi> over this Nation; why
ſhould you call that an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:61513:78"/>
and account it the Principal point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<hi>viz. That</hi> England <hi>ought to be
ſubject to</hi> Rome; which even in thoſe
you call <hi>Catholick Times</hi> was declared to
be no leſs than <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and no other
than an Opinion that did deſtroy the
<hi>Prerogative</hi> of the King, the <hi>Priviledges</hi>
and <hi>Liberties</hi> of this Church, the <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>quiet</hi> of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects?
They were <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in other Points
who condemned <hi>Appeals to Rome,</hi> and
maintained, that <hi>the Crown of</hi> England
<hi>was in no Earthly ſubjection,</hi> and that <hi>the

who counted all the <hi>Power</hi> which the
Pope ever had here, meerly <hi>permiſſive,</hi>
tolerated by this Nation ſo long as they
pleaſed, and ſuch as might be curbed,
leſſened, hindred or taken away by the
Supream Authority of this Nation
when ever they ſaw expedient: It was
a King and Parliament of your <hi>Religion</hi>
in moſt points, that reſtored the King
to his juſt <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and took away
the precarious or uſurped and much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
<hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop here;
they thought a Supremacy in <hi>Spirituals,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:61513:78"/>
as to this Kingdom, was more than he
had any Right to, but he and his Agents
expect to be allowed to over-rule the

have the Nobleneſs and Gallantry of
true <hi>Engliſh ſpirits,</hi> your affections for the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> ſhould not rob you of
your love to your <hi>Native Country,</hi> nor

doth not further any mans Salvation, and
it is ſo far from doing any good in thoſe

it might be made appear, the ſetting up

at that time, that for ſome Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the wiſeſt and beſt men of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

after all, neither he nor

Reform either their

upon their private advantage, than the

<hi>That by the Reformation it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

rather than to be thought to have once

of the ſame humour with thoſe Gentiles

to whom <hi>Arnobius</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>What you have

                     <hi>Arnob.</hi> adv. gentes, l. 6. p. 197.</note>. Wherefore ſince
<hi>Rome</hi> reſolved not to
Reform, <hi>England</hi> (having firſt reſtored
her King to his Ancient and juſt Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy)
reſolved to reform it ſelf, without
the Popes leave or conſent, knowing full
well they had Authority ſufficient
among themſelves to order the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Religion, which had been Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
many Hundred years in this Land
by the King and his own Biſhops, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any dependence on the Pope at all:
Thus the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> reformed their
Kingdoms of Old, Thus the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
with <hi>Leander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sevil</hi> reformed
that Kingdom from <hi>Arianiſm</hi> without
the Pope<note n="t" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Tolet.</hi> 3. An. 589.</note> and thus
King <hi>Edgar</hi> intended
to proceed in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Church of Old when he told his own
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61513:82"/>
Clergy, <hi>I have</hi> Conſtantines <hi>Sword in my
hands, and you have</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>in yours</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Edgar <hi>Ap.</hi> Ailred. <hi>Col.</hi> 361.</note> That
is, we need no further
Authority or power to
reform, Than what we have within our
ſelves: The Kings of this Nation, with
the advice and conſent of their Biſhops,
Barons and Commons had been always
wont to order Eccleſiaſtical affairs as they
thought meet, not heeding whether the
Pope were pleaſed or diſpleaſed thereat;
And accordingly this happy Reformation
was made by the Supreme Power of this
Kingdom, upon mature deliberation, in a
Regular, Orderly, and Legal way; and
it was managed with ſo much moderation
and prudence, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſaid little againſt it, but Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with this Church (after the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation)
till the Pope for his own ends
forbid them ſo to do; but I hope his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
without any juſt reaſon, ſhall not
outweigh the Supreme Authority of your
own Nation, with <hi>you,</hi> who profeſs your
ſelves to be Loyal Subjects, and for the
<hi>intereſt of England;</hi> and ſince there was
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61513:83"/>
ſuch need of Reformation, ſuch obſtinacy
in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuch Authority here, and ſo
orderly proceedings in this Reformation,
I think all Good Chriſtians and ſober
men, being Natives of this Land, ought
to ſubmit unto it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. You will be further perſwaded
hereunto, by conſidering <hi>the Doctrine</hi> of
this Church, which agrees with Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtianity, in that it obliges you
to believe nothing as of neceſſity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but what may be plainly proved our
of Holy Scripture, and for this reaſon
you muſt ſtill hold the three Creeds of the
Apoſtles, of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi>
all which the Church of <hi>England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
believes. <hi>And he only is a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
which follows not this Holy Rule</hi> (ſay
the Conſtitutions of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian)
but they are Catholicks that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it:</hi> In this Church we give as much
honour to, and obey more Canons of,
the firſt Four General Councils, than they
of <hi>Rome</hi> do; we approve of that Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of Scripture which hath the conſent
of the Fathers of the firſt three or four
Centuries, yea we hold all that the Church
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61513:83"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf held as neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Five or Six hundred Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and it is very remarkable that a
<hi>Romaniſt</hi> may turn Proteſtant without
adding any one Article to his Faith, but
a Proteſtant cannot turn to <hi>Rome</hi> unleſs he
embrace many new Articles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are generally confeſſed by both
ſides to be true, but thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church are rejected by our Reformers,
as Novel Additions, and ſuch as have no
good foundation in Scripture, nor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Antiquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Doctrines are the ſurer and ſafer,
as in which both ſides agree; For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
we and they both hold there are two
States after this life, Heaven and Hell, but
they add a third which is Purgatory, and
this we deny: We and they both ſay, that
ſins are to be remitted by the merits of
Chriſts death, but they add the merits of
the Saints, and their own ſatisfactions
with the merit of their own good works,
which we deny to be Expiatory, or ſuch
as can merit Remiſſion for us: We hold
there be two Sacraments Baptiſm and the
Euchariſt, theſe they confeſs are the Chief,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61513:84"/>
but add Five more, to which we affirm
the name of Sacraments doth not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong: We ſay that God alone is to be
worſhipped, they confeſs he is chiefly to
be worſhipped; but then they ſay the
Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Angels, and Saints
are to be worſhipped alſo, which Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we deny: We ſay Chriſt is our only
Mediator and Advocate, they confeſs he
is principally ſo, but add, that Saints and
Angels are ſo in an inferiour manner,
which we utterly deny: We ſay Chriſt is
really preſent in the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
this they confeſs, but add, he is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally
there by the Transſubſtantiation
of the Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this we deny: We
ſay the Scriptures are the Rule of Faith,
and they will not abſolutely deny it, but
add their own Traditions, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
We ſay there are XXII. Books of
the Old Teſtament Canonical, and they
confeſs theſe all to be ſo, but they add di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and call them Canonical, which we
affirm to be Apocryphal; I could give
more inſtances, but theſe may ſuffice to
ſhew that the Proteſtant Doctrines look
moſt like the Ancienteſt, as being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61513:84"/>
by both Parties, but the <hi>Roman</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
are Novel Enlargements of Old
Catholick Truths, ſo that a Proteſtant
becoming a Romaniſt muſt take up many
Articles barely upon the credit of that
Church, and begin to believe many things
anew, queſtioned by the bigger part of
Chriſtendom; but a Romaniſt turning
Proteſtant retains all the Old Eſſentials of
his former Faith; and doth only become
a Primitive <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> are more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Primitive patterns than thoſe of
the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church are: Our
King hath the ſame Power that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had, the ſame
which the great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Emperors for many years enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the ſame power which the Ancient
Kings of this Nation exerciſed, <hi>viz.</hi> A
power to convene his Clergy and adviſe
with them about affairs of the Church:
A power to ratifie that which the Biſhops
and Clergy agree upon, and give it the
force of a Law: A power to chuſe fit
perſons to Govern the Church, A pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61513:85"/>
to correct all Offenders againſt Faith
or Manners, be they Clergy, or Lay-men:
And finally, A power to determine all
Cauſes and Controverſies Eccleſiaſtical
and Civil, among his own Subjects (by
the advice of fit Counſellors) ſo as there
lies no Appeal from his Determination;
and this is that we mean when we call
him <hi>Supreme Governour of this Church,</hi>
which our King muſt needs be, or elſe he
cannot keep his Kingdoms in peace;
Beſides for Spiritual Juriſdiction, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Adminiſtrations, we have a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
of our own, The Arch-Biſhop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> Primate of all <hi>England,</hi> whom
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Second call'd <hi>the Pope of the

King; we have alſo Right Reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,

Form, and more
agreeing to the eldeſt times, than <hi>Rome</hi>
it ſelf can ſhew; and if you will Judge
impartially, it muſt be confeſſed that the
Clergy of <hi>England</hi> are altogether as
Learned, and generally more painful and
pious than in any Catholick Country
whatſoever: Our Canons for Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government are all founded on the
Canons of Ancient Councils (as I could
ſhew by particular induction, if time
would permit) and for the Exerciſe of our
Diſcipline it is managed with more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and eaſe to the People than that
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is:</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. You may conſider our <hi>Divine
Service</hi> and Sacred <hi>Adminiſtrations,</hi> which
(as far as ever God made neceſſary to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61513:86"/>
Salvation) may be had in this Church:
We have the Holy Scriptures plainly
tranſlated, Learnedly interpreted, and
practically Preached; We have daily
Prayers, by a <hi>Form</hi> ſo Grave and ſo Agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the undoubted parts of Ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,
that it may challenge all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
to produce any thing ſo conſonant to
the pureſt Primitive Devotions; A <hi>Form</hi>
which hath all thoſe parts of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Offices which were known and uſed in the

Innovations and Corruptions of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Maſs;</hi> And is uſed in <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the
benefit of the meaneſt Chriſtian in our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies:
We have alſo thoſe two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which Chriſt ordained (and many
of the Elder and Later
Doctors own no more

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61513:86"/>
keeping the Primitive and main part of
them, only attended with fewer Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
We preſs and practice alſo Charity
and good works, as much as the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church doth, and it may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that more and greater gifts have been
given in <hi>England</hi> to pious uſes, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſons ſince the Reformation, than
in two Centuries before: And though we
dare not ſay we ſhall merit Eternal life
by them (becauſe that is the gift of God)
yet we believe none can come to Heaven
without good works: In a word, the
Church of <hi>England</hi> worſhips God as he
hath preſcribed in Holy Scripture, She
commands all that he enjoyns, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
all that he prohibits, and therefore
wanteth nothing that is neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="5">V. You may look upon our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
which are few and eaſie, Ancient and
Significant, and though we do not place
ſo much Religion in Externals as the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, yet here is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
all that is needful for decency and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Clergy always wear
Grave and diſtinct habits, and have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61513:87"/>
Garments in Divine Adminiſtrations,
that Churches be adorned and neat, that
the People be Reverent in Gods Houſe,
that the memory of our Saviours chief
Acts, and the Feſtivals of the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
be religiouſly obſerved; That <hi>Lent,</hi>
with the Vigils of great Feaſts, the <hi>Ember</hi>
weeks, and all the Fridays in the Year,
be kept as days of Faſting or Abſtinence,
and if ſome Proteſtants do not obſerve
them, yet others do, and are commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it, and you may follow the beſt, not
the moſt: you will have more liberty
(by turning to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church) as to
Circumſtantials, and greater helps as to
the Eſſentials of Religion: So that it is
upon all accounts your wiſeſt and ſafeſt
courſe to embrace this ſo true, ſo Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
ſo Pious, and ſo rational a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Let me therefore ſhut up my <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
and <hi>Friendly Advice</hi> by Requeſting
you to conſider all theſe things without
prejudice or paſſion, and then I hope you
will perceive how much the Religion of
this Church excells that of <hi>Rome,</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
Integrity, and Uſefulneſs, and
no longer ſuffer your ſelves to be ſo ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61513:87"/>
impoſed on, and ſo miſerably made to
ſerve the ends of Avarice and Ambition:
And if you have taken ſuch prudent and
pious Reſolutions, you ſhall not only be
freed from the inconveniences you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of here, but alſo have better aſſurances
of your Salvation hereafter, than the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church can give you; For there you have
only the words of their Prieſts for it,
whoſe intereſt and whoſe practice it hath
been to deceive you; But here you ſhall
have all the aſſurances which the word of
God can give you, provided you become
reformed in your lives as well as in your
Religion, and will leave off your old Vices,
as well as your old Opinions; For unleſs
we can perſwade you to become Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
of Righteouſneſs, we ſhall not much
value the gaining you over to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
becauſe we know it is neither the
being Papiſt nor Proteſtant will ſave thoſe
that live in their ſins; But this Religion
is the better chiefly in this, that it is moſt
likely to bring you to unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the practice of real Holineſs.
And if you deſire further information in
theſe particulars, let me adviſe you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61513:88"/>
the late Eminent Proteſtant Writers,
together with ſome of the moſt able and
ingenuous of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, whom
you will find very willing and ready to
give you more full ſatisfaction, and to be
men that have no deſigns upon you, but
to direct you in the beſt way to Heaven:
And doubtleſs, if you would but try the
difference a while, a little experience
would teach you how happy and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
a change he makes, who forſakes
the Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and embraces the
Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
