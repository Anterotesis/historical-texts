         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Reformation of it. Chriſtians then made uſe of thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſh

thought he had good reaſon, and juſt ground to do what he

then leaned upon his hand, as he was wont to do in other

plead it to be allowable?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The daily uſe of theſe names in this way ſeemeth to be
more then barely <hi>Hiſtoricall</hi> or <hi>Civill; viz,</hi> an <hi>Honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of them. So we look upon that name which is given to
the firſt day of the week, when it is called the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> not
as meerly <hi>Hiſtoricall,</hi> onely minding us of what was acted
upon that day, <hi>viz.</hi> the reſurrection of our Lord, but as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
carrying with it an <hi>Honourable reſpect</hi> unto him to whom

<hi>Idolatrous dedication of dayes and moneths</hi> come in the number?
The <hi>Chriſtian dedication</hi> of ſome dayes to the memorie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
Saints,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> you have alreadie by your Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
made null. And why ſhould all the reſt be left undone,
an <hi>Heatheniſh dedication</hi> to the memorie and honour of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Idols?</p>
            <p>Thus have I (<hi>thrice noble and Illuſtrious Senatours</hi>) freely and
plainly repreſented unto you this ſo juſt a greivance. And
what now remaines but that I ſhould herein beſpeak your
zeale for God? Which that I may ſet an edge upon, I ſhall
onely ſet before you what God himſelf ſets before his people
by way of <hi>Evangelicall promiſe.</hi> Zach. 13. 2. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe
in that day, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that I will out off the names of the
Idols of the Land. Hos. 2. 16. I will take away the names of Baalim
out of her mouth, aad they ſhall be no more remembred by their name.</hi>
This hath God promiſed to do for his <hi>Church,</hi> under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
and this he will do. May you have the honour and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117617:7"/>
happineſſe to be inſtrumentall in promoting this deſigne in
this Kingdome. Which in the ſpecified particular you may
effect with as great facilitie as your Remembrancer moove
it. It is but your <hi>Fiat;</hi> who will contradict, or oppoſe it?
Not any who either have, or pretend to <hi>tender conſciences.</hi>
Having ſo expreſſe a <hi>precept</hi> to aw them, they dare not. Not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
having ſuch <hi>precedents, a Prelate</hi> and a <hi>Prince,</hi> both ſo
great, and ſo good, to go before them, they will not.</p>

The <hi>first, ſecond, third</hi> day, or <hi>moneth.</hi> This was the language
both of the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> and <hi>new.</hi> And why ſhould any be
