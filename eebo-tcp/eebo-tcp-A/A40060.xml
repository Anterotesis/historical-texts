            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">2. In our laſt Repreſentation it may appeare what our Deſires are, as Members of the Common wealth in behalfe of our ſelves and all others for the clearing, ſetling, and ſecuring of the Rights, Liberties and Peace of the Kingdome: for the Juſtneſſe, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſſe, Neceſſity, and Common-concernment whereof unto all, we dare appeale to the whole Kingdome, and to the World: yet we have hitherto received no anſwer thereunto, nor can we heare of any conſideration taken thereupon, to put the things conteined therein into any way of reſolution or diſpatch.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:105327:3"/>
3. Wee have ſince, in purſuance of the firſt and ſecond head of our deſires in the ſaid repreſentation, delivered in a charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt divers perſons, Members of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> for divers deſignes and practiſes to the abuſe and Diſhonor of the <hi>Parliament</hi> the unſufferable injury of the <hi>Army,</hi> the infringment of the Rights and Liberties both of Souldiers and Subjects, the breach or haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the Peace of this Kingdome, and the hinderance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of <hi>Ireland &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Vpon which though the maine things charged, with the miſchievous effects and further dangerous conſequences of them, as alſo the conſtant and continued activity of all, or moſt of the perſons charged in relation to thoſe things, for the moſt part are ſufficiently knowne, eſpecially to the Parliament it ſelfe, yet wee finde neither any thing done vpon what is ſo knowne, nor any way reſolved on or admitted by the Parliament for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination or diſcovery of what may be leſs knowne: But rather (as if neither the things charged nor the preſent ſad effects nor future ill conſequences thereof were at all conſiderable) the whole buſineſſe ſeemes to be ſlightly paſt ouer or ſet aſide.</p>
            <p>Laſtly we did with theſe deliuer in another paper (whereof here is a Coppy annexed) contayning divers juſt and neceſſary things which wee did deſire might be provided for, and done for the better proceeding in the Premiſſes with more ſafety to our ſelves and the Kingdome, and with more aſſurance or hopes of a timely and happy iſſue.</p>
            <p>To which things deſired (which wee ſuppoſe all men reaſonable will thinke juſt and neceſſary) wee have yet received no anſwer or reſolution, nor can finde any conſideration at all had of them, ſave that a months pay is ſent downe to the <hi>Army,</hi> whilſt thoſe that have deſerted the <hi>Army,</hi> receive at <hi>London</hi> much more, and that ſome Votes have bin paſſed for the annulling the Committee pretended for ſafety about liſting of men and drawing of Forces together, which Votes wee finde rendered but vaine and deluſive, by the continued under-hand practiſes of thoſe whom wee have charged and their accomplices in liſting and ingaging men for a new Warre, and by a later dayes Votes not admitting that the Forces ſo liſted or ingaged ſhould by publicke Order be diſmiſt or diſcharged: which with other things wee cannot but attribute
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105327:3"/>
chiefely to the prevalent influance of the ſame perſons.</p>
            <p>Now whereas wee finde that our firſt deſire in the Paper laſt mentioned (for preſent ſuſpending the perſons Impeached from ſitting in the Houſe) is judged by ſome to be againſt the courſe &amp; Priviledge of <hi>Parliament,</hi> or of ill conſequence in the preſident of it, (the charge being but generall and no particular proofes as yet produced to render the proceedings Legall) we cannot but remind the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That as the moſt and maine things charged (with the ſad effects and conſequences of them) ſo the conſtant and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued activity, of all or moſt of the perſons charged in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereunto, (in miſinforming, deluding, abuſing or ſurpriſing the Houſe, and otherwiſe, are ſufficiently knowne to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe,) ſo as the Houſe might upon their owne paſt and preſent cognizance of the ſame, moſt juſtly proceed to ſuſpend them,) as (in many other caſes upon farre leſſe occaſions which never could have produced ſuch ſad effects to the Kingdome,) they have done many other of their members meerely for words ſpoken of things moved in the Houſe alledged to be but againſt Order or Cuſtome of the Houſe, and this without any tryall, proofe or charge, but meerely upon the Houſes owne cognizance of the things, as we could inſtance in many caſes ſince this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament began.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas many of the things to which the Charge relates, are things ſpoken, moved or done in the Houſe, ſo as yet we have no cleare way opened particularly to charge or mention them, or to produce proofes to them, without ſome pretence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us of breach of priviledge, and therefore (though we thinke no priviledge ought to protect evill men in doing wrong to particulars, or miſchiefe to the Publique yet,) we have beene hitherto ſo tender of Parliament-Priviledges, as that we have onely remonſtrated the evill of ſuch things done, and ſuppoſing the Houſe to have beene (as we did, and doe beleeve, and if way were open, without breach of Priviledge, ſhould not doubt to proove it was) ſome wayes miſinformed, deluded, ſurprized, or otherwiſe abuſed in theſe things by evill members, we have frequently in former papers, (before the Charge) put the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon it, (who without colour of breach of Priviledge
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105327:4"/>
might doe it,) to find out and diſcover who they were that had ſo abuſed them, and to diſingage the Honour of Parliament from the evill practiſes and deſignes of ſuch Incendiaries.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the ſame difficulties or prejudices lye yet in our way, (as to the particular charging or proofe of ſuch things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt members.) And the Parliament (though ſo often put upon it in our former papers, yet through the powerfull intereſt of the perſons guilty,) hath not taken any cognizance what members or others have ſo abuſed them, to draw the Parliament to ſuch diſhonour and inconveniences, we cannot but againe more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearely aſſert (as we have in former papers, and ſhall more particularly if neede be, remonſtrate) that divers things lately done and paſſed from the Parliament againſt this Army, (as particularly the Order for ſuppreſſing the Petition, that high Declaration againſt it, and againſt all that ſhould proceede in it, putting the faithfull ſervants of the Parliament and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out of the protection of the Law, and expoſing them as enemies to the State, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> to the forfeiture of Eſtates, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Life and all, but for going about in an humble, peaceable and inoffenſive way, to deſire what was undeniably, their due and dearely earned, and many other ſuch like proceedings both againſt the Army, and others,) doe carry with them ſuch a face of injuſtice, oppreſſion, arbitrarineſſe and tyranny, as (we thinke) is not to be paraleld in any former proceedings of the moſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Courts againſt any private men, but have brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable diſhonour upon the Parliament, (which we are, and others ought to be deepely ſenſible of,) hath tended to diſobliedge all men, eſpecially Souldiers from the ſame, to deſtroy all juſt freedome either of Souldiers or Subjects, and hath conduced to all other the ſad effects and worſe conſequences, expreſſed in the Charge, and gives us and others cauſe to conclude that thoſe Worthies, who have formerly acted and carried on things in Parliament for Publique-Good, Right and Freedome, are now awed or over-borne by a prevailing party of men of other private intereſts crept in, and that neither we, nor any other can reaſonably expect right freedome or ſafety (as private men or) to have things acted in Parliament for publicke good while the ſame perſons continue there in the ſame power to abuſe the name
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105327:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and authority of Parliament, to ſerve and proſecute their private intereſts and paſſions and (vnder the priviledges of Parliament) to ſhelter themſelves under the worſt of evills or miſcheifes they can doe, though to the Ruine of the Kingdome. Wee are in this caſe forc'd (to our great griefe of heart) thus plainely to aſſert the preſent evill and miſchiefe, together with the future worſe conſequences of the things lately done even in the Parliament it ſelfe, (which are too evident and viſible to all.) And ſo (in their proper colours) to lay the ſame at the Parliaments doores, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Parliament ſhall be pleaſed either of themſelves to take notice and ridde the Houſes of thoſe who have any way miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, deluded, ſurprized, or otherwiſe abuſed the Parliament to the paſſing ſuch foule things there, or ſhall open to us and others ſome way how we may (regularly and without the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of breaking Priviledges come to charge and proſecute thoſe particular perſons, that (in truth) have ſo abuſed the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (as well as our ſelves) even for thoſe miſinformations, and other evill and indirect practiſes or proceedings in Parliament, whereby they have ſo abuſed the ſame (as in our ſaid Charge and former papers is ſet forth.)</p>
            <p>And here (if wee may) we ſhould humbly offer to conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether it were not a necaſſary expedient, for prevention or remedy of ſuch evills in future, that in things ſo clearely diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the common Rights and Liberties of the people, and the ſafety of the Kingdome, there ſhould be a libertie for diſſenting members in the houſe of Commons (as it is alowed in the houſe of Peeres) to enter their diſſent, and thereby to acquit themſelves from the guilt or blame of what evill may enſue, that ſo the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may regularly come to know who they are that performe their truſt faithfully, and who not. And this proviſion for the future, (as alſo our deſires for remedy in the preſent caſes) as it were clearely good and neceſſary in the reſpects premiſed, ſo (wee thinke) the ſame may well be without future prejudice or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in any other reſpects to ſucceeding Members of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Providing alwaies that no man ſhall be queſtioned or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for any thing ſaid or done in <hi>Parliament</hi> any further then to excluſion from that truſt, which is all that in the preſent caſe wee ſhould deſire upon any ſuch grounds. And that future liberty of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105327:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
entering diſſents wee doe not here propoſe as a thing wee any way inſiſt on to the prejudice of <hi>Parliament</hi> priviledges, wee onely offer it to conſideration, and that from good wiſhes to the Priviledges of <hi>Parliament,</hi> to render them more laſting by being leſſe nocent. And indeed whoever moſt adores or tenders thoſe Priviledges, wil beſt expreſſe his zeale towards them in taking care they be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed or extended to private wrong or publicke miſchiefe. (For wee clearly finde &amp; all wiſe men may ſee it) that <hi>Parliament</hi> Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as well as Royall-Prerogative, may be perverted and abuſed to the deſtruction of thoſe greater ends for whoſe protection and preſervation they were admitted or intended <hi>(viz.</hi> the Rights and Liberties of the people and ſafety of the whole) and in caſe they be ſo, the abuſe, evill, or danger of them is no ieſſe to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt, and a remedy thereof no leſſe to be endeavoured, then of the other.</p>
            <p>And whereas the injuſtice (in that particular of the <hi>Declaration</hi> againſt the <hi>Army</hi> for their juſt and innocent Petition) may ſeeme to have bin recompenſed in the late expungeing thereof out of the Journall bookes. Wee confeſſe it had bin ſo in great meaſure, as to the particular or preſent injury done to the <hi>Army</hi> therein, &amp; (we cannot but acknowledge therefore the Juſtice that lyes in thoſe Votes for expungeing thereof, and for our owne or the <hi>Armys</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reparation, wee ſhould neither wiſh more, nor ſcarce have inſiſted on ſo much to any diſhonor of <hi>Parliaments</hi> in future, &amp; we ſhould rather have been ſatisfied with the <hi>Parliaments</hi> declaring how, and by whom they have bin miſinformed, ſurpriſed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe abuſed in the framing, propoſall or paſſing thereof as it was, but as to that particular, or any other of that nature, we ſay as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We never did nor doe value or regard our own injury or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in any compariſon to the conſequence of the one, to the prejudice of the other, or to the future ſecurity of common right &amp; freedome in this Nation. And accordingly we do not account any reparation conſiderable that extends but to our ſelves in the preſent caſe, and does not in ſome ſort ſecure our ſelves, and all others from danger of the ſame or worſe injuries or oppreſſions, (as private men from the wills and paſſions of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have offered and acted ſuch things againſt us while an Army.</p>

Wee cannot but imagine and conſider (according to generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) how the expungeing of that Declaration was carried and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and upon what grounds and intentions it was given way to, but had thoſe that procured it been all for expungeing it (and that freely) yet how can we expect better but that the ſame men who at one time carried ſuch a Declaration, and another time expung'd it, may the next day obtaine the like or worſe (upon any occaſion wherein it may ſerve their private ends or intereſts) if they continue in the ſame power and ſway and be let paſs in deluding and ſurprizing the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they have done in the paſt particulars.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The apparent diſhonour and prejudice brought upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in having ſuch a Declaration ſo paſſed as they ſhould ſoone after (without any alteration) in the pretended ground of it find cauſe (for ſhame of the world) to expunge, (we think) ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage thoſe Members that love Parliaments, in point of honour, to find out and diſcover, how, and by whom the Parliament had been abuſed or therwiſe brought into ſuch an inconveniency. And the Parliament may in this ſee the temper (as by-ſtanders do the prevalence) of thoſe Members that abuſed the Parliament in that Declaration, who will and can make the Authority of Parliament ſtill lye under the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it (in a bare expungeing or retracting) rather then to admit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſideration to acquit the authority of Parliament that would tend to fix the blame on thoſe particular Members that had deſerted it. And this certainly will be admitted and done rather then to ſlight it over in a bare expungeing, were not ſome men more tender of, and more ſwayed with ſuch conſiderations and conſequences as may tend to the prejudice of perſons, then ſuch as tend to the generall prejudice and diſhonour of Parliaments.</p>
            <p>As to theſe particulars included in our charge which depend on things don without the Parliament we are ready and ſhould moſt willingly proceed in the particular charging, and proving thereof if (firſt from the Juſtice of the Houſe in a preſent proceeding againſt the perſons charged for thoſe things that are already knowne to the houſe being done in it) we could find incouragement to expect any good iſſue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe other things, and did we not (on the contrary) find that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what is ſo knowne to the Houſe as before expreſſed) the ſame perſons continue in ſuch power &amp; prevalence both in the Houſe and in all Committees of the higheſt truſt as leaves little hope of right or ſatisfaction to the Army or Kingdome in other things and much

leſſe in any juſt proceeding againſt themſelves while they continue Judges of their owne and our concernments, ſo as we cannot, while they remaine in the ſame power, expect any other but a continued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and making advantage of all things (and eſpecially of thoſe delayes which a regular proceeding againſt them would neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce) altogether to our owne and the Kingdomes prejudice and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diſable or weaken us for thoſe things which the ſafety and ſetling of the Rights, Liberties, and Peace of the Kingdome requires: And to ſtrengthen themſelves by underhand practiſes and preparations both at home and abroad the better to oppoſe us and engage the Kingdom in a new War, thereby to accompliſh their deſignes, or at leaſt to ſave themſelves from Juſtice in a common confuſion: We ſay were it not for theſe and ſuch other conſiderations, that leave little hopes of Juſtice to our ſelves or the Kingdome (while they continue in the ſame power) and render all delayes dangerous and diſtructive to our ſelves and peace of the Kingdome, we ſhould be contented that the buſineſſe concerning the Members we have charged ſhould be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide till thoſe other things were firſt ſettled, which our Declaration does propound for the common rights and liberties of the Kingdome.</p>

               </gap> we appeale to all men for the Juſtice, reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſſe, and neceſſity thereof.</p>
            <p>The Juſtice in that the former ſervice (for which theſe arrears are due) hath beene (at leaſt) as faithfully and diligently performed by the Army as by thoſe late deſerters of it and in our preſent poſture (though they have appeared indeed more officious and ſerviceable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and will of particular men then we, yet we are ſure) the Army is and (we hope) will at laſt appeare to be more faithfull to the true intereſt of Parliament, and the Kingdome (which wee were at firſt called out and ingaged for) then they in deſerting the Army have hitherto appeared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105327:6"/>
For the reaſonableneſs of our deſires though we have ground to claim more then they, or rather that they or ſome of them ſhould forfeit their Arrears, yet we aske (for preſent) but equall nor ſhould wee (at preſent) inſiſt much on that (as to Officers) if our Souldies were but firſt paid up. Our neceſſity to inſiſt on that, is obvious to every man, and therefore (unleſs we ſhould betray our owne and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes cauſe) we cannot but poſſitively inſiſt upon it, that the Army ſhould forth with be paid up (at the leaſt) equally to thoſe deſertors of it which if denyed or delayed, we ſhall be thereby inforct upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wayes of iuſtant remedy and right-to the Army therein.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Parliament hath lately ordered and publikely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that all that ſhall deſert the Army ſhall have preſent ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Arreares (the Officers three months pay, the Souldiers all their Arreares deducting for free quarter) which ſtill continues un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recalled, we cannot but look upon it as a moſt cleare evidence of the continuing malice and prevalence of ours and the Kingdomes Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And we muſt and do inſiſt upon it, that that order or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may forthwith be publikly recalled, otherwiſe we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that any thing but ruine and deſtruction is deſigned to our ſelves and all others in the Kingdome, who every where call upon us, not to disband till we ſee the Rights, Liberties, and peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſettled according to the many Declarations by which we were firſt called forth, and invited to engage in the late War.</p>
            <p>Next we cannot but take notice that (inſtead of granting or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering our deſires in the laſt paper) in order to the better and more ſafe proceeding to a compoſure and ſettlement of all things for the good and peace of the Kingdome, and for prevention of a new War the Army being firſt commanded to forty miles diſtance from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> his Majeſties Perſon is demanded immediatly to <hi>Richmond</hi> houſe within eight miles of <hi>London</hi> which (as we cannot but impute it) to the prevailing intereſt of the ſame enemies to our, and the Kingdomes peace, ſo all men may eaſily diſcerne (with us) how directly it tends (in purſuance of their former private deſigne) upon the King ere he came from <hi>Holdenby</hi> to put his Majeſty within the reach of thoſe mens power who have under hand Liſted about <hi>London</hi> already very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable numbers both of horſe and foor, and are daily liſting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging more both there and in many parts of the Kingdome to ſerve their deſignes: And therefore we appeale to all uningaged men whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105327:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we can in this give way to have the King put ſo far within thoſe mens power without giving them the ſo long ſought for advantage of his Majeſties Perſon, whereby to embroyle the Kingdome in a new and bloody War, and to ſtrengthen themſelves in their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous deſignes, the better to uphold and eſtabliſh their faction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended domination, ſo that in this caſe we cannot but importune the Parliament (as they tender the peace and ſafety of the Kingdome and the avoyding of Jealouſies or worſe inconveniency in the Army) that they would reſume the conſideration of that buſineſſe concerning the Perſon of the King, and not propoſe any place for him neerer to <hi>London</hi> then they would have the Quarters of the Army to be.</p>
            <p>And whereas (by the procurement of the ſame perſons, or others of their party) there hath been ſcandalous informations preſented to the Houſes, and induſtriouſly publiſhed in Print, importing, as if his Majeſty were kept as a priſoner amongſt us, and barbarouſly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilly uſed, we cannot but declare that the ſame and all other ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of that ſort, are moſt falſe and ſcandalous, and abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, not onely to our declared deſires, but alſo to our principles, which are moſt clearely for a generall right and juſt freedome to all men. And therefore upon this occaſion we cannot but declare par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that we deſire the ſame for the King, and others of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (ſo farre as can conſiſt with common right or freedome) and with the ſecurity of the ſame for future) and we doe further clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, we doe not ſee how there can be any peace to this Kingdome, firme or laſting without a due conſideration of, and proviſion for the Rights, Quiet, and Immunity of his Majeſties Royall Family, and his late partakers, and herein we think that tender and equitable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (as ſuppoſing their caſes had been ours) and a ſpirit of common love and juſtice, diffuſing it ſelf, to the good and preſervation of all, will make up the moſt glorious conqueſts over their hearts, (if God in mercy ſee it good) to make them, and the whole people of the Land, laſting friends.</p>
            <p>Now to draw to a concluſion: ſince we can yet obtaine no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or anſwer to the things deſired as before, but contrariwiſe finde all things carryed on by the prevailing intereſt of thoſe our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to the prejudice and danger of our ſelves and the Kingdome, ſince (notwithſtanding ſome Votes of Parliament, againſt the late Orders of the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> for liſting of Forces, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105327:7"/>
the earneſt deſires and indevours of the City, concurrent with our own, to have the ſame prevented or remedyed, yet the ſaid <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Safety</hi> being continued ſtill in the ſame power) we find that by the appointment or contrivance, and under the protection or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the ſame perſons whom we have charged, and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, there are ſtill manifold practiſes under-hand, to liſt and raiſe new Forces, and (notwithſtanding the diſcovery thereof to the Parliament from the City, yet) the ſame perſons have prevailed ſo far in the Houſe, as not to admit the Queſtion for diſchargeing of them, but the ſame practices ſtill continue, and with double diligence are inforced ſince: alſo divers forces (pretended to have ingaged for <hi>Ireland)</hi> are by the ſame perſons ordered to Randezvouz about <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> there to lay the foundation of a new Army. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Emiſſaries and correſpondents in all Counties, are buſie and active to raiſe forces for them. And though for theſe things the actors of them have no preſent publique authority, yet they have ſome way ſuch countenance or aſſiſtance to be juſtified in Parliament, (if queſtioned for it) as that they have the confidence to act openly, ſince they have likewiſe their Emiſſaries or agents abroad in <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> and other Countries, very active to draw in Foraine Forces for their aſſiſtance: ſince in the mean time, they are indevouring by Spies, and ſecret agents in all our Quarters, to inveigle and invite the Souldiers of this Army to deſert their Officers and come to <hi>London,</hi> And for that purpoſe doe improve the advantage of the Order or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Parliament afore-mentioned, for ſatisfaction of Arreares to ſuch as ſhall deſert the Army. And we finde they have the publick purſe ſo much at their diſpoſall, as to make good that, and other their undertakings of that nature, and yet ſuch as have ſo deſerted the Army and received their Arrears, are not diſcharged or diſperſed, but continued together in bodies, and under Command, in or near the City, (as in particular ſome of Sir <hi>Robert Py<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105327:8"/>
and ruine, and the Kingdomes prejudice, and to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and ſtrengthening in their deſignes, the better to prepare for a new warre.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, conſidering the multitudes of Reformadoes and other Souldiers, ſwarming about the City (whom the perſons we have charged and their accomplices, have at their beck, to bring up to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> when they pleaſe) and that by their frequent tumultuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences thither (beſetting, and ſometimes blocking up the Parliament dores threatning and offring violence to the perſons of the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Parliament men) the juſt freedome of Parliament ſeemes to be taken away or at leaſt for the preſent abrogated in ſo much that thoſe Members who have ſerved the Kingdome hitherto with moſt faithfullneſſe, diligence and integrity for the publike good, many of them dare ſcarce come to the Houſe; or (if they doe) they come in feare and perill of their lives, and when they are there, are awed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, or diſabled from diſcharging their conſciences, or doing their duties to the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe conſiderations, we are clearly convinc'd and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that both our duties and truſt for the Parliament and Kingdom, calls upon us, and warrants us, and an imminent neceſſity (for our own and the Kingdomes ſafety, and prevention of a new warre) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth us to make or admit of no longer delayes, but upon theſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations God hath given us with vigour and ſpeed, to indevour in ſome extraordinary way, the vindicating of Parliament freedome from tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuons violence, the breaking of theſe deſignes and preparations that otherwiſe threaten a preſent imbroilement of the Kingdome in more blood and war and a future perpetuable inſlaving of it under faction and Tyranny. And ſo (if God ſee it good) to put the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament into a freedome and capacity (with his Majeſties wiſhed and hoped concurrence) to ſettle the rightes, liberties, and peace of the Kingdome.</p>
