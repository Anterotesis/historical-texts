            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Faithful WARNING TO Out-side Professors, And Loose Pretenders to <hi>CHRISTIANITY</hi> of all Sorts.</head>
            <p>COme all ye <hi>Professors</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> upon the Face of the whole Earth under what <hi>form</hi> soever, <hi>what have ye learned</hi> hitherto of all that ye <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess?</hi> have ye learned to <hi>Fear God</hi> and <hi>keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi> have ye learned thus to <hi>Love God?</hi> and <hi>do you love your Neighbour as your selves?</hi> do ye not profess <hi>to love God above all things, and your Neighbour as your selves?</hi> is this done? what? will <hi>a profession</hi> of <hi>words</hi> commend you to God, where the obedience is awan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</p>
            <p>O thou that art called <hi>Christendom,</hi> how art thou fallen! how art thou become the <hi>Plant</hi> of <hi>a degenerate Vine</hi>! how are thy <hi>Grapes</hi> become as those of <hi>Sodom</hi>! who shall bring <hi>healing</hi> to thee, who hast rejected the balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> that the Father brought to thee.</p>
            <p>O Thou <hi>foolish Child</hi>! how hast thou triffled out thy <hi>precious Time</hi> about <hi>Toyes</hi> and <hi>Triffles,</hi> and hast not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:92989:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Voyce</hi> of thy <hi>Maker,</hi> who hath waited all day long to gather thee, and to do thee good; but thou wouldst not! Thou hast Chosen the <hi>worse part,</hi> in that thou hast <hi>forsaken</hi> the Lord the <hi>Fountain of Living Waters</hi>; and hast hewed and chosen to thy self <hi>a Cistern,</hi> that will hold <hi>no Water.</hi> Thou art gone into the <hi>wayes</hi> of the <hi>Old World,</hi> upon whom the Flood came: And which of those sins, for which <hi>Sodom</hi> burned, are a wanting in thee?</p>
            <p>O! The pure <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> that would quench thy thirst, how is it slighted and neglected by thee! And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou utterly unsatisfied, in whatsoever thou dost, or attempts to do. Thou art never able to sati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te thy soul with husks: Thou must come into the <hi>Fathers house</hi> before thou hast <hi>Bread enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thou sayst in thy heart, Thou art a <hi>Queen,</hi> yea, That thou art <hi>Rich,</hi> and <hi>indued with goods,</hi> and hast <hi>need</hi> of <hi>nothing</hi>: When as alas in the true Light, that loves thy soul, thou art seen to be <hi>miserable, poore, wretched, blind</hi> and <hi>naked. A long Course</hi> hast thou run; but the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised end</hi> thou hast not reached: thou hast been like <hi>a bewildred sheep,</hi> running <hi>from Mountain to hill</hi> to find a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, where no rest is. Thou camest indeed a little out of <hi>Aegypt</hi>: but O! how soon didst thou turn back again thither, from whence thou came, and loved the <hi>Flesh-Pots of Aegypt,</hi> yea, the Onyons and Garlick bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then God's <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wilderness: Thou shouldest have followed the Lord <hi>perfectly</hi> unto the <hi>Land of Rest</hi> in patience, and silence of Spirit under his <hi>voice,</hi> and <hi>teachings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thou grew <hi>weary of waiting</hi> upon thy God, and saw <hi>Images</hi> of things on Earth, and <hi>Images</hi> of things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and bowed thy heart to them, and didst not keep
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:92989:2"/>
thy heart to the power that broke through the Darkness for thee. Nor didst thou keep thy eye to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> that freely shined out of Darkness for thee to have guided thee through the dark-howling <hi>Wilderness</hi> to <hi>Sion.</hi> But thou being <hi>careless,</hi> and <hi>selfish,</hi> thou lend thy ear to the <hi>voyce</hi> of the <hi>stranger,</hi> that cryed, <hi>Lo here</hi> and <hi>Lo there</hi>: and so wast thou led out of the <hi>Way</hi> into <hi>By-Pathes</hi> of sin and death, where thou hast been lost from the <hi>true Life,</hi> and <hi>true Light,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that wrought in thee in the beginning. And thou hast not to this day throwly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered thy loss; nay very little is thy nakedness and wretchedness laid to heart in thee.</p>
            <p>And now therefore thou, that art called <hi>Christendom,</hi> What is the Wood of <hi>thy Vine</hi> (seeing thou hast lest off to <hi>bear Fruit</hi> to the Lord) better, then the Wood of <hi>another Tree?</hi> nay, it is not so good as any. For, if the <hi>Salt,</hi> that should season other things, have lost its <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> wherewith shall it be salted? and of what use is it, but even to be trodden under feet of men. O! that thou wert wise to <hi>consider,</hi> at least in this thy day the <hi>things of thy peace</hi> in this great day, wherein the Bridegroom, which hath been as one travelled into a far <hi>Country,</hi> is come again, and is appeared in his antient love, power and perfection to visit thee, and to seek thee up out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place, where thou hast been scattered from sin in the long <hi>Night</hi> of <hi>Apostacy,</hi> to see, if any of the pure love, that was in thee in the <hi>day</hi> of thy <hi>Espousals,</hi> may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to himself out of thee: that he may know, how to do thee good, and how to make manifest his antient love unto thee, which burned the hearts of his simple <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> into such love of his goodness, as <hi>to follow the Lamb where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he went</hi> in the beginning.</p>
            <p>But O thou <hi>polluted Woman,</hi> how art thou <hi>wandred away</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:92989:3"/>
from the true Sheep-fold! how art thou gone <hi>a whoring</hi> from under thy God! how art thou covered with the <hi>shades</hi> of <hi>Night</hi>! and how art thou <hi>lost</hi> amongst the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and mingled with the <hi>Heathen</hi>! yea, thou hast cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen thy own wayes, and worshipped the works of thy own hands, and hast cast the pure law of God behind thy back. Yea, the <hi>Light</hi> of the Glorious Gospel of Christ, which hath shined to thee, and would have gathered thee up to God, thou hast <hi>rejected,</hi> and hast not liked to retain God, nor his light in thy knowledge. And so thou art become vain in thy mind, and thy foolish heart is become so dark, that thou worships thou knows not what, like those that know not God; and art become a prey to every Beast of the Field, and art bowed in thy heart to the <hi>creatures,</hi> more then to the living God the <hi>Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore will he arise in thee in great <hi>Majesty,</hi> and dreadful <hi>Power,</hi> and will yet again bring to pass his <hi>Act, his strange Act</hi> in thee. And he will not meet thee as <hi>a man,</hi> but as <hi>a consuming Fire:</hi> because thou hast rejected his goodness, patience and forbearance.

            <p>Howl then ye <hi>Guilty,</hi> and be Humbled for your Sins, lest that Day come suddenly upon you, as a Thief in the Night, and sweep you all away; as it did the <hi>Old World,</hi> who regarded not the Day of their Visitation, but went on in their Sins, until there was no Remedy.</p>
            <p>Awake, awake, ye <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>Careless-Hearted,</hi> who put the Day of the Lord afar off, and cry <hi>Peace,</hi> when there is <hi>no Peace.</hi> For, what Peace to the Wicked? <hi>There is no Peace to the Wicked,</hi> saith the true God; but <hi>Peace</hi> only upon <hi>Zion,</hi> and to such as turn from Iniquity
<pb facs="tcp:92989:5"/>
in <hi>Jacob.</hi> So let not one take the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> in their Mouth any more, until they depart from Iniquity. For such, as go on in the Custom and daily Practice of Sin, and yet think to cover themselves with an <hi>Outward Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christ,</hi> do but deceive themselves, and increase their Condemnation, adding Sin to Sin. This is God's Truth, which he that hath an Ear, let him hear; and he that hath any Desire in him to return to God, let him consider of, and give Glory to God by Repenting of that, which doth any way dishonour God.</p>
            <p>Also this know for truth, That your <hi>Invented, Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Gaming</hi> for Vain Delights and Pleasures is not of God; but an Invention of that Wicked One, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> invented to please the Vain and Empty Minds of his Children and Servants, which are out of the Law and Truth of God. But the Children and Servants of God are full of Goodness, and are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the Law and Truth of God Day and Night; and so deny the Devil and his Works. So let no Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any of you, neither be deceived in your selves; for the Judge is at the Door. And the True light is ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, which makes manifest every Work, and the Reward of it forever.</p>
            <p>And all ye <hi>Stage-Players, Puppit-Players,</hi> and the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> and <hi>Inventors</hi> of such things, with all that love such <hi>Heathenish</hi> things, yea, and give your Money for them, that thereby ye may feed the Covetous Lusts in the <hi>Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> that thirst after Money; and the Vain Lust of your own defiled Eyes and Ears, which are after Pleasures more then the Lord God, that made you. Know this, That your Works are all weighed in an Equal Ballance,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:92989:5"/>
and by the Light of Christ you are all seen to be out of the Doctrine of Christ in the <hi>Heathenish Nature,</hi> uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and practising those things, which Christ came to destroy. Yea, and by the Light of Christ in your own Consciences, when you are a little sober and still in your Minds, you know, <hi>you should not do such things</hi>: Here you also have learn'd your Condemnation, and cannot in this State stand before the Lord, because of your Sins.</p>
            <p>And all ye, that can please your selves with beholding <hi>one Creature hurt, and torment another,</hi> yea, sometimes even <hi>to Death,</hi> as at <hi>Bull-Baitings, Bear-Baitings, Cock-Fightings,</hi> and the like. O! what Minds have ye, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary are ye herein to the <hi>Tender Nature</hi> of Christ, and all <hi>Christians,</hi> truly so call'd, who could never Rejoyce in any such things, by reason of their <hi>tender, pittiful</hi> and <hi>merciful Nature!</hi> O ye <hi>Children of Cruelty!</hi> when will your Hearts break, your Stony Hearts melt into Tears before the Lord for all your mighty Sins? and when will you bring your Deeds to the Light, that ye may see the Ugliness of your Sins, and repent of them; lest the Judgments written fall upon you for them, as it did upon all such from the beginning of the World, and there be no escape?</p>
            <p>O <hi>England, England!</hi> How hast thou defiled thy self by thine Iniquities! How is the Flood-gate of Sin broken open in thee to the polluting of thy Land! O, how art thou wholely over-spread with Bryars, and Thorns, and Weeds! so that the Lord must arise to purge thee by <hi>Fire</hi>; seeing thou hast refused to wash in that pure <hi>Water of Life,</hi> that sprung up in thee. So if thou hast an Ear, hear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late, and the Door be shut.</p>

Yea, you cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Christ afresh to your selves, and put him to open Shame by your Lewd Living.</p>
            <p>The Hand of the Lord is against you, ye prophane <hi>Esaus,</hi> who have sold and are selling your Birth-right for a Mess of Pottage. When will ye Awake, when will ye Arise from off your sinful Bed, where you cry <hi>Peace</hi> to your selves in your Sins.</p>
            <p>When will ye lay to Heart the Apostle's Doctrine, ye Common Sinners, who proudly boast of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers, and yet depart not from your Iniquities? Is not the Sacrifice of the Wicked an Abomination to God? and will God regard your Prayers, whilst you so love and regard your Iniquities, and walk so contrary to the Doctrine of Christ?</p>
            <p>Doth not the Appostle say, <hi>Make no Provision for the Flesh, to satisfie it in the Lusts thereof</hi>; and ye in a direct Opposition and Hatred to this Doctrine, make <hi>all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi> for the Flesh to fulfil and satisfie it <hi>every way</hi> in the Lusts thereof. And so your Table is the Table of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and not of Saints; and ye cannot both partake of the <hi>Table of Devils,</hi> and the <hi>Table of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> being Witness.</p>
            <p>So howl ye <hi>Sinners,</hi> and <hi>Ungodly People,</hi> and be Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for all your Lewdnesses; and Repent of all your Whoredoms, whereby ye have gone away a Whoring from the Life of Christ, and his Saints.

            <p>O ye, that are so contrary to Christ, be humbled before the Lord for all your <hi>Hypocrisies,</hi> who say, <hi>You are come out of</hi> Popery, and yet continue in some of their <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Customs,</hi> as this prophane keeping of the time, which ye in Imitation call <hi>Christmas</hi> (among other Superstitions) whereby ye shew your selves to be too near of kin to that <hi>Whorish Woman,</hi> which hath defiled the Earth with her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations.
