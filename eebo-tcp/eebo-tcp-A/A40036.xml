            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37288:3"/>
conſideration of them admitted in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (though viſibly of higheſt moment to the Publique) and all ordinary Remedies being denied, we were neceſsitated to an extraordinary way of Remedy; whereby, to avoid the Miſchiefs then at hand, and ſet you in a condition (without ſuch obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or diverſions by corrupt Members) to proceed to matters of publique Juſtice, and general Setlement. Now as nothing did in our own hearts more juſtifie our late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking towards many Members in this Parliament, then the Neceſsity thereof, in order to a ſound Settlement in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the integrity of our Intentions to make uſe of it onely to that end: So we hold our ſelves obliged to give the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all Aſſurance poſsible, That our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the corrupt cloſure endeavored with the King, was not in Deſign to hinder Peace or Setlement (thereby to render our Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as Soldiers neceſſary to be continued) and that neither that extraordinary courſe we have taken, nor any other proceedings of ours, have been intended for the ſetting
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37288:3"/>
up of any particular Party or Intereſt, by or with which to uphold our ſelves in Power and Dominion over the Nation; but that it was and is the deſire of our hearts, in all we have done (with the hindering of that imminent evil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Conjunction with the KING) to make way for a Settlement of the Peace and Government of this Kingdom, upon Grounds of FREEDOM and SAFETY. And therefore becauſe our former overtures for that purpoſe, being onely in general terms, and not reduc'd to a certainty of particulars fit for practice) might poſsibly be underſtood but as plauſible pretences, not intended really to be put into effect, we have thought it our duty to draw out thoſe generals into an intire frame of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, aſcertained with ſuch circumſtances, as may make it effectively practicable: And for that end, while your time hath been taken up in other matters of high and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent importance, we have ſpent much of ours in preparing and perfecting ſuch a Draught of Agreement, and in all things
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37288:4"/>
ſo circumſtantiated, as to render it ripe for your ſpeedier conſideration, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms acceptance and practice (if approved) and ſo we do herewith humbly preſent it to you. Now to prevent miſunderſtanding of our intentions therein, we have but this to ſay, That we are far from ſuch a ſpirit, as poſitively to impoſe our private appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions upon the judgements of any in the Kingdom (that have not forfeited their Freedom) and much leſs upon your ſelves; neither are we apt in any wiſe to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on circumſtantial things, or ought that is not evidently Fundamental to that Publike Intereſt for which you and we have declared and ingaged: But in this tender of it, we humbly Deſire,</p>
