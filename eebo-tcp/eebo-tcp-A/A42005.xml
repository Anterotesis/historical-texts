         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MOſt dearly and well beloved Friends, <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Siſters</hi> whom the
Lord hath gathered to be <hi>a People, to be to the praiſe of his Name,</hi>
who once were not a People, but were ſcattered as among the
<hi>Tribes,</hi> and a certain dwelling place we knew not, but went <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as a Dove without a mate,</hi> ſaying, Where is our <hi>Souls beloved?</hi> and when
we were almoſt out of <hi>hope,</hi> then the Voice out of the <hi>excellent Glory</hi> was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,

ready to ſay, We muſt now dwell in the houſe of <hi>mourning,</hi> and <hi>the ſhaddow of
death muſt be our habitation for ever:</hi> Then, in an <hi>acceptable time,</hi> when it was
with us, as if it were <hi>neither night nor day, but in the even-tide,</hi> then the <hi>Light</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and he was <hi>lifted up</hi> who hath drawn our hearts after him, even <hi>Christ
the Light of the world,</hi> the <hi>Saviour</hi> of all that believe and follow him; this was
he that we had heard and ſpoken much of, yet then were <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to him,
though he was nigh unto us, and ſpake with us, ſhewing unto us our loſt and
and undone eſtate; and ſometimes made our <hi>hearts burn within us:</hi> But now,
bleſſed be the Lord, who by the Light which he hath cauſed to ſhine in our
hearts, he hath ſhewed us our ſelves, our ſins, and he who is the father of
them, and hath, and is opening the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>his Kingdom,</hi> which conſiſts

<hi>raiſed up Jeſus from the dead,</hi> in the hearts of his People; and this is that Gift
that is <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> given of the Father to reſcue, and redeem, and ſave loſt
man, from the power of <hi>Death,</hi> to bring him out of the houſe of <hi>Bondage</hi> and

delivered <hi>David</hi> out of the mouth of the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and out of the paw of the Bear,
and in the name of the Lord he ove came the <hi>great uncircumciſed Philiſtim.</hi>
The Lord alſo preſerved his Servant <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den, and <hi>Job</hi> in his

<hi>Oh great is the Lord, and greatly to be feared,</hi> and <hi>admired</hi> in all his <hi>Saints,</hi> who is
<hi>dreadful</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi> in <hi>power,</hi> who doeth all things according to his <hi>pleaſure:</hi>

with his preſence,</hi> who without him cannot live, nor be ſatisfied with any thing
but the <hi>Bread of life,</hi> that comes from him; and for thoſe he ſpreads a Table,
and feeds them, though they are as in a wilderneſs, and giveth them <hi>bread
that the world knows not of.</hi> Well my Friends, Did the Lord hear and anſwer
our cries in the dayes paſt? when we were as <hi>Ephraim, bemoaning our ſelves,</hi> and
as <hi>David,</hi> thinking <hi>we were caſt out of his ſight;</hi> yet did we look to that which
was <hi>holy,</hi> which God had <hi>manifeſted in us,</hi> and back again into the world we
could not go, neither would the ſhadows of the Heavenly things ſatisfie us,
but the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> that we earneſtly deſired: And now the Lord, by the <hi>light</hi>
of his Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath made known himſelf unto us, and hath let us ſee, that he
<hi>hath waited long to be gracious,</hi> and hath watched over us as a tender Father;
and ſince we knew him to be our God, he hath been good unto us, and hath
appeared for us, in rebuking our <hi>adverſaries,</hi> and in driving back and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
our <hi>Enemies</hi> within and without: And when the <hi>Dragon</hi> hath been

that the <hi>Dragon hath caſt out of his mouth,</hi> on purpoſe to drown us. Therefore
fear not, O <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Zion,</hi> whoſe dwelling is outwardly as in <hi>Sodom</hi> or <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and thou at ſome times haſt been ready to ſay, <hi>Thy God hath forgotten thee,
and the Lord hath forſaken thee,</hi> becauſe thou haſt been derided of the wicked,
and haſt been <hi>the Song of the ungodly</hi> all the day long, and in <hi>departing from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
thou art made a prey;</hi> thou haſt been even as a <hi>Chaſed Roe,</hi> or as a Sheep

compaſſed thee about, and purſued thee as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Hoſt. Yet now ariſe <hi>Oh
Zion, for thy light is come,</hi> and thy <hi>Glory is riſen,</hi> and <hi>thy enemies are men, and not God,</hi>
and <hi>their Horſes are fleſh and not ſpirit:</hi> therefore <hi>fear not man, whoſe breath is in his
noſtrils,</hi> for what is he before the <hi>Lord,</hi> when he ſtretcheth forth his hand for
the ſake of his own Seed, when he calls them <hi>from the Eaſt</hi> and <hi>from the Weſt,</hi>
and ſaith <hi>to the North give up, and to the South hold not back?</hi> then who can hinder
the purpoſe of the <hi>Lord,</hi> who doth whatſoever pleaſeth him. Therefore all
ye <hi>tender Ones,</hi> and ye feeble of the Flock, who are afraid of miſcarrying, and
cry becauſe of your <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and of the ſtrength of your <hi>Enemies</hi> within and
without, and are ready to ſay in your hearts, <hi>we ſhall never hold out to the end,</hi> and
this, even the thoughts of it, is your greateſt grief; for you matter not what
you may ſuffer, ſo you may hold out to the end, that <hi>your God</hi> may be <hi>honoured,</hi>
and his <hi>Truth,</hi> or which you are made partakers, <hi>advanced,</hi> and many that yet
are ſcattered, into it may be gathered, by it to be ſet free from the pollutions
of the world; this I know you heartily deſire. Oh ye <hi>tender Ones,</hi> whoſoever
ye are, <hi>lift up your Heads,</hi> and let not your <hi>ponderous thoughts</hi> cauſe you to droop;
for <hi>in weakneſs is God ordaining ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>out of the mouths of his Babes ſhall come
perfect praiſes,</hi> and power from him alone ſhall be received by the faithful, to
anſwer his requirings; <hi>For all our ſufficiency is of and from the Lord, and they that
wait on him ſhall renew their ſtrength.</hi> This I am a witneſs of: Therefore now
<hi>let Iſrael truſt in the Lord,</hi> and know him to be all their ſtay, waiting diligently
in the <hi>meek and quiet ſpirit</hi> upon him, ſo ſhall they never be confounded: For
this is the day, wherein God is <hi>ſeparating the Chaff from the Wheat,</hi> and is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a <hi>difference between them that fear him, and them that fear him not;</hi> and <hi>them
that Swear, and them that fear an Oath,</hi> though againſt the laſt of theſe, even
againſt thoſe that fear an Oath, a grievous Law is made and now is the cry,
<hi>We have a Law, and by it you ſhall ſuffer,</hi> ſurely <hi>this is not added, becauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi>
which the ancient Laws were, <hi>but becauſe there is a people that cannot
tranſgreſs the Law of their God,</hi> therefore there is a cry, <hi>Its not for our profit to let
theſe abide in our Land.</hi> But this let all know, <hi>That the Lord hath called us</hi> to be
a people, and hath gathered us into his <hi>innocent life of righteouſneſs,</hi> and to this
day hath been our <hi>Defence,</hi> when our <hi>Enemies</hi> were many. And this alſo
is a great cry againſt us, <hi>becauſe we meet together,</hi> to wait upon, and worſhip
<hi>the Lord in ſpirit and in truth:</hi> Therefore are we <hi>perſecuted,</hi> carried before <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi>

People of God in the days of old, <hi>when the ſnare was upon Mizpeh, and a ſpread
net upon Mount Tabor.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this, ye dear Children of the Lord,
meet together in <hi>Gods Name, Fear and Authority,</hi> having the <hi>loines of your minds
girded up, and your hearts fixed on the Lord,</hi> and none forſake the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the
<hi>faithful,</hi> neither let in the fear of Man, <hi>who can kill the body and can do no more;</hi>
for many of you hath the Lord deeply tried, and many of our <hi>brethren</hi> have
laid down their lives, as the faithful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Martyrs of Jeſus,</hi> giving glory to the
name of the Lord; and we know that the Lord was no hard Maſter, but
hath given us power according to our <hi>trials,</hi> and in Priſons he hath been and
is with us; therefore let none be <hi>troubled</hi> becauſe of the Law for Baniſhment,
neither let your faith fail, becauſe of the great and wide Sea: but now <hi>ſtand
ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of God,</hi> which is to be revealed to thoſe <hi>that faithfully
follow the Lamb whereſoever he goeth. Be ſtedfaſt, and unmovable, alwayes abounding
in the work of the Lord,</hi> committing your cauſe to him, <hi>waiting in the meek and
quiet ſpirit</hi> upon the Lord, his counſel to receive, that as the heart of one man,
with one conſent, ye may worſhip, and bleſs, and praiſe the <hi>Almighty God</hi> in
the ſenſe of his love; ſo his bleſſing will reſt upon the whole <hi>Camp,</hi> and his
inviſible Power will be your <hi>Shield</hi> in the greateſt <hi>tryals,</hi> you to defend and
preſerve in peace with your God; this my ſoul greatly deſiers. This as a
token of my love unto you <hi>(by the breath of Life)</hi> for the ſtirring up of your
<hi>pure minds,</hi> and that none may fear thoſe things which they may ſuffer, but
that your <hi>truſt</hi> may be in the <hi>Lord,</hi> and your <hi>ſtrength</hi> in the <hi>mighty God.</hi> Thus
having none other way to expreſs what is in mine heart towards you, but in
writing, I bid you Farewel.</p>
