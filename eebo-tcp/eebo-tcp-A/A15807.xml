         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I had obserued thus much, That whereas in private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,

good right bee reputed the Commaunders of such beasts as they have vnder their
hands. But withall, I perceived evidently, that all these Heards are more willing to

which they are by them driuen; so they forbeare such, as they debarre them fro.
And verily, they suffer their said Pastours to vse at their owne pleasure, those profit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rebelliously against their Pastours, either by way of disobedience, or in denying them
the vse of their fruits. Nay rather, more curst and hurtfull are beasts to all others

whomsoever, than to their Rulers and those who receive commodity by them:
whereas contrariwise, Men set themselves against none more, than such as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
goe about to exercise dominion ouer them. When I had well pondered these
points in my minde, thus I concluded in the end, That more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>asie it was for a man to
command all other living creatures in the world, than men.</p>
               <p>But when I considered eftsoones, How <hi>Cyrus</hi> a <hi>Persian</hi> borne, had won exceeding
many men, very many Cities, and Nations likewise, to his obedience, I was thereby
enforced to change my former opinion, and thus to resolve at the last; That it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impossible, nor yet a matter of difficulty, to governe men, in case one have the
skill thereof, and goe about it with dexterity. For why? of this we are assured, that
there yeelded obeisance willingly vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> some who were many dayes, others as
many moneths iourney, distant from him: those that never saw him, yea and such as
knew full well they should never see him: yet nathelesse would they all become his
liege men and devoted subiects. And no maruell. For, so farre excelled he all other
Kings, as well those that by inheritance succeeded in their Fathers Kingdomes, as
those who by their owne conquest attained to their dominions; that whereas the
<hi>Scythian</hi> King, (albeit the <hi>Scythians</hi> be a State, for number of people most puissant) is
not able to command any forraine Nation; but would be well apaid, if he might but
rule his owne: The <hi>Thracian</hi> Prince, likewise the <hi>Thracians:</hi> and the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,

imprint such an affection in their hearts, with an earnest desire to doe him pleasure, as
that they sued alwaies to be ruled according to his will and direction. Furthermore,
he had so many sorts of people obliged vnto him, as it were a painefull piece of
worke, to number them all: what way soever a man take, from his royall Palace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this Prince, as of a man worthy to be admired: and namely, how he was by

had? that he so farre surpassed all men in princely government. Whatsoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

they are. Those also they chastise, whom they take accusing others without iust cause.
Moreover, they call iudicially into question that crime, for which, men hate indeed
one another most, yet never question any therefore, And that is Ingratitude. And
whomsoever they vnderstand able to require a good turne, and yet short in requitall,
him they sharply punish: For this they thinke, That vnthankefull persons, are of all
others most negligent likewise in their duty to God, to their parents, to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

boyes temperance: And much furthered are they in learning such moderation, for
that they see before their faces, even the Auncients every day, to live right temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Furthermore, they give them precepts to obey their Rulers. In which point
also it auaileth much, that they behold the very Elders, passing obedient to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

wherein also they have a great helpe; partly because they have before their eyes the
example of the Seniours, who depart not vnto their refection before the Magistrates

their mothers, but with their Masters, and when the Provosts doe so appoint: Now

as in time of warre, (for he both hunteth himselfe, and also taketh order that others

have the election also of all Rulers and Magistrates. And if any one of the younger

of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and the forme thereof may more evidently appeare, now will I returne
and ascend a little higher: For, by reason of that discourse which hath already beene
made, I shall be able to declare the same very briefely.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are said to be in number about one hundred and twenty thousand: and
none of them all by law, vncapable of honourable dignities and Offices of State: Yea,
and lawfull it is for all the <hi>Persians</hi> to send their children to the common schooles of
Iustice. Howbeit, they onely doe send, who are able to keepe them otherwise in ease
and doing nothing: but such as cannot so doe, never send them thither. And verily,

lawfully among the young men passe their youth forward: But such as haue not bin
so taught, may not once come amongst them. They also who haue conversed with
other young men and performed their parts as the law requireth of them, are allowed
to step higher vnto the fellowship of those men that are come to full age; to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
also with them in Magistracies and dignities. But such as have not liued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
out their time, among the boyes or young persons abovesaid, are never admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the society of the middle aged men. Moreouer, as many as have passed their
compleat time without blame and reproufe among those of full and perfect yeeres,
be promoted vnto the order and degree of the Auncients. And thus are they ordained
Seniours, when they have gone through all good and honest functions. And truely
this is that forme of policy and government, which as many as vse be reputed simply
the best men and most vertuous. And even at this day, there remaineth a testimony,
as well of their moderate diet, as also of working out their food. For even yet, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Persians,</hi> it is held a shamefull thing, either to spit, or snit the nose, or to
seeme full of ventosities. Yea and a shame it is for a man to be seene openly to goe any
whither abroad, either to make water, or to doe any such requisite businesse of nature.
And surely, never were they able thus much to doe, vnlesse they did, not onely, keepe
a spare diet, but also by trauell, so spend and consume their excrementitious moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
as that it might passe and be conueyed some other way. Thus much I thought
good to speake of all the <hi>Persians</hi> in generall. But now will I deliver the noble acts

with great speed, no sooner knew <hi>Cyrus</hi> that <hi>Astyages</hi> was his mothers father, but
forthwith (as he was a childe by nature kind and louing to his parents) he saluted and
embraced him, as if he had beene one brought vp with him long before, or inwardly
acquainted with him of old. And beholding him, how he was set out with painting

seene, either vpon the way, in the streets, or at their dores, my grandfather here is the

to ride. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> (being a child given much to decent gallantnesse, and no lesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of honour) as he tooke great delight in that rich robe, so he joyed not a little,
that he learned the feat of riding. For, in <hi>Persia,</hi> by reason that it is hard for want of

here, and taste of so many and sundry meates? why? quoth <hi>Astyages</hi> againe, Is not
this, thinkest thou, a finer supper by many degrees than that in <hi>Persia?</hi> No verily
Good Sir answered <hi>Cyrus,</hi> considering we goe a more plaine and direct way to satisfie
our selues than yee do: For, bread and flesh onely bring vs straight thither; whereas
yee, shooting at the same marke that we doe, after much wandring vp and downe, and
fetching many a compasse and winding cranke, hardly and with much adoe at length,
arriue vnto that, whereto we attained long before. But we my childe, quoth <hi>Astya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
thinke it no paine thus to raunge and goe about, onely doe but taste, and thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
shalt know, quoth he, how toothsome and savoury these cates are? Yea, but me
thinkes, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that even your selfe, grandsire, doe loath these deinties. Then
<hi>Astyages,</hi> whereby speakest thou so, my child? and what conjecture leadeth thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
because saith he, I see, when you have handled bread, that you doe not wipe your
hand with any thing: but no sooner touch you any of these viands and sauces, but
presently at every morsell, and as you dio therein, you make your hand cleane with a
napkin, as if you were much offended, that the same was full of it. Well, my sonne,
quoth <hi>Astyages,</hi> if this be thy conceit; be merry yet and fall to thy flesh-meats, that
thou maist returne home a gallant Youth. Which he had no sooner said, but he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
many kinds of flesh, both wild and tame, to be set before him. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi>

hand of all the flesh which he received. But how is it quoth <hi>Astyages,</hi> that thou givest
nothing to <hi>Sacas</hi> my Cup-bearer, whom of all others I esteeme most? Now was this
<hi>Sacas</hi> a goodly fellow of person; and besides, in that place of credit and honour, as to
admit Suiters vnto the presence of <hi>Astyages,</hi> and to put backe such as he thought came
out of season and not meet to have accesse. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> (as a child) not smaying at all,
nor abashed at the question, readily came upon him againe with a reply, And why
Grandfather, quoth he, set you such store by this <hi>Sacas?</hi> Then <hi>Astyages</hi> answered mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in this manner, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thou not quoth he, how deftly and featly he doth his office?
for, the Cup-bearers of these Kings, be very neate and fine in powring in the wine
with a singular grace: bearing the<note n="*" place="margin">Or boll.</note> Cup also with three fingers so handsomely, that
as they deliuer it into the hands of him that shall drinke thereof, hee may receive it
with greatest facility. Why? quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> commaund <hi>Sacas</hi> good Grandfather to
put the Cup likewise into my hands, that I also serving you with wine right decently,
may if I can, win your grace and favour. Whereupon, <hi>Astyages</hi> willed him to give
the Cup unto <hi>Cyrus;</hi> which when he had received, he rinsed it as featly as he had seene
<hi>Sacas</hi> doe it; and so with a setled countenance hee brought it to his Grandfather and
gave it him so curiously with such a seemely gesture, that he set both his Mother and
<hi>Astyages</hi> alaughing full heartily. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe taking up a laughter for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
ran unto his Grandfather and kissed him, saying with all, Thou art utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
<hi>Sacas,</hi> for I am like to thrust thee out of thy honorable place. For, as in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
I shall powre out wine better than thou, so when I do it, I will not drinke it off,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19319:15"/>
my selfe. For, these Kings Cup-bearers when they present a cup of wine, powre
some of it forth into a taster which they hold in their left hand, and so take the
assay and drink it off, to the end that if they had conveyed poyson into the Cup,
they might not escape themselves without a mischiefe. Hereupon <hi>Astyages,</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to make some sport with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> And why, quoth he, unto him, dost thou
imitate <hi>Sacas</hi> in all points else, but drankest not the wine as he did? Because, said
he, I feared that poyson was mixed therewith in the goblet. For, when upon
your birth-day you feasted your<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> friends, I perceived evidently, that he pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
forth unto you all, very poyson. And how knewest thou that, quoth he, my
Sonne? For-sooth, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because I saw you distempered both in body and
minde. For, first, looke what ye forbid us children to doe, that did yee your
selves: yee did set up a cry, and howted all at once together: yee fell to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and that very ridiculously, and whom yee heard not to sing at all, ye would
not sticke to sweare, that he fung passing well. Moreouer, when every one of
you bragged of his owne strength and valour, no sooner rose yee vp to daunce,
but (so farre were yee from keeping the measures) that unneth ye were able to
stand vpright on your feet. So that yee all forgat your selves, you, that you
were a King, and the rest that they were your subjects. And then learned I first,
that this which you then did, was that very<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> liberty of free speech, which
alloweth every man to speake indifferently his mind. And, to say a truth, your
tongues neuer lay still. Why? quoth <hi>Astyages</hi> then, Tell mee my sonne, when
thy father drinketh wine, is hee not drunken otherwhiles? No truly, answered
<hi>Cyrus.</hi> But how doth he order the matter, quoth <hi>Astyages,</hi> that he continueth
sober? Truly, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he drinketh so, as that hee allayeth his thirst onely
and in so doing, other harme hee feeleth none: For hee hath no <hi>Sacas,</hi> I trow,
Grandfather, to fill him wine. Hereat inferred his mother and said, What is the
reason my sonne, that thou art so heauy a friend to <hi>Sacas</hi> and thus set against
him? To tell troth, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because I hate him in my heart; for, many
times when I am desirous to runne unto my Grandfather, this fellow (most
lewd and wicked varlet as he is) puts mee backe. But I beseech you good
Grandfather, giue mee the command ouer him, but three daies. And after what
sort said <hi>Astyages,</hi> wilt thou exercise thy authoritie vpon him? Stand I will,
quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in the very entry, where he is wont to stand, and when he would
come in to dinner, Backe Sirra will I say, There is no ingresse for you yet unto
your dinner: My Grandfather is busie in giving audience unto certaine persons.
Againe, when he commeth to supper, I will say, Hee is now bathing of him.
And if I see, that very faine he would eat, I will tell him that my Grandfather
is even then with the<note n="*" place="margin">

himselfe useth to delude and delay mee, keeping mee backe from accesse to your

while. But in the day time, if he perceiued that either his Grandfather, or Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
by the Mothers side, had a minde to any thing, hard it was for any other to
prevent him, in effecting the same: For, exceeding glad was <hi>Cyrus</hi> to gratifie

               <head type="sub">How the Queene Mother Mandane returned into Persia, and Cyrus abode behind in

Armes: and with his owne hand killed many wild beasts.</head>
               <p>NOw when <hi>Mandane</hi> addressed her selfe to returne unto her husband,
<hi>Astyages</hi> besought her to leave <hi>Cyrus</hi> with him: But shee made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
againe, That willing shee was indeed to satisfie her father in all
things, howbeit she thought it hard, to leave the childe behind her against his

wilt tarry here with me: First and formost, for accesse to me, thou shalt not be
beholden to <hi>Sacas,</hi> nor at his appointment: But whensoever thou art disposed to
enter into my chamber, it shall be as thou wilt thy selfe: and the oftner that
thou shalt repaire unto me, the more thanke will I conn thee. Againe, mine
owne horses shall be at thy commaund, yea and others as many as it pleaseth
thee to use: And when thou wilt depart, take with thee which of them thou
list. Besides, at thy suppers use thine owne diet, and take what course thou wilt
unto that which thou thinkest to stand with moderate sobriety. Moreover, I
bestow upon thee all wild beasts that now be in my Parke, and others will I get
together for thee of all kinds: which, so soone as ever thou hast learned to ride
an horse perfectly, thou shalt chace at thy pleasure, and by shooting and darting
overthrow, like as tall and mighty men are wont to doe. Furthermore, I will
appoint certaine young Gentlemen to bee thy play-feers: And in one word,
whatsoeuer thy mind stands to, say but the word to me and thou shalt not faile
but have it. After that <hi>Astyages</hi> had thus said to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> his mother asked him,
whether he would stay or depart? who without any study vpon the point, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
readily, That tarry he would. And being demaunded againe of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
wherefore? This (by report) was his answer: Because, Mother, at home,
as I am indeed, so men repute me, of all my companions for shooting and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the very best. But here, I know full well, that in riding I come short of all
my fellowes: which thing, I would you knew, Mother, how it greeveth me not a
little: Now, if you leave mee here behind you, that I may learne the feate of
Horse-manship, when I am come among the <hi>Persians,</hi> I suppose you thinke, I
shall soone surpasse them (as good as they are) in foot-man-ship: and if I returne
hither unto the <hi>Medians,</hi> I shall endeavour, being of many good horsemen, the
best my selfe and most excellent, to aide my Grandfather in his warres. Then
replyed his mother, But how, my sonne, shalt thou learne Iustice here, seeing thy
Preceptors be there [in <hi>Persia</hi>]? Why Mother quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I am therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
enough already: And how knowest thou that? said <hi>Mandane:</hi> Forsooth,
quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because my Schoole-Master, taking me for one very well and
throughly seene in Iustice, appointed me to be a Iudge over others: And verily
in deciding one time a certaine controversie, I was well beaten, because I gaue
not sentence aright: <hi>And such a case it was as this. A great boy having a little
coat, disrobed another boy, who being but small had a large coat: and when he had so
done, put upon that boy his owne coat, and with the others clad himselfe.</hi> I therefore
sitting as Iudge upon this matter betweene them, gave judgement in this wise,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19319:16"/>
That for both parties it was better, to have either of them, the garment that fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. But my Master did whip me for my labour: saying withall, that if
I were made a Iudge in question of that which is meet and fit for any person, I
ought to proceed in that sort: But when I am to determine whose coat it is?
then I must consider which is the rightfull possession? and whether it be reason
for him to enjoy it, who having taken it away by violence, holdeth it so; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for him, who either caused it to be made for himselfe, or else bought it with
his owne money? he added moreover and said, That a thing was then just, when
it was lawfull: and whatsoever was unlawfull, the same also was to be reputed
violent: and finally, hee concluded, that a Iudge ought alwaies to give defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
sentence according to the law. And even so, Mother, I say to you, that in
matters of Iustice I am perfect enough and sufficiently practised: but if in any
point I be defective, my Grandsire here shall and will teach me and supply my
wants. But sonne, quoth she, The same things are not all deemed just by your
Grandfather here, which among the <hi>Persians</hi> be received so. For here in <hi>Media,</hi>
he hath made himselfe the absolute Lord of all that the <hi>Medes</hi> have: whereas
among the <hi>Persians,</hi> to keep equality is held to be just. Againe, your Father,
what prescript rules are ordained in the State, receiveth the same, and is the first
himselfe that observeth them: So that, the rule and measure which he goeth by,
is not his owne lust and will, but the Law. Take heed therefore my child, that
thou be not skourged to death at home, when thou art returned thither, having
learned of him here, in stead of Princely government, Lordly tyranny: the very
nature and property whereof is this, To thinke it reason for to have and hold
more than all others besides. Never feare that, good Mother, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> The
King your father here is very wise and skilfull, that hee can teach one to have
lesse rather then covet more. For see you not, how he hath brought even all the
<hi>Medes</hi> to this passe, as to hold lesse than himselfe? Be sure therefore Mother,
that your Father will so schoole me, that when he sendeth me away, I shall be
instructed as well as all the rest, not to cover for to possesse more than others
Many such speeches and discourses as these, passed from <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Well, at the last,
<hi>Mandane</hi> his Mother tooke her leave and departed: but <hi>Cyrus</hi> remained behind,
and had there his bringing up.</p>
               <p>Quickly grew he into acquaintance with his companions, so as hee became
very inward with them: Soone also did he wind himselfe into the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their fathers, both by going unto them, and also by shewing what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he bare to their children: in so much, as if they themselves had any suit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King, they would bid their children to request <hi>Cyrus</hi> to take upon him for
to dispatch their businesse: And <hi>Cyrus</hi> for his part (such was his courtesy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of honour) tooke no greater pleasure in the world, when these children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
ought, than to speed their suits. Neither had <hi>Astyages</hi> the power to
deny any request that <hi>Cyrus</hi> made, but was ready to satisfie him therein. For,
when it hapned that the King was sicke, he would never depart from him, nor
give over weeping: that every man might well perceive, how exceedingly he
feared, lest his Grandfather should die. And if <hi>Astyages</hi> called for any thing
in the night whereof he stood in need, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was the first that heard him: start
he would up, and of all others make greatest haste to minister vnto him such
things as he thought might please him: whereby he wonne <hi>Astyages</hi> his heart
and was every way gracious with him. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> to say a truth, was peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19319:17"/>
somwhat talkative and too ful of words: partly by reason of his education,
For that he was enforced by his schoolemaster to render a reason of all his own
doings, and to require as much of others, when he sat in Iudgement: and in part,
because (being as he was desirous of knowledge) he would ever both himselfe
be inquisitive asking many questions of them that were in place, how the world
went with them? and also, whatsoever others demaunded of him (such was the
quicknesse of his wit,) he had alwaies his answer ready for them: So that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
all these causes, he had gotten to himselfe an habit of loquacity and
much prattle. But like as in their bodies, who being very young, are shot up,
and growne to great stature above their age, there appeareth neverthelesse a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vigorous youthfulnesse that bewraies their tender yeeres: even so out of all
the lavish language that <hi>Cyrus</hi> used, there was seene no audaciousnesse, but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and loving behaviour. So as any man would haue desired, still to heare
him speake more and more, rather than to be with him when he held his peace.
Howbeit, when in processe of time, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was growen both in body and yeeres
toward a young mans estate, he not onely used fewer words and shorter speech,
but tooke himselfe also to a more still and lower voice. So bashfull likewise he
was, that he would blush whensoever he met with any elderly persons. That
overmuch forwardnesse also of his, in fawning upon every man and preasing into
all companies, like unto wanton whelps, he shewed nothing so much now, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
whereby he became more stayed by farre, and neverthelesse in all meetings
right lovely and passing well accepted. For, truly, what games and exercises
soever companions are wont many times to practise one against another, looke
in which hee knew himselfe better than other young Gentlemen his fellowes,
therein he never chalenged them: but wherein he wist full well that he was the
weaker, he would be sure to begin first, and give out withall, that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the same better than they. Yea he assayed first before all others to vault
and mount on horsebacke, to shoot also and dart from his horse. Went he any
time away with the worse? very pleasant he was and laughed at himselfe most
of all: By reason therefore, that when hee had once the foyle, hee would not
shrinke and give over cleane, but still assay and practise eftsoones to doe better
and better, those feats wherein he was inferiour: in short time he became as
good a rider as his fellowes: within a while also (such was his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervent affection
to the thing) he outwent and excelled them all. To conclude, within a little
space, what with chacing, shooting and killing those beasts which were in the
parke, he made such havocke, that he destroyed them all; insomuch as <hi>Astyages</hi>
could not get together for him more game. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, perceiuing that his
Gradsire was not able, would he never so faine, to furnish him with beasts alive,
many times said thus unto him, What need you Grandfather to trouble your
selfe so much as you doe, in seeking wild beasts? If you will send me forth on
hunting with mine Vnkle [<note n="*" place="margin">His mothers brother.</note> 
                  <hi>Cyaxares</hi>] I will suppose, that every beast which I
shall see, you keep up and nourish for me. And in very truth exceeding desirous
though he was to goe abroad into the forrest, yet could he not now any more be
so bold and forward as before-time, when he was a child, but held off and tooke
good leasure to come unto his Grandfather for to get leave: So that wherein
hereto fore he complained of <hi>Sacas</hi> for not suffering him to go unto his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he was therein become a <hi>Sacas</hi> to controll himselfe. For hee would not
venture to presse in, unlesse he foresaw that the time served thereto: yea he would
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19319:17"/>
not sticke to desire <hi>Sacas</hi> to doe him the favour, as alwayes to signifie unto him,
when he might have the opportunity of accesse, and when not? And therefore
this <hi>Sacas</hi> now loved him passing well, like as all others did. Now when <hi>Astya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
knew once that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had such an ardent desire to hunting abroad in the
Chace, he sent him forth together with his said Vnkle: and appointed a guard of
certaine auncient Gentlemen of the Court, who also were on horsebacke, with
speciall charge to keepe him out of daungerous places, and to save him from sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
beasts, if haply any of them should be put up. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore was very
inquisitive of these warders that attended upon him, what kind of beasts they
were, which he might not approach nor meddle with, as also which hee might
be bold to hunt? Who told him, that Beares, Lions, wild Boares and Libards
had slaine already many a man adventuring to come over nigh unto them: But
Harts and Hinds, Bucks and Does, wild Sheep and wild Asses, said they, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
daungerous to be dealt withall. They added moreover and said, that the
difficulties of some places were to be taken heed of, no lesse than the very beasts:
For, many men, horse and all (said they) have heretofore fallen downe headlong
from steep rocks and so perished. <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave good eare and willingly conceived
all these advertisements: Howbeit, no sooner had he espied an Hind on foot, but
forgetting all that he had heard, hee made after her, looking to nothing in the
world else, but whither she made way and fled. In so much as his horse under
him, leaping forward, I wot not how, fell upon his knees, and went very neere
to have cast him over his necke: neverthelesse <hi>Cyrus</hi> made meanes, though it
were with much adoe, to sit him still, and so the horse recovered. But so soone
as he was come into the open field, he picked his dart and overthrew the Hinde,
a goodly faire beast, I assure you, and a large: whereat himselfe verily rejoyced
exceeding much: but his Governours and those of the guard aforesaid, came ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to him apace, all to rated and rebuked him, shewing to what perill he had
exposed himselfe, and saying withall that they would tell his Grandfather of
him. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore who by this time was alighted from his horse, stood still,
as one much grieved and troubled in his mind, to heare such words. But when
he heard the cry, he leapt presently on horsebacke againe, as one beside himselfe
and in a fanaticall fit: and so soone as ever he saw a wild Bore affronting him, he
ran against it, launced his jav'lin, and tooke his aime so right, that he struck him
in the forehead, astonied the beast, overthrew him and gat the upper hand of
him. Then, his Vnkle also seeing his adventurous rashnesse reproved him: who
notwithstanding his rebukes and checks, requested him, that he might with his
good leave, carry whatsoever himselfe had gotten, unto his Grandfather and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
him therewith. But his Vnkle made, as they say this answer, Your Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
if he should know that you chaced these Beasts in proper person, would
not only chide you, but reprove me also for suffering you: let him skourge me
too, and spare not, quoth he againe, if it be his pleasure, when I have once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
them vpon him: And even you, Vnkle, may likewise chastice me, if
you will, and as you list, so you gratifie me first in this my request. Well, quoth
<hi>Cyaxares</hi> then at length, doe as you will your selfe, for now already you seeme
to be a King over us. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> presented the beasts and gave them to his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
saying withall, that he had hunted the said venison for his sake. As for
his darts hee shewed them not openly unto him, howbeit all bloody as they
were, he bestowed them in such a place where he thought his Grandfather should
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19319:18"/>
see them. Then said <hi>Astyages</hi> unto him, I accept my sonne gladly at your hands
whatsoever you give me: but I stand in no such need of any of these things, that
you should hazard your selfe therefore. Why then Sir, quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> againe, if
you need them not, I humbly beseech your Grace, to bestow them upon me, that
I may deale them among my companions. Take them, my Sonne, quoth <hi>Asty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,</hi>
and give not onely the same, but whatsoever else you will desire, to whom
you please. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke them, and gave them among the boies such as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
saying thus withall, How trifled we my lads, when wee hunted the deere
empaled within the parke? for mine owne part, I thinke it all one, as if a man
should course beasts in a<note n="*" place="margin">Or, pinfold.</note> prison. And why? First they were enclosed within
a streight place: then, they seemed but small, leane and mangy: some halt and

and medowes, how faire, how great, how fresh and slick seeme they? The Harts
and Hinds, like so many winged foules, were so fleet, that they mounted aloft
toward the skie: and the wild Bores gave assault, in manner, as one would say, of
hardy and valiant men: so large and broad withall, that a man could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
misse them. Certes, in my conceit, these beasts here of the Forest lying
starke dead, make a goodlier shew, than those immured within a pale or wall,
for all they be alive. But how thinke you sirs quoth he, will your fathers give
you leave to go on hunting? Yea, and that right soone, said they, if King <hi>Asty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages</hi>
would but commaund. Which of all you then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> will moove
the matter to the King? Who, said they, is better able to perswade and speed
than your selfe? As for me quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by <hi>Iuno</hi> I sweare, I wot not to what
passe I am brought. For neither can I speake ought, not able am I any more so
much as to looke my Grandfather in the face, as I was wont to doe. And if I
grow on still after this fashion, I feare me that I shall proove altogether some
blockish coward or starke foole. And yet when I was but a little child, mee
thought I had tongue enough, and could speake, none so well. Why then said
the boyes againe, by your saying, it goes hard with us, in case you can do nothing
in our behalfe, if we should stand in need, but that we must seeke unto some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for to effect that, which lyeth in you to doe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> at these words being
much agrieved and vexed at the heart, departed from them in silence: and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
himselfe with boldnesse, hee went in to his Grandfather. Now when
he had waited his time, and cast with himselfe how he might without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and displeasure addresse his speech unto him, for the obtaining of his and the
boyes suit, in this manner he began, Tell me, good Grandsire quoth he, if any
one of your houshold servants ran away, and you should catch him againe, in
what sort would you intreat him? How else, quoth he, but imprison him, and
force him to worke as a slave in yrons? yea, but say, he returned of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord?
after what manner would you deale with him then? what should I doe,
but after I had skourged him, that he might doe no more so, use him againe as I
did before? Then were it high time, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for you to be provided for to
whip me, who have a purpose to run away, and to take with me my fellowes on
hunting. Well, quoth <hi>Astyages,</hi> it is honestly done of you yet, to give me war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
for now I commaund you not to stirre one foot out of dores: A trim and
goodly matter it were indeed, if I for a little piece or two of hunted flesh, should
bereave my daughter of her sonne. Vpon these words <hi>Cyrus</hi> obeyed indeed and
tarried at home; howbeit with a sad and heavie countenance he continued silent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19319:18"/>
and would not speake a word. <hi>Astyages</hi> then per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eiving how hee sorrowed, as
one much discontented; yet minding to please him againe, had him forth into the
chace: And having assembled a great number both foot and horse, together
with the boyes also, and caused the wild beasts to bee driven together into the
plains commodious for the horsemen, he made of it a great day of hunting. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
also in person all royally beseene was present, and gave streight commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
that no man should be so hardy as to shoot and strike a beast before that
<hi>Cyrus</hi> had his fill thereof. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> not able to endure that others should be
thus forbidden, Grandsire, quoth he, if you would have me to make a pleasure
of my hunting, suffer all those that are about me here, to chase, to strive, and do
their best. Then <hi>Astyages</hi> gave them all leave: And himselfe stood still and beheld
how egrely they encountred the beasts, how they contended for the better, how
they pursued them in chace and piked their darts at them: Great delight he took
in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who for very joy could not hold his tongue, but like a whelp of a good
kind, set up a cry, when he drew neere unto any beast, and therewith encouraged
and called to every one by name. He rejoyced moreover to see how <hi>Cyrus</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at one, and to heare how he praysed another, without any shew at all of repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
envie. But in the end <hi>Astyages</hi> departed, with a great prey of many beasts.
And from thence forward (such pleasure he had in this hunting) hee would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
when his leasure served goe forth with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> yea and for <hi>Cyrus</hi> sake, take
the youths aforesaid abroad, among many others beside. And verily after this
manner spent <hi>Cyrus</hi> the most part of the time; wherein his carriage was such, that
as he procured some contentment and good to all men, so he wrought no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
nor harme to any.</p>

               <p>NOw when hee was about the age of fifteene or sixteene yeers, it hapned
that the Kings sonne of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> being upon the point of marriage,

                  </note> deere (for by reason of the warres, they were spared and not
of long time hunted) he had a mind now to hunt there. To the end therefore
that he might follow his game in more safety, he tooke with him, many of his
light horsemen, and targatiers, who should out of the rough thickets put out
the beasts for him, and drive them into the tilled grounds and open plaines. And
being come as farre as to his frontier Forts, and where he had a garrison, there
he supped; that early the morrow morning he might hunt. Now by that time
it was evening, there were come out of the city both horsemen and footmen, to
succeed in place of the former garrison. So that now he supposed himselfe to
be furnished with a great army, as having two garrisons in readinesse, besides
the foot and horse which himselfe had brought with him. Vpon good delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
therfore, he thought it best to make an incursion and raise booty out of the
<hi>Medes</hi> ground; for that thereby, as the pastime of hunting would seeme more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19319:19"/>
brave and gallant, so he thought hee should have greater store of beasts to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Betimes therfore in the morning, he did set forward with his power in this
order. His footmen he left thicke embattayled upon the borders: himselfe with
his Cavallery advanced toward the fortresses of the <hi>Medes,</hi> where he stayed with
the best men of armes and those in number most, whom he kept about him, that
the garrison soldiours of the <hi>Medes</hi> might not make head upon his Avantcourri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as they stragled and overran the confines: as for the light horsmen nimbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
he sent certein forth out of every band to make rodes, some one way,
some another, with commandement, to overspread every place, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came within their reach, to drive the same to his hand. Which service they
performed accordingly.</p>
               <p>When advertisement was giuen to King <hi>Astyages</hi> that enemies were already
entred into his land, both himselfe in person went forth with such as were about
him to relieve the marches, and his sonne also, with such a troupe of horsemen
as were in readinesse accompanied him. Not forgetting withall to send out his
commissions to all others, for to come forward in aid. The <hi>Medes</hi> when they
saw a great power of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> arraunged in good order, together with their
men of armes keeping their ground and not stirring, made also a stand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And <hi>Cyrus</hi> for his part, seeing others on all sides, ready to set forth in
defence of the Frontiers, did the same likewise. Which was the first time that
ever he put harneis on his backe (a thing not permitted him before to do) so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
was he to be armed: and truly a very fayre armour it was and well befitting
him, which his Grandfather had caused to be made compleat for his body. Thus
armed at all peeces, and mounted upon a goodly courser, hee rode forward to
the service. <hi>Astyages</hi> seeing this, albeit he mervayled much at whose commaund
he came, yet required he him to abide with him and not to stirre one foot. <hi>Cyrus</hi>
then, so soone as he discovered a number of horsemen afront, demaunded say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Be those yonder, our enemies Grandfather, who sit still upon their horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs
so quietly? yea quoth he, enemies they are. And what are they a farre
off that ride and drive before them, quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> be they likewise enemies? yes
said <hi>Astyages</hi> and they too. Now surely Grandsire, quoth he, they seeme to be
but cowards, and to ride upon very jades and titts, who thus harry and drive
before them our goods. It were a good deed, yea and uery requisite, that some of
us made a rode out after them. Yea, but see you not my Child (answered he)
what a strong troupe of great horse and men of armes, standeth on a plump in
battell-ray? who if we should make after those, would intercept us by the way
and stop our passage: besides, our forces are not yet come together. But if you
will tarry here, replyed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and receive such as are comming hither to aide;
those that stand still hereby, will be afraid and not once dare to quetch: those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also who are driving booties, will immediately forgoe their prey, upon the
very sight of some that charge upon them. Having thus said, he seemed unto
<hi>Astyages</hi> for to speake somewhat to the purpose. Who wondring withall at his
prudent forecast, and vigilant circumspection, commaunded [<hi>Cyaxares</hi>] his sonne
to take a Cornet of horsemen, for to set forward, and to charge those that were
a boot-haling. And I for my part quoth <hi>Astyages</hi> will make head at these here,
if they once seeme to stirre and advance against you: so that they shall be forced
to have a watchfull eye unto us. Thus <hi>Cyaxares</hi> taking with him the valiantest
men and best mounted, did put forwards. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> so soone as he perceived
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19319:19"/>
them to come on, speedily breaketh out with them; and long it was not but
himselfe was the foremost of the troup, and led them all a great pace: <hi>Cyaxares</hi>
followed hard, and the rest were nothing behind. Whom, when they that drave
the booty saw to approach, incontinently they abandoned all and fled. But the
company about <hi>Cyrus</hi> intercepted them: and whomsoeuer they could ouertake
and reach, they wounded out of hand, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> was the foremost: but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as ouerrode them and escaped their hands, those they pursued hotely, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
gave over untill they had taken some of them prisoners. And like as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Hound, untrained yet and without experience, runneth all on the head rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the wild Bore: Even so for all the world, rode <hi>Cyrus</hi> upon the spurre,
looking at this onely, how he might strike whomsoeuer he could overtake, and
regarded nothing els. The enemies seeing their fellowes thus distressed and in jeo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

came forward with their maine troupe, supposing that the chace would
ceasse, if they were seene once to advance toward them. As for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he slac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
never a whit the more, but for joy called upon his unkle, to hold on and
maintaine the chace still. And for that he had gotten the upper hand, he did put
the enemies to an exceeding great rout. And verily, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> [the yonger] for his
part, followed, haply for a reverent regard of his father: the rest likewise came
after, being then more willing by such an example to make pursuit, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
were not very courageous nor resolute to encounter the enemy. <hi>Astyages</hi>
perceiving them inconsiderately to follow on still, and the enemies many in
number, and those in good order of battaile redy to confront and receive them:
being affrayd withall in the behalfe of his owne sonne and of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> lest they

themselves, directly led against the enemies: who on the other side per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
the <hi>Medes</hi> making towards them, stood still, some with their darts redy
to lance, others with bowes and arrowes bent to shoot, and so kept their ground:
supposing that the other likewise would stay and stand, so soone as they came
within shot, according as they were wont to doe. For, their manner was, thus
neere and no more to approach one another, and so many a time to skirmish on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with shot at randam even untill night. But now seeing their owne men to flye
unto them amaine, and therewith the souldiers about <hi>Cyrus</hi> pursuing them fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hard at heeles, and <hi>Astyages</hi> likewise with his Cauallery, already within arrow
shot, they declined from them at one side and fled: The other, who also at once
followed in chace, tooke many of them by force one with another: and whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they caught, downe they went, both horse and man, killing and slaying
all that fell: and never gave over the execution untill they came as farre as to the
<hi>Assyrians</hi> Infantery: And there verily, for feare of some greater ambushment
in covert, to intercept and cut them off, they stayed themselves. Then <hi>Astyages</hi>
retired with his forces, as right joyfull for the horsemens victory: But of <hi>Cyrus</hi>
he wist not what to make or say: For, well he knew, that he was the chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of this exploit: but he saw withall, how in all the service, for his audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
adventure he fared like unto one furiously transported. For, even at that
time I assure you, when others were returning homeward, he onely did nothing
els but ride up and downe all about, to view them that were ouerthrowne and
slaine: in so much as hardly could they (who had commission so to doe) hale
him away and bring him to <hi>Astyages:</hi> and even those who had the conducting of
him, he caused to goe a great way before, for that he perceiued his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers

countenance at the sight of him, to be sterne and terrible. And thus pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
these things in <hi>Media.</hi> As for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as he was rise in every mans mouth,
whiles they ceassed not to say and sing all praises of him: So <hi>Astyages,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime
highly honoured and esteemed him, had him now in exceeding great

               <head type="sub">How Cyrus returned to his father into Persia: and what honour the
Medes did him at his departure.</head>
               <p>THEN <hi>Cambyses</hi> the father of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> hearing this report that went of him,
joyed thereat, you may be sure, not a little: but for that he heard that
<hi>Cyrus</hi> had atchieved manly Acts alredy, hee sent for him home, to the
end that he might performe those parts which by the discipline of the <hi>Persians</hi>
were required. Whereupon <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by report, said, that depart he would, because
his father should not be offended, nor his countrey and the State complaine and
finde fault with him. <hi>Astyages</hi> therefore thought it requisite and necessary to
send him away: and having bestowed upon him such horses as it pleased him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to take, and furnished him besides with all things for that purpose, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
dismissed him: which he did, both because he loved him, as also for
that he conceived withall a great hope of him, that he would prove a man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day, sufficient both to pleasure and helpe his friends, and also to displease
and hurt his enemies.</p>
               <p>Now was <hi>Cyrus</hi> at his departure accompanied on the way with all sorts and
degrees, as well boyes and such as were of his owne yeeres, as men and Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
all on horsebacke: yea and <hi>Astyages</hi> himselfe rode onward with him: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there any one, as it is sayd, but at his returne homeward wept amaine.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> also is reported to have shed many a teare at his farewell: Moreouer, men
say, that among his equalls in age and companions, he dealt many of those gifts
which <hi>Astyages</hi> had bestowed upon him. In conclusion, the very <hi>Median</hi> Robe
which he then ware, he did put off, and gave it unto one, declaring thereby that
he loved him especially above the rest. Who when they had received these gifts
at his hands, presented them all, as they say, unto <hi>Astyages:</hi> and <hi>Astyages</hi> when
he had them, sent them backe unto <hi>Cyrus:</hi> but he returned them eft-soones into
<hi>Media,</hi> delivering this message withall, If you would ever have mee, ô Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
to repaire unto you againe without the blemish of shame and disgrace,
suffer each one to have and hold that which I have given them: which words
when <hi>Astyages</hi> heard, he did according to the said message. And, if I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
some merry speeches, and amorous words also that passed among, the
voyce goeth, that at <hi>Cyrus</hi> departure, when they tooke their leave one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Cyrus</hi> dismissed his kinsmen with a kisse of his lips, after the <hi>Persian</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
for it is the fashion among the <hi>Persians</hi> even at this day so to doe. At which
time there was one of the <hi>Medes</hi> a right good and an honest Gentleman, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
well a long while, the exceeding beautie of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and wondered thereat:
who when he saw his other kinsmen to kisse him, he himselfe stood still and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not. No sooner were the rest gone, but he came unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> and said, What
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19319:20"/>
                  <hi>Cyrus!</hi> Am I the only man whom you know not for your kinsman? Why,
quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> are you also of kinne to mee? Yea surely that I am saith the other.
This was it quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that you eyed me so: For mee thought I marked you
oftentimes so to doe. True said the other: and as desirous as I was, all the while
to come unto you, yet God so mee helpe, for very bashfulnesse I ever held off
But you should not have so done, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being a cousin of mine: and with
that he came unto him and kissed him. The <hi>Mede</hi> when he had this kisse, asked
him and said, Is this the manner indeed of the <hi>Persians,</hi> for kinsmen thus to
kisse one another? Yea verily, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> both at meeting when they have
not seene one another a certaine time, and also at parting when they take then
leave and goe forth any whither. Then it is time now saith the <hi>Mede,</hi> that you
give mee another kisse. For even now as you see, am I to depart. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kissed him the second time, bade him farewell and went himselfe away
They had not ridden farre asunder on their journey, but the <hi>Mede</hi> returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with his horse under him all sweating and in a lather: whom when <hi>Cyrus</hi>
saw, what! saith he, have you forgotten any thing that you would have said to
meee? No verily answered the other, but after a time, I am come as you see unto
you. True indeed, cousin, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you are so, and that after a very short
time. What short time answered the <hi>Mede</hi> is that? wote you not, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that
if I doe but winke never so little, I thinke the time very long, for that I see you
not the while, being so gallant a young Gentleman as you are? Hereat <hi>Cyrus</hi>
began to laugh (and the first time it was, after his former weeping) saying
withall unto him, Goe your wayes and be of good cheere: For shortly the
time will come, when you may behold mee if you will, with your eyes broad
open and neuer winke for the matter.</p>
               <p>

that if there were any great cheere upon some high and festivall day, he could
finde in his heart to give away unto others some of his owne part, rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
any of others: when they perceived besides, that in all other things <hi>Cyrus</hi>
farre excelled them, then his companions began to have him againe in great
esteemation. When hee had passed through this first discipline, and was now
entred into the ranke of young-men: therein also hee seemed to surmount all

               <p>BVr in processe of time <hi>Astyages</hi> [the King] dyed in <hi>Media:</hi> and <hi>Cyaxares
Astyages</hi> his sonne, and brother to <hi>Cyrus</hi> Mother, succeeded in the Empire
of the <hi>Medes.</hi> Then the King of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> who had vanquished all the

and brought him to his obedience, and who held already the <hi>Hyrcanians</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
under his subjection, and now warred upon the <hi>Bactrians</hi> and besieged their
cities, thought this with himselfe, that if he could once conquer the <hi>Medians</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
or weaken their estate, he might soone become the absolute Monarch of all
the neighbour countries round about him. For, this Nation, of all the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
was reputed most puissant. Sending therefore unto his owne subjects, and
to those who were under his alleageance: likewise to <hi>Croesus</hi> King of the <hi>Lydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and to the King of the <hi>Cappadocians:</hi> to the inhabitants of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> both the
one and the other, to the <hi>Carians, Paphlagonians,</hi> to the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Cilicians,</hi> he
layd open unto them many grievous imputations against the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi>
alleadging, how great and mighty these States were, how they combined and
linked themselves together by mutuall marriages: and in a word, were so knit
and united in perpetuall league and amity, that unlesse some one arose by good
forecast to prevent their growth and abate their force, great daunger there was,
that they would invade one nation after another, and so subdue them all. These
Princes and States therefore, partly perswaded by these his suggestions, and in
part inveagled by his presents and money, whereof he had exceeding store, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
and entred into association with him. But <hi>Cyaxares Astyages</hi> his sonne,
perceiving what traines were laid and purveyance addressed against him; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

his brother in law, who had married his sister and raigned King of <hi>Persia.</hi> Hee
sent also to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> requesting him that in case the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and was reckoned in the ranke of men full growne. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore having well
approoved the motion, was by the Elders (Councellers of the State) elected

to choose unto him 200. Gentlemen as Peeres called<note n="*" place="margin">That is, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall dignity.</note> Homotimi. Also every

every one of this thousand they granted for to levy from out of the common
people of the <hi>Persians,</hi> 10. light targuatiers, ten slingers, and tenne archers. By
which meanes, over and above the thousand Peeres or Gentlemen aforesaid,
there were in all ten thousand Archers, ten thousand Targuatiers, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

who was no sooner chosen, but forthwith he began devoutly at the service of

               <p>
                  <q>MY friends, chosen you I have, not as one who had good proufe of you
at this present and not before: but in that I have seene, even from your
Child-hood, with what alacrity you travaile in those things which
the Common-wealth reputeth vertuous: and utterly abandon such as it dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vicious. But what motives induced me not unwillingly both to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
this high place of government, as also to call you forth into the Action,
I am now minded to declare unto you. Thus much I observe, that our Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
have in nothing beene inferiour unto us, as who evermore practised
the deeds of vertue: But what benefit they have acquired being so brave men
as they were, either in publike to the <hi>Persians</hi> Common-weale, or in private to
their owne estates, I cannot yet perceive. For, surely, in mine opinion, men
give not their minds to exercise any vertue for this end, that when they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
good and honest, they should in nothing be preferred above the wicked.
And even they that forbeare the fruition of pleasures presented unto them,
doe it not because they would never joy any more: but, for that by such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
behaviour, they might in future time attaine to many and sundry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.
They that desire to excell in eloquence, aime not in all their studies and
meditations to this end, that they should never give ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the eloquent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of causes: but their hope is, that when they have by their fine tongues
perswaded men to their minds, they may to themselves purchase many great
and goodly availes. Moreover, Martiall men that are emploid in feats of
Armes, take not all this their paines, never to make an end of fighting: but
even these men also, set this downe to themselves, that being once come to
perfection in military prowesse, they shall win both to themselves and to their
countrey much wealth, much happinesse and great honours. Now, if any
men after their great toyle in these affaires, before they reaped any fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
have carelessely suffered themselves to age, and thereby to grow unmeet
for warre, in my conceit they fare much like, as if one desirous to be a good
and thrifty husbandman, should sow well and plant his ground as well: but
when he is to receive the encrease comming of his tillage and husbandry, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
the corne not inned, to shed, and fall againe upon the ground. Or, as
if some Champion when hee hath sustained much travaile, so as now he is
thought a worthy victour, should never after enter into the lists and performe
his devoyr. For, in my judgement, even such an one deserveth worthily to be
condemned for his folly. Let not us therefore my souldiers be faulty in this
kind: but considering we are privy to our owne hearts, and assured that even
at first from our tender yeers we have beene trained up in noble and worthy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19319:22"/>
Acts, set me forward against those enemies, whom I know most certainly, by
that which my selfe have seene in them already, to be unexpert in fight against
us. Certes, for my part, I hold not these to be able souldiers, who howsoever
they have the feat and knowledge, to shoot well, to dart likewise and ride as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
yet cannot endure any labour, but quaile when they are put unto it. But
these our enemies, for any matter of paines taking, are very raw and untrained
novices. Neither are they to be accompted good souldiers, who when they
should watch cannot away withall: and our enemies here are such, as for their
sleepe cannot of all things want it: Nor yet may they goe for good warriors,
who albeit in the points abovesaid are sufficient enough, yet be to seeke how
to carry themselves toward their friends, and how to enemies. And evident it
is that these here be altogether to learne those disciplines which in warre be of
greatest consequence. But as for you, able yee are to use the night in every
point as well as others the day: yee repute labours to be the guides leading
the way to pleasant life. Hunger yee reckon in stead of sauce<note n="*" place="margin">

yee have laid up within your hearts: in that ye take more joy in being praised,
than in all things else in the world. And they that are lovers of praise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme,

abide all daunger. Now, if I should pronounce thus much of you, thinking
and knowing otherwise, I doe but deceive my selfe: as upon whom the fault
will redownd, incase no such thing be performed by you. But verily, such is
your owne skill, your love also to me ward: such likewise is the blockish ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of our enemies, that I trust assuredly these good hopes will not faile
mee. Only let us march on in this our journey with bold and couragious
hearts: considering, it is farre from us to be thought for to covet other mens
goods unjustly: for even now, as, our enemies are comming and begin first
to deale wrongfully with us: so our friends call unto us for ayde. What
then is there either more just than to put by an injury, or more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
than to helpe our friends? Moreouer, in this regard I suppose you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
not the least confidence, because I have not enterprised this expedition,
with neglect of the Gods: For, being as yee are, privy unto many of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and much conversant with mee, yee know very well that not only in
weighty affaires, but also in smaller matters, I use alwayes to begin in the
name of the Gods. In conclusion, quoth he, what should I say more? when
you have chosen and taken unto you elect men, and are otherwise in all points

I will unto my Father, to the end that having with all speed learned of him

               <p>That the gods, my Sonne are propitious, and accompany thee with their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
favour, evident it is as well by sacrifices as celestiall tokens: and thou
thy selfe doest know as much. For, taught thee I have these matters of purpose,
partly that thou mightest know the will and counsell of the gods by no other
interpreters, but understand the same by thy selfe, seeing the sights and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the noises that are to bee seene and heard: and not depend upon wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
who might if they were disposed deceive thee, by relating other things
than were signified by the gods above: and partly because, if at any time thou
wert without a Soothsayer, thou shouldest not doubt what to resolve upon, by
those divine tokens: but observing by this skill of Divination what Gods will
is, obey the same. Surely father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> endeavour I will alwaies even
to the uttermost of my power and according to your advertisement, that the
gods being favourable unto us would ever be pleased to aduise us for the best
For, I remember, that I heard you once say, It standeth with good congruity,
that he should obtaine any thing at the gods hands as well as at mans, yea and
more easily, who doth not fawne upon them when he is in distresse: but at what
time he is in greatest prosperity, even then thinkes upon the gods most of all.
You said moreover that the same consideration of friends likewise must be had.
Certes, then my Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyses,</hi> being as thou art so devoutly affected
to the gods, thou commest unto them now at this time more willingly in that
regard, to crave their helpe, yea and thou hopest so much the rather to obtaine
whatsoever thou needest and makest petition for, because thy conscience beareth
thee witnesse that thou wert never slacke in their service. Doubtlesse, father,

What Sonne, said the Father, and doest thou remember those points, which
sometime we resolved upon? Namely, that such men are like to speed better
who have learned those sciences which are given unto us by the gods, than those
that be ignorant of the same? Againe, that by travell they shall gaine more, than
by sitting still? As also that by carefull diligence they shall live in more safety,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19319:23"/>
than if they carry themselves carelesly and take no heed? And verily thus was
then our opinion, that after this sort wee should crave good things at Gods
hands, to wit, in demeaning our selves as we ought. Truly Father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
I remember very well that I heard you deliver these lessons: and I could not
choose but of necessity yeeld my consent to those speeches and bee perswaded
thereby. Full well I wot also, what you added moreover and said, that in no
wise lawfull it was for them to crave of the gods victory in Horse-fight, who
have not learned to ride well: neither for those who be unexpert in shooting,
to pray unto the gods that they may have the better hand of cunning Archers:
ne yet for such pilots as know not how to guide the helme, to beseech the gods
they may save ships by their steering: no more than for them that never fowed
their seed to wish for a fayre crop of corne to come up; or for those who looke
not to themselves in battayle, desire the safety of their lives. For, all such [pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and wishes] verily, be against the ordinance and law of God. Semblably,
you said, that whosoever asked at Gods hands ungodly things, by as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
deserved to be said nay, as those to take a repulse who preferre unto men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
suits. But have you Sonne, forgotten those matters, quoth <hi>Cambyses,</hi>
whereof you and I sometime devised and talked together? namely, That it is a
sufficient Act for a man to performe, if he be able to procure thus much, as to be
himselfe a worthy man indeed and so reputed; and also that both he and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
may be well furnished with necessaries: And if this be so difficult a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to effect, then to have the skill, for to rule other men, so, as they may have
foison of all things needfull and be themselves likewise all, such as they ought
to be, I suppose is an admirable thing. Truly Father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
full well that this also was your saying, and therefore unto me as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you it seemed then an exceeding hard matter to Governe wel. And even now
likewise am I of the same mind considering as I do with my selfe what a piece
of worke it is to commaund. But when I looke into other men, and observe
withall, both the quality of those persons that are become Rulers, as also what
manner of concurrents and adversaries we shall find, I thinke it a foule shame to
be affraid of any such, and not willingly to oppose our selves against them: whom
I for my part (to begin first with these our friends here) perceive to bee of this
opinion, that a Prince or Ruler ought to differ from his people, and to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them, in more plentifull fare and sumptuous suppers; in having at home
better store of gold and treasure; in sleeping and lying longer abed, and in a word
in living at greater ease, and taking lesse paines than those that are under him.
Whereas I (quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi>) contrariwise am of this mind, that a Soveraigne ought
to excell his subjects, not in idlenesse of life, but in prudent forecast and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse
to endure all trauaile. True it is Sonne (quoth he) but it falleth out
otherwhiles in certaine cases, that we are to fight not against men, but even with
the very things themselves, which we cannot without great difficulty ouercome.
As for example, you know well, quoth he, that all your rule and commaund
will soone come to naught, if haply your army have not at hand sufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of necessaries. Yes, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but <hi>Cyaxares</hi> (Father) sayth he is to make
purveiance thereof to serve all those that goe from hence, how many soever
they be. And doe you indeed my Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyses,</hi> enter upon this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
trusting in these meanes of <hi>Cyaxares?</hi> Yea that I doe answered <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Why!
doe you certainly know, replyed he againe, what store of treasure he hath?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19319:23"/>
Not I, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I assure you. And give you credit neverthelesse to these
uncertainties? Or wote you not thus much, that you shall have need of many
things, and even anon be forced to spend much otherwise? Yes, full well I know
that, quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> How then, quoth <hi>Cambyses?</hi> Say that he either lacke money
and bee not able to beare the charge: or for the nonce hold you up with un
truths; where are you then, and in what case will your army be? Certes, plaine
it is, verily that it cannot be well with it. If then, Father, quoth he, you see
any way, whereby I may raise some masse of money whiles we are yet among
our friends, shew unto me the same. Aske you of me ô Sonne, quoth he, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there may be meanes wrought by you to make money? Why? who should
in all reason devise and cast about for to make provision thereof, rather than
you, who have so puissant an army to commaund? going as you doe from
hence with such a power of footmen under your hand, as I know you would
not exchange the same for another farre greater in number than it? and as for
horsemen, you shall have a troupe to joyne with you from the <hi>Medes;</hi> which of
all other in these dayes is simply the best. What neighbour nation then, thinke
you, will not bee glad both by way of gratification and also for feare of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and displeasure, to relieve you? which you and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ought joyntly
to consider and thinke upon: to the end, that at no time you bee at a fault, for
want of ought that must be had: yea and if it were but for custome sake, you are
of course to lay for meanes to bring in revenewes store. But of all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this especially, that in no wise you deferre and put off your provision,
untill very need enforce you thereto: but whereas you have most plenty, be
you carefull so much the more, to be furnished before you feele any want: For
you shall the sooner speed at their hands of whom you are to seeke reliefe, if you
seeme not to bee destitute and in need: besides, your souldiers shall have no
cause to find fault: and so by this meanes, others also will the rather have you
in reverence: your souldiers likewise so long as they have all things necessary,
will be more ready to serve, if you be disposed by the help of your army, either
to doe pleasure or displeasure unto any. And this moreover you are to know,
that your speech will carry greater credit, and be more effectuall to perswade
them, when as you shall be most able to shew that you have power enough, as,
to doe a good turne, so also to worke a mischiefe. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Me thinks Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
quoth he, that you speake all this very well unto me, as in other respects,
so in this also, that whatsoever the souldiers shall now receive, not one of them
will take himselfe beholden to mee as who know well upon what conditions
<hi>Cyaxares</hi> sendeth for them to aide him: But looke what shall come vnto them
over and above that which is set downe, the same verily will they both take as
an honour due unto themselves: and like it is by good reason also, that they
will yeeld much thanks therefore, to the giver. Furthermore, he that hath the
commaund of an army, by the which he may both doe his friends good, and so
receive for it the like benefit from them: as also endamage his enemies, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to get something from them: and then afterwards bee negligent in
purveiance of plenty and store. Thinke you this, quoth he, to be lesse shamefull
in him, than if a man who hath land of his owne, and husbandmen beside to till
the same, should yet for all that suffer his ground to lie still, and unprofitable?
And therefore, this opinion I would have you Sir to conceive of mee, that I
will never be carelesse in devising all meanes possible of provision for my soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19319:24"/>
necessaries, neither in my friends countrey nor in mine enemies. But,
beare you not in minde Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyses,</hi> what other matters we thought
upon and concluded sometimes, and those in no wise to be neglected? Yes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
quoth he, I remember them well, what time I came unto you for silver,
to pay unto one by way of reward, who said he had instructed me in the leading
of an armie: For when you gave me the said money, you questioned withall in
this manner with me. Tell mee, my Sonne, said you, whether this man to
whom you carrie this reward, among his rules of a Generall, made any mention
unto you of<note n="*" place="margin">House-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> oeconomy? For, souldiers verily have no lesse need of necessaries
for their living in the Campe, than servants in an house. And when I told you
the truth and said, that hee spake not one word at all of that point, you asked
me againe, whether hee discoursed unto me of health and bodily strength,
whereof a Grand-Commaunder should be no lesse carefull than of the conduct
of his host? And upon my denyall thereof, you demaunded of me once more,
if he had taught me any meanes whereby mine Associates fighting under mee,
might in every respect be most expert in warlike feats? And when hereto also
I answered nay: you enquired farther, whether I had learned of him how I
might encourage and cheere up mine armie? saying therwith, that in every deed,
courageous alacritie, far excelled heartlesse backwardnesse. When I had denyed
this too, you came yet stil upon me, and would needs know, what precept he had
given of this point, namely the obedience of an armie, and how a man might
best bring that to passe? And when it appeared, that there had not been a word
delivered as touching that, in the end you concluded with this question, what
one point he had taught me when he said, that he instructed me in the Art Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratory?
Vnto which when I made answer, saying, That he had trained me in
<note n="*" place="margin">The Tactiks.</note> embattailing an armie, you smiled thereat, and discoursed unto me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
to wit, what good did the embattailing of an armie to the Art<note n="*" place="margin">

without the purveiance of things necessary to live by? also what availed

made it plaine to me, that he<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>ctick skill.</note> setting of a battayle in ray was but a small part
of the<note n="*" place="margin">Of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an army.</note> art Imperatorie, and therewith I asked of you, whether you could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
me in any of those points? you willed me to goe my waies and repaire
unto military men, that were reputed expert Commaunders, and of them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how these matters each one might best be effected? Since which time I
conversed with those whom I heard to be most skilfull in these points. And
verily, as touching victuals for our campe, I am perswaded that so much will
suffice for this present occasion, as <hi>Cyaxares</hi> will provide for us. As concerning
our bodily health, because I heard and saw, how Cities such as regarded health,
make choice of cunning Physicians, whom they maintaine: and Generals of the
field also, for their soldiers sake, take Physicians forth with them in their traine,
I likewise was no sooner appointed to this charge, but presently I had a care
thereof. And I suppose, quoth he, ô father, that I have about me very expert
men in the Art of Physicke. Whereunto his Father replyed in this wise, But
these Physicians, my Sonne, whom you speake of, are much like unto certaine
botchers, that mend torne garments; For, even so, when some are fallen sicke,
then and not before they cure and heale them. But your regard of health I
would have to be much more honourable unto you: for, you are to endeavour
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19319:24"/>
and provide in the beginning that your army fall not into sicknesse: And what
course shall I take father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to performe this? At the first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
you must, quoth he, see to this, that the place be holsome, where you
purpose to abide and lye encamped a long time together; wherein you cannot
faile, if you take any heed. For, commonly men cease not in their ordinary
talke to give out which be healthy coasts and which subject to maladies; and
there be alwaies at hand certain apparent signes, to testifie and direct unto both,
to wit the very bodies and colour of the inhabitants. Moreover, it will not be
sufficient to consider the regions onely, but remember you ought also, in what
manner you endeavour to looke unto your selfe, that your owne person may
live in health. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> first of all quoth he, my principall care I assure you
is, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t I never surfait, for that is a dolourous and yrksome thing. Secondly,
with labour and travaile, I digest and worke out whatsoever is gone into my
belly: For, by this meanes I am perswaded, that I stand to health the longer,
and besides get the greater strength. And even so my Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyses,</hi>
as carefull you ought to be of others. But may Souldiours, good Father, have
leisure to exercise their bodies? Yes Iwis, quoth his father, they not onely
may, but of necessity must so doe. For an army, if it would doe as it should,
and as belongeth thereto, ought never to be at rest, but be doing still, either
working mischiefe to the enemies, or doing good to it selfe. A griefe it is my
Sonne, to nourish but one person idle, much more grievous to keep a houshold
that is sloathfull: but most importable of all, to maintaine a whole hoast in
idlenesse. Many things there bee in an army, (to begin at the least, and so to
proceed forward) that eate and spend: and looke what they winne, they waste
excessively. And therefore in no wise is it expedient that an army should bee
idle. Your words, Father as I conceive them, imply thus much, that like as
of a sloathfull husbandman there ariseth no profit, even so of an idle Generall
can never come good. But I vndertake quoth he, that an industrious Captaine,
unlesse some God do crosse him, will both bring to passe, that his souldiers may
have plenty of victuals and necessaries, and also provide that their bodies be
passing healthy, strong and able. To the end therefore, quoth hee, that they
may be well seene and practised in each feat of armes, I suppose, Father, that
if I publish to every one of them certaine games of prise, and propose rewards,
I shall cause them best to be exercised in each thing: that when need shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
I may finde them prest and ready for any service. That is very well said
of you Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyses.</hi> And in so doing, know this assuredly, that you
shall see you military bands alwaies studying to performe their parts, no lesse
than in daunces, to observe measures and keepe their order. Moreover, saith
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> for to make souldiers forward and courageous, there is nothing in
mine opinion more effectuall, than to have the cast to feed men with good
hopes of great availes. But this, quoth he, my Sonne, is much like for all the
world, as if a man in hunting would evermore holla to his hounds in such a
note as he useth to set up when he seeth his game. For at the first, full well I
wote, he shall have his hounds willing enough to heare and obey: but in case
he delude and deceive them often in this sort, at the last they will not beleeve
him at all, no, not when he sees the game indeed. Semblably it is in this hope
whereof you speake. If a man proposing many times unto them the expectance
of good things, deceive them, it will come to passe in the end, that when such
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19319:25"/>
an one, sheweth in truth assured hope, he shal not be able to perswade them. And
therefore, my Sonne, you ought to take heed, and spare to speake, that which
you know not for certaine. Well may other men sometime so doe, and cast out
words to that purpose: but it behooveth a Captaine to reserve his owne encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to the greatest daungers and extremities, that it may carry the most
credit. Now, beleeve me Father, me thinks you speake this very well, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so delivered, it pleaseth me better.</p>

               <head type="sub">How a Prince may gaine the obedience of his people, Vanquish his enemies,
and get the attribute of wise and vertuous.</head>
               <p>BVr how to make my souldiours obedient unto me, I thinke not Father,
that I am now to learne. For, you have taught me this your selfe, even
immediatly from mine infancie, when you enforced me to obey you.
Afterwards you recommended mee in my childhood to Schoole-masters, and
they inured me likewise to the same. Also what time I was raunged among
the young men, our Governour was very carefull and diligent in this behalfe.
Yea, and most of our lawes seeme to prescribe these two points especially,
<hi>To Rule,</hi> and <hi>To be ruled.</hi> And therefore when I consider throughly these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in generall, mee thinkes I observe thus much, that the thing which moveth
men most effectually to obedience, is, both to praise and honour him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth,
and also to disgrace and punish the disobedient. Indeed my sonne,
quoth he, this is the ready way to cause men to obey by constreint, but to make
men of their owne accord obedient (which is farre better) there is a more
compendious course to be taken. For, whom men thinke to be more wise in
procuring their owne good than themselves, him right gladly they will obey.
And this you may know to be true as in many other instances, so in sicke folke,
how forward are they, to call for Physicians that should prescribe and direct
what they ought to doe? Semblably at Sea, how cheerefully doe the passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
obey the Pilots? Likewise, looke whom men suppose to know the avenues
and waies better than themselves, how earnestly strive they to follow such
guides, and will not by their good wills be left behind? But contrariwise,
when they thinke that by obeying they shall take some harme, they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yeeld much for any punishment, nor yet be stirred up with rewards; For,
no man willingly taketh any gifts to his owne hurt. Then, Father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
your words import thus much, that there is nothing more available to keepe
subjects in obeisance, than for a Ruler to be reputed wiser than they. This is
my meaning in deed said he. But how may a man Father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> soonest
acquire such an opinion and esteeme of him selfe? There is not, my sonne, a
neerer way, saith <hi>Cambyses,</hi> than to be prudent in very deed in those things
wherein a man would be thought wise. Doe but consider hereof in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and you shall find that I say true. For, if you would be taken for a good
Husbandman, an expert horseman, a skilfull Physician, a cunning Musician, or
any such, when you are in truth nothing lesse, marke what a number of shifts
you must devise to maintaine this outward semblance? And say, that by your
perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, many men fal to praise you, to the end that therby you might raise a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19319:25"/>
glorious name of your selfe: so as you have now laid a good foundation, and
possessed every of them with a singular conceit of you: First, you should but
deceive them for the present; and soone after when you come to the triall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
what you are, and so appeare in your owne colours, a vaine boaster. But
how might a man Father, in very deed, attaine unto such wisedome, as to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
what in future time will be expedient? Truly, even thus, my sonne, said
<hi>Cambyses;</hi> If so be you study to get as much as may be had by learning, like as
you are taught already the skill of marshalling an armie. But, what things
soever men cannot learne by discipline, nor foresee by humane wisedome, if
you by divination, and oracles consult with the Gods thereabout, you shall be
wiser than other men: especially, if when you know what is best to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you be carefull withall to put the same in execution. For, to be industrio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s in
procuring of things requisite, is the part of a wiseman, rather than to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
negligent in that behalfe. Moreover to winne the love of subjects, a
point, which I hold chiefe and principall, evident it is that the same way would
be taken, as if a man desired to be loved of his friends. For, I suppose that to
effect this, he must endevour to be seene bountifull and beneficiall. A difficult
matter it is my sonne, for a man to be able alwaies to pleasure whom he would.
But to shew himselfe joyfull and ready to congratulate their good fortune, and
with them to grieve and take heavily any adverse calamitie; as also to be prest
and ready to relieve them in distresse, to be affraied aforehand least they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
to labour also to prevent and provide that they doe not stumble and fall:
in these cases, I say hee ought in some sort to goe even with them and beare
them companie.</p>
               <p>To come now to the practise of armes; If service fall out to be performed
in Summer season, a Generall must in all mens sight endure the heat of the
Sunne aboue the rest: semblably in Winter time abide most cold: and where
travaile is required, there is he to take the greatest paines: For, all these things
make much to the winning of his souldiers hearts. And say you so, Father?
quoth he, should a Captaine in deed be more painfull every way, than his men
that serve under him? Yea ywis, that is my saying. Howbeit, my sonne, be
of good cheere and be not dismayed thereat. For, know you this, that the
same labours be not in semblable bodies of a chiefe Commaunder and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
souldiour, grievous alike: both because in a Commaunder the respect of
honour maketh the travaile some-what lighter; and also for that he knoweth
whatsoever he atchieveth shall not be hidden but openly seene. But, Father,
when souldiers are now well provided of necessaries, when they be in good
health and able to travaile: when they be trained in martiall feats, and have a
kinde of ambitious humour, desirous to appeare valiant: and withall take more
pleasure to obey than to be stubborne and disobedient, thinke you not, father,
the man wise who then would make hast to encounter his enemies? Yes truly
said he, if he might get the better of them. If not, I for my part verily, as I
thought both my selfe to be in better case, and my followers also better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
so much the more would be wary and take better heed: like as all
other things that we thinke most precious and set greatest store by, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
endevour to have in best securitie. But, to get the vantage and ods of
our enimies, by what meanes Father, may one best attaine? This is no meane
point, I may tell you, my sonne, nor of small importance that you demaund of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19319:26"/>
mee. But know for certeine that who ever shall effect this, had need be a wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer,
a deepe dissembler, a craftie and fraudulent deceiver, a very theese and
greedy robber, and in one word, every way able to overtop his enimies. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<hi>Cyrus</hi> smiling, ô good God, Father, what manner of man would you by
these your words, have me to be? Even such a one, sonne, as may for all that,
be right-just, and most observant of the lawes. Why then, quoth he, when we
were children and younglings, taught yee us quite contrary to all this? Why!
even so doe wee now also, quoth <hi>Cambyses,</hi> namely toward our friends and
compatriots. And wote you not that yee learne many mischeivous devises,
whereby yee may be able to annoy your enimies? No truly, Father, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Cyrus:</hi> Wherefore then, quoth he, learned yee to shoot? For what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
were yee taught to dart? Why were yee trained up in taking wild Bores
with net and toile, yea and in entrapping them in pitfals, or in catching Staggs
with snares, grinnes, and cords? Wherefore stood ye not your ground, nor
fought on even hand with Lions, Beares, and Libards, but evermore went about
to encounter these wild beasts upon advantages? Or know yee not, that all
these things be nought else, but mischeivous slights, deceitfull practises, fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
wiles, and laying for all advantages? They are no other Father, quoth <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
howbeit, against savage beasts. But, were I but seene so much as willing
to beguile any man, I remember full well, that I met with many a stripe for
my labour. No force, said <hi>Cambyses.</hi> For wee did not, I take it, permit you,
my sonne, either to shoot your arrow, or cast your dart through a man: but
we taught you to drive directly at a marke, and in no wise for the present to
hurt and mischeive your friends: But if there hapned any warres, that ye might
be able to level, yea and to hit even very men also. Likewise we taught you to
practise deceit and to win advantage, not of men but of wild beasts: to the end
that even herein yee should not hurt your friends. Howbeit in time of warre,
if need so require, yee might not be short in such fears. Then, Father, said <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
if it be expedient to learne both; namely, to know the way how to doe
good and hurt also unto men, it were meet to teach men the one as well as the
other. It is reported my sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyses,</hi> that there was sometime in
our auncestours daies a certein Schoolemaster, that taught his children (right
as you also would have it) Iustice [and Injustice] Not to lye, and withall,
To lye: Not to deceive, and yet to deceive: as well, Not to accuse wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as To accuse unjustly: both, Not to get advantage above others, and also
To lay for private gaine and commoditie before others. Now, In these points,
forsooth, he did distinguish thus, namely which they were to do unto friends;
and which unto enimies. Nay, he went further than so, and taught, That law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
it was even to beguile friends for profit, yea and to steale from friends their
goods for commoditie. He that taught these rules, could not chuse but exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his scholars to practise the same one unto another when they were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
like as men say, the Greeks in the feat of wrestling teach the art of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
yea and inure their children also to supplant and beguile one another.
Whereby it came to passe, that some of them, growen to be towardly impes,
both to beguile cleanly and also to get the vantage of others cunningly: and
haply framed withall by nature not unapt for covetousnesse and greedy getting
of goods, spared not their very friends but attempted to goe beyond them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Hereupon a law was made, which standeth in force with us at this day. That
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19319:26"/>
our children should be taught simply and after one way: even as we teach our
houshold-servants, To speake truth to our selves, not to deceive, nor steale and
filch, ne yet to seeke their owne commoditie: and if they trespasse herein, wee
threaten to punish them. To the end that being nuzzled up and inured in this
wise, they might prove the milder and more tractable patriots. Afterwards
when they were growne to your age, then and not before it was thought, they
might safely teach, what things were lawfully to be done to enimies. For being
thus brought up togither in a mutuall respective reverence one of another, yee
are not like now so farre to exorbitate and breake out of order, as to become
fierce and fell among your fellow-citizens. And even so, we doe not discourse
of venereous matters and fleshly pleasures unto those that be very young: least
haply, young as they be, when audacious boldnesse meeteth with heat of lust
they might use the same immoderatly. Par-die quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> true it is, And
therefore, good Father, forbeare not to teach mee what you can, as one some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
dull and comming late to learne, these subtill casts of catching vantage
how I may be able to make my part the better and outstrip mine enimies. Then
said <hi>Cambyses,</hi> Devise therefore to the uttermost of your power, when your
owne men are, in good order arraunged, to surprise your enimies when they be
in disarray: with your owne souldiours armed and well appointed to assaile
them unarmed: with your companies watching, to set upon them fast asleepe:
when they are espyed by you, and your selfe not discovered by them: also
whiles you are in a fensed place of safety, to take them encumbred, within the
difficultie and disadvantage of the ground. But how is it possible Father, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> for a man to watch his enimies such a turne, as to fall upon them in
these and such like defaults? For that, my sonne, as well you as your enimies,
are of necessitie to meet with many of these occurrents (For both of you
ought to goe and send out a foraging, yee cannot choose): yee must needs of
both sides take your sleepe: Early in the morning, yee cannot otherwise doe
but all-togither, make starts and straggle aside to purvey necessaries: and such
waies as yee light upon, be they better or worse yee are to use perforce. All
these things ought you to thinke upon; and looke wherein yee finde your
selves weakest, therein most of all yee are to be wary and circumspect: in what
things you perceive your enimies easiest to be taken and vanquished, therein
especially to set upon them. What! quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is it lawfull to lay for van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in these particulars onely, or in some others beside? Yes yw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t it is,
and in those much more my sonne. For in these, all men for the most part keepe
sure watch and ward, as knowing that ordinarily they have need thereof. But
they that are skilfull to circumvent their enimies, can either put them first in a
good conceit of themselves, and then surprize them at unwares: or suffer
them to follow in chase, and so cause them to breake their raies: or by sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of flight, traine them into streights and places disadvantageous, there to
assaile them sodainly. Now, my sonne, it behooveth you, to practise not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all these stratagemes, which with earnest desire you have already learned, but
devise also and of your owne head other sleights against your enimies: even
as Musicians, use not those tunes and songs onely which they have learn'd, but
study also to make &amp; set other. And verily in Musick new dities and fresh notes
in their very prime are in most request: but much more in warre new policies
are best set by. For why? such late devised inventions, are those that soonest
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19319:27"/>
can deceive the enimies? And if you my sonne, quoth he, would turne upon
men nought else but those sleights, which you have laid for very small wild
beasts, thinke you not that you should make good progresse in winning the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hand of your enemies? For, to catch foule, you have in the most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time of winter risen and gone forth by night: yea and before the poore birds
were stirring, set snares and grins for them so cunningly as that the mooveable
false floore seemed like unto that which mooved not. Besides certeine foules
were so taught by you, as that they served your owne turne, but in the meane
time deluded other silly birds of their owne fether: whiles your selfe lay in
couvert and espiall so, as you saw them, and they had no fight of you. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
your care and endevour was, to prevent the said foules and draw them
unto you before they should flye away. As for the Hare because she goeth to
releife and feedeth in the darke night, but by day saveth her selfe by her light
foot, you kept Hounds which by sent might finde her out: and for that when
shee is started, shee swiftly runneth away, you had Greehounds besides trained
of purpose to overtake her in pursuit, by good footmanship. And in case the
said Hares should out-strip these Greehounds also, you learned out their paths
and musets: and to what harbours they chuse to flie, therein you pitched haies
and nets hardly to be seene, to the end that the Hare in her most eger flight
might fall into them, and therein entangle her selfe. And that shee might not
escape thence, you placed men of purpose to watch and marke the manner of
it, who being neere at hand should streight-waies seize upon her. And your
selfe verily from behind, by setting up a lowd cry, that raught unto her, so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
the poore Hare, that caught shee was at unwares: whiles those who on
the forepart lay in waite instructed by you to keepe silence were hidden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene.
Therefore as I said before, if you would practise likewise such devises
as these, against men, I know not for my part, how you should come short of
any enemie in the world. Now, if it chaunce at any time, that you be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
in plaine even ground and open feild to joyne battaile with ensignes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played,
when yee are on both sides armed and well appointed, even then, my
sonne, those helpes and advantages provided long before do very much availe.
And such, I say, be these: namely, if your souldiours bodies have beene well
exercised; if their hearts have had an edge set upon them and thereby be well
encouraged: and last of all, if they have diligently studied and practized mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
feats aforehand. Moreover, this thing also you are to know; that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as you shall thinke it meet they should obey you, will all of them likewise
deeme it as fit, that you provide for their good and safetie every way. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be you never carelesse in this point, but foresee over-night what you would
have your liege men to doe the morrow, and fore-cast by day, how night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service
may speed best. Furthermore, in what sort an armie is to be put in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
against a battaile: after what manner it is to be led in march by night
or day? how in streights, how in broad plaines and open wayes? how
over hilly places, how through champian fields and plaines? Also in
what wise a campe is to be pitched? How watch and ward is to be set, as
well for night as day? How to advance against the enimies, how to come off,
and retire? How to march before an enimie-citie? how to lead an armie to the
assault of a walled Fort, and how to withdraw the same from thence? In what
manner to passe through<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19319:27"/>
order to take with horsemen? what with darters and archers? Also, when
you lead your armie displaied into wings, if then your enimies charge directly
upon you, in what sort are you to make head and withstand them? Again, when
you lead it in forme of a thicke<note n="*" place="margin">Or Phalang</note> squadron, and they flanke you from some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, and not afront; in what manner you are to encounter them? Also,
by which meanes you may best know your enimies behaviour and projects:
and they least perceive your desseine and purpose. But all these points, why
should I now rehearse unto you? For, whatsoever my selfe knoweth, you have
often heard: and if others besides seemed expert therein, you have not negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
conference with any one of them: and never were you dull witted and
hard to learne. You ought therefore, as I thinke, according as occasions shall
be presented, to put such instructions in ure, as you shall suppose will be at all
times most expedient for you. And learne withall, my sonne, of mee these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of greatest importance. Never adventure any thing either by your
selfe alone, or in your armie, without warrant of sacrifices and auguries by
bird flight: considering thus much, that men take matters in hand no otherwise
than by guesse, as not knowing for certeine from whence any good shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
unto them: how ever haply a man may by the events understand the
same. For, many men and those reputed most wise, have perswaded<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> cities to
make warre upon those, at whose hands they thus perswaded, have afterward
beene overthrowne. Many a man besides, hath both enriched private persons,
and also amplified publike States, from whom by their meanes thus enriched
and advanced, they have susteined afterwards extreme losse and mischiefe.
Many also when they might have used others as friends with reciprocall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of doing and receiving pleasures, chusing to make them their slaves
rather than their friends, have felt the smart thereof, and suffred punishment
even at their hands. Many againe, not content to live a pleasant life with a
competent and sufficient portion, but coveting to be Lords of all, have lost
thereby even all that they had, and possessed before. And to conclude, many
having gotten much gold and treasure which they so greatly wished for, have
by the same perished and come to ruine. Thus, mans wisedome knoweth no
more how to chuse what is best; than if one should cast lots and draw what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
falleth unto him. Whereas, the immortall Gods know all as well past
as present, yea and the future events of euery thing. And to as many as
seeking to them for direction they vouchsafe their gracious favour,
therefore signifie, what enterprises they are to attempt, and what
not. Now, if they be not willing thus to advise all men,
no marvaile is it. For, they are not bound of
necessitie to regard such as
they will not.</p>

of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> how great an Army he had brought? Who answered, thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
even those who were wont heretofore to come unto you and serve as
mercenaries: And certeine others besides of the Peeres ranke who never yet
went forth to warre, are comming to them. And, How many be they? quoth
<hi>Cyaxáres:</hi> As for the number, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it will not greatly please you when

or did you feare in vaine? and happly the enimies come not. Yes verily, that
they doe, quoth <hi>Cyaxáres,</hi> and those a great number. And how know you that?
said <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Because, quoth he, how ever there be many come from those parts
reporting diversly, yet they all agree in one point of substance, and speake to the
same purpose. Then, I see quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> fight we must against these men. No
remedie said <hi>Cyaxáres.</hi> Why then, replyed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> did not you tell me (if you
have so good intelligence) what power of theirs is a-foot, as also what our
owne forces bee, that upon the certeine knowledge thereof wee may consult
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19319:28"/>
togither, which way best to joyne battaile with them? Hearken then, quoth
<hi>Cyaxáres. Croesus</hi> that rich King of <hi>Lydia</hi> bringeth, they say, ten thousand
Horsemen: and of Targuetiers and Archers more than 40000. <hi>Artámes</hi> the
Prince of Great <hi>Phrygia,</hi> is said to come with a power of 8000 Horse, and of
Pikemen and Targuetiers together, no fewer then 40000. <hi>Aribaeus</hi> King of the
Cappadocians, leadeth (by report) 6000 Horsemen, and his Archers with Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guetiers
are not under 30000. <hi>Maragdus</hi> the Arabian, hath in his conduct
10000 men of Armes, one hundred Chariots; and of Slingers an exceeding
great multitude. But as touching the Greekes that inhabit <hi>Asia,</hi> it is not yet
knowne, whether they follow or no? <hi>Gabaeus,</hi> as the speech goeth, who hath
from about the plaine of <hi>Caystros</hi> 6000 Horse, and 10000 Targuetiers, will
augment his number, with those of that <hi>Phrygia,</hi> which joyneth to <hi>Hellespont.</hi>
But the <hi>Carians</hi> varily, the <hi>Cilicians</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonians,</hi> for ought we heare, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
not, although they were requested to come. Howbeit, the Assyrian (Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch)
who hath under him <hi>Babylon</hi> and all <hi>Assyria</hi> beside, will bring into the
Field, as I suppose, 20000 horse and no fewer: Chariots I am sure not above
200: but of footmen, I guesse, an huge number: For so is he wont to doe
whensoever he invadeth these parts. By this computation then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
you say that our enimies be in Horse 60000: of Targuetiers and Archers not
so few as 200000 strong. Goe to now, to what number, say you, doe your owne
forces amount? There be, quoth he, of <hi>Median</hi> Horsemen, above 10000: of
Targuetiers and Archers, there may be levied in our owne territory, about
60000. But of the Armenians and Borderers, there will be here 4000 Horse,
and 20000 Foot. By your saying then, inferred <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Our men of armes bee
fewer than one third part of our enimies Cavallery, &amp; our footmen well neere
halfe their Infantery. How then, said <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> doe you accoumpt the <hi>Persians</hi>

their severall services. Surely, quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> They use in manner all, the same
kinde of fight. For, there be of them as well as of us, Archers and Darters.
Since then, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> they be for weapons thus appointed, there musts needs be
skirmishing with volly of short from a farre? Of necessitie it will be so, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Cyaxares.</hi> Then quoth he againe, in this kinde of service it cannot be, but
that the greater number shall have the victory. For, sooner will there be a few
hurt and slaine by many, than many by a few. If the case so stands, my good
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, what devise may a man finde better, than to send unto the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,
both to declare unto them, that if the Medes susteine any disastre, the
losse and calamitie will reach even unto them; and withall to require a greater
power? But I would have you to understand thus much, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that if all
the Persians should come into the field, wee were not able for number to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
our enimies. What other meanes then, doe you see better than this,
quoth <hi>Cyaxares?</hi> Were I, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as you are, I would cause to be made for all
the Persians that are comming, such armour in every point as those Gentlemen
of ours have, who are repairing hither and be called Homotimi: namely, a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race
over the brest, a light targuet for the left hand, and a short curtelax for the
right. If you can provide us these armes; you shall bring to passe, that as it
wil be more safe for us to confront our enimies &amp; cope with them in close fight:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19319:29"/>
so it shall be better for them to flie than to keepe their ground. And verily, we
that are <hi>Persians</hi> be prest to deale with such as will stand to it: but looke how
many of them do flie, those commit we to you and to your horsmen: so that they
shall have no leisure, either to flie or once to turne backe. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus
discoursed upon the point, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> approved well his speech: insomuch, as he
made no more words of sending for a new levie, but presently provided the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and weapons abovesaid. Now, when the same were in good forwardnesse
and almost ready, the said Peeres were by that time come with the armie sent
out of <hi>Persia.</hi> Whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> after he had assembled together, spake by report un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>MY friends, seeing as I did, your selves in armes so well appointed and

being few in number, and abiding the shocke of a battayle, destitute of those
that were to second you, and falling upon your enemies so many in number,
should haply incurre some hard extremity. But now, considering yee are hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
come with such able and manly bodies, as cannot be found fault with: and
that they againe shall have the like armour unto yours: it remaineth onely that
for your parts, yee whet and quicken their hearts. For, it is the office of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

the receivers doe much more prize the same at their hands. Semblably the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
now, in case <hi>Cyrus</hi> should exhort them, would joy farre more, than if they
were exhorted by us. And being admitted into the order of the Petres, they
will account the preferment more assured, and the benefit better worth, if it
proceed both from a Kings Sonne, and also from a Lord Generall, than if by
our meanes they were advanced to the very same place of dignity. And yet

               <p>MY friends, yee that are <hi>Persians,</hi> as yee were borne and bred up in the
same region with us, and are in bodie besides framed nothing inferiour
to us: so, it is meet that your minds also be not worse then ours. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
such ye are indeed, yet in our native countrey yee were not in equall estate
and condition with us: not for that yee were by us put by, but because yee
were enforced to provide necessaries. Now, both I, by the leave and power of
God will take order that yee shall have the same degree, and your selves also,
if yee be so disposed, using the same armes that we doe, how ever otherwise in
meaner place than we are, may enter upon the same daungers with us, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the archievement of any noble and worthy exploit, receive the like guerdon
to ours. Heretofore, yee were archers and darters as well as wee. In which
manner of service if yee carried not your selves equall to us, it is no marvaile.
For why? yee had not time to practise these feats, as wee had. But in this kind
of armature here, we shall have no vantage at all ever you. For, every one of
you shall have a curace fitted for his brest, a light buckler in his left hand, as
wee all were wont to carry, and in his right an arming sword, or battle axe
wherewith we are to smite our enemy that standeth opposite unto us, and need
not feare to misse whensoever we offer to strike. What is it then, (considering
this manner of fight) wherein one of us should passe another? unlesse it bee in
boldnesse and courage, which yee ought to shew as well as we. And as for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
whereby all good things and excellent, are both gotten and kept, what
reason is there that we should desire it more than yee? To speake of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which giveth all away to the Conquerours, from them that be conquered,
why should it concerne us more than you, to seeke therefore? To conclude
then, saith hee, yee have heard all, and see the very armour. Take every man
what he needeth and is fit for his body, and then give his name to the Captaine
of some company for to be enrolled in the same degree and ranke with us. But
whosoever is content with the place of a mercenary souldier, let him remaine
still in such armes as are meet for servitours unto others.</p>

Whereupon they all entred their names, and being once registred, tooke every
man his armour. But all the while that the enemies were said to be comming
neere at hand, and yet appeared not in sight; <hi>Cyrus</hi> endeavoured both to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19319:30"/>
his souldiers bodies in such feats, as it might gather more strength: to teach
them also to set their array, and embattaile, yea and to whet their stomacks
against warre-service. But first of all, having received ministers and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> he commaunded them to furnish every souldier sufficiently
with all things needfull: Which order being taken, he left them by this meanes
nothing else to doe, but to exercise onely martiall deeds: seeming, that he had
learned and observed thus much, that they became alwaies in every point most
excellent, who leaving to busie their heads &amp; to deale in many things, gave their
minds to one worke onely and no more. Nay, more than so, even of military
exercises, cutting off their training to the use of bowes, arrowes and darts, hee
left them nought else to practise, but to fight with sword, buckler and brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
whereby it came to passe, that immediately he imprinted this opinion in
them, that either they must buckle with their enemies close at hand-strokes, or
else confesse themselves to bee warre-fellowes of no worth. But to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thus much was very hard and harsh to them: knowing as they did, that
they were kept for no other purpose, but in defence of those that gave them
maintenance. Furthermore, weighing well with himselfe, that men be much
more willing to practise all those feats, about which ariseth an emulation and
contentious desire of victory, he proclaimed games of price and triall of maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
among them, in all those points that he deemed expedient for souldiers to
put in ure.</p>
               <p>Now, the particulars that he ordained and published were these: Imprimis,
for a private souldier, that he beare himselfe hardy, obey his Rulers and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines:
be willing to labour; forward and prest to adventure; yet so, as hee
keep order in his ranke: expert in military affaires, elegant and neat in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:

For the Caporals, that such of them as were thought to have trained
their bands most sufficiently, might succeed in their places who had beene Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions:
In like maner that the best Decurions should be advanced to the rowme
of Caporals: and the Quincurions likewise to the leading of Decuries. Finally,
that private souldiers, such as excelled the rest, should step into the Quincurions
degree. And verily, all these Captaines gained this at first, To be esteemed of
those Companies whereof they had the rule: then, other honours consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
followed, as were beseeming every one according to their calling. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
he made shew of greater hopes to such as were praise worthy, if haply
in time to come, there should appeare any shew of father commodity. Hee
proclaimed likewise rewards of victory, to whole Centuries, as also to whole
Decuries and Quincuries: according, as they shewed themselves right<note n="*" place="margin">

appointed unto them. And such were their rewards, as best befitted a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
Thus much as touching these particulars, which himselfe published,
and wherein the Soldiours were exercised. Moreover, he provided for them
Pavilions, for number as many as there were Centurions, and for their capacity
sufficient every one to receive a<note n="*" place="margin">A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> Company: and each Company contained one
hundred Soldiers. And thus pitched they their tents by the hundreds. Of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping
thus and lodging together, he supposed this commodity would arise
unto them, against any future battaile, in that they saw themselves one with
another kept and maintained alike: In which regard, none could have pretense
of Cowardise, for to shrinke or beare himselfe worse in fighting with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as having smaller availes one than another. This conversing also under
one roufe, he thought would make much for their mutuall acquaintance. For,
in knowing each other, he was perswaded they would bee all more abashed to
doe amisse: Whereas, those who are unknowne, like unto such as live in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
seeme in some sort more prone to commit wickednesse. Againe, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
unto him, that by reason of this society in campe and pavilion, they should
finde much good in the exact ordinance of their Companies and setting them
in array. For the Centurions had under them their hundreds lying and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> in so good dispose, as if every Century marched by it selfe upon the
way: Semblably the Caporals of their bands: The Decurions their Tenns and
Quicurions their fives. This precise order of severall bands and companies, he
thought very profitable, both to prevent all trouble and confusion: and also in
case they were once shuffled and in desarary, to rally and reduce them againe
sooner into order: like as stones and pieces of timber, which are to bee joyned
and set together in building, how ever they chance to lye asunder and cast aside
may yet be easily fitted and couched one to another, if they have certaine marks,
by which it may evidently appeare from what place every of them came? Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
by such fellowship in living together at bed and boord, he thought they
should finde this benefit, in that they would be more louth to forsake one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
because hee saw, that even wild beasts feeding together hoan exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after their fellowes, if happly any man plucke and sever them asunder.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Cyrus</hi> had a speciall eye to this also, that his Soldiours should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
goe in, to dinner or supper, unlesse they had laboured first, untill they sweat
againe. For, he either led them forth on hunting, and so caused them to sweat,
or else devised for them such games and pastimes, as might drive them into a
sweat. And if it happened, that himselfe were to performe any exploit, hee
would in person lead them, and set into the action so, as they should be sure,
not to returne without sweating. For, this he supposed to bee very good for
them, causing them to eate their meat with better stomack and delight, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their health, and to enable them unto labour. Yea, and this fellowship
in paines taking as he thought, would make them to be more milde and gentle
one unto another. For, even horses accustomed to worke and labour togither
abroad, are wont to stand more gently and quietly in the stable. And certaine
it is, that those Soldiours will sticke to it more couragiously against their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who are privy to themselves that they have beene well exercised. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
<hi>Cyrus</hi> for himselfe reared a pavilion, sufficient for the receit of those,
whom he bade at any time to supper. And for the most part, he invited to his
table, such Centiniers as he thought meet. Sometimes, Caporals, otherwhiles
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19319:31"/>
Diziniers and Cinquiniers: Now and then also, he admitted to his boord, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
private souldiers, yea and whole companies or bands, of fives and tennes,

                     </gap>ties</note> twenty fives and hundreds, at a time. This manner of inviting and doing
them honour, he used whensoever hee saw some of them to have executed that
exploit, which he would have had joyntly performed by all. As for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of dishes up to the boord, it was no other for <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe than for his
guests. The<note n="*" place="margin">As, Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of honour and advancement than either Heraults or Embassadors. For, he
supposed, that such ought to be trusty; expert in military affaires, quicke witted
and of good conceit, hardy besides and active, forward to action, and firme in
resolution: yea and more than so, <hi>Cyrus</hi> judged that these ministers ought to
be as much respected every way, and to enjoy as many preferments as those,
who were reputed the very best: and therefore so to bee inured, as that they
might refuse no labour, but thinke all things meet for them to doe, which their
Captaine commaunded.</p>

               <p>OVer and besides, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whensoever hee with his invited guests made
merry togither in one Pavilion, endeavored alwaies to have such talke
and speeches interlaced among, as might cause most mirth, and withall
incite to vertue and prowesse. And one time above the rest, he fell into such a
discourse as this. What thinke yee, Sirs, saith he, seeme others beside our selves?
inferiour unto us any jote, in this regard that they had not had the same educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and breeding with us! or will there be no difference at all betweene them
and us, either in mutuall conversing together, or in manner of fight when we are
to joyne battayle with our enemies? Then <hi>Hystaspes</hi> made answer and said,
How they will demeane themselves against the enemie, I wote not yet; but in
their daily conversation, so helpe me God, some of them seeme peevish and
teasty enough already. For, of late <hi>Cyaxares</hi> sent unto every severall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
beasts slaine for sacrifice to make good cheere with, so as there should fall
to every one of our shares three pieces of flesh or more as they were served and
carried round. And verily, the Cooke, when he went about with the first ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
began at me: But as he came in, the second time to deale about, I willed
him to begin at the hinmost and so to hold on his course the contrary way.
Whereat one of those souldiers which sat in the mids of the<note n="*" place="margin">Or, round.</note> Circle, cryed out
and said, Pardie, here is no indifferent dealing, if no man will begin at us here
in the midst. Which when I heard, I was not a little grieved, that they should
thinke themselves cut short and to have lesse than the rest; and therewith, I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
presently for the said party to come and sit by me: who herein very orderly
obeyed and came. Now when the meat that went about came unto us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by that time, the smallest portion remained, by reason (as I take it) that wee

for to haue gotten a bigger piece than he, he casteth from him that which he had

from him, and so made an end of his course about, before the party could meet
with another piece. Whereupon he was so ill appaied for his hard hap, that
when the meat was eaten vp which he had once receiued, the rest, sauce and all
wherein he should dip (in such a pelting chafe was he, and so angry with his ill
fortune) he quite ouerturned. A Caporall that sate next vnto us, seeing this,
clapped both his hands together and laughed thereat full heartily. But I, quoth
<hi>Hystaspes,</hi> made as though I coughed: For, I assure you, I could not containe my
selfe but laugh a good. And such an one, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> can I shew unto
you out of our owne fellowes. Here at they laughed all, as they might well
enough. Then another Centurion, This man quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> met belike with
a fellow thus froward and discontented. But I, quoth he, when you had taught
us the maner of marshalling our companies, and so sent us away commaunding

and next unto him placed a lusty young fellow, and so others in order, as I
thought meet, I stood then my selfe before them all: and looking toward the
said band, when I saw my time, commaunded them all to march forward:
Whereat, this said youngster aduanced himselfe before the leader and marched
formost: which I seeing, Whither now good fellow, quoth I, what meanest thou
to do? I march on Sir, quoth he, as you commaund. Then replied I, Why! I bad
not thee alone, but all the rest to come forward: which when he heard, turning
backe to his fellowes, Come on Sirs, quoth he: Heare ye not how he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
us all to march? Then they all stepped afore the Caporall, and came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
me: whereupon the said Caporall called them all backe againe to their
places: with that they stomached the matter and grumbled saying: whether of
the twaine must we now obey? for the one biddeth vs march on, and the other
forbiddeth vs. Well, I tooke all in good part, disposing them eftsoones in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with this charge, that none of them behind should set one foot forward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the former led the way, but all of them have a speciall eye to this onely,
even to follow the former. Now it hapned, that one intending to take a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into <hi>Persia,</hi> came and called upon mee for my letter which I had written
home to my friends. Whereupon I willed a Caporall (for he knew where the
said letter lay, to runne unto the tent and fetch the same: He ran accordingly;
but the foresaid youngster followed the Caporall hard at heeles, armed as he
was in his curace and with his curtelace. All the rest of the whole band seeing
him to runne, ranne also amaine for company: and so they all of them came and
brought me my letter. Thus hath my band, saith he, learned all that you have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19319:32"/>
enjoyned us. Hereat, all the rest verily that were present laughed, as well they
might, and namely at this warlike guard and convoy of the letter: But <hi>Cyrus</hi>
said, <hi>O Iupiter,</hi> and all yee the Gods besides, what manner of Associats have
we to fight for us? so<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> tractable and easie to bee wonne, that many of them
will become good friends for a small piece of meate, and some againe so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious,
that before they know what they are commaunded, be ready to obey?
Trust me truly, I wote not what kind of souldiours a man should wish rather to
have than such. <hi>Cyrus</hi> also laughed with them, and in this sort praised the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
It fortuned moreover that in his Pavilion there was then, at this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
one of the Centurions named <hi>Aglaitadas,</hi> a man for his manners and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
one of these austere and grimme Sirs, who began in this wise: Thinke
you, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, that these men make a true report unto you? Why? said
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> what should they meane to tell lies? what else, said the other, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are disposed to move laughter? in which regard they both come out
with these tales, and also shew themselves bragging boasters. Oh good Sir
quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Faire words I pray you. And terme not these men vaine vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
For the name of boaster or vaunter, as I take it, is aptly given unto them,
that pretend either to be richer or more valiant than they are: such also, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to doe, that which they cannot performe: yea and then especially, when
they are knowne evidently so to doe for lucre. But they that devise meanes to
make the company to laugh, neither for their owne gaine, nor to the damage
of the hearers, ne yet for any other harme at all, why should not they more
truely be called, merry conceited Pleasants rather than Boasters? Thus much
answered <hi>Cyrus</hi> by way of Apologie, in the behalfe of those who had mooved
laughter. Then the Caporall againe, who related the merry narration of his
band. Now verily, <hi>Aglaitadas</hi> quoth he, If we had gone about to cause you
to weepe, as some Poets and Oratours there be, who both in their Sonnets and
also in their Orations, invent pitifull and lamentable arguments, thereby to
provoke melancholicke persons to shed teares, you would have greatly blamed
us; when as you knowing as you do, that we are desirous to make you somwhat
merry, and in no wise to hurt you, yet you requite us with great contumely and
disgrace. I do so indeed quoth <hi>Aglaitadas,</hi> and (by <hi>Iupiter</hi> I sweare) auow it well
and iustly done. For, in my conceit, whosoeuer causeth his friends to laugh, doth
not so worthy an act by farre, as he that setteth them a weeping. And euen your
selfe, if you weigh the thing aright, shall find that I say trve. And why! by wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
fathers bring their children to modesty and sobriety: Schoolemasters
likewise their schollars to learne good arts and sciences: yea, and the lawes,
whiles they force citizens and subjects to shead teares, put them forwards to
observe and practise Iustice. But as for these Pleasants that procure laughter,
tell me if you can wherein they profit mens bodies or enhable their minds, the
better, to menage either private government of house, or publike administration
of Common-weale? Hereupon <hi>Hystaspes</hi> came upon him with such a speech as
this. Well, <hi>Aglaitadas,</hi> if you will follow my counsell, be bold to expend
frankly upon your enemies this that you price so high: and doe your best hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make them weepe: but upon us, your friends, be so good as bestow your
laughing, being a matter of so small cost and valew. For, I know well, you
cannot choose but haue plenty thereof layd vp in store: considering neither
your selfe for your owne vse haue spent, nor willingly affoord ought of it to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19319:32"/>
your friends and guests: and therefore can pretend no excuse, but that you
must impart some laughter among us. Why? quoth <hi>Aglaitadas,</hi> and goe you
about <hi>Hystaspes</hi> to fetch a laughter from mee? with that, the Caporall aboue
sayd, Nay in good faith; he were a very foole then: For I suppose a man may
sooner strike fire out of you, than get one laughter. Hereat all the rest of the
company, that knew the humor and quality of the man laughed hartily: and
<hi>Aglaitadas</hi> himselfe could not choose but smile also a little. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then seeing
him disposed somewhat to mirth, You do not well, Caporall, quoth he, to offer
this wrong; in that by perswading the man to laugh, you seeme to corrupt and
marre this our most sober and grave guest: especially being so professed an
enemie against laughter. And thus, an end there was of merry talke in this
kind.</p>

share, but the best and worthiest person ought to be preferred respectively both
in honours and gifts? I verily, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> am of that mind: partly for that yee
are ready to opine the same with me, and partly because it is unbeseeming to
gainsay this position, That whosoever both travaileth most and procureth

that this decree should passe for those<note n="*" place="margin">Homo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that even they would bee more valourous, if they knew once, that being first
judged by their deeds, they should receive condigne rewards. He thought it
therefore the best opportunity, at this very time, to have this matter decided
by voices: when as the very Peeres themselves feared this equall condition of
the vulgar with them. It was thought good then, by all those who were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
in the Pavilion of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to referre this question in hand to a Scrutinie,
and that, who ever would be reputed a man in deed, should accord thereto. A
Centurion there was in place, who smiling hereat; One man quoth he of the
common sort I know, who will soone agree that this even partage thus hand
over head shall not passe. And who may hee be? I pray you, asked another.
It is, saith he, a tent-fellow of mine: who in all things by his good will would
have more than others. What! saith another, In labour and paines taking too?
Nay, quoth he, Ho there. Here I am taken in a lye. For, in travailes and all
such matters, he ever suffreth very gently any one that will, to have more than
himselfe. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I ordaine saith he, that such fellowes as he now speaketh
of, should be called and displaced, if wee intend to have a valiant and obedient
army. For, of this opinion am I, that the multitude, in generall, of souldiers
stand thus affected, even to follow which way soever any man leadeth them.
Now, such I suppose as be honest and valourous, endeauour to be leaders unto
good and honest actions: but lewd and wicked persons, unto lewd and naughty
deeds. And truely, it falleth out oftentimes, that lewd folke induce more to
follow them and take their part, than the better sort. For, vice conversing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
pleasures, which soone offer and present themselves, useth their helpe
joyntly to perswade many to assent unto her: whereas vertue leading the way
directly up to steep ascents, is not very powerfull and able so quickly and out
of hand to winne and draw men unto her: especially if there be others againe
who allure them to gentle, easie and pleasant descents. And therefore, if there
be any, who onely in sluggardy loitering and refusing<note n="*" place="margin">

naught, such I repute as drones to endamage their fellowes in matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense,
and nothing else: but such as in paines taking with others be slacke, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
in seeking their owne gaine, forward enough and shamelesse withall, they
become ringleaders also unto lewdnesse: For they are able many times to shew
and prove, that wickednesse hath sped best, and gained most. Wherefore such
as these in any wise we ought to discharge and remoove from among us. And
verily yee are not so much to consider, how yee may supply and make up these
your broken bands with your owne countrimen: but, like as in horses, yee lay
for them that be best, and not bred at home: even so in choice of men, of all
others take them whom yee thinke likely and meet, both to adde most strength
and bring also greatest honour to your selves. And that such a course will speed
well I presume also upon the testimony of this one instance: For that neither
can a chariot be swift, in which the steeds be slow: nor a Councell or judiciall
Court be just, wherein unrighteous men be joyned with others in Commission:
ne yet a house well governed that employeth lewd and naughty servants. Nay,
lesse detriment should an house receive, wanting servants altogether, than being
pestered with those that be false and wicked. Certes, my friends, I would have
you to know thus much, that by weeding out lewd souldiers, not onely this
good shall ensue, that such persons will be rid away and gone: but of those also
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19319:33"/>
who shall remaine behind with us, as many as be already infected and growne
full of wickednesse, shall be purged of the same againe: Yea and the good,
when they shall see the wicked disgraced and put to shame, will with farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
alacritie embrace vertue. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus said, all his friends approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

company, and also to behold his countenance. When the other tent-fellowes
heard this, they looked wistly upon the partie, and perceiving his face to be
passing foule and ill-favoured, they all fell a laughing. And one among the
rest, Now for Gods sake, quoth he, <hi>Sambaulas,</hi> for what good demerit is this
man so highly in your favour? I will tell you truly, quoth <hi>Sambaulas.</hi> How

was the conclusion and determination thereof.</head>
               <p>THE morrow after, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had gathered all his souldiers togither,
he made a speech unto them in this manner: Friends we have a battaile
toward: For, our enimies approach. And rewards belong only to
victorie. If we be victours, certeine it is, that both the enimies will be ours,
and likewise all the enimies goods: but if we be vanquished (for this must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
be our saying) semblably, all our goods in case we be overcome, are
present prizes and rewards evermore for the winners. Moreover, thus much
yee ought to know, that if men taking part togither in warre, shall every one
set downe this reckoning, that nothing will succeede well, vnlesse for their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19319:34"/>
parts and places they play the valiant men, they will soone atchieue many and
those right braue exploits. For, such as they, will not neglect through slouth
any seruice that is to be done. But when ech one thinketh, that some other man
there will be to do the seruice &amp; to fight, though himself sit still &amp; take his ease:
then make this full accompt and be sure, that there is no misfortune and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but all such persons must abide it. And verily, this after a sort is the ordinance
of God: For, ouer those who will not enioyne themselves labour, to effect
good things, he setteth others to rule and command. Now therefore, let some
one arise up here and speake to the point, whether he thinketh, that it is like
wee will giue our mindes to exercise vertue the rather, if he that is willing to
travaile most and to enter into greatest daunger, shall obtaine also the greatest
honour: or if he know, that it matters not at all if one bee a coward, seeing
that all of us shall be rewarded alike? Then <hi>Chrysantas</hi> one of the<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Knights, Homotimi.</note> Peeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
said arose. No big man was he of person to see to, nor strong, but of
singular wisedome, who spake in this wise.</p>
               <p>I suppose, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you propound not this case to be decided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you thinke it meet, that cowards should by right have equall part with
valiant men, but to try, whether any one will be seene to carry this minde, that
although himselfe execute no good and commendable Act, yet hee would be
full partner, and reape like fruit of those things, which others by their valour
have atchieved? As for my selfe, quoth he, swift I am not of foot, nor yet a
tall man of my hands. And full well I wote, that for any feats which I shall
with my body performe; I cannot be raunged in the first, nor second, ne yet I
suppose in the thousandth, no, nor peradventure in the ten thousandth place.
And yet thus much also, I know for certeine, that if hardy men shall attempt
any brave deeds, and doe their best, I shall have such part of some good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
as I am thought of right to deserve: but if both cowards and slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs
shall doe just nothing, and also the valorous and able men be put out of
heart and discouraged, I feare me, quoth he, I shall have a part of any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than that which is good, yea and in greater measure then I would.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Chrysantas</hi> had thus said, there stood up after him <hi>Pheraulas</hi> a Persian
Commoner, one in some sort ever since they came from home, inward with
<hi>Cyrus</hi> and well accepted of him. A man for his body not unpersonable, and
in regard of his minde, seeming no ignoble and base pesant, who made this
speech.</p>
               <p>I suppose ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, and yee Persians as many as are present, that we
all endevour, and strive to the triall of vertue. For, I perceive that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wee acquaint our bodies to like diet: wee are admitted all, to semblable
societies and meetings: and the very same acts of Prowesse are propounded to
us all indifferently. For, to obey those that be in authority, is a point in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that concerneth all, and whosoever is known thus to doe without refusall
&amp; pretending excuse for the matter, him I see most honored at <hi>Cyrus</hi> his hands.
Also, to be stout and valiant against the enemy, is a thing not deemed decent
for one, and undecent for another: but even the same hath been judged already
to be most seemly and honourable for all. But now, say I, a fight battaile also is
presented unto us, unto which I see all men are fitted and skilfull by nature: like
as other creatures are cunning every one in some fight or other, which they
have learned of no other schoolemaster but of nature. As for example, the Bull
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19319:34"/>
[or Oxe] is naturally taught to push with his home, the Horse to strike with
his house, the Dog to bite with his mouth, and the Bore to wound with his
tusk. And all these beasts know to avoid those things which are most to be
taken heed of. And yet for this, they never frequented any Schoole at all. My
selfe, when I was but a little one, knew even then, how to cast some thing in his
way, who I thought would beat me. And if I had nothing else about mee, I
would put forth both my hands and as much as possibly I could impeach him
that was smiting of mee. And this did I untaught. For, beaten otherwhiles
I was, if in defence of my selfe I opposed ought betweene. Being but a very
child, I would catch up a sword, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eresoever I could see it, not taught of any
other so much as how to take and hold it, but onely by instinct of nature, as I
suppose. Nay, I would thus doe, when I was not taught, but forbidden to doe
it: Like as other things thereby, which notwithstanding I was restreined by
my father and mother both, yet by nature I was enforced to practise: And, so
helpe me Iupiter, as I loved to be striking with a sword, what ever I could reach
covertly and not espyed. Neither was this unto me naturall onely, as to goe
or to run, but besides the motion of nature that way, mee thought I found a
pleasure and sweetnesse in so doing. Seeing then, quoth he, this fight is left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, wherein naturall courage is like to prevaile more than artificiall cunning:
why should not we delight to enter into contention and aemulation with these
<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Gentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>men.</note> Peeres: considering that the like rewards of fortitude be proposed unto us
on both sides? and yet we know, that we for our parts hazard not alike. For,
these here adventure an honourable life, which is the onely life of all others
most pleasant, but we a painfull and laborious life in deed, but a life without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which I suppose is most odious and displeasant. And now, my fellow
soldiers, this most of all inciteth me to entertein a contention and triall with
them, For that <hi>Cyrus</hi> shall be our judge, who will not upon any envie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
partially: but I dare upon mine oath say, That I am verily perswaded in
my heart, that whom soever <hi>Cyrus</hi> seeth to beare themselves valiantly, those he
loveth no lesse than his owne heart. And this I perceive in him, that upon them
here, he bestoweth what he hath with more pleasure, than keepeth it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
yet I am not ignorant: That these Peeres be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gh minded Gentlemen,
and of hautie stomacke, brought up and trained, as they are, to endure hunger,
thirst and cold: Full little knowing that wee have learned even the same of a
better Schoolemaster than they. For, there is no better Preceptour of these
things than Necessitie, which hath taught us to be very perfect therein. As for
these Gentlemen I say, enured they have beene to trauaile in bearing their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
which all men have devised to make so, as they might be borne most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily:
but we were put to goe and runne also under great burdens: so that now,
the carriage of harnois, seemeth unto me more like unto wings than burdens.
And therefore, tak mee, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for such an one as will doe my devoyr: and
whatsoever I am, better or worse, I shall require to be honoured and advanced
according to my worthinesse and not otherwise. And yee also, my friends, of
the Commons, I exhort you that yee will arme your selves in this battaile to
strive for the better, with these Gentlemen so well brought up. And now no

for offense, he gave unto the one halfe in their right hands good round<note n="*" place="margin">Or wasters.</note> bastons:
signifying to the rest, that they should take up clods and fling them at their
opposites. Now when they stood thus arraunged and appointed, he gave them
the signall to combat. Then the one part threw from them their clods at the
other, and hit them, some on the brest-plates and bucklers, others upon the
thighs and<note n="*" place="margin">Or greaves.</note> boots. But when those were once come to close fight, who had
the wasters abovesaid: they laid about them and basted the other well: some on
their thighs, others about their hands and armes: others also over their shinnes

be sure to lay upon their necks and backs. At length the<note n="*" place="margin">Or bastoniers.</note> waster-men put the
others to flight, pursued them, and beat them throughly with much good
laughter and pastime. Others also for their parts againe, would in like manner
take wasters in hand and serve them so who fought with flinging clods: <hi>Cyrus</hi>
admiring as well the witty devise of the Leader, as the due obedience of the
Soldiers: for that they were at once both exercised and also emboldened: and
seeing withall, those gaine the better who counterfaited the Persians armour
and weapons, being much delighted with this sight, bade them all to supper:
and espying in his pavilion, some of them with their shinnes and legges, others
with their armes and hands bound up, he asked them what they ayled? who
answered that they had beene hurt with clods: then demaunded he of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
whether they caught their hurt when they met close togither, or when
they were farre asunder? they made answer, when they were farre asunder:
but when wee came to close-hand-fight, said the Wastermen, we made most
pleasant pastime and sport: Sport? cried out the other who had beene well ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted

togither, thus to be cudgelled: and with that shewed on their armes, hands and

which they had received. And then verily they laughed heartily one at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as they might well enough. The day following, the whole field was full

there being then in place a certeine other Centurion, that was bidden to supper;
But, invite you not my Centurie, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> into your Pavilion? and
yet, when he is at supper he doth the very same every way: when supper also
is done, and the meeting dissolved; the last Leader of the reare band bringeth
forth his crew, having the last verily set formost in array against they should
fight: then after them, he likewise that leadeth the taile of the second crew:
and semblably the third and the fourth: to the end that when they are to be led
away from the enemies, they might know how to retire. Furthermore, if we
addresse our selves for a running march, and be disposed to journey: whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we set out toward the Sun-rising, I my selfe lead the way, and the first band
goeth formost: then, the second keepeth his place, as is meet: the third like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

band, so long as I bid them. But when we march toward the West [or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting]
then the Caporall of the reare band and with him those that be last,
lead in the front: and yet they obey me neverthelesse comming behind in the
very taile: that they may be accustomed as well to follow, as lead with like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
And what! quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Doe ye alwaies practise this? Yea Sir, I
assure you, quoth the said Captain, so often and as duly as we go to our suppers.
I invite therefore you also, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> partly for that you yonder traine your
souldiours so precisely to keepe order in going and comming, in marching on
and retiring, and partly because you practise so to doe both by day and night;
and withall not onely exercise your bodies by journeying but also profit your
minds by teaching. And now, for as much as yee doe every thing double,
good reason it is that we semblably make you double cheere. Not so, for Gods
sake, saith the Captaine, unlesse you give us also two bellies apeece. And thus
brake up their meeting in his Pavilion. The morrow after, <hi>Cyrus</hi> reinvited this

               <p>AS <hi>Cyrus</hi> on a time was mustering all his souldiours in their armour and
setting them in order of battaile: there came a messenger from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi>
advertising him of an Embassage arrived from the Indians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Cyaxares</hi> his will is, saith he, that you repaire unto him with all speed. I
have beside, quoth the messenger, brought unto you from <hi>Cyaxares</hi> a most good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and faire robe: For, his desire is, that you should shew your selfe in most
magnificent and gorgeous manner, For that the Indians are to view and behold
you as you come. <hi>Cyrus</hi> hearing this newes, gave commandement to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
and formost Centinier, arraunged as he was in battaile ray, that standing
himselfe on the right hand, and leading his Centurie one by one, hee should
place it afront: he willed him also to give the like charge unto the second: and
so, throughout them all hee bad him intimate so much. Which order of his
they obeyed, and as they quickly delivered this charge, so they performed the
same as speedily. Thus within a short time, there stood afront in ranke 200.
For so many Centiniers there were, and in depth one hundred. When they were
thus placed, hee commaunded them to follow, as himselfe led the way. And
forthwith, he set forward in a running march. But when he understood once,
that the way leading to the Court, was so narrow that it might not receive
them marching all afront, he commaunded the<note n="*" place="margin">Formost.</note> first regiment of a thousand to
follow in their place, and the second to march after in the taile of it. And in
this manner he went himselfe alwaies formost, never resting betweene; and the
other thousands followed every one hard at the heeles of the former. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
he sent two<note n="*" place="margin">s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rgeants.</note> Officers of purpose unto the entry of the way for to instruct
any one that was ignorant and to seeke, what to doe. Now when they were
come before the gates of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his Palace, hee commaunded the formost
Centurion to arrange his Companie so, as they might stand 12. in file, deep,
and to place the leaders of every 12. afront before the Palace. The like charge
he caused to be given unto the second, and so throughout to all. Which they
did accordingly. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> presented himselfe to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> in a long <hi>Persian</hi>
robe, nothing proud nor sumptuous. When <hi>Cyaxares</hi> saw him, well pleased
he was with this speedy repaire that he made, but offended at the basenesse of
his garment. How now <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth hee, what meane you by this, to shew
your selfe in so simple habit before the Indians? I would have had you most
stately and gloriously to be seene. For, an honour it would have beene to me,
that you my sisters sonne had beene set out and arrayed most royally. To this
<hi>Cyrus</hi> made answer in this wise. Whether should I have honoured you more,
good Vnkle <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> if being clad in purple, putting on bracelets and wearing
a colar about my necke, I have accomplished your will and commandement
by leasure, or rather as now I doe, obey you so speedily with so great and
goodly a power, and all, to doe you honour; adorned (as you see) my selfe,
and so adorning you with swett and through diligence? teaching others also
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19319:36"/>
thereby, to be likewise obedient unto you? Thus spake <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
well of his speech: and thereupon commaunded the Indians to be brought
forward for audience: Who being come in place, The <hi>Indian</hi> King our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
say they, hath sent us with commission, to demaund the cause, wherefore
the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Assyrians</hi> make warre one against the other? and upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of your answer, he willed us to go on directly to the <hi>Assyrian</hi> King, and of
him likewise to demaund the same: but in conclusion, to declare vnto you both:
That the <hi>Indian</hi> King, upon consideration of right and Iustice, will take part
with him that hath the wrong. To which Embassage <hi>Cyaxares</hi> returned this
answer. Give eare then unto my words. No wrong at all doe wee unto the
<hi>Assyrian</hi> King. And now, go your wayes yee may unto him, and enquire what
he saith. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> being there present, Pleaseth it you, quoth he unto <hi>Cyaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
that I also may deliver mine opinion? Say on, quoth <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and speake
your minde. Yee then, saith <hi>Cyrus</hi> unto the Embassadors, shall thus report un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King your Master. That, unlesse it seeme good otherwise to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi>
wee make this answer. That if the <hi>Assyrian</hi> King say, he hath in any thing bin
injured by us, wee are content to accept of the <hi>Indian</hi> King himselfe to be the
Iudge. When they heard this, they tooke their leave and departed.</p>

Affaire, and about levying summes of money, enterprised warre
upon the King of Armenia.</head>
               <p>AFter that the <hi>Indian</hi> Embassadours were gone forth, <hi>Cyrus</hi> began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
with <hi>Cyaxares</hi> in this manner. Sir, hither came I to you bringing
from home with mee no great store of treasure properly mine owne:
And how much so ever it was, that I had, there is but very little left thereof,
for that I have spent it upon my souldiers: Now haply you marvaile how I
have consumed it, considering they are at your finding. But I would have you
to know, that I have done nothing else therwith but bestowed it in gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
whensoever I admired any one of my souldiours: For, thus I thinke, That
a man may better and with more pleasure incite by faire language and well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
rather than by hard dealing and compulsion, all those whose helpe hee
would use in any businesse whatsoever: so likewise, he that is desirous to have
in warre affaires, willing and forward coadjutours, must in my judgement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
and winne them altogether with gracious words and liberall deeds. For,
friends they must be and not foes, who shall unfainedly and without pretense of
excuse assist us in war, and fight by our side as who will never envie their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in weale, nor shrinke and forsake him in woe: Vpon these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
me thinks I had need of much treasure. For, to have mine eye for every
thing upon you, whom I perceive to be at very great expense, seemeth to me
absurd: And therefore, I deeme it meet both for you and me to consider up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this point together in common, that you be not bare of money. For, if you
be throughly stored, well I wote, that I also may have my part thereof at my
need whensoever: especially, if I take the same to such an use, as the defraying
thereof may turne to your better profit. I remember I heard you say of late,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19319:37"/>
that the <hi>Armenian</hi> King slighteth you at this present, because hee heareth say,
there be enemies comming against us, and so neither sendeth unto you an army,
nor payeth you the tribute due, as he ought. Hee doth so indeed good <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
quoth he. And therefore I stand now in doubt, whether it were better for me
to make warre upon him, and so to try what I can doe by force: or now for my
behoufe, to let him alone at this time, for feare wee make the number of our
enemies the greater by him. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> replyed and asked, What! Doe the
<hi>Armenians</hi> dwell in places surely situate, or in such as be easie of accesse? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
answered <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> Their houses be not seated very strongly. For, I have
not beene carelesse in that behalfe. Howbeit there be certaine hils, into which
if<note n="*" place="margin">The Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King.</note> he retire, he may straight-wayes be in such safety as that he need not yeeld
unto the enemy either himselfe or whatsoever he can convey thither, unlesse he
would beleaguer him a long time, with a standing campe, as my Father some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
did. Hereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> inferred thus. If you will send me, and give me the
conduct of a troupe of horsemen, such as you shall thinke sufficient, I trust with
the leave and helpe of God, to cause the <hi>Armenian</hi> King both to send unto you
an army, and also to pay you the tribute. Yea, and I hope besides, that much
more friendly he will be to us, than now he is. And even I too, quoth <hi>Cyaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
am verily perswaded, that they will all rather come in and side with you
than with us. For, I heare say, that some of the Kings children were wont to
be your companions in hunting, who perhaps will joyne with you againe. But
if some of them be subdued and brought under your hand, all things will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
as wee would our selves. How then, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> thinke you it not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to conceale these d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssignes of ours? Yes truly, quoth <hi>Cyaxares;</hi> For, by this
meanes, both some one of them we shall take the sooner, and also if a man should
invade them, they might be surprized lesse provided. Listen then, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
whether I shall seeme unto you to say somewhat to the purpose? Many a time
have I, with all the <hi>Persians</hi> that were with mee, hunted about the confines of
your land and the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and otherwiles having joyned unto mee some
horsemen, (those I meane who were my friends and familiars here in <hi>Media</hi>)
made a journey thither. Therefore, quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> if you enterprise the like
now, you should never be suspected. But if your forces appeare much greater,
than you were wont to take with you a hunting, then it were very suspitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
Yet may we devise a pretty perswasive pretense quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> for this:
Namely, if some one give it out and carry word thither, that I have a desire to
make a great hunting, &amp; seeme withal to crave openly of you certain horsmen.
Well said of you, quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and I my selfe will not willingly graunt unto
you but a meane sort, making semblance, as though I meant my selfe, to goe
unto my Forts and Castles which frontier next unto <hi>Assyria.</hi> For, in very truth,
I intend a journey thither, to fortifie the same holds, and make them as sure as
possibly I can. Now when you are set forth with those forces of your owne,
and have hunted two daies, I wil send unto you a sufficient strength of horse and
foot, levied already about me: which when you have received, you may direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make an invasion. And I for my part, ready to second you with the rest of
my forces, will doe my best not to bee farre from you; to the end that when I
see my time, I may shew my selfe in the field. Thus <hi>Cyaxares</hi> assembled out of
hand horsemen and footmen both, for his holds: and withall sent waggons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with victuals, the very way that led to the said Forts. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19319:37"/>
sacrificed in regard of this expedition, and therwith sent unto <hi>Cyaxares,</hi>
requesting that he might have the younger horsemen: and notwithstanding,
many were ready to follow as voluntaries, yet he graunted unto him but few.
When <hi>Cyaxares</hi> had now put himselfe upon his way, with a power of foot and
horse toward his fortresses, <hi>Cyrus</hi> hapned to have a lucky Sacrifice, presaging
fortunate successe in his journey against the Armenian [King]: and so he set
forward, as one well appointed onely for to hunt. And as he marched on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
in the very first open field that he came into: he presently started an Hare:
and with that an AEgle flying on the lucky hand; having espied the Hare run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
made wing, strake her, caught her up, and away: Now when shee had
carried the Hare to the next hill top, shee seized on her prey, as shee would her
selfe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> observing this signe, rejoyced in his heart, and therewith worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Iupiter King, and said unto those that were present: My friends, This will
be I trust in God, a faire and pleasant Chace. When they were come hard to
the Frontiers, he hunted streightwaies, as his manner was. And verily, the
common sort as well of footmen as of horsemen, coursed and galloped to and
fro, intending thereby to rouse the Deere: but the best and chiefe of horse and
foot both were divided, to stand at the receit of the beast being once a-foot,
and to follow the game. So within few houres, they tooke many wild Bores,
<note n="*" place="margin">Stags</note> Harts,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> fallow Deere, and wild Asses. For, in these parts there be many such
Asses bred, even at this day. When they had given over hunting for that day,
so soone as he was entred into the marches of the Armenians, he supped. The
next day he hunted againe, approching nigh to those mountaines, which hee
desired to gaine: And here likewise after hee had done hunting hee tooke his
supper. But so soone as he discovered the power that <hi>Cyaxares</hi> sent, advancing
neere at hand, he dispatched secretly a messenger, willing them, to fall off, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two parasangs from him, and there to goe to supper: Foreseeing, that this
would much availe to conceale his comming from the enemies: And so soone
as he had supped, hee commaunded that their<note n="*" place="margin">Or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundet.</note> Captaine should repaire unto
him. When supper was done, he called likewise before him the Centurions,
unto whom being present he spake in this wise.</p>

               <p>MY good friends, the Armenian King, hath before-time beene confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and as a Tributary done homage unto him. But
now, upon intelligence of our enimies comming, hee setteth him at
nought, and neither sendeth us an armie, nor payeth tribute, therefore must we
hunt him now if we can: and in this manner, quoth he, I thinke it good, that we
proceed. You <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> after that you have gotten some moderate sleepe,
take with you the one halfe of the Persians which are with us: enter the way
of the mountaines and seize those hils first, unto which, they say he useth to flie,
when he is in feare: I my selfe will give unto your guides for your better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
And verily, these hils, by report, be so thicke overspred with trees, that I
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19319:38"/>
hope yee shall not be descried. Howbeit, if you send forth before the armie,
certeine nimble fellowes lightly appointed, resembling both for number and
apparell brigands and robbers: If they chance to light upon any of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,
looke whomsoever they can catch, them will they be sure to keepe
and make sure for telling tales: and whom they shall not be able to take, they
will yet hold them so farre all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of, as that they shall not have a sight of our
maine hoast, but consult togither as touching you, as of theeves and none other.
Thus I say, doe you. As for my selfe, by day-breake, I will with the other
moitie of the Infantery, and the whole Cavallery, take to the plaine and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
way, marching directly to the Court where the King lyeth. Then, if he
make head against us and resist, it is a plaine case, that of necessitie, fight wee
must. But say that he retireth and leaveth the even ground, evident then it is,
that we are to course and pursue him. Suppose he flieth to the hils, then quoth
he, it will be your part, to let none of them escape that shall come thither unto
you. Make the case thus, as in hunting: Imagine we be the hounds, that seeke
and finde out; and your selfe the huntsman, that keepeth by the net and toile.
Remember therefore, that all the Avenues must be stopped before the hunting
is begun. Moreover; close they ought to be and secret who are appointed to
keepe the passages, in case they would not have the wild beasts to be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
that are running forth toward them. Howbeit, doe not you, good <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santas,</hi>
as you are wont sometime to doe, for the love you have to hunting.
For, often-times you passe the whole night in businesse without sleepe. But
now, permit you must your souldiers, to take their rest moderately, that they
may be able to fight against sleepe and resist it. Neither (because your selfe
can raunge and wander over the mountaines, having no men to be your guides,
but the skill to follow that way whereas the beasts went before) may you
therefore at this time, goe likewise in places hardly passable: But give you
charge unto your guides to lead you the easiest way, if so be there be not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
farre shorter. For, the easiest way, is the speediest for an armie and soonest
dispatched. Ne, yet must you lead your men a running march, for that you
have beene wont to runne over the hils: but see you goe before them a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
pace, that the armie may conveniently follow. It were good also, that some
of the most able and forwardest men staying behind, should encourage the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that when as afterward that wing passeth on, which is to incite the rest
for to make speed, all the souldiers therein compared to those that goe an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
foot pace, may seeme to runne. <hi>Chrysantas</hi> having heard thus much, and
ioying greatly in his heart, that he had received these advertisements from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
tooke with him his guides, and departed. Now when he had told them
that should goe with him, what they were to doe, he tooke his repose. After
they had rested so long as he thought meet, he advanced toward the hils. But
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> by that time it was day-light, sent a pursuivant before unto the King of
Armenia, with instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to deliver this message unto him &amp; to say, <hi>Cyrus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
you, ô King of Armenia, thus to doe: namely to repaire unto him with
all speed, bringing with you both your tribute &amp; also a power of men. If he aske
you where I am? Tell truth and say, that I am within his marches. If he demand
whether my selfe am comming forward in person? Answere hereto also, and
that truly, that you know not. But if he enquire, how many we are strong? Bid
him send some men to know. Thus dispatched he the messenger away with this
errand. For he thought it stood better with courtesie and humanitie, in this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19319:38"/>
wise to deale, than to come upon him at unwares without any warning. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
being sufficiently every way provided, both to goe through his journey,
and also to fight if need required, set forth and marched forward. But, hee
made Proclamation before unto all his souldiers, That they should doe wrong
to no person. And if any of them chaunced to light upon an Armenian, to
bid him be of good cheere and feare nothing: and withall to permit every man
that were so disposed, to keepe mercate in those places where they abode: with

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>YRVS verily was thus busied in these affaires. But the
King of Armenia upon the mandate of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> delivered
by his Herault, was much affrighted: considering especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that he did wrong both in with-holding tribute, and
also in not sending an Armie. And this most of all hee
feared, least he should be seene for to have begun to build
and fortifie his Palace so, as it might be able to keepe out
his enemies. Being therefore much perplexed by all these occasions: He sent
forth Commissioners into divers parts [of his Kingdome] for to assemble
his owne forces, and withall, conveied away into the mountaines his younger
sonne <hi>Sabaris,</hi> his owne wife, his sonnes wife and his daughters, togither with
their ornaments, furniture and Iewels of great valew, appointing a convoy
of purpose to conduct them safe. He made out also certeine men in espiall, to
see what <hi>Cyrus</hi> did; yea and did put in order of battaile those Armenians who
were come unto him. And within a while, others repaired unto him with
newes, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> in person was at hand. But then, his heart would serve him
no longer for to try a battaile: and so, secretly withdrew himselfe out of the
way. Now when the Armenians saw him so to doe, they also fled home eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, intending to remove their goods farther off. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, beholding the
fields, how full they were of those that ranne straggling here and there shifting
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19319:39"/>
for themselves, and driving before them their cattell, sent after, and did them to
understand, That he meant not to proceed in hostile manner against any one
that would tarry: but if he tooke any flying away, hee denounced aforehand
that he would deale with them as enemies. By this meanes the vulgar sort, and
the most part stayed: Howbeit, divers there were, that privily conveyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
away with the King. When as now they that were gone afore with the
women, fell within the danger of them that kept the mountaines, they set up
by and by a great and piteous cry, and as they fled, very many of them were
taken. In the end, the Kings sonne, the wives also and daughters aforesaid
were taken captive, and all the goods and treasure seized upon, which they had
carryed with them. The King himselfe, when hee understood what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne
unto them, being in doubt what to doe, and which way to turne him, fled
up to a certeine hill top for to save himselfe. Which <hi>Cyrus</hi> likewise seeing, with
the power he had about him, laid siege to the hill round about: He sent also to
<hi>Chrysantas,</hi> willing him to abandon the Keeping of the foresaid mountaine and
to come unto him. Meane while that <hi>Cyrus</hi> his armie assembled, he sent unto
the Armenian King an Herald, by whom he demaunded these questions. Tell
me directly, King of Armenia, whether you will remaine there still to wrestle
and fight with hunger and thirst, or come downe into the plaine and fight it
out with us? The Armenian King answered, that he would fight with neither.
Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent eft-soones and asked in these termes, Why then sit you there
and come not downe? Because, quoth he, I am to seeke what to doe. But you
neither need nor ought to doubt, replyed <hi>Cyrus;</hi> For you may come downe to
plead your owne cause. And who shall be our judge? saith the King. Who
but he? saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> unto whom God hath given power, without forme of law
and judiciall processe, to use you at his pleasure? The King then, considering
into what streights he was driven, descended from the hill top. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi>
having taken both him and all other things also that he had, into the middle
space betweene, environed them round within his tents; For, now by this
time, had he all his forces about him. At this very instant, the Kings eldest
sonne, <hi>Tigranes,</hi> who before-time had accompanied <hi>Cyrus</hi> in hunting, was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
returned from a certeine journey: And hearing what occurrents were falne
out, went directly, even as he was, to <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But so soone as he saw his father
and mother, his brethren, sisters, and his owne wife captives, he wept as good
reason he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> when he beheld the man, used no other complement of courtesie and
entertainment, but thus said unto him. Come you are in good season, that you
may be present to heare your fathers cause tried. And therewith immediately
he assembled together the Chiefetaines and Rulers, as well of the <hi>Persians</hi> as
of the <hi>Medes:</hi> He called likewise to this Councell, as many of the Nobles and
Honorable persons of <hi>Armenia</hi> as were present: The very women also being
there in their Carroches he excluded not, but admitted them to the audience of
his cause. Now, when he was provided accordingly and saw his time, turning
to the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> thus began he to speake. First, quoth hee, ô King of
<hi>Armenia,</hi> I advise you in the deciding of this matter, to speake the truth: that
you may be cleere at least of that one thing, which of all others deserveth most
hatred. For, this would I have you to wit well, That to be taken with a lye,
is the greatest barre that men can have against obtaining of grace and pardon.

Moreover, even your children and these women here your wives: many <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi>
also that be in place, are privie to you of all that which you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
Who, if they perceive you to speake otherwise than truth, will thinke
that you judge your owne selfe worthy to suffer all extremities, when I shall
once finde out the truth. Propose then, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> what questions you
will: For, utter the truth I shall, come of it what will. Why then quoth <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
Answere directly unto me. Made you warre at any time upon <hi>Astyages</hi> my
mothers father and the rest of the <hi>Medes?</hi> I did, said he. And when you were
vanquished by him, Did you not covenant and accept of these conditions. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis,
to yeeld him tribute. Item to aide him with men in his warres, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he gave you warning? and lastly to hold no fortresses in your realme?
It was even so indeed, answered hee: Now therefore why have you falsified
your faith, and neither tendred your tribute, nor sent a power for aide, but have
walled your forts? Because, saith he, I was desirous of liberty. For, I thought
it a noble thing both my selfe to be free, and also to leave the same freedome
to my children. Certes, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a worthy matter it is for a man to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that he may never come into bondage: but if one either defeated in war,
or otherwise brought into servitude, be taken practizing to revolt and shake off
alleageance unto his Lords, tell me, you first, doe you honour him as a good
man and behaving himselfe well, or punish him as a trangressour, after you have
taken him? Surely I punish him quoth he. For you allow me not to lye. Then,
answer me plainely and punctually quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> to these Interrogatories. If
any man in place of authority and commaund under you, doe offend and deale
unjustly, suffer you him to beare rule still, or appoint you another in his roome?
I place another, saith he in his stead. And, say, such an one be very wealthy
and full of money; permit you him to be rich still, or bring you him to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
I take from him quoth the King, whatsoever he hath. If you understand
that he fall away from you, and taketh part with the enemie, what doe you to
him then? I put him to death, said he. For, why should I die convicted of
leasing, rather than confessing the truth? Then his sonne hearing these words
plucked in peeces, the Turbant from about his owne head: and withall rent his
mantell and upper garments. The women also piteously cried out and tare
themselves, as if both father had beene even then condemned and a dead man,
and all of them besides undone for ever. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> willing them to be silent,
said thus againe. Well, be it so, I have enough. These bee just and rightfull
courses in your owne practise, ô King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> But what would you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
us hereupon to doe? The <hi>Armenian</hi> held his tongue, as being doubtfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he should advise <hi>Cyrus</hi> to put him to death, or teach contrary to that which
he said himselfe did. But his sonne <hi>Tigranes,</hi> demaunded of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and said.
Tell me, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (because my father seemeth to stand in suspence) whether I shall
advise you concerning him what I thinke will be best and most expedient for
you to doe? <hi>Cyrus</hi> having observed well enough, what time as <hi>Tigranes</hi> used to
hunt with him, that he entertained a certaine learned man, who was very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
and in wonderfull esteeme with him, desired greatly to heare, what hee
could say: and therefore bad him speake his mind boldly. If you approve saith
<hi>Tigranes</hi> either the designes by my father intended, or the acts by him already
done, I advise you in any hand to imitate him: but if in your opinion he hath
altogether faulted, I would give you counsell not to follow him. Then quoth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19319:40"/>
                  <hi>Cyrus,</hi> If I doe right, I may not in any wise take him doing thus amisse, for an
ensample. True, said <hi>Tygranes:</hi> By your reason then, inferred <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I must pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
your Father, in case it stand with justice to chastice a man that doth
wrong. Yea, but whether thinke you it is better ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth <hi>Tigranes,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
unto punishment with your owne good and profit, or to your owne hurt
and detriment? Not thus, saith <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for, so, should I punish my selfe. Yea
quoth <hi>Tigranes</hi> and much hinder and endammage your owne estate, if at such a
time you killed any of your liege men when they might stand you in greatest
stead to be kept alive. But how can those men be prized so high, when they be
taken in the manner doing injurie? Yes verily as I thinke saith <hi>Tigranes,</hi> if then,
they may proove wise and sound-hearted. For, this is mine opinion, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
that without the mind bee seasoned with prudence, no other vertue availeth
ought. For what use can there bee of a strong and stout man, or of a valiant
Knight? what profit may one make of a skilfull horseman if he be not wise and
discreet withall? Nay, what commodity may arise from a wealthy person, or
a mighty man in a City, if discretion be away? But with wisedome, every friend
is profitable yea and every servant good and commodious. This is then, the
meaning of your words quoth <hi>Cyrus:</hi> That your Father also even this day, is
of an unwise and inconsiderate man, become wise and discreet. Yes verily quoth
he. Ergo you hold saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that such wisedome and discretion, is an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

What! good <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth he, did you never yet observe, that one man in
his folly taking in hand to fight with another better and mightier than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
so soone as ever he was defeated, gave over straightwaies that folly of his
shewed toward the other? Againe, have you never seene that one City standing
out against another, presently after it hath beene conquered, chuseth rather to
obey that other, than to maintaine fight any longer? But what calamity of
your fathers can you alleadge, that you may so confidently avouch him to bee
made wise and considerate? Even that, said <hi>Tigranes,</hi> whereby hee is privy to
himselfe, that for a greedy desire of liberty, hee is brought to that servitude,
which he never felt before: and that he was not able to effect any of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which he thought either secretly to have held, or by stealth to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed,
or by fine force to have brought to passe. But he knoweth right well,
that wherein so ever you minded to deceive him, you have circumvented him
so, as a man would have deluded the blind or the deafe, and those that had no
wit at all in the world: and what things so ever you thought should be carried
closely, therein he knoweth full well you have beene so secret, as that those
places which he supposed most safe and sure for his refuge, you made the same
his prisons to hold him fast ere he was aware. As for celerity, so farre have
you surpassed him, that comming as you did your selfe<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> from places farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
with a puissant armie, you prevented him before that he could bring his
forces togither. And thinke you in very deed quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> such a foyle as this,
sufficient to make men so wise and wary, as to acknowledge others to be their
betters and superiours? Yes verily said <hi>Figranes,</hi> and much more ywis than
when a man is defaired in battaile. For, it falleth out otherwhiles, that a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
once put to the worse by meere strength, thinketh after he hath exercised
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19319:40"/>
his body, to be better appointed, and to combate againe. Yea, and some cities
forced and wonne, having gotten fresh aides, suppose they are able to try it out
eftsoones by a new conflict. But, looke whomsoever any shall judge to be more
vertuous and wiser than themselves, those many times they are willing to obey,
even without compulsion. You seeme then, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> not to thinke that inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and malapert persons take knowledge of any others more staied and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
than themselves, nor theeves of true men, nor liers of truth speakers, nor
unjust of those that be righteous. And know you not, quoth he, that now also,
your father hath dealt falsely, and not firmely observed covenants with us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he knew, that wee for our parts have not broken the least point and tittle,
of those Articles, which <hi>Astyages</hi> agreed unto? Neither doe I my selfe, quoth
<hi>Tigranes</hi> say this, That it maketh men wise and considerate, barely to know
their betters, unlesse they suffer punishment also at their betters hands: like as it
is my fathers case now. Yea, but your father, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> hath felt as yet no
smart at all. He stands I know well in great feare, that he shall be put to abide
all extremities. And thinke you indeed quoth <hi>Tigranes</hi> that any thing doth cast
men downe and subdue them more than strong feare? or, wote you not, that
those who have felt the edge of the sword, (which of all punishments is thought
to be the sharpest,) will never the lesse encounter the same enemies againe who
wounded them? But such persons as men doe mightily stand in dread of, they
can not endure to looke full upon, although they speak comfortably unto them.
This is then your saying, is it not? quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> That men afraid of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are more punished already, than if they were tortured in very deed.
Why! even your selfe, quoth he, doth know, that I say truth, as well as I can
tell you. For, well you wote, that such as feare to be banished out of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
countrey, such also as being to fight a field, are afraid of an overthrow,
live in continuall anguish. Semblably, they that saile at sea, so long as they
stand in feare of shipwracke: as many also as feare bondage and imprisonment,
by reason of their feare can have no joy, nor receive benefit either of meat or
sleep. Whereas such as be in exile, such as be defaited and brought into servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
already, can otherwhiles eate and drinke, yea and sleep better than those
which are in happy estate. Furthermore, it appeareth even in these persons
more evidently, what a cumberous burden feare is. For, some fearing least af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they be taken prisoners they should bee put to death, die before, for very
feare: partly by throwing themselves downe headlong, partly by strangling
themselves, and in part by cutting their owne throats: So that of all horrible
things in the world, feare most of all terrifieth mens minds. As for my father
here, how is his heart now affected thinke you, standing as hee doth in feare of
Captivitie, not only for himselfe, but also for me, his wife and all his children?
I can easily beleeve in deed quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that he is in this maner much disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
yet am I of this opinion, that incident it is to one and the same man, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
to be proud and insolent: but in calamity to be sodainly dejected &amp; soone
cast downe: howbeit, if upon pardon he recover and be raised up, eftsoones to
looke aloft, to waxe high minded, and ready to stirre up new troubles againe.
True it is ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth <hi>Tigranes,</hi> Our offences are such as give good occasion,
why we should no more be trusted: howbeit in your power it is, both to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
your castles with strong wals, and also to keepe with garrison your sensed
holds, yea and to take what pledges and assurance you will, of our fealty. And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19319:41"/>
verily, quoth he, such persons you shall have of us, as will not greatly grieve
hereat. For, call to mind wee shall, that our selves are the cause of our owne
woes.</p>
               <p>But when you have made over the government of this State, to any one of
those that never trespassed against you, if your selfe shall seeme then distrustfull,
take heed, least as you gratifie and pleasure them; so they withall take you to
be no friend of theirs. Againe, while you would be thought to avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
of their hatred, if you lay no yoke upon them for to keep them under, so,
as that they can commit no insolent parts; beware that hereafter you have not
more need to reclaime them, than now you have to reduce us unto goodnesse
and order. But, for mine owne part quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> so God me helpe, I have me
thinks no minde at all, to put such ministers in trust, whom I know to serve me
upon compulsion. But, as for those, whom I perceive, upon good will and love
unto me, ready to doe their devoir, I suppose I can better beare with them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent
though they be, than such as hate me, doe they never so well, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
all double diligence upon constraint and necessity. To this, replied <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes:</hi>
As whose hands then, can you ever win so much love and friendship, as
now you may gaine of us? Even of those I think, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who never were my
professed enemies, so I would be beneficiall unto them, as you are desirous now
I should be unto you. Why! can you find any man, good <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth hee, at
this time, unto whom you may be so bounteous as unto my father? Say, you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
some one to live, who never did you wrong; what thanks suppose you will
he render unto you? Or, if you bereave him not of wife and children? who will
in this regard affect you more than he, who thinks himselfe to deserve no lesse
than to loose the same? And know you any man that is like to sorrow more, if
he hold not the Kingdome of <hi>Armenia,</hi> than we? Evident therefore it is, quoth
he, that unto whom most anguish and griefe shall redound, if he be not King, the
same also if he receive of you the Kingdome, will yeald unto you the greatest
thanks. Moreover, if you have any care of this also, namely to leave the State
here at your departure in least trouble; consider quoth he, whether you thinke all
will be more quiet, by innovation and change of the Government under a new
Lord, or by suffering the old and received manner to remaine still in force un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their ancient Prince? Semblably if you have an eie to this, how to bring
out into the field a puissant armie: Who, thinke you, will muster and levie it in
better order, than he that hath often used the same? Now, put case you stand in
need of money, whom suppose you meet to raise and procure it for your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than him who both knowes, and hath also under his hand all the store that
is? Beware therefore good <hi>Cyrus,</hi> least by casting off and loosing us, you endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
your selfe more, than my father can hurt or hinder you. To this or the
like effect, spake <hi>Tigranes.</hi>

unto you first, all the forces that I have: which when you see and know what
they be, you may have away with you as great a power as you list, leaving as
much as may serve for the defence of the land. Then, for mony likewise, meet
it is that I should shew unto you all the treasure that I have, whereof you may
take and leave what you thinke good. Goe to then, saith <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Shew unto me
directly what your strength is, and tell mee withall, what store of coine you
have. Hereto the Armenian King returned this answer. Of horsemen the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians
are able to make 8000, and of footmen, 40000. As for mony, quoth
he, togither with the treasures which my father left unto me, being reckoned to
the true rate or valew in silver, it amounteth to more than 3000 talents. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> as one in this behalfe nothing care-lesse said thus: Of your armie
then, because the Chaldees your borderers make warre upon you, send with
me the one halfe: but of your monies, for those 50 talents which you paid as
a tribute, deliver double so much unto <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> in regard of deteining the
payment thereof: And to my selfe you shall lend another hundred talents. For
the lone whereof, I promise, If God speed me, either to doe you greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
or else to repay you the mony, if I be able. If I doe not, thought haply
I may be unsufficient, but judged, worthily, I shall never be unjust. Now for
Gods sake ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> said the Armenian King, use not these words: otherwise,
you shall not have me so confident and trustfull in you. But make this accompt,
quoth he, What monyes so ever you leave us, they are yours no lesse, than those
which you carry from hence. Well said <hi>Cyrus:</hi> But how much mony will you
part withall unto me, for to have your wife againe? Even as much, quoth he,
as I am worth. And what will you give me to enjoy your children also? As
much for them likewise as I can make. By this reckoning then inferred <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
these be prised at twice so much as you possesse. Now, <hi>Tigranes,</hi> to you I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
my speech. With what ransome would you redeeme your wife? (newly
married he was and loved the woman exceeding well) I assure you, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi>

Take her to you, then quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For yours she is: neither doe I repute her

to have beene a captive at all, seeing you never fled from us. You also, King of
Armenia, have away with you both your wife and children without any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

this present take your suppers with us: and when yee have supped: Depart
whither yee list. So they stayed. But after supper, whiles they were yet in the
pavilion, <hi>Cyrus</hi> questioned in this manner, Tell me <hi>Tigranes,</hi> quoth he, what is
become of the Gentleman that was wont to hunt with us: For you highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
him. Why? quoth he, hath not this my father here put him to death?
Of what offense said <hi>Cyrus</hi> was he convict? Hee laid to his charge, quoth he,
that he corrupted me, And yet my deere <hi>Cyrus,</hi> so good a man he was and so
honest, that even then, when he was to die, he called unto mee and said: Bee
not you greived <hi>Tigranes</hi> and offended with your father, in that he mindeth to
take away my life: For he doth not this in any malice, but of errour and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
And what trespasse men upon errour doe commit, I suppose is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their wils. At these words said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Alas good man that he was. But
the Armenian King turning unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> spake in this wise, Neither doe those,
good <hi>Cyrus</hi> who take other men naught with their wives pursue them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to death, for that they make their wives more wanton and unchast; but
because they thinke they steale away their hearts and quench that love which
they owe unto them: in which regard, they proceed against them as very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And even so, Ielous was I and envied that man, because me thought he
was the cause that my sonne admired and esteemed him more than my selfe.
Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> So God me love good King of Armenia, as I thinke your fault was
no other than any man would have done. Therefore <hi>Tigranes</hi> pardon your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>WHEN they were come home, some made report of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
others related his patience and sufferance: one spake of his

<hi>Tigranes</hi> asked his owne wife and said: How now my Armenian Ladie,
Seemed <hi>Cyrus</hi> in your eyes also a faire and beautifull personage? In good faith,

He gave warning also to his owne subjects, such as were to goe to

whether of them twaine would lead the armie? The sonne, or himselfe?
Whereunto both of them made answere: the father in this wise: Even hee
whom you shall commaund; but the sonne after this sort. as for mee ô <hi>Cyrus</hi>
I will not leave you, no though I should follow you hard at heeles as a Campe

be content to give, for to have your wife heare you are become a Campe slave
and to carry fardels? Shee shall never need, quoth he, to heare that. For I will

it were time for you to trusse up and be furnished every way for this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
I make full accompt quoth <hi>Tigranes</hi> that we shall shew our selves in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,

after gifts of friendly entertainment bestowed upon them, went to rest.
The next day <hi>Cyrus</hi> taking to him <hi>Tigranes</hi> with the best and most select horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Medes, as many also of his owne friends as he thought convenient,
rode abroad to view the country of Armenia, devising where he might build
a fortresse. And being mounted up to an hill top, hee asked <hi>Tigranes,</hi> which
were those mountaines from whence the Chaldees used to make rodes downe
into the plaines, and so to drive away booties? Which when <hi>Tigranes</hi> had

And what doe they, saith he, when they have notice of any thing? Every man
saith <hi>Tigranes</hi> makes what hast he can up to the hill tops for to help and succor.
When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard this, and withall beheld the country all about, he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that a great part thereof, lay as wast ground to the Armenians, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled,
by reason of the warres. Then for that time returned they to the armie,
and after supper tooke their repose and slept. The morrow next ensuing, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi>
shewed himselfe ready and well appointed, having raised a power of
foure thousand Horsemen, with ten thousand Archers and as many Targuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
But whiles these forces were a levying, <hi>Cyrus</hi> sacrificed, and seeing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails
of the beasts to be faire and fortunate to him, he called togither the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
both of the Persians and of the Medes, and in the presence of that Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
made this speech. My welbeloved friends, These mountaines that we see,
belong to the Chaldaees, which if we may first be masters off, and on the top
of them build a fort and plant our garrison: of necessitie, as well the Chaldaees
as the Armenians will demeane themselves loyally toward us. As for our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
they betoken all good on our side: and as touching mans alacritie and
humane meanes, nothing will so much help the same forward to the atchieving
of this exploit, as expedition. For, if we can climb up the hils, before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
assemble their power, we shall either gaine the hill tops wholly without
any resistance, or else skirmish with our enemies, when they are but few in
number and feeble in strength. No labour therefore can be easier and more
void of daunger, than if presently we be resolute in celeritie and quicke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.
Arme your selves therefore, on all hands. As for you the Medes, march
on our left hand: but yee the Armenians, goe one halfe of you on the right
side: and the other halfe lead the way in the vaward before us. Yee that bee
horsemen, follow behind in the Rear, to incite and put us forward up the hill,
neither suffer yee any one faintly to draw backe. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus said, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19319:43"/>
arraunged his files directly upward; hee advaunced before the Armie.
The Chaldees, [that lay in espiall] when they perceived the march forcibly
to mount up hill, forthwith signified so much to their fellowes, and so, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
and alarmes from one to another, they drew togither. <hi>Cyrus</hi> also for his
part gave warning to his soldiers saying. These here, ô yee Persians, signifie
unto us that it is high time to make hast. For, if we prevent them, and get the
hill before, our enemies shall be little able to doe ought. Now the Chaldaees
had light bucklers, and two javelins apeece: and these are reputed the most
martiall men of all that country. They serve also in warres as mercenaries and
be alwaies in pay, whensoever any man hath need of them, because, warlike
though they be and valiant, yet are they poore and needy. For, the region which
they inhabite is full of hils, and a small part thereof welthy. Now when the
soldiers about <hi>Cyrus</hi> approched neerer to the hill-tops, <hi>Tigranes,</hi> who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> Wote you not ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth he, that we must fight out of hand:
and the Armenians will not abide the first brunt of the enemies? <hi>Cyrus</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he was not ignorant thereof: in which regard I have already saith he
given order to the Persians to prepare themselves and be in readinesse. For they
are to follow hard, so soone as the Armenians begin to give ground and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
draw the enemies neerer unto us. Thus the Armenians advanced formost in
the vantguard. But the Chaldaees, as many as were present, upon the approach
of the Armenians sodainly setting up a shout, rushed fiercely upon them after
their manner and gave the charge. The Armenians likewise, as they were
wont, received them not, but reculed. Now when the Chaldaees following
them in chace, perceived others with sword in hand to mount up the hill ready
to encounter them afront, some that hapned to joyne in fight were quickly
slaine, others escaped by flight, and certeine of them were taken prisoners. Thus
the hill tops were soone gain'd. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> his souldiers were gotten up
thither, and looked downe toward the habitations of the Chaldaees, they might
perceive how they abandoned the houses that stood next, and so ran away.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> then, as soone as all his soldiers were come togither, commaunded them
to take their dinners: After dinner, having learned that the place of Espiall
where the Chaldaees lay, was both safe and also well watered, presently hee
emmured it in manner of a fortresse. Hee commaunded also <hi>Tigranes</hi> to send
unto his father, willing, and requiring him to make present repaire thither, and
to bring with him all the Carpenters and Masons that were to bee had. So
there was a messenger streight-wayes dispatched unto the Armenian King.
Meane while <hi>Cyrus</hi> with those about him began to build the wall. At which
very time, they presented the captives unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> some bound, and others of
them sore wounded. Whom when he beheld, he commaunded immediately
the bound to be loosed, and such as were hurt to be cured. For which purpose,
he had sent for<note n="*" place="margin">Or Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</note> Physicians. This done, hee said unto the Chaldaees, that his
comming was not either for any desire he had to destroy them, or need to make
warre: but because he would conclude a Peace betweene the Armenians and
the Chaldaees. And before that I was possessed of these hill tops, quoth he,
I wote well yee had no desire of peace. For why? Your owne State was in
safety, and the goods of the Armenians yee harried and carried at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
But now yee see in what case yee stand. I dismisse you therefore that be
prisoners, home to your houses, and give you leave to consult with the rest of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19319:43"/>
the Chaldaees, whether yee will maintaine warre against us, or enterteine amity
with us. If yee make choice of warre, See ye come not hither, if ye be wise,
without armes and weapons, but if yee thinke yee have need of peace, come
hardly unarmed. Will yee become our friends? I will then take care for the
safetie and wellfare of your state. The Chaldaees hearing this, after they had
highly praised <hi>Cyrus</hi> and on all sides given him their hands, departed home.</p>

               <p>THE Armenian King when he heard that <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent for him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
what he had done, taking with him the Carpenters and Masons
aforesaid, and all other things which he thought necessary, repaired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> withall speed possible. No sooner saw hee him, but hee brake out
into these words: Little it is ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that wee men are able to foresee in future
things, and yet attempt and enterprise many desseins. For, ere while, my selfe,
when I went about to compasse my libertie, became a slave more then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and after that wee were taken prisoners, whiles wee made full accompt
that wee were utterly undone, it appeareth now most evidently, that wee are
preserved, no time before, so much. For, those who never ceassed to infest us
many wayes, I see now to be in that case, which I ever wished. And thus much
ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> I would have you to know, that for to disseize the Chaldaees of these
mountaine tops, I would have disbursed much more mony, than your selfe have
of mee. And verily the good turnes which you promised to doe unto us, what
time you received that mony, you have performed already. We acknowledge
our selves therefore to be debters unto you still for other benefits: Which (if
we would not be naughtie persons) it were a shame for us not to requite. And
what requitall soever we make, yet shall wee not be found to have made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
recompense, beseeming so beneficiall a friend. Thus spake the King of
Armenia. But the Chaldaees came unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> as Oratours, beseeching him to
make peace with them: whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> questioned with, in this wise. Crave yee
peace at this time yee Chaldaees, for any thing else, but that yee thinke to live
in more securitie by peace than by warre? considering that wee also said as
much. The Chaldaees made answere, Yea; for, all other things we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
But what and if, replied <hi>Cyrus,</hi> there accrue unto you other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
beside, by the meanes of peace? Then, said they, would wee be the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And what other reason is there, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> why you repute your selves
now to be poore, but for lacke of rich and fertile ground? When they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
to him in this point also. How then? would yee be content, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
to pay so much tribute as the other Armenians doe, so ye may lawfully occupy
and till as much Armenian ground as yee will your selves? Yes, right willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answered the Chaldaees, if we might beleeve, we should susteine no wrong
hereafter. And what say you, King of Armenia, would you have this ground
of yours that now lieth wast, to become tilled, provided, that the occupiers
thereof pay you such rent as you set downe? Yes verily, quoth the King, I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19319:44"/>
would give a great deale of that condition. For, by this means the revenues of
my Crowne should be much augmented. And yee Chaldaees, quoth he, what
say yee to this, considering yee have fertile mountaines, would yee willingly
permit the Armenians to use the same for pasture, yeelding unto you for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturage
a reasonable rent? Yea gladly, said the Chaldaees, for that we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
much profit without any paine and labour. But you King of Armenia,
saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> are you willing to use their pastures, if for a smal commoditie arising
unto the Chaldaees, your selfe may receive farre greater profits? Yea, with all
my heart, quoth he, if I thought I might enjoy the said pasture-ground in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
without molestation. What! might yee not enjoy them safely, if yee had
the helpe of the hill-tops? Yes said the King. Hereat the Chaldaees. But we,
par-die, shall never be able to occupie, wee will not say, their grounds, but not
so much as our owne lands, if so be these be masters of the said hill tops. But,
What! quoth he, if those mountaines may helpe you? Mary, then, answered
they, we should thinke our selves well apayed. But it were not so good for us,
beleeve me said the King, in case they recover the mountaines againe, especially
being walled and fortified. Well then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I will take this course.
The strength of these hill-tops will I deliver to neither of you both: But wee
our selves will hold them in our owne hands; And whether of you wrong the
other, their parts will we take who susteine the wrong. Which when both sides
heard: they praised the devise, and said it was the onely way to establish an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
peace. So upon these capitulations following, they all gave and received
interchangeably hostages for securitie: and agreed it was betweene them, That
they both, should be free one from the other, enterteine mutuall marriages, use
tillage and pasture in common indifferently: and one aid the other if any did
molest either of them. Thus for that time things passed: and the league then
and thus concluded, betweene the Chaldaees and the Soueraine Ruler of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,
remaineth yet in force to this day. Now after these Covenants of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
were confirmed, both parts immediately did put to their helping
hands with great cheerefulnesse, to build and wall the said fortresse as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
strength and defense for them both, and thereto joyntly brought all things
necessary.</p>

               <head type="sub">How Cyrus sent an Embassage unto the Indians: and returning

the Assyrians.</head>
               <p>WHen evening drew neere, <hi>Cyrus</hi> entertained togither with him at
supper both parties, as being now joyned in mutuall amity. And
as they sat at supper, one of the <hi>Chaldaees</hi> began and said: This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
may well be acceptable to all others of our nation. But some <hi>Chaldaees</hi>
there are quoth he, that live by preading and robbing, who neither have skill of
husbandry, nor can abide to till the ground, as wonted alwaies to get their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by the warres. For, they used evermore to drive away booties, and many
a time to serve for wages under the King of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who by their saying is
a Potentate full of gold, and as often under King <hi>Astyages.</hi> Why then, said <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:19319:44"/>
doe they not take wages of me? For I will give them as good pay, as hee,
who ever he be that gave most. This offer of <hi>Cyrus</hi> they accepted and said, that
many would bee right willing to serve him. And thus of these points above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
were they agreed. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, who had heard say that the <hi>Chaldaees</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
had recourse unto the <hi>Indian</hi> King; and calling to remembrance, that
from him there came to the <hi>Medes</hi> certaine persons as Spies to see and learne
what was done among them, and the same afterwards went also to the enemies,
for to have intelligence likewise of their affaires, was willing enough that the
<hi>Indian</hi> King might know what deeds himselfe had atchieved: And therefore he
entred into such a speech as this. Tell me ô King of <hi>Armenia</hi> and yee <hi>Chaldaees,</hi>
If I should dispatch a messenger of mine, unto the <hi>Indian</hi> King, would ye send
any of yours besides, who might both conduct the man in his way, and assist
him also to the obtaining at the said Kings hand, of such things as I desire? For,
I gladly would, we had more money stil, to the end that I might both give large
pay to as many as have need, and also by bountifull gifts grace and honour such
as serve under me, according to their worthinesse. In these regards I say, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
I am to be furnished with great store of treasure. And, albeit I make recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to stand in need, yet gladly doe I spare your monies whom I suppose now
to be our friends: yet, of the <hi>Indian</hi> King I would willingly take the same, if
he would part with it. As for the said messenger, unto whom I will and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
you to allow guides for his conduct, and to be assistant when he is thither
come, he shall speake in this wise, <hi>Cyrus</hi> hath sent me unto you ô King of <hi>India,</hi>
saying that he stands in need of more money: For that he expecteth another
army from home out of <hi>Persia</hi> (and in very deed quoth he, so I doe.) If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you will send him as much money as you thinke good, he saith, that if God
give him good successe, he will endevour so to doe, as that you shall thinke you
have done very well and wisely for your selfe, in gratifying him thus in this
kind. This message shall my Agent deliver from me. Now, for those whom
yee shall send, give them in charge and commission, what your selves shall thinke
requisite. And if, quoth he, we may get money of him, we shall have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
store by us to use. If not, we shall know that we are nothing beholden to
him nor have any cause to thanke him, but may for ought that concerneth him,
order all things to our owne behouse. Thus said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> supposing that those
<hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Chaldaees</hi> who were to goe this journey, would make such reports
of him, as himselfe desired, that all the world should both speake and heare.
And so for that time when they saw good, they dissolved this meeting at sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and went to bed. The day following <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent away the Messenger with
those directions which he had delivered before. The King of <hi>Armenia</hi> likewise
and the <hi>Chaldaees</hi> appointed such persons to accompanie him as they thought
most meet to helpe forward the businesse which they had in commission, and
also to give out of <hi>Cyrus</hi> such speeches as were befitting. After this, when <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
had finished the fortresse and furnished it with garrison souldiours, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as were sufficient, and with all things else necessarie; yea and left as Captaine
over them a <hi>Median,</hi> (in preferring whom he thought to gratifie <hi>Cyaxares</hi> most)
he departed; leading away with him that armie which he had brought thither;
as also those forces which he received from the <hi>Armenian</hi> King, and together
with them such as came from the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> to the number of 4000. who of all
others were reputed the best warriours. Now when he was come downe into
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19319:45"/>
the parts inhabited, there was not an <hi>Armenian,</hi> man or woman that staied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doores, but they all went forth to meet him, rejoycing greatly at this peace:
bringing with them and driving before them, what thing so ever any of them
had worth presenting unto him. Neither was the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> herewith
displeased; for that he thought <hi>Cyrus</hi> would take the more contentment, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus generally honoured of all. In the end came forth likewise his Queene,
with her daughters and younger sonne. And beside other gifts, shee brought
that gold also which before time <hi>Cyrus</hi> refused to take. All which when <hi>Cyrus</hi>
saw, Yee shall never quoth he make me ô <hi>Armenians,</hi> for hire and reward sake
to goe from place to place, and bestow my favours. And you Madame, goe
your waies and keepe the money that you bring, to your selfe, and give it no
more to the King your husband, for to bee buried in the ground: but rather,
therewith set out your sonne right gallantly, and so send him forth to the wars.
Of all the rest, for your selfe, your husband, your daughters and sonnes, have
and hold so much, as by the enjoying thereof and adorning your selves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
you may lead a more deinty and pleasant life: and let it suffice, quoth he,
for the bodies of the dead to be interred. This said, he rode away: whom there
accompanied the King himselfe of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and all the people besides, calling
him their bountifull benefactour, and a worthy good man. Thus they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
untill they had conducted him out of their countrey. The <hi>Armenian</hi> King
then, sent unto him a greater armie, because he had now peace at home. Thus
departed <hi>Cyrus</hi> mightily enriched, not onely by the present treasure that he had
received, but also for that by his good deportment he had made way for much
more whensoever he should need. And so for that time they pitched their tents
in the confines.</p>
               <p>The next morrow, he sent the armie, and part of the money to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> (who
according to his promise was not farre off.) But himselfe, with <hi>Tigranes</hi> and the
Nobles of <hi>Persia,</hi> hunted wheresoever he could meet with game, and merrily
followed his sports. Afterwards, being come into the <hi>Medes</hi> land, hee dealt
money among his owne Centurions, so much as was thought sufficient for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, that they also might have wherewith to honour and reward, those that
served under them, as many as they admited for their valour. For this recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
made he, that if each one performed his part praise-worthy, the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the army likewise would prove right excellent. Furthermore, if himselfe
saw any thing that might adorne the army, the same when he had once gotten
it, hee would bestow upon the best worthy: For, this hee supposed, that what
good thing and beautifull ornament soever the souldiours had, himselfe with all
the same was likewise adorned. And at the very same time, when he distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among them, such presents as he had received, in a frequent assembly of his
Centurions,<note n="*" place="margin">or, File leaders</note> Caporalls, and all those whom he best esteemed, he made a speech
in this wise.</p>
               <p>We seeme now my friends, to conceive a certaine joy, partly because wee
have gotten some wealth: and in part for that we have, wherewith to adorne
those we would, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d whereby our selves may be honoured againe, according
as each one of us is worthy of advancement. But in any wise we must ever call
to remembrance, what manner of feats they bee, which have procured these
good things unto us. For if yee consider well, yee shall find, that yee have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
hereunto, by watching when time required, by travaile and paines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19319:45"/>
by celerity and expedition, and finally by giving no ground unto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
It behooveth you therefore hereafter to be hardy and valiant men, setting
this downe with your selves, that great pleasures and commodities both, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
proceed but from obedience, constancie, labours and perils undertaken in
time convenient. <hi>Cyrus</hi> now perceiving how fresh and able in bodie his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were to endure warre-travailes; how resolute also and courageous in heart
to despise their enemies: what skill beside each one had in every point belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their owne armes: Semblably, seeing them all well disposed and ready
to obey their Rulers. In these respects, desirous he was even now to performe
some of those exploits, which are usually enterprised against enemies: knowing,
that many times by delayes and putting of, Commaunders and Generals find
some alteration even in brave projects and worthy dessignements. Furthermore,
perceiving that many of his souldiers upon an ambitious humour, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
where they strived to surpasse, began to envie one another; for this
cause also desirous he was with all speed to lead them forth into the enemies
countrey, as knowing right well, that common daungers kindle mutuall love
and affection, betweene fellow souldiers; in which case none of them will either
envie others that are set out in bravest armour, or repine at them that be given
to seeke after glory and honour: but rather such persons both praise and also
embrace their like, as reputing them to be joynt labourers with them in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the common good. First and formost therefore, hee harnoised his armie
and marshalled it in as beautifull and excellent order <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

likewise and pety Captaines of smaller bands (for these were free and
not enrolled in the ordinary lists of souldiers; and yet when it was required that
the Generall should be obeied or any charge given, no part of the armie for all
that, was left ungoverned: but all matters else executed well enough by pety
Captaines of 12. and 6. in a crew.) Now after these serviceable men of note
were come togither, <hi>Cyrus</hi> brought them into his Pavilion: and both shewed
unto them, what things were well and in good order, as also instructed them
how the severall forces and Companies of their Allies and Auxiliaries might
be most firme and strong. And when he had so wrought, that even they also
had a longing desire to be employed in some Action, they cared not how soone,
thus he said unto them, Goe your waies now for this time unto your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and instruct every one your owne change, as I have taught you, doing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
your best, to kindle in them all, a servent desire to undertake this expedition:
that with a cheerefull heart yee may every one set forward: and tomorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
shew your selves before <hi>Cyaxares</hi> at the Court gate. Then departed they,
and did accordingly. The next morning by breake of day, those men of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prest to performe their service, were ready at the Palace. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore
being entred in with them to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> began to speake in this manner.</p>

deliver, have beene long since considered upon and approved by you no lesse
than by us: but haply, abashed you are to utter the same, least if your selfe

all one with them; whether wee waite here for them or set forward to meet
them there. In like manner wee also shall be the same in fight, whether we
receive them comming hither, or goe thither and give them battaile.</p>
               <p>But in very truth the hearts of our souldiers we shall finde more courageous,
if we invade our enemies and seeme not loth to affront them and looke them in
the face. Semblably they will bee much more in feare of us, when they shall
heare that we sit not still at home, as men smitten with dread of them, but upon
intelligence of their comming, are ready to encounter them on the way for to
joyne battaile with all speed, and not tarry untill our owne country be enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged,
but preventing their attempts, waste their land first: Certes, if we make
them any whit more fearefull, or our selves bolder, I suppose it will bee to
our great advantage. And by this meanes verily I make accompt, that our
danger will be lesse, and our enemies hazard much greater. Moreover, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was alwaies wont to say, you also to confesse, and all others to accord,
that fields are fought and battailes tried, rather by the resolution of mens
hearts, than the strength of their bodies. Thus verily said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> unto whom
<hi>Cyaxares</hi> made this answere. But I would not have you <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the rest of
the Persians once to suspect, that I thinke much to mainteine you with victuals:
Yet am I also of this minde, that in every respect it will be more expedient for
us, even now to invade our enemies land. Since then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> we concurre
in one opinion, let us joyntly trusse up bagge and baggage and so dislodge, and
in case our sacrifices unto the Gods assent soone unto our desires, with all speed
set forward. Hereupon, after warning given to packe up and to put themselves
in readinesse, <hi>Cyrus</hi> sacrificed to Iupiter King, first: afterwards to the rest of the
Gods: praying withall, that they would vouchsafe to be propitious and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
guides unto the Armie, and shew themselves gracious Assistants, assured
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19319:46"/>

that the armie was wholly assembled togither before him in the very marches,
after tokens likewise of bird-flight, promising happy successe, he did set foot
within the enemies country. And no sooner was hee entred the borders, but
presently hee there procured the gracious favour of Dame <hi>Tellus,</hi> with Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
and liquid offerings. The Gods also and inhabitant Patrons of Assyria
he pacified with solide hosts and sacrifices. Which complements done and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he sacrificed eft-soones to Iupiter, the Protectour of his owne native soile

to give them battaile.</head>
               <p>WHEN all these things were accomplished in good sort, the Infantery
forthwith marched on and made no great journey but soone pitched
their tents. Howbeit, having put forth the Cavallery to make incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and to raunge abroad, they gate great pillage of all things. Then remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
they, and being now furnished with all provision necessary, and forraging
the country still, they encamped and waited the enemies comming. Now,
when noised it was that their army was on foot and within ten daies journey,
<hi>Cyrus</hi> said, It is now high time ô <hi>Cyaxares</hi> to put on, and to meet with them:
And let us give no cause to be thought, either of our enemies or our owne men,
to shrinke backe, and not to abide them, but rather shew our selves not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to fight. When <hi>Cyaxares</hi> allowed well hereof, they marched on alwaies
after, in battaile ray, going forward every day as farre as they thought good.
As for their suppers they never tooke them but by day-light: and in the night
they made no fires within the campe. Howbeit, before the campe they burnt
fire, to the end that by the light thereof, they might see if any came by night
towards them, and yet not be seene themselves. Many times also, to deceive
the enemie they did set fires aburning behind the campe: whereby otherwhiles
the enemies spies fell into the hands of their formost escont-watch: For, by
reason that the said fires were behind, they thought themselves had beene yet
farre from the campe. Now the Assyrians with their Confederates and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
after that the Armies approched one the other, entrenched themselves, A
thing that the Barbarian Kings use to do even at this day. For, when they pitch
their tents, an easie matter it is for them to cast a trench about their campe, so
many hands have they to set on worke. And, they know that a power of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the night is soone disordered, and so of little or no service, especially if
it consist of Barbarians: For, such use to have their horses tied by the feet at
their mangers: And if any man should charge upon them, a labour it wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

night to unloose the horses, a trouble to bridle them, a paine to saddle and trap
them, much adoe also to bard them and doe on their harnois. Yea and when
they are mounted on horsebacke, impossible it is by any meanes to ride them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19319:47"/>
through the campe. For all these causes, they also like as all other Barbarians
enclosed these within certeine fortifications, thought they might being thus
within the safegard of a sensed place, fight when they list themselves, and not
otherwise. Whiles they were thus busied, they approched one the other, and
being about a<note n="*" place="margin">About three miles and three quarters Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</note> Parasang off, the Assyrians encamped thus as I said, in a place
entrenched round about, howbeit open and exposed to the eye. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
his tents, as much out of sight as possibly he could, as having of purpose
sought out certeine villages, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts and mounts, afront his campe, thinking that
all his warlike equipage sodainly presented, would be more terrible to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.
And verily that night, after the Sentinels set, as requisite it was, they
betooke themselves on either side to rest. The day ensuing, the Assyrian King
and <hi>Croesus,</hi> with all the other Commaunders, kept their forces quiet within
their Strength and rested still: But <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> stood embattailed, ready
to fight if the enemies came forward. But when it was for certeine knowne,
that they would not that day issue forth without their rampier, nor intended to
fight, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> calling for <hi>Cyrus</hi> and all the gallants and men of Action, spake
unto them in this wise. My friends, I am of this minde, that thus well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as we are, we ought to march unto the assault of our enemies rampier, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to shew that we for our parts are willing to fight. For, if by this bravado,
they will not come forth against us, our men shall be the better encouraged in
giving the attempt: and our enemies upon the sight of our boldnesse and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
more daunted. This was the advise of <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> But <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For the love
of God, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> let us not doe so. For, if according to your minde
wee shew our selves, and goe forward; our enemies will looke upon us now,
with no feare at all, as we come upon them knowing themselves, as they doe,
to be in a place of securitie so as they can receive no hurt: and more than that,
when as we retire without effect, they eft-soones seeing our forces far inferiour
to theirs, will despise the same, and to morrow sally forth with much more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and resolution. Now for this present, knowing us as they doe, to be here,
and yet not seeing us, beleeve me verily, they set not light by us, but must they
doe and marvaile what we meane, neither ceasse they, I dare well say, to talke
and discourse of us. But when they shall come forth first, then will it behoove
us both to appeare in sight and at once to encounter and buckle with them; as
having found them where heretofore we long desired. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus
said, both <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and the rest also agreed thereunto. Then therefore, having
taken their suppers, set the watch and made fires accordingly before the same,
they went to bed and slept.</p>

them made this speech. The Gods, my deere friends, as both Divinors say
and I my selfe accord, fore-tell us that a battaile there will be; They also give
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19319:47"/>
us victory, and in the Intrailes promise unto us safety. Now, to admonish you, in
what sort ye should beare your selves in this affaire, abathed I am. For, I know,
that in these points, yee are as skilfull and expert as my selfe, as who have stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
meditated and heard, yea and continually do heare these things as well as I:
in so much as you by good right teach others the same. But if ye have not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
understood and learned so much, listen then to me. These here our Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats,
whom we have newly taken unto us, and endevour to make like unto our
selves, we must put in minde, for what cause we have beene maintained by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares?</hi>
what exercises wee have beene trained in, and to what purpose wee
have called them hither? as also in what regard they have given i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t of
sword. This also yee ought to recall into their remembrance, that this is the
very day, which will declare what rewards each one is worthy off. For, such
things as men be late ere they learne, no mervaile it is, if some of them have
need of one also to suggest and prompt unto them. Yea, a blessed turne it
were, if men might become valiant, even by the instinct and provocation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And verily in so doing, yee shall give good proofe of your selves withall.
For, he that is able in such a matter as this, to better others and make them
more valiant, may without question be privy to himselfe, that he hath attei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the perfection of valour. Whereas, he who being able to enforme himselfe
in these things, resteth therein, supposing it sufficient; and proceedeth no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is by good reason to hold himselfe but halfe perfect. And for this cause,
I deliver not thus much to them, but charge you to declare the same, that they
may endevour to give you content. For, yee also are next conversant with them,
every one in his owne particular. And this, quoth he, would I have you to
know: that so long as ye shall be seene of them full of valour and resolution,
yee shall become masters and teachers, both to them and also to many more,
not in word, but in deed, for to be likewise valiant and courageous. At the last,
he knit up his speech with bidding them to goe to dinner wearing guirlands on
their heads: and after the complements of sacred libations performed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire

               <head type="sub">How the King of Assyria issued out of his campe to fight a field, and
made a speech unto his soldiours. How Cyrus and they
afterwards joyned battaile, wherein the Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
were discomfited.</head>
               <p>THus were the souldiers of <hi>Cyrus</hi> occupied; by which time the <hi>Assyrians</hi>
having dined already, sallied boldly out of their campe, made a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado,
and with resolute hearts stood strongly appointed in battaile ray.
The King himselfe in person, mounted in his chariot did put them in order, and
withall in this manner exhorted them. Now is the time ô yee <hi>Assyrians</hi> when
yee must shew your valour: For, now are yee to fight for your lives, for the
soyle wherein yee were borne, for the houses in which yee were fostered, for
your wives and children, and for all the goods that yee have. If yee atchieve
the victorie, Lords yee shall be of all this as heretofore: but if ye be vanquished,
wote well that yee must forgoe all, and leave the same to your enemies. Stand
to it therefore and fight manfully, as becommeth those that affectionately do
love victorie. For, meere folly it were, that such as desire victory should flie
away and turne unto the view of their enemies the blind backe parts, such as be
neither armed nor furnished with hands. And, a foole he is, who desirous to live,
goes about to run away, as being assured that the winners are they who shall be
safe, where as they that flie, shall sooner die than those that tarry by it. A foole
also he is and no better who coveting wealth, suffreth himselfe to be overcome.
For, who knoweth not that the Conquerours save their owne goods, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the same, gaine also the goods of their enemies conquered? Whereas they
that be subdued, shall at once lose both themselves, and all that they have.
Whiles the <hi>Assyrian</hi> King was thus busied, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> sent some unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who
said, That now the opportunity of time served to lead forward and to set
upon the enemie. For, how ever few of them are issued forth without the
trench, by that time quoth he that we be come unto them, they will be very
many. Let us not stay therefore and wait untill they be more in number than
we: but set forward whiles we thinke we may easily overmatch them. <hi>Cyrus</hi>
answered, I would have you to understand ô <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> that unlesse more than
the halfe part of them be vanquished, they will give out, that we for feare of
their multitude did charge but a few of them, and therefore they will not take
themselves to be defaited: so that you must then fight a second field, wherein
peradventure they will be better provided and use more policy than now they
doe offring themselves to us: so, as that we may at our owne choise, fight with
what number soever we will. The messengers when they heard this departed.
Meane while, <hi>Chrysantas</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> came, and certaine other of the Peeres and
Gentlemen, bringing with them those that had runne from the enemies part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them: Of whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> enquired, as meet it was, what his enemies were a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Who answered, That they were already come forth of the campe all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
That the King himselfe being without, was setting them in array, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
them ever as they issued forth with many words and those very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
as they affirmed, who heard him speake. Hereat <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> What and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19319:48"/>
if quoth hee you also ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> would draw your souldiers togither while you
have time and exhort them, should not you likewise make them more hardie?
Tush, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> let the perswasive orations of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> King my good <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santas,</hi>
never trouble you: For, no exhortation wil be so effectual, as to make men
the very same day that they heare it, of cowards to be valiant: nor Archers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they had beforehand beene exercised in that feat: nor Darters, ne yet hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
nay it will not worke thus much, as to cause them to be able in body, for
to endure paines taking, except they were trained before therein. But yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Chrysantas,</hi> it would suffice, if by your exhortation you could but make
their hearts more courageous. Why! quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is one dayes work, or one
oration able, not onely to replenish the hearts of the hearers with modest
shame, or reclaime them from things dishonest and unbeseeming, but also to
excite and stirre them up, for the love of praise and glory to determine for to
undergoe all labour, and adventure all perils, and to grow unto this stedfast
resolution, that better it is for men to fight valiantly and so to die, than to run
away and save their lives? Also, to the imprinting, quoth he, of such thoughts
in mens minds, and to retaine the same there firmely fixed, is it not behovefull,
That first there were such positive lawes, by vertue whereof, for valiant men
there should be provided a worshipfull and free life, but upon cowards might
be imposed a base, grievous and unpleasant condition? Then, there ought to be
Mrs. I suppose, and Governors appointed beside, who may rightly instruct &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome
them to perform the same so long, untill this opinion be surely settled,
namely to repute in very deed valiant and noble men happiest, and to thinke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and obscure persons of all others most miserable. For, in this wise ought
they to be affected, who will shew, that discipline availeth more than the feare
that ariseth from the enemies. But, if a man, when souldiours are going armed
into the field (what time many of them forgoe and forget even their old lessons
and principles) were able at the instant, with a subitary speech to make them
brave and worthy warriours, certes, it were the easiest matter in the world, both
to learne and also to teach the most excellent vertue of all others that belongeth
to a man. And verily, for mine owne part, I would not beleeve, That even these
here whom we have now with us, and have trained up and exercised, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
persevere and abide to the end, but that I see you present in place, both
willing to give them good example how they ought to carry themselves, and
able also to suggest unto them, that which haply they have forgotten. But as
for those quoth he, my <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> who are altogither raw and untrained in
vertue and prowesse, I would much marvaile if an oration with a goodly grace
pronounced, could helpe them more to attaine unto valiantnesse, than a
song sweetly chaunted, edifie those in the knowledge of musicke, that are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
ignorant of that science. In this manner reasoned and discoursed they.
By which time <hi>Cyaxares</hi> sent eftsoones unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> charging him in plaine
termes that he did amisse, to delay the time so long, and not with all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
march against the enemies. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> returned this answer unto his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers:
Let <hi>Cyaxares</hi> quoth he understand, That they are not come forth
as many of them as should: And thus much tell him from me in the hearing
of all. Neverthelesse, because it is his mind, I will anon set forward. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus said, and made his oraisons unto the Gods, he brought forth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Now when he began to march still faster and faster than ordinarie, he led
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19319:49"/>
the way himselfe and his souldiers followed not onely with an orderly pace in
good array, as having through long exercise learned to keep order: but, also
courageously and with resolution: For that, in a kind of emulation, they strove
one to excell another, and had bodies withall well enured and hardned to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile:
as also, for that all those that went formost were no other than their very
Captaines and Commaunders: yea and cheerefully beside, in regard of their
skill and cunning: For, they knew and had learned long agoe, that it was the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and easiest way, all at once directly to charge the enemies, especially if they
be Archers, darters and horsemen. Whiles therefore they were yet without
the daunger of shot, <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave this Motto for the signal of Battaile. <hi>IVPITER

Peeres above-said march on, bravely togither, with a lightsome countenance
(as being well trained and taught) beholding one another, calling by name to
their sidemen, and next followers, iterating full often these words. Now to it
good friends. Goe to it now right valiant Knights: mightily encouraging
each one his fellow to follow. Which they that came behind hearing, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
semblably the former to lead and goe before boldly. Thus the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
without, was replenished with forward alacrity, desirous of glory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne,
full of strength, of confident boldnesse, of encouragement and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
of stayed temperance and obedience, which I take to be the most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
objects that can be presented to enemies. But, of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> such as
were ready to fight before the rampiers and in defence of their campe, when
the <hi>Persians</hi> army once approached neere unto them, mounted their chariots,
and retired themselves to their fellowes where they were thickest embattailed.
As for their Archers, Darters and Slingers, they discharged from them their
shot farre sooner, and before they could possibly reach unto their enemies.
When the <hi>Persians</hi> now, by preassing forward, were come within the daunger
of shot, <hi>Cyrus</hi> with a lowd voice cryed out. Now most brave and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Knights, Step some one quickly before, and shew proufe of his valour,
and therewith encourage he the rest. These words uttered they also againe
to the other. By occasion whereof, some upon a brave and courageous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
upon an ardent desire also and love to fight, began to make speed, whom
the whole maine battaile followed with a running pace. <hi>Cyrus</hi> likewise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
forgetting to keepe his ordinary march, ranne before crying out, Who
followes, who? where is the valiant soldier that will fell and lay along the first
man? Which others hearing, seconded him and held on the same note. Thus
throughout the whole armie, as he began, the voice went, who will follow?
who will play the douty man! Well, in this manner gave the <hi>Persians</hi> the first
onset and fiercely assailed the enemies. But they not able to abide the shocke
and the open field, reculed, and turned their backs, flying amaine unto their
trench and rampier. The <hi>Persians</hi> pursuing them unto the very gates, whiles
they thronged and thrust one another to get in, slew many of them. And
looke who fell into the trenches, they leaped downe upon them and killed
them outright both horse and man. For, some of the Chariots were forced
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19319:49"/>
in this their rout to fall downe into the ditches. Which when the <hi>Medes</hi>
horsemen saw, they rode with full carrier against the enemies horsemen: who
gave way to decline their violence. Whereupon began a great chace both of
horse and men, together with much slaughter as well of the one as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Those <hi>Assyrians</hi> which within the Munition stood upon the top of the
rampier, had neither mind nor might, to shoot and dart at those, who made
such carnage and havocke: so terrible was the spectacle thereof and so smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
were they with feare. Perceiving then soone after, that certaine <hi>Persians</hi>
had broken through the gates and entries of their fortifications, they turned
backe and fled from the said toppe of the rampier. The wives, as well of the
<hi>Assyrians</hi> as of their auxiliary Associats, seeing this rout within the campe,
skriked out and ran up and downe all amazed: Some of them being mothers
of children, others but younglings, tearing their side garments, and scratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves with their owne nailes, lamentably beseeching all those whom
they met, not to flye and forsake them, but to defend their children and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And herewith the KK. themselves with their trustiest guard about
them, stood at the very gates, and climbing up to the top of the rampiers,
partly in proper person fought, and in part exhorted others to doe the same,
<hi>Cyrus</hi> after he understood what was done, fearing least by making an irruption
and forcible entry, his men so few in number might be hurt of so many, soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the retrait, commaunding them to retire, out of the arrow shot, and to obey.
Then, and there, a man might have seene the noble Peeres, how excellently
they had beene brought up in martiall discipline: For, streightwaies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obeied, and gave charge to the rest, for to doe the like as quickely: and
no sooner were they without the danger of shot, but they stood raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in their places, more orderly than in any daunce or quire
of Musicians, whiles every man knew perfitly
where hee should be.</p>

and made open shew, that ready they were to fight if any
would issue forth, seeing none to come abroad, withdrew
his power so farre as he thought good and there encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
Now when he had set his Corps du guard, and sent
out his espialls before, himselfe having assembled his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
in this manner spake unto them. My friends, yee that
are Persians, First, the Gods above I laud and praise to my full power, like as I
suppose yee all doe: For, atchieved we have this day both victorie and safetie.
In regard whereof bound we are to retribute gifts unto their Majesties, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of thankes, even out of all that ever we have. And as for you, I cannot
choose but commend you every one: For, looke what service there is exploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the same hath beene performed to the honour of you all. But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
due recompense in particular, when I am certified by those, of whom meet
it is I should enquire, of what desert every one is, I shall endevour both in word
and deed to conferre rewards upon each one respectively. And verily, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this Centurion here <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> who was next unto mee, I need not to
learne of others, as knowing my selfe very well how hee hath borne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
For, as in every point else hee hath done his devoyr, like as of you
all I suppose no lesse: so when I had caused the retreat to bee sounded and
called unto him by name, albeit hee had his sword up ready to smite his
enemie, hee presently obeyed, and leaving that undone which hee went about,
did as he was commanded: For, not onely retired he in person, but readily
charged the rest to doe the same: in so much as he brought his owne company
without daunger of the voley, ere our enemies wist that we gave ground at all,
even before they could draw their bowes, or launce their javelins against us:
and so he is both safe himselfe, and by his obedience hath saved his owne men
also. As for others, quoth he, I see some in deed wounded, of whom when I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19319:50"/>
have better considred what time they were hurt, I shall then deliver my doome.
But <hi>Chrysantas</hi> being so brave a man of action, so wise withall, and sufficient as
well to rule as to be ruled; him, I say, at this present I ordeine a Colonel over
a thousand. And whensoever God shall give me a good hand againe, I will
not then be forgetfull of him. And I would have you all, quoth he, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thus much and make use of this journey. For, whatsoever erewhile ye have
seene in this fight, never ceasse to thinke upon, that ye may alwaies judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your selves, whether it is running away, or preesse rather, that saveth your
lives? Also, whether they that fight willingly, be sooner freed from warre, or
those who are unwilling? Likewise, what pleasure it is that victory bringeth.
For none of these points may ye best determine, as having made proofe and
seene the experience, considering the service is so lately performed. And verily
by continuall meditation hereof, yee shall prove the better. Now therefore, as
religious, valiant, and temperate men, take your suppers. Offer sacred libations
to the Gods, beginning with a triumphant<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> song, and withall have an eye and
due regard to that which is commaunded. Thus said, he got up to horsebacke,
and rode away untill he was come to <hi>Cyaxares:</hi> Where, after rejoycing with
him as requisite it was, upon mutuall congratulation for their common victory:
when he had seene how things went there and asked of him what need he had
of his service, he rode backe from thence to his own armie. As for <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his
souldiers, after they had supped and appointed a sufficient watch, they betooke
themselves to rest.</p>
               <p>But the Assyrians, whose Soveraine Commaunder was slaine and with him
the very flowre and best of his souldiers, were all in great heavinesse yea and
many of them by night slipt away and fled out of the Camp. Which when
<hi>Craesus</hi> and the rest of their Allies perceived, they sorrowed all very much (for
every thing was dolorous) but this troubled them most in generall, that
throughout the armie, all the prime company of those that should have beene
their Leaders were out of heart, void of counsell and at their wits end. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
in the night season they abandoned their tents and departed. When day
appeared and discovered how naked of fighting men their Camp was: <hi>Cyrus</hi>
presently advanced thither first with the Persians. Now, the enemies had left
behind them, many Sheepe, many Kine and Oxen, and besides many waggons
full of much treasure and goods. Then repaired thither all the Medes likewise,
who were with <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> where they dined. Dinner being done, <hi>Cyrus</hi> called
unto him his owne Centiniers, and unto them made this Oration. My souldiers,
what benefits and how great, presented here unto us by the goodnesse of God
seeme we to let slip out of our hands? For now, your owne selves see, that the
enemies for feare of us be fled. And if they, being fortified strongly within
their hold have quit the same, and are runne away, how may any man imagine,
that they will stand to it, if they see us on even ground in the plaine field? Also,
they that durst not hold out when they had no experience of our valour; how
shall they be able now to abide us, defaited as they are already and having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
so many displeasures at our hands? And how shall their greatest cowards
be willing to sight with us, whose most valiant men lye slaine upon the ground
before us? Hereat, said one of the Company, why then doe we not with all
speed pursue them, seeing so great availes comming towards us so evidently?
Because, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> we want good horses: whereas the very best of our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19319:51"/>
enemies, and such, as most fit it were now, either to kill or to take prisoners,
hie them homeward apace well mounted on good coursers? And those verily
by Gods helpe, able were we to put to flight, but in following the chace, shall
never overtake. Why then, say they, goe you not to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and impart so
much unto him? Say you so? quoth he, Then follow mee all, that he may
know, yee are generally of this minde. So they all both followed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and
also declared what they thought meet as touching the matter they required.
<hi>Cyaxares,</hi> partly for that they made the motion first, somewhat envied them:
and partly because he thought he should doe well for himselfe, if he did not
enter into daunger a second time (for surely he gave himselfe to joy and mirth,
and saw many of the Medes doe the same) answered in this manner.</p>

               <head type="sub">The opinion of Cyaxares, to divert Cyrus from following
the traine of his victorie.</head>
               <p>I Know nephew <hi>Cyrus</hi> both by report, and also by that which I have seene
my selfe, that yee Persians of all other men study most, not to set your
minds upon any pleasure unsatiably. But verily, for mine own part, I thinke
it much more behoovefull, in the greatest pleasure to be continent and hold a
meane. And what is it, that presenteth greater contentment to men, than good
successe, which at this time is falne unto us? If we therefore being now in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
case, can soberly and wisely keepe the same, we may perhaps live unto our
old age in felicitie without all daunger. But if wee are never satisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
pursuing still one good fortune in the necke of another: take heed, least
that befall unto us, which, they say, many navigatours have found at sea; who
meeting sometime with a good gale of wind and fortunate voyage, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make an end of sayling, untill they were cast away and so perished. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably,
many men, (by report) having obteined one victory, by coveting to
winne another, have lost the former. For, truly if our enemies who are fled,
were fewer in number than we, it might peradventure be safe for us to pursue
them being so few. But now, consider with how small a troup of them wee all
fought, when we gained the upper hand? The rest were not at the battaile nor
strucke one stroke: whom if we force not to draw sword, they not knowing
us nor themselves, for want of skill and for cowardise will be glad to escape
and be gone: But if they perceive once, that they shall be in as great jeopardie
by running away, as by tarrying still, and have no hope of safety but in their
swords point, beware we urge them not even against their owne wils and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to beare themselves like valiant men. For, this you must know, that you
are not so desirous to take their wives and children prisoners as they be to save
them. Consider also, that wild swine when they are espied by the hunter run
away, (many though they be in number) with their young pigs: but if a man
hunt or chace any of their young ones, they will flye no longer, no though there
be but one of them and no more, but assaile him that goeth about to catch the
same. And verily, the enemies at this time beeing enclosed within their
strength, give us leave to skirmish with as many of them as we thought good
our selves: but in case wee joyne battaile with them in the broad and open
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19319:51"/>
plaine, when they shall learne, divided apart as erewhile, some to confront us,
others to flanke us on the one side and the other, and some againe to set upon us
behind in the tayle: See then whether every one of us have not need both of
many eyes, and also of as many hands? Furthermore, I would not wish, quoth
he, for my part, seeing as I doe the Medes solacing themselves in myrth, to
withdraw them from their delights, and force them to hazard their lives in a
doubtfull piece of service.</p>

               <head type="sub">How Cyrus obtained of Cyaxares part of the Medes forces: and with them
and the Hyrcanians togither that yeelded unto him, pursued the
Assyrians in their flight.</head>
               <p>VPon this speech <hi>Cyrus</hi> briefly replied: You shalt not need, [good Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle]
to compell any man: onely let me have them who will follow me
as voluntaries, and peradventure we shall returne, bringing unto you
and to every one of these your friends, that which will give you all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
Follow we will not in chace the maine multitude of our enemies
(fot how possibly should we encompasse and take them?) but if we may light
upon any piece of their armie dismembred from the rest, or upon a skirt and
remnant thereof, we shall fetch it in and bring the same unto you. Moreover,
thinke this, quoth he, that we at your request are come a great journey, and all
to gratifie and doe you pleasure; You therefore in all equity are to requite us in
the like: that we also may in some sort make up our owne mouthes, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
home with good pillage; and not depend all of us, upon your pay and
treasure. Then said <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> If any one will of his owne accord beare you
company, I would acknowledge my selfe beholden also vnto you. Send there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with me one of these here who deserveth to be trusted most,
that he may declare unto the <hi>Medes</hi> from you, what you commaund. Goe to,
said <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> take of all these any one, whom you will chuse. Now, it hapned
that the <hi>Median</hi> Gentleman was there present, who in times past had claimed
kinred of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and gotten so many kisses of him. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> forthwith, This
man here, quoth he, without more adoe shall serve my turne. Content said
<hi>Cyaxares,</hi> let him wait upon you: and withall, he charged the party, to deliver
thus much in his name, That whosoever would, might goe with <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Thus
<hi>Cyrus</hi> taking the man with him, went out: and when he was gone forth, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
said unto him: Now verily shall you make knowne whether you spake
truth or no, when you said you tooke much pleasure in beholding me. Say
you so? quoth the <hi>Median,</hi> Then will I never forsake you. And are you willing
said <hi>Cyrus</hi> to impart as much to others likewise? Then the man bound it with
an oath and said yea by <hi>Iupiter</hi> that I will: and bring it so about in the end, that
even you shall be as willing to looke upon me also. Then being thus sent from
<hi>Cyaxares,</hi> as he declared otherwise right cheerefully this errand to the <hi>Medes,</hi> so
he added this moreover, that he would never depart from so noble, so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
so goodly a person, and that which passed all the rest, descended from the
race of the Gods.</p>
               <p>Whiles <hi>Cyrus</hi> was busie about these affaires, there arrived, as it were by the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19319:52"/>
providence of God, certaine Embassadors from the <hi>Hyrcanians.</hi> These <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
border upon the <hi>Assyrians.</hi> A nation verily nothing populous (which is
the reason that subject they were unto the <hi>Assyrians</hi>) howbeit, reputed then, (as
they are no lesse at this day,) good horsemen. In which regard also the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
employed them, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did the <hi>Scyrites,</hi> making no spare of
them, but putting them to all paines taking and adventures. And at this very
time, they had charged them to keepe the Reare (and in number they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a thousand horse) to the end that if any damage hapned behind, they
first, should undergoe it before themselves. These Hyrcanians, because they
were to march hinmost, had their waggons also and their families behind all
the rest. For, the nations of Asia, the most part, in all their expeditions, use to
goe to warre with their whole housholds. And in this manner served the Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canians
at that time. Who now considering well with themselves, what hard
and servile warfare they were put to under the Assyrians: also that now their
Soveraine Lord being slaine, they were all foyled and discomfited, their whole
armie in great feare, their Associats out of heart, ready to faint and forsake
them; casting, I say, these things in their minds, they thought they had a fit
time and opportunitie offred to revolt, if togither with them <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would make head afresh and set upon them. Hereupon they dispatched
their messengers unto <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For, now by reason of this battaile, his name was
up and his fame much encreased. These that were sent, related unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> what
just cause they had to hate the Assyrians: if therefore at this time he were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
to make an invasion they would become both Associates, and leade
the vaward also in this journey. Withall, they recounted unto him, in what
state the enemies stood, the rather to incite him thereby to take this expedition
in hand. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> questioned with them in this sort: Thinke yee, quoth he,
that we shall be able yet to overtake them, before they put themselves into
their strong holds? For we take this for a great infortunitie of ours, that they
have so secretly in the night escaped from us. This spake he because he would
have them to conceive an excellent opinion of him. Who answered, That ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the next morning they might reach them, if they made speed and went light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appointed. For, by reason, say they, of their great multitude, and heavy
carriages, they march but slowly: and besides, for that they sate up and watched
all night before, they had now rid but small ground forward, and pitched their
tents betimes. Then replyed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Can ye put in any pledge for our assurance,
that yee speake the truth? Wee will, say they, forthwith ride away, and even
this night bring hostages with us for your better securitie. Onely doe you assure
us in the name of God, and give us your right hand, that we may make report
to others, what wee have received from you. Then hee faithfully promised
them, that if they performed <hi>bona fide,</hi> what they had said, he would use them
as his trusty and assured friends: neither would he ranke them inferiour in place
either to the Persians or to the Medes. And even at this very day, a man shall
see the Hyrcanians put in trust and bearing office of state, as well as Persians or
Medes, such as are thought of best worth. After they had supped, <hi>Cyrus</hi> led
forth his armie before day light was gone, and commaunded those Hyrcanians
to give attendance there and to march onward togither with him. As for the
Persians, they all in generall, as requisite it was, speedily came forth, and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi>
also with his owne Regiment. Of the Medes, some entred this journey,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19319:52"/>
for that having beene children when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a child, were now become his
friends: others, because they had beene his companions in hunting, and were
much delighted in his good behaviour: some againe in token of thankfulnesse
unto him because he seemed to have delivered them out of great feare: others
also upon good hopes, that seeing hee bare himselfe so valiantly, hee would
prove afterwards a fortunate, and mightie Prince. There were besides divers
of them willing now to doe him some reciprocall pleasure and service for the
good turnes which hee had procured unto any whiles hee was brought up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Medes. And verily, (as he was of a kinde and courteous nature),
he had procured for a number of them at his Grandsires hands many favours.
Last of all, a great sort of them, after they had seene the Hyrcanians and heard
a rumour spred abroad, that they would be their Leaders to bring them unto
great wealth, went forth for to get somewhat. Thus the Medes in manner all,
followed him: unlesse they were such as hapned to be of the Domesticall traine
of <hi>Cyaxares:</hi> For, these onely remained, togither with those that were their
vassals and followers. As for all the rest, full gladly and cheerefully, they did
put themselves forward in this journey, not I say as men constreined, but as
meere voluntaries, and who to gratifie him, of their owne accord went forth.
When they were now abroad upon the way, first hee commeth out unto the
Medes, whom he praised: and prayed withall, <hi>Imprimis,</hi> that the Gods would
vouchsafe to be propitious guides both to them and his. <hi>Item,</hi> To graunt him
such favour as to bee able to render unto them condigne recompense for this
their affectionate love unto him. In conclusion, hee gave order, that the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
should lead the march: and then he commaunded the horsemen to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Moreover, if in any place they rested or stayed in their journey, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that some should ride unto him, to know from time to time what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to be done. After this, he willed the said Hyrcanians to lead formost.
Who asked him in this manner, Why? Sir, tarry not you and expect untill
wee bring our hostages: that you also, having taken pledges of us for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
securitie of our troth, may then set forward? And he, by report, made this
answere. Even, for that I consider, we doe all carry the assurance of our faith,
no otherwise than in our hands and hearts. For, at this point and thus provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
seeme wee to be, that if yee be true of your word unto us, we have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
power and meanes to doe you good: but if yee be false and deceive us, we
take our selves to be in that state, as we need not be in subjection unto you, but
yee rather (if the Gods will) shall be thrall unto us and at our devotion. And
verily, quoth he, yee Hyrcanians, because yee say, your countrymen use to
march hinmost, therefore when ye see them once, give us knowledge that they
be of your nation, to the end wee may spare them. The Hyrcanians hearing
this, led the way as he commaunded: and withall admired his princely heart
and magnanimitie. Neither stood they any more in feare of the Assyrians or
of the Lydians or yet of any other their Allies and Confederates. And as for
<hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe, he supposed, there lay matter of no small moment every way
in them, were they present with him or were they absent. Now as they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and night drew on, reported it is, that a cleere light shining from heaven,
appeared evidently unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his host, in so much as they all conceived a
reverent feare of the Divine power, and a confident boldnesse besides against
the enemies: and, for that they were lightly appointed and went apace, by good
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19319:53"/>
reason they made, that night, a great journey, and by breake of day in the
very twy-light, approched neere unto the Hyrcanians maine regiment. Which
when the messengers above-said perceived, they signified unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> that those
were their countrimen: And hereof, said they, have we sure intelligence, as
well by their marching hinmost, as by the number of fires which they make.
Whereupon hee sent one of these two unto them, commaunding him in his
name to deliver this message: That if they were his friends, they should with
all speed come and meet him holding up their hands aloft. Some likewise of
his owne men he sent with him, whom he commaunded to say unto the Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
That as his men should see them comming towards him, so they also
would doe the like againe. Thus, one of the messengers tarried still with <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
and the other rode forth to the Hyrcanians. During the time that <hi>Cyrus</hi> waited
to see what the Hyrcanians would doe, he caused his armie to stay the march.
Then the Chieftaines of the Medes togither with <hi>Tigranes</hi> galloped hard unto
him, demaunding what they were to doe? unto whom he made answere, This
troupe next unto us is the regiment of the Hyrcanians: unto whom one of their
messengers, accompanied with some few of our men in gone for to signifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, that if they meane to be friends, they should meet us bearing up all
of them their right hands. Wherefore, if they so doe, receive them yee, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one in his place friendly giving them your right hands, and bid them be of
good cheere. But if they either take weapon in hand or goe about to flie, doe
your best, quoth he, to dispatch them at first, so as not one of them remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
These were the directions of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Meane-while the Hyrcanians, having
heard what the messengers said, were exceeding glad, and quickly mounting on

certaine in what state we stand: namely, that if we now become faint hearted
and demeane our selves cowardly, we shall incurre the most grievous calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that be. For, our enemies know full well, wherefore we are come: but if we
shall fiercely set upon our enemies and give the charge with courage and manly
resolution, yee shall see them soone like unto fugitive slaves, that are found out
and apprehended againe, some to court us in humble and suppliant manner cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19319:53"/>
they will not be able so much as to thinke either of the one or the other. For,
as men once discomfited, they will state and looke upon us: and suspecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lesse, than that we are comming, they being neither set embattailed nor
provided to fight, will be surprised. If therefore we desire to sit at supper fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
merrily, to passe the night sleeping quietly, and in a word, hereafter to
live pleasantly: let us give them no respit, either to consult or prepare any
good thing for themselves, no nor so much as to know at all that we be men:
but thinke onely, that nought else is come among them but bucklers, courtill-axes,
glaives, browne-bills and bloudy wounds. And yee <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> quoth
he, step forward upon them, and make way before us, that by the sight of your
armour, we may be in covert and unseene as long as possible it is. But, when
I am come close to the enemies armie, leave with me<note n="*" place="margin">Armenians Medes, and Hyrcanian.</note> every of you a corner of
horsemen, to use as need requireth so long as I abide here with the armie. And
such of you as are Commaunders, chiefe-Officers and of the elder sort, see you
ride close in a thicke squadron togither, when yee charge them, if yee be wise:
least haply yee light upon their massive troupes, and so be borne downe by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
But, suffer the younger gallants to follow the chace, and let them have
the killing of the enemies. For, this is the safest way now, that we leave as few
of our enemies alive as may be. And if it come to passe (as it hapneth to many
winners) that we quite overthrow their fortunes, and breake their backes for
ever, take heed we must, that we fall not to pillage. For, he that so doth, is no
more a valiant souldier, but a base souldiers page, and such an one, any man that
will may use as his slave. This also ought we to know, that nothing is more
gainefull than victory. For, the victour presently carrieth all away with him at
once, men, women, money and goods, yea and the whole countrey withall.

But I am not perswaded, that this dinner and refection of ours, will
profit us more, than if it may appeare, that we are carefull of our fellowes and
confederates: neither can all this good cheere make us so much the stronger, as
this one thing would doe, to wit, if we might be able to cause our Allies to be
forward in ayding us. If therefore, we should seeme so to vilipend those who
now follow the chace and execution of our enemies, fighting still with them
that make head, as that before we know how they speed, we should dine and
make merry, I feare me, as we shall be noted openly for lewd persons, so wee
shall weaken our selves, when we misse their aide. But to have such a care of
those that take paines and expose themselves unto daungers, as that when upon
their entry into the Campe, they may finde food ready and all things necessary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This say I, were a feast alone, and would make us much more jocund and jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall,
than if we went by and by to fill and pamper our bellies. Consider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
quoth he, that although it stood us not upon, in modestie to have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19319:55"/>
any regard at all of them, yet ought we not at any time, to give our selves to
belly cheere and drunkennesse. For, as yet we have not fully atchieved those
exploits which we enterprised, but all things now are come to the very pitch
and doubtfull point which requireth carefull diligence. For, we have in the
campe enemies in number farre more than we be our selves, and those loose, and
at liberty, whom peradventure it were fit to be guarded surely still: yea and
care would be had, that there be such as may purvey us necessaries. Moreover,
our horsemen are away, who verily disquiet our minds and make us to muse
where they be: and when they are returned, whether they will stay with us or
no? therefore, in mine opinion, such meat and drinke we are at this time to take
and stay our stomacks with, as a man may thinke most meete and expedient,
thereby neither to be full of drowsie sleepe, nor surprised with inconsiderate
folly. I wote well likewise, that much treasure there is and other goods in the
camp: of which I know it is in our power to convert to our proper use as much
as we list, how ever the same be common, as well to those who were with us
at the winning thereof as to our selves. But I doe not thinke, it would turne
more to our gaine, for to seize the said goods into our owne hands, than if we
shew our selves true and just unto them, and in so doing purchase thus much,
as that they shall be more fast and assured friends unto us than now they are.
In these respects therefore, I thinke it good to commit the dispose and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these monies and goods, to the <hi>Medes, Hyrcanians,</hi> and <hi>Tigranes</hi> at their
returne: and say they deale the lesse part among us, yet to reckon even it our
gain &amp; advantage. For, by reason of lucre growing to them ward, more willing
they will be to remaine with us. As for our selves, if at this time we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
our owne commodity before theirs, verily it would gaine us wealth to
last but a small while. But to let this pillage goe by, and in lieu thereof to have
and hold such things, whereof riches doth arise, this is it in my judgement,
which may yeeld both to us and to all ours, more durable and perpetuall
wealth. For this cause also, quoth he, I suppose when we are at home in our
owne countrey, we doe inure our selves to master and keepe downe our bellies:
to forbeare likewise unlawfull and unreasonable games: that when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
we might use the same to our weale and commodity. And verily, where
we may shew our institution and bringing up in greater matters, than these now
presented unto us, I cannot see. And herewith made <hi>Cyrus</hi> an end of his speech.
This advise of his, <hi>Hystaspes</hi> a <hi>Persian</hi> and one of the above-named Peeres appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and said as followeth. An indignity and shame it were ô <hi>Cyrus:</hi> if we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times in hunting should continue without meat and all for to take some wild
beast, and the same peradventure but little worth: and now when we are in the
pursuite of a world of wealth, we be our owne hinderance by those things that
rule lewd men, and are subject to the good: so as wee should not seeme to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
what we ought and befitteth us best to doe. Thus agreed <hi>Hystaspes</hi> with
the opinion of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and all the rest allowed thereof. Goe to then said <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
Since we concurre in one and the same mind, Send every Caporall out of his
owne band five of the tallest and best men to goe round about, and as many as
they see busie in purveiance of necessaries, to command them; but whomsoever
they perceive slacke in this behalfe, against them to proceed with more severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than if they were their very masters. And thus verily did <hi>Cyrus</hi> and those
with him. As for the <hi>Medes,</hi> some of them who overtooke certaine waines
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19319:55"/>
which had gone before, and turned them backe, brought them full loden with
such commodities as the armie had need of. Others tooke and brought away
with them<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Wagons</note> Chariots and Carroches, wherein were passing faire women: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lawfull wives and in part<note n="*" place="margin">Ligbies</note> concubines, such as for their singular beauty were
carried about and went with the Campe. For, the manner is of all the nations
in Asia, even at this day whensoever they make any warlike expedition, to take
with them along, the most precious things they have: saying, That they are
the more eger of fight, when their most leife and deerest jewels are about them.
For, there is a certeine necessitie imposed upon them, manfully to protect and
defend the same, and even so in very deed perhaps it is: or peradventure thus
they doe, to satisfie their lusts and pleasures. Now <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when hee saw what
feats the Medes and Hyrcanians had exploited, check'd, as it were, and rebuked
himselfe and his whole traine: in that others at this time seemed to outgoe
them in valour, and to winne somewhat: whiles he and those about him sit still
in a place farre remote from performing good service, doing just nothing. And
in truth, they that came away with this said bootie, had no sooner shewed unto
<hi>Cyrus</hi> what they brought, but they rode forth eftsoones, to pursue the rest of
the enemies: For so said they, we have expresse commaundement from our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vosts
and Rulers. <hi>Cyrus</hi> albeit he was stung herewith, yet bestowed hee this
bootie safe, and laid it up every thing in due place. Then assembled he once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
his Centiniers; and standing so as he might be heard whatsoever he spake,
made this oration unto them.</p>

               <p>MY good friends, Wee all, I suppose, doe know, that if we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
those matters, which fortune at this time presenteth unto us:
as, there shall accrue much profit unto the Persians all in common: so
the greatest part of good right will be ours, by whose travaile the service is
done. But, how we should be Lords thereof, being not of sufficient strength
to enjoy and hold the same, unlesse we have a Persian Cavallerie of our owne,
truly I cannot yet see. For, consider I pray you with mee, that wee Persians
are furnished with those weapons, wherewith we may seeme to foyle and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfit
our enemies at close fight: but when wee have once routed them, what
Horsemen, what Archers, what Targuaters, or what Darters, can we either
take prisoners or kill as they flie, wanting horses as we doe? And why should
either Archers, or Darters, or Horsemen, be affraid to assaile us and worke us
mischiefe, so long as they know for certeine, that they stand in no daunger to
receive hurt from us, no more than from the very trees that grow fast in the
ground? Which being so, is it not evident, that those men of armes who now
assist us, doe thinke that all these preies which now are taken, be no lesse their
owne than ours? yea and perhaps more too, so helpe me Iupiter. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
stands the case now, and it cannot otherwise be: But if wee may provide
our selves of a Cavallerie, out of our owne nation, not inferiour to this of theirs,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19319:56"/>
is it not very apparant unto you all, that we shall be able to doe as much against
our enemies without them as now we doe with them? and besides, finde even
them more modest in their carriage and respective towards us? So that wee
shall need the lesse to care whether they will stay with us, or bee gone, seeing
that without their helpe we shall be sufficient of our selves. Well, Let this goe
by: For I thinke no man will gainesay this opinion, but that it is every way
and simply better, for the Persians to have Horsemen of their owne. But hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
yee thinke with your selves, How this may be brought about? If then, we
desire to set up a Cavallery, let us take into our consideration what we have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it, and what we want? Horses we have these here, in number many, taken
already in the Campe, bridles we have for to rule and keepe them in; with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things besides meet for those to occupie, that have horses. We have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
all that a man of Armes needeth to use: For defensive armour, brest plates
to protect our bodies: For offensive weapons, Darts and Iavelins which wee
may launce from us, or keepe still in our hands as we please. What lacke wee
then? Belike, men we have need of: but of them we are best sped. For, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so much our owne, as we our selves be ours. But peradventure, some
man will say, we are not skilfull in horsemanship. Neither was there, I assure
you, any one of them cunning in that which now they can skill of, before hee
was taught the fear of it. And haply another will object and say, that they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it when they were young children. But I pray you, good Sir, Whether
are children more apt and of better capacitie, to learne such things as are told
and shewed unto them, than men growne? or whether when they have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them, are childrens bodies or mens, more able to put the same in practise?
Now, for our selves wee have such opportunitie to learne, as neither children
nor any other men have so much. For, wee shall not need to be taught the feat
of shooting, as children are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> considering that we know it already: not the sleight
of darting; for wee can doe it well enough. Nor is it with us as with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men: who are, some, troubled about tillage and husbandry: others hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by trades, arts, and occupations: and some againe letted with domesticall
affaires: Whereas wee, are not onely induced by time and leasure, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
martiall feats, but also driven thereto upon necessitie. Moreover, it is not in
this, as in many other warlike points, which may well be profitable, but yet are
difficile and hard. For, is it not more easie and pleasant to ride our journeys,
then to goe them on foot? When there is required expedition and speed, is it
not a great pleasure, to be streightwaies with a mans friend? yea and in the
pursuit of man or beast, quickly if need requires, to outstrip and inercept
them? Is not this also very handsome and convenient, that what armour soever
is to be worne or weapon borne, a mans horse should carry both it and him?
For, truly it is all one to weare, and to beare the same. Now for that, which we
may seeme to feare most, namely-least if wee be put of necessitie, to try the
fortune of a battaile on horsebacke, before wee have atteined to the exquisite
skill of riding, wee prove neither good footmen nor sufficient horsemen: This
is not so hard a matter but it may be well avoided. For, when and wheresoever
we list, we may soone alight and fight on foot: neither shall we in learning to

to kill a man, so farre of as I could see him, and in chacing of wild beasts, I
would not doubt to confront and kill some at hand, to strike others also aloofe
with my javelin, as if they stood still. For, although man and beast both of
them run swiftly, yet drawing nigh togither, they seeme as though they stood.
And verily mee thinks of all living creatures I can admire most and wish to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the Hippocentaures, if ever any such were; as who in fore-cast, used
mens prudence in managing that which was to be done, their hands: in taking
that which fled, and in overthrowing whatsoever stayed and stood still, the
swiftnesse and strength of an horse. Therefore, if I were an horseman, I would
I trow be furnished with all these togither. For, having humane reason and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of mine owne, I mought bee able to foresee all: in my hands I
should be able to beare and weld my weapons: with my horse-feet to pursue,
and with his strength, to lay my concurrent along. Neither yet should I be so
conjoyned and growne togither unto my horse, as Hippocentaures are. And
indeed better is it, thus to be, than so united and concorporate. For, the Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocentaures
I suppose, were ignorant, how to use many good things invented
by men, as also how to enjoy many pleasures and delights, which horses natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
have: whereas I, having learned once to ride, shall whiles I am on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
performe in some sort what belongs to an Hippocentaure: and when I
am alighted on foot, dine and suppe, weare my clothes, and doe as other men
doe: what else therefore shall I be but an Hippocentaure divided one while,
and compounded againe another while? Besides, in this one point more, I shall
have the vantage of an Hippocentaure and excell him. For whereas he saw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him with two eyes, and heard with two eares onely, I certeinly shall guesse
at things with foure eyes, and have the ynkling and intelligence of them by the
meanes of foure eares. For, it is said, that an horse, by the fore-sight of his
eye, warneth a man of many occurrents, yea and advertiseth him no lesse, by
the foreknowledge that he hath with his eares. Enroll mee therefore in the list
with them, that would most gladly be horsemen. And us also, for Gods sake,
said all the rest. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Seeing we are so fully accorded, What if we make
a law unto our selves, that it shall be a shamefull reproch, for any of them to
whom I shall give horses, to be seene abroad on foote, be the journey that they
take, great or small? that men may thinke us to bee very Hippocentaures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?
Thus when he had proposed this law, they all gave their assent and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19319:57"/>
the same. Hereupon it is, that ever since that time, unto this present day,
there is not a man of worth and haviour among the Persians, seene by his good
will to goe on foot. Thus debated they these matters, and discoursed as yee
have heard. By which time it was past noone: and then, the Median and Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canian
horsemen, came riding towards them, bringing both horses and men
whom they had taken prisoners. For, they did not put any one of them to the
sword, who had delivered up their weapons. Being come, <hi>Cyrus</hi> demaunded
of them, First, whether they were all safe? And when they answered yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
asked them what they had exploited? Who made report of their service done:
and how valiantly they had performed every thing in particular, they stucke
not to set out to the full, in most brave words. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
heard all that they were disposed to relate, he fell afterwards to praising of
them likewise, in these termes. Certes, it appeareth very well, my good friends,
that yee have borne your selves right manfully. For, surely yee are now farre
greater, fairer and more terrible to see to, than heretofore. He enquired more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
of them, how great a journey they had made? and whether the country
were inhabited or no? Who made answer, that they had ridden over a great
ground: that the land throughout was inhabited, and replenished with Sheepe,
Goats, Neat, Horses, Corne and all good commodities. Then, quoth he, two
things are we to looke unto. The one, that we may have the soveraintie over
them who possesse this wealth: the other, that they remaine where they be.
For a countrey well peopled is a rich possession and worth much: whereas, if
the same lye desert and abandoned of men, it must needs be destitute also of all
good things. I know full well, that slaine yee have those which made resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
Wherein yee did well, I assure you (for this is it that chiefely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
victory) but such as yeelded yee have taken prisoners and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
Whom if we let goe, wee shall, as I thinke, doe well for our owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.
For, first we need not now to take order how to beware of them, how
to keepe them in safe custodie, or to finde them food, and with hunger truly
we will never kill them. Then, if wee set these at libertie, we shall still meet
with more captives. For, Conquer wee once the country, all the dwellers
therein will be our captives. Yea and the rest will the sooner tarry, chusing
rather to obey, than to fight it out, if they see these remaining alive and let goe
at large. This is mine opinion. If any man see farther into the businesse, let
him speake his minde. But they having heard his advise, agreed, that the same
should be done accordingly. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore calling unto him the said priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
spake thus unto them.</p>

and if hereafter yee doe likewise, there shall no hurt befall unto
you: unlesse it be this, That the same Prince shall not be your Ruler

you to take any warre in hand, present your armour here unto us. Looke, how
many of you bring the same in, they shall have peace, and all things before
named without fraud or covin. But whosoever shall not lay downe their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

to us in friendly manner, and be seene either to performe any action and to teach

both to know, your selves, and also to intimate unto others. Now if yee for
your parts be willing to condiscend hereunto, and yet some other will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
lead yee us against those, to the end that we may rule them, and not they
us. When he had thus said, they with great reverence did obeisance unto him,
and withall promised so to doe. After that they were departed, <hi>Cyrus</hi> spake in
this wise, It is time now ô yee Medes and Armenians both, that we all goe to
our suppers. And behold, we have prepared for you the best cheere we could
get. Goe your wayes therefore and send us halfe your bread that is purveied
and ready made, for there is sufficient provided for both. As for<note n="*" place="margin">

And yee Hyrcanians, quoth he, bring these men to their lodgings; the
chiefe and principall Commaunders to the best and largest, (yee know whither
well enough) the rest as yee shall thinke most meet and convenient. Take yee
also your suppers your selves where yee best like. For, the tents are kept safe
and untouched for you, and therein is provision to serve you as well as them.
And this know yee both, that for all matters without doores, wee will for you
keepe watch and ward this night: Looke yee your selves to those things that
are within the pavilions, and therein bestow your harnois and weapons. For,
they be not yet our friends all, that are in the said tents. So the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi>

and provender enough. Moreover they sent unto the Persians of their bread
halfe a loafe to every one: but neither cates<note n="*" place="margin">Cate</note> nor wine thereto did they send:
supposing that <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his companie had sufficient thereof, because himselfe

having caused the Persians to take their suppers, for that now by this time the

commaunding them to lye close and in covert round about the tents. For, thus
he thought, that these would serve both as a good watch and guard, to keepe
backe any that from without attempted to enter in: and also by this meanes
whosoever intended to make an escape out of the campe, and convey money
away with them, they should be intercepted and taken in the manner. And
even so in very truth it fell out. For, many fled, and many were apprehended.
As for the money found about them, <hi>Cyrus</hi> left it behind, for those to have,
who had taken paines to attach them, but the men themselves he caused to bee
killed: Whereby it came to passe afterwards, that you could not easily, would

verily the Persians bestowed their time: whereas the Medes fell all the while

away as guides to conduct them in their journey. When <hi>Cyaxares</hi> heard this, he
was much more wroth and angry with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because hee had not acquainted
him therewith: and he made the more hast to send unto the <hi>Medes,</hi> thereby
to leave <hi>Cyrus</hi> more naked and destitute: And so, with greater menaces than
before, hee cited the <hi>Medes</hi> peremptorily. Threatning the Captaine afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
likewise, if he delivered not this message stoutly and in sharpe termes. So,
tooke he his leave that was sent, accompanied with some hundred horsemen of
his owne, being angry in his heart that he went not himselfe this voyage with
<hi>Cyrus.</hi> Now, as they were upon their journey, by reason of certaine turnings
where the waies were divided, they chaunced upon a wrong by-lane, and so
wandred out of the right way they wist not whither: in so much as they could
not come unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> his armie, untill they hapned upon some of the <hi>Assyrians</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:19319:58"/>
whom they constrained to be their guides. By this meanes having espied the
fires, they came thither about mid-night. Now, when they approached hard
to the campe, the watchmen, according as they had in charge from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> would
not let them in before day. But by day-breake <hi>Cyrus</hi> first sent for the<note n="*" place="margin">Priest</note> Magi,
whom hee commaunded to chuse forth, according to the usuall and solemne
manner, offrings unto the Gods, for so good successe and so rich booties. And
whiles they were busied hereabout, himselfe assembled the Peeres, and thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them said. My Friends and Countrimen, God presenteth unto us many
good things; But we ô <hi>Persians,</hi> are at this time too few, for to have and hold the

we leave some of our owne forces for the custodie of our winnings, it will
be soone seene, that little or no strength remaineth with us: I thinke it good
therefore, that one of you should with all speed go into <hi>Persia,</hi> both to enforme
the State what I say, and to will them, with all expedition to send a power, in
case the <hi>Persians</hi> desire to have the Dominion, and enjoy the fruits of Asia. Goe

of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> brought in and had audience. Who in the presence and hearing
of them all, declared the indignation of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> against <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as also his threats
unto the <hi>Medes.</hi> In conclusion, he said, That <hi>Cyaxares</hi> commaunded the <hi>Medes</hi>
to depart, [from <hi>Cyrus</hi>] although he would have them to tarry: Which mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
when the <hi>Medes</hi> heard, they kept silence, being in doubt and perplexity
how they might disobey him, sending for them in this manner: and fearing as
much on the other side, how to obey him menacing thus as he did; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
knowing his cruell nature. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For mine owne part quoth hee,
you the Messenger, and yee my Friends the <hi>Medes,</hi> I nothing marvaile, if <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi>
seeing our enemies then, to be so many, and not knowing now what we
doe, be much troubled both for us and also for himselfe. But when hee shall
once understand, that a number of our enemies be slaine and all the rest put to
slight: First he will give over his feare, and afterwards acknowledge, that hee
is not now left desolate when as his Friends thus destroy his foes. And how
are we blame-worthy deserving so well of him, and namely enterprising nought
of our owne heads? For, I perswaded himselfe, first to licence me to take you
out with me in this journey: and yee againe, not as men very desirous to bee
gone, asked him whether yee might goe forth? And so, come hither now yee
are in deed; but commanded by him to goe forth, so many at least wise of
you as thought not much and were not unwilling thereto. And therefore, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
I am, that this anger of his will both upon these good exploits of ours be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19319:59"/>
concocted, and also with the ceassing of his feare vanish away and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And you good messenger, quoth hee, for this time, because you have
travailed hard and are weary, rest your selfe. As for you <hi>Persians,</hi> For that we
expect these our enemies will be here, either to fight it our, or else to yeeld, let
vs be bravely appointed in the best manner; for being thus seene, great likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
there is, that we sooner shall effect what we desire. As to you the Prince
of the <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> tarry you here, and commaund the Captains of your souldiers
to see them armed. Which when the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Prince had done accordingly
and was come vnto him: I take great pleasure [my Lord] quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that not onely you are here present to shew your friendship, but also that
you seeme unto me wise and politick. And verily, at such a time as this, the
same I am certaine may much availe us. For, as the <hi>Assyrians</hi> be mine enemies,
so they are now more malicious to you than to me. We are therefore on both
parts so to consult, as that of those our Allies which be now present, none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
from us; and that we may, if possible it be, procure more to side with us.
Yee have heard how this<note n="*" place="margin">Captaine or Messenger.</note> 
                  <hi>Median</hi> here calleth away the Horsemen home: and
if they depart, how shall we footmen onely remaine behind? Wherefore, both
yee and I must order the matter so, that this messenger who thus calleth for
them away, may be willing himselfe to stay with us. Doe you therefore find
out a Pavilion and appoint it for him, wherein he may keepe and live right gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly,
as being furnished with all necessaries whatsoever. For mine owne part,
I shall devise to set the man about such businesse, as wherein hee will be more
willingly employed, than depart from hence. Discourse you with him, what
hope there is of great availes comming toward us and all our friends, if those
matters speed well which are meet to bee performed. When you have thus
done, repaire eftsoones unto me. So the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Potentate went his way and
brought the said <hi>Median</hi> unto his tent. And the messenger addressed for <hi>Persia</hi>
was there present, prest and ready to take his journey. Vnto him <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave in
charge, For to say unto the <hi>Persians,</hi> what was declared in the former confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,

               <p>NOw the tenour of the said Epistle was this: <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> Greeting.
Neither have we left you desolate, [good Vnkle,] (For no man is then
destitute of friends when he hath the upper hand of his enemies) nor in
departing from you thinke we, that wee exposed you to any daunger. But the
farther that we are from you, the more in our conceit wee worke your safety.
For, they that keepe neerest unto their friends, provide not alwaies best for their
security: but such as drive their enemies farthest of, those be they that set their
friends in greatest surety. Consider moreover, how I have carried my selfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, and in what sort againe, you have dealt with me. Then, complaine
of me and spare not. For my selfe, I brought unto you Auxiliaries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
not so many as you perswaded, but as many as possibly I could. And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19319:59"/>
you verily, whiles I was yet in our friends countrey, graunted unto me as many
as I could by perswasion win: But now whiles I am in the enemies land, you
call away not every voluntarie, but generally all without exception. Certes,
at that time I thought my selfe beholden both to you and them: whereas now;
you force me as to forget you, so to endeavour all that ever I can, to thanke and
requite those wholly, that followed me: Howbeit for all this, I can not be like
unto you. But even at this present, sending as I doe into <hi>Persia</hi> for an armie, I
charge as many as shall come unto me, that, before they repaire unto us, if you
stand in any need of them, they doe you service, not as they will themselves,
but as it pleaseth you to employ them. And withall, I would advise you, youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
though I be than your selfe, not to revoke your gifts, and take those things
away which you have once given, least in stead of thanks, evill will and heart-burning
be your guerdon: nor to summon in minatory maner, when you would
have any one to repaire speedily unto you: ne yet when you give out, that you
are forlorne, withall to threaten many; for feare, you teach them to vilipend
and set light by you. As for us, we will doe our best to be with you so soone as
we have with all expedition performed those exploits, which being once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved,
we are perswaded will redound indifferently to the profit of us both.
Farewell. Deliver this letter unto him, saith <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and if he aske you concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
any of these points, answer accordingly to that which is therein written.
For, as touching the <hi>Persians</hi> also I give you commission to doe as it is set down
in writing. When he had thus said and given him the missive, he sent him away,
with a charge so to make hast, as he knew that his speedy returne would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.
After this, immediately he tooke a survey of the <hi>Hyrcanians</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi>
his souldiers all in armes: The <hi>Persians</hi> likewise were armed. By which
time also certaine of the marches brought away their horses and presented their
armour and weapons. But those hee willed to fling away their javelins into
that place whither he had before commaunded the rest: and such as were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thereto, for to set them on fire, as many I meane, as they themselves
had no need of. As for the horses, he charged those that brought them, to keep,
and to tarry still themselves, untill some notice were given unto them what
they should doe. But to the Captaines of the Horsemen and to the <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi>

have gotten, many men besides taken prisoners. And because neither wee our
selves doe know, what goods properly belong to every of us, nor they, what
severally they be owners and masters of: therefore a man shall hardly see very
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19319:60"/>
many of them doing what they ought to doe: but all of them in manner, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
what is to be done. To redresse therefore this inconvenience, divide the said
goods; and whosoever hath received a tent, stored sufficiently with meate and
drinke, with servitours to attend, with hangings and counterpoints, with appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
with other furniture and implements, meete for a warlike Pavilion to bee
dwelt in conveniently, thereto verily needeth no other addition but this, that
the receiver know, he is to take charge of these things, as if they were his owne:
but whose chaunce is it to meet with tents unfurnished of many necessaries, it is
your part to see unto them, and to supply their wants. Certes, there will be yet,
of many things, I know, a surplusage. For, our enemies had of all sorts above
the proportion of our number. There came moreover unto me the Treasurers
of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> King, and of the other Potentates, who said, they had under their
hands gold in ready coine: making mention therewith, of certaine, tributes.
Proclaime therefore and commaund, that they bring forth all before you,
wheresoever yee sit downe and make abode: Terrifie them withall, in case any
one doe not according to your commaundement. Now, when yee have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the same monies: deale the same, to every horsman a double share, to a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
a single, that yee may have, what yee need, and wherewith also to buy
somewhat beside. Moreover, let proclamation be made forthwith in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
place within the Campe, that no man wrong another. Also, that retailers
and merchants may fell every man what wares and chaffer hee bringeth: and
when he hath had utterance and made returne, that he fetch more, to the end
that our campe may be well peopled and inhabited. And this verily they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
out of hand.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Medes</hi> and, <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> How shall wee, said they, without you and
yours, distribute these things. To these words of theirs replied <hi>Cyrus</hi> in this
manner: And are yee in deed, (my friends) of this mind, that when ought is
to be done, we should all be present at every affaire? So that if either I negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
for you in any businesse requisite, or yee deale for me, wee shall not satisfie
and content one another? And by what other meanes, shall we busie our selves
more, and effect lesse, than by this? But, consider I pray you, quoth he, we have
here kept these things for you, and yee beleeve, I doubt not that they have been
well kept. Semblably, distribute yee the same: and wee will likewise beleeve,
that they are very well distributed: and even so in other things againe, we will
endeavour to doe somewhat else for the good of all in publike. First therefore
quoth he, See how many horses we have here? and how many are a bringing
to us? If we suffer them to be without riders, they will serve us in no stead, but
put us to trouble in keeping of them. But if we set men upon their backs, wee
shall be rid of trouble, end withall, augment our owne strength. Now if ye know
any other to bestow them upon, with whom yee would more willingly hazard
your selves and enter into daunger (if need be) than with us, let those have them.
But if yee had lei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er that we stand to you and helpe at a pinch, before all other,
give them unto us. For, erewhile, when yee made a rode and adventured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, yee did put us greatly in feare, that all was not well with you: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
yee caused us to be much affraied for that wee were not where yee were.
But if we receive horses, follow you we will: and if, fighting on horsebacke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
with you, we may be thought to doe you better service; there shall be
no courage not forwardnesse wanting on our behalfe. But, in case we shall be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19319:60"/>
thought to stand you in better stead on foot: soone will we alight from our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and straight waies be with you as footmen: and as for our horses, devise we
will whom to deliver them unto. Thus said he: and thereto they made answer
in this wise. Wee, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> neither have men to backe these horses, nor if we had
seeing it is your mind so to have it, would we preferre any course to be taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this. Here therefore take you these horses unto you, and doe with them
what you thinke good. I accept them, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> &amp; in the name of God, and
ina lucky houre be it spoken, Let us from henceforth become men of armes: and
now divide yee the common spoile. But first and formost quoth he, call out of
the whole for the Gods, what the<note n="*" place="margin">

Then, set by for <hi>Cyaxares</hi> that wherein yee thinke to gratifie him most. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
they smiled and said: Then must we needs chuse out for him some faire
and beautifull Ladies. Goe to then, quoth he, select those women, and what
else yee please. And when as yee <hi>Hyrcanians</hi> have made choise for him, See
what lieth in you, quoth he, That all these <hi>Medes</hi> who so willingly on their
owne accord have followed me, have no cause to complaine. Yee <hi>Medes</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
esteeme and honour these who became our first Associates, that they may
thinke they have done well for themselves in siding with us and seeking our
friendship. Moreover set out some part of every thing, for the messenger sent
from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> both for himselfe and also for his traine. Intreat him likewise
to stay a while with us, saying, that I would very faine have it so: to the end, that
when he hath better intelligence of every thing, he may relate the truth unto
<hi>Cyaxares.</hi> As for the <hi>Persians,</hi> quoth he, that are about me. Whatsoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,
as superfluous, when your selves be gallantly furnished, the same shall
suffice them. For, we I may tell you, have not beene over want only brought up
in deinty delicates, but after an homely and rusticall manner: whereby, haply,
yee would make good game at us, if any rich or goodly apparell were hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us: like as, quoth he, I wote well we should make you very good sport, and
moove you to laugh right heartily, as we sit on horsebacke, and namely, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
when we take falls and lie along on the ground. After this, they for their
parts went to the division of the booty, laughing heartily at this mention of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and horsemanship. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> having sent for the Centurions, commaunded
them to take the horses togither with their harnoise and keepers, to take them I
say by tale, equall in number to the souldiers, as they fell out by lot unto them,
according to their bands and companies. He caused also proclamation to bee

brought <hi>Gobryas</hi> in person before <hi>Cyrus:</hi> who when he saw <hi>Cyrus,</hi> spake
thus unto him. My Lord, I am by birth an Assyrian. A strong Castle I hold,
and have the soveraine rule of a large territory. With a thousand horse I ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Assyrian King, whom I friended loyally, no man more. Now sithence
his hap hath beene (good Prince as he was) to be slaine by you; and seeing his
sonne my most mortall enemie succeedeth him in the Empire; I am come unto
you, humbly kneeling and falling downe prostrate at your feet. And here I
yeeld and submit my selfe unto you, as your vassall, ready to doe you service,
beseeching you to revenge my wrongs, and as much as lyeth in me, I adopt you
for my sonne, as having no issue male of mine owne body begotten. For, the
onely sonne and heire that I had, (my Lord) who, though I say it, was a gallant
young Gentleman and vertuous withall, one who loved and honoured mee so
as any child might doe, and by that dutifull honour make me his father a most
happie man, him this Prince who now doth reigne, when as the late King his
father had sent for him, intending to bestow upon my sonne, his owne
daughter in marriage (and verily when I sent him from mee, I carried my head
aloft, as one who looked to see my sonne another day affied to a Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
him I say the King that now is permitted to hunt and chace the best hee
could, as counting himselfe a better horseman than he was by many degrees.
So hee hunted with him as with his very friend. And when there was a Beare
rowzed in sight and both of them followed the Game, the Prince who now
reigneth, slung his dart from him, and as ill lucke was missed. But that sonne
of mine, (alas the while) launced likewise, and in an ill houre, ywis, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably,
hit his marke and overthrew the Beare. Whereat, for the present
verily, the other (vexed though he was) kept in his envie. Againe, when upon
the presenting of a Lion which encountred them, hee failed the second time
(which was as I thinke no great mervaile) my sonne likewise as before, hapned
to kill the Lion outright: and thereupon said, Certes, twice now togither

But, seeing the Kingdome is now devolved upon the slayer of my sonne: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

bringing with mee the forces of my country. I have besides, a daughter, a

shee is. Whom heretofore I thought to cherrish and bring up, to be a wife
for this new King. But now, my daughter, with many teares and humbly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

And of the same minde I also am. Now therefore I give you good leave,
to deliberate of her no otherwise, than I my selfe would be thought to consult
concerning you. Hereupon, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> In regard, quoth he, of these Capitualtions,

out to morrow betimes in the morning, the next day after, you may lodge in
my house. So <hi>Gobryas</hi> departed, leaving behind him a guide for the way. By
this time also were the Medes come, having allowed unto the<note n="*" place="margin">Priests.</note> Magi what
especiall things soever they said should bee put apart for the Gods. Chosen
they had besides, First, for <hi>Cyrus</hi> a most goodly tent, also a Susian Ladie, who
had the name to be the fairest in all Asia, and two Chanteresses most skilfull
in Musicke. Secondarily, for <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> the same in kinde, but of a second
sort. Moreover, they sped themselves to the full of other commodities as
they needed, to the end they might want nothing whiles they warred. For,
great plentie there was of all things. The Hyrcanians likewise tooke what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they stood in need of, yea and the Messenger of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> they permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to share equally with the rest. As for those Pavilions which remained over
and above, they delivered into the hands of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for the use and behoofe of
the Persians. As touching the money in coine, they said, they would then
make partage thereof when they had gathered in all. Which duly they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
Well, thus they did, and thus they said. As concerning the portion
selected for <hi>Cyaxares, Cyrus</hi> gave order to such as he knew to be most inward
and familiar with him, for to receive and keepe the same safe. Now for those
gifts, quoth hee, which yee conferre upon mee, I take them willingly.
Yet, whose minde soever among you all stands most thereunto, hee shall use
the same with all my heart. Then a certeine Median, who loved Musicke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well. Truly <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, when I heard these musicall women sing whom
now you have, I tooke great delight in hearing them. And if you would be
so good as to bestow one of them upon mee, I should thinke it a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to be a souldier here in the Campe, than to carry at home. Then, quoth
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> and I give her thee with all my heart: yea and I take my selfe to be
more beholden unto thee, for craving, than thou to me for having
her of mee. So desirous am I to gratifie you all.

beheld her well when I chose her for you, And verily at our comming into
her tent, at first wee knew her not from others. For, shee was set upon the
ground, with all her waiting maids about her: and clad shee was like unto
them. But when upon a desire that we had, to know which was the Mistresse,
and cast our eyes about, wistly avising them all, it was soone seene how farre
shee surmounted the rest, set though shee were wimpled and veiled, yea and
looking downward to the ground. But when wee willed her to arise upon her
feet, and therewith all the other that were about her arose likewise, then shee
surpassed them all indeed; First, in tallnesse and goodly presence; then, in the

out amaine. With that, the most part of her face was seene, her necke bared,
her hands and armes discovered. And assure your selfe <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, that as
well to mee, as to all the rest who saw her, it seemed there was never yet the

also shall neither will nor chuse, but see her. Not so, quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> If she be so
goodly a creature as you report, so much the lesse will I behold her. And why
so. Sir, said the young Gentleman. Because, quoth he, if now upon your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that shee is faire and beautifull, I should be perswaded to goe and eye her,
having no great leisure and time to spare, I feare mee least shee might eftsoones
allure me sooner to come eftsoones for to view and review her againe, and so
perhaps neglecting my serious and weighty affaires, which I ought to manage, I
should set by it, avising and looking upon her. Why? quoth the said young
Gentleman, and laughed withall. Thinke you, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that the beautie of man
or woman, is so powerfull, as to enforce any one against his will, to doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than for the best? For, if, said hee, it were so by the course of nature, it
would force all indifferently. Behold, the fire here, quoth he, burneth all men
alike, and why? because such is the nature of it. And of beautifull women,
men love some, and others they doe not. One is enamoured of this thing, and
another of that. For why? love, quoth he, is a passion meere voluntary, and
every man liketh what and whom he listeth. Now, you see, that the brother
is not in love with his sister, but a stranger is: Neither falleth the father in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
with his owne daughter, another doth. For, feare and law, are sufficient to
restraine love. But if a law were made, that who eare not, should not be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry;
who drinke not, should not be dry: Also, that no man should be a cold in
Winter, nor hote in Summer: how strictly soever it were devised and penned,
it could not bring to passe, that men in those points would obey the same. For,
by nature they are framed to yeeld thereto. But, to love, is meere voluntary.
Every man, to say a truth, affecteth the things that be his owne, as his raiment,
his shooes, &amp;c. Then replyed <hi>Cyrus.</hi> If love be voluntary how is it that a man
cannot ceasse to love when he will? For, I my selfe have seene men to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>epe,
for every sorrow occasioned by love, yea and to become bond and thrall to
those whom they loved; how-ever, before they were in love, they reputed ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
and bondage to be very evill. Yea I have observed them to give away
many things, which without their losse and hinderance they might not misse:
who also wished of God for to be delivered from love, no lesse than from some
other grievous maladie, yet could not be released therefrom: but were bound
with a stronger duresse of necessitie, than if they had beene tyed with chaines
of yron. Hence it is, that they yeeld themselves thrall unto their Paramours,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19319:63"/>
ready even to performe many idle and foolish services unto them: yea and
being once thus encumbred and distressed with these miseries, they never so
much as give the attempt to get away, but rather become Gaolers themselves
unto their beloved; observing them narrowly, that they make no escape. They
doe indeed thus, as you say, quoth the young Knight, poore wretches as they
be. And therefore I suppose being<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> in this miserable case, they alwaies wish
indeed to die; but notwithstanding there bee ten thousand meanes, to make
themselves away, yet they doe it not. And even these selfe-same men also [to
mainteine their lives] fall to stealing, and forbeare not other mens goods: yet
when any have either robbed or filched ought, see you not how your selfe
with the first, (as if there were no necessitie of such theeving) accuse the theefe
and robber, neither doe you pardon but punish him? Semblably, they that be
faire and beautifull, neither compell men to love them, nor to covet such things
as are not to be desired: but silly and foolish folke, be, I suppose, in all manner
of lusts and desires incontinent, and when they cannot rule their owne affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
lay all the blame afterwards upon love. Whereas, honest and wise men,
although they desire gold, faire steedes and beautifull women, yet can they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
absteine from all these, so, as that they will not so much as touch them
wrongfully. And for mine owne part, I assure you, albeit I beheld this faire
Dame, and that shee seemed in mine eye right lovely and amiable, yet you see,
how I am now with you, I ride my horse, and performe other parts of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir
in your service. And so you doe, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as God me love. Yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
you came sooner away from her, than is the time that love useth to
ensnare a man. For, it may well be, that if one touch fire, he is not presently
burnt therewith; and wood streight-wayes catcheth not a light fire and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
out. Yet neither willingly doe I touch fire: nor with my good will
looke on beautifull persons: ne yet doe I advise you ô <hi>Araspas,</hi> to keepe your
eyes fixed long upon those that bee faire. For that, the fire indeed burneth
those onely that touch it, but the beautifull inflame even those also that eye
them afarre off, so as they burne againe in love. Be content I pray you, quoth
he, ô <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For, I warrant you, looke I never so long upon her, yet shall I
not be so farre overcome as to commit any lewd and undecent part. That's
very well said of you, quoth <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and therefore keepe you her as I bid you:
For, perhaps, this woman may one day stead us very much. Thus having
communed togither they departed asunder.</p>
               <p>But this young Gallant, partly seeing her to be of incomparable beautie, and
in part perceiving her vertuous deportment: as also for that hee having the
charge of her, was perswaded that he did content her humour: Finding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
her selfe not unthankefull, as who for her part againe, was very carefull, that
by the meanes and ministery of her servants, whensoever he came into his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion,
he should have all things convenient, and if at any time he were ill at
case of sickish, want nothing requisite: by occasion of all these things, I say,
caught he was in the snares of love, and perhaps, this was no strange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
thing that besell unto him. And thus passed these matters.</p>

               <head type="sub">How Cyrus being assured of the Medes and other Allies, rode to the
Castle of Gobryas. And of his Magnificence.</head>
               <p>BVT <hi>Cyrus</hi> being desirous that both Medes, and other Associates also,
should bee willing to continue with him, called unto him all his men of
Action, unto whom when they were come togither, he made a speech to
this effect. I know for certeine, that yee Medes and all here present, have gone
forth with me, neither for want of money, nor because yee thought in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
to doe <hi>Cyaxares</hi> service: but upon a desire to doe me pleasure and honour,
yee have beene willing even by night to travaile and adventure with mee. In
which respects, I take my selfe obliged unto you, unlesse I would bee unjust
But to recompense you accordingly, and to your desert, mee thinkes I am not
able as yet. And verily, soto say I am not abashed: And to promise, That if
yee tarry still, I will requite you, wote yee may well, I am ashamed. For I
might suppose it would be thought, I so spake, because I would have you to be
more willing for to stay with mee. But in lieu thereof, thus much I protest
unto you: That albeit yee depart upon your alleageance to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> yet will
I endevour, so to carry my selfe to you ward, in case I speed well, that even
your selves may commend and praise me. For, I am not now upon my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of these parts. But with the Hyrcanians, unto whom I have given
mine oath and right hand; I will keepe just promise, and never will I be found
to betray them. As for <hi>Gobryas,</hi> who erewhile, hath made over unto us his
walledforts, his territorie and forces, I will so deale with him, as he shall never
repent of his journey made to mee. And that which more is, since that the
Gods so evidently goe with us and further our enterprises, I should both stand
in feare of them and also be ashamed, if I gave over these designments, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
in consideratly without effect. This therefore, quoth he, will I for my
part performe, doe yee as yee shall thinke good: but withall acquaint me with
your resolution. Thus spake he. But the Gentleman, who sometime claimed
kinred of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> opined first in this wise. As to my selfe verily, thus much, ô
King; for, a King you seeme to be by nature no lesse than the Master Bee, which
in the hive is bred their Leader, as whom the Bees are willing to obey: in so
much as wheresoever hee remaineth, not one of them will depart from thence:
and whithersoever he goeth, none will tarry behind: such an ardent love is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
in them, to be governed by him: Semblably, are these men, I say in some
sort affected to you. For, when you went from us into Persia, who was there
of all the Medes young or old left behind, but hee waited upon you? untill
such time as King <hi>Astyages</hi> called us away. Againe, after that you came out
of Persia to aide us, wee might perceive incontinently your friends in manner
all, as voluntaries to follow you. Moreover, when you were desirous to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
an expedition into these parts, all the Medes willingly attended upon
you. And truly, at this present, thus disposed we are, that so long as we have
your personall presence in our enemies Land, wee dare be bold: but without
you, affraied we should be to returne even into our native country. Therefore,
what other men intend to doe let them speake themselves: but I, ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19319:64"/>
all those that are under me will stay with you: and so long as we behold you,
be resolute to abide all brunts, and shew our selves firme and fast to you, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of those favours and benefits which we have received at your hands. Then
spake <hi>Tigranes</hi> after this manner. Mervaile not ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, if I keepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
For, my minde is not ready now to deliberate, but to execute whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you commaund. Then, the Hyrcanian Prince, I would say, quoth he,
that if yee the Medes departed now, it were the will of adverse fortune, and
some crosse handiwork of God, not to permit you for to enjoy any great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For, in the judgement of man, who would either turne backe, when his
enemies flie? or when they deliver up their armes, not receive them? or when
they yeeld themselves and what they have, not take all? especially, seeing we
have such a Captaine, as seemeth, I take all the Gods to record, to delight
more in doing us pleasure and procuring our good, than in enriching himselfe.
After him all the Medes with one voice brake out into these or such like words.
You, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> brought us forth, and therefore when you thinke it time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
bring you us likewise home againe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard this uniforme accord, hee praied in this wise. Graunt I
beseech thee, most mighty <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that I may exceed these in beneficence, who
doe me this honour. Which said, he commaunded all the rest, after they had
set their watch and ward, to keepe themselves in their severall quarters: but the
<hi>Persians</hi> to set out and distribute the tents, to the men of armes, such as were
meet for horsemen; to the footmen those that were sufficient for them: Also to
take order, that generally throughout, as many as were within the tents, should
bring all things necessarie unto the <hi>Persians,</hi> according to their severall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
yea and furnish them with horses well tended and dressed to their hands:
to the end that the <hi>Persians</hi> themselves might have nothing else to doe, but to
attend upon warlike affaires. Thus spent they this day.</p>
               <p>The next morning early when they were risen, they put themselves in their
journey toward <hi>Gobryas. Cyrus</hi> verily being mounted on horsebacke togither
with the new Cavallery of the <hi>Persians,</hi> growne now to the number of 2000.
or there about. After whom followed those who carried their targuets and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miters,
being in number equall to them. Semblably, the rest of the armie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in good array. Moreover, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded every one of them to say
unto these their new waiters and followers; that whosoever were seene either
dragging behind the leaders and keepers of the rereward, or leaping before the
front of the vantgard, or taken on either side [or flanke] of the battaile with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
divided from those that were in their ranks, they should be grievously pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
Thus, the next day, they were come by the evening as farre as to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryas</hi>
his Castle. An exceeding strong pile they saw it to bee, and upon the
wals, every thing planted to make resistance and forcibly to repell the enemie.
Furthermore, they perceived many head of oxen, and a mighty number of sheep
driven and brought togither, under the very fortifications. Then, <hi>Gobryas</hi> sent
unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> willing him to ride about and view where the avenue was most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:
and withall, to send in unto him certaine of his trusty men, who might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
unto him what they had seene within. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore, desirous in very
deed to see whether the Castle were any where prenable, or whether <hi>Gobryas</hi>
would be found a lier, rode all about: where, he saw every place stronger, than to
yeeld any accesse. As for those whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> had sent in to <hi>Gobryas,</hi> they brought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19319:65"/>
word backe againe unto him, that there was within, such store of goods, as in
their judgement seemed sufficient to serve those therein, all a mans life. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Cyrus</hi> mused with himselfe what those things might be. By which time
<hi>Gobryas</hi> in person came forth unto him, and brought out all the persons that
were within: some, laden with wine and wheat-meale; others driving before
them kine and oxen, swine, sheepe and goats: And all other victuals whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
they presented unto him: so as <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his whole armie might sup right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
therewith. They therefore who were thereto appointed, ordered these
things accordingly, yea and dressed supper. Then <hi>Gobryas,</hi> when all his owne
men were gone forth, willed <hi>Cyrus</hi> to enter in, and that in such manner, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
thought best for his owne safety. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> having sent before his spies to
discover, and a strong troupe for to guard, at the last entred in person. When
he was once within, and the gates kept wide open still, he called unto him all
his friends and chiefe Commaunders of the souldiers about him. When all
were come in, <hi>Gobryas</hi> brought out wine bolles of gold, flagons, basons and
ewers, with ornaments and furniture of all sorts, certaine pieces also of coine
called Dareiks innumerable, and all things, that were faire and goodly to bee
seene. At the last, having presented his daughter also, (an exceeding beautifull
Damoisell she was, very tall, and personable besides, clad in mourning weed for
the death of her brother aforesaid.) Here quoth he ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> All this riches I
bestow upon you. And this daughter of mine likewise, I recommend to your
tuition even to dispose of her as you thinke good: And humbly beseech you,
both I, as beforetime in the behalfe of my sonne, and shee now for her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that you will be his avenger. Hereto <hi>Cyrus</hi> answered in this wise. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
you verily, as then, to revenge your quarrell to my power, if I found you
true of your word. And now, seeing you have spoken a truth, I am bound to
performe my word and promise. To her also I make behest, with the helpe of
God, to doe no lesse. And as for this treasure quoth he, I accept thereof, and
withall bestow the same here, upon this your daughter, and him whose hap it
shall be to espouse her. But one gift there is beside, that I would gladly at my
departure receive at your hands; which if I may obtaine, I would not more
joyfully depart, if I had all the wealth either in Babylon which is much, or in
the universall world, which is infinite. <hi>Gobryas</hi> merva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and suspecting he would, name his daughter, asked him and said: What is that
boone <hi>Cyrus</hi> which you would so faine have? Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> answered, I suppose

much as to lie: Howbeit, because no man would ever put into their hands great
wealth, regall dominion, strong castles, and most deerely beloved children,
they die before they be knowne what they are. But you, by tendering unto me,
fensed and walled forts, riches infinite of all kinds, your whole power and puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
yea and your daughter so liefe, so deere, and so worth the having, have
made knowne to all the world that I am the man, who would neither deale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

willingly falsifie my promise and convenant. Be you sure therefore and wote
well, that so long as I am a just and righteous man, and shall be for that good

in mee] but endeavour by all good and honest meanes, to honour you
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19319:65"/>
againe. Neither feare you quoth he, that you shall lacke a man, worthy to be
an husband for your daughter. For, many friends I have and those right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and valiant Knights: and whose hap soever it is of all them to marry
her, whether he shall have so much money and good as is given by you with
her, or much more than that commeth to, I am not able to say. But this would
I have you to know for certaine, that some of them there be, who in regard of
the portion which you give, will not esteeme you one whit the more. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.
they now imitate mee with a kind of emulation: and pray unto all the
Gods, that they may have occasion one day to shew that they are no lesse loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and faithfull to their Friends, than I am to mine; and to their enemies, whiles
they have a day to live will never yeeld, unlesse some God crosse them. Now
for vertue and good reputation, they would not preferre before it, all the riches
of the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Assyrians</hi> put them both togither, and set the same to yours.
And such men I would you well knew, are now sitting here. Then <hi>Gobryas</hi>
laughed heartily and said. For the love of God, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> shew me where these
men are, that I may beg at your hands one of them for to be my sonne. Care
not you for that, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> neither shall you need to enquire that of mee
doe but keepe us company, and you shall be able your selfe, to shew each of
them, even to another. Thus much having said: he tooke <hi>Gobryas</hi> by the right
hand, and rising withall went his waies forth, and drew out all his men with
him. And albeit he was earnestly importuned by <hi>Gobryas</hi> to take his supper
with him, yet would he not, but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pped in the Campe, and tooke <hi>Gobryas</hi> with
him as his guest.</p>
               <p>Now being set upon a greene banke, he questioned with him in this manner
Tell me, my <hi>Gobryas,</hi> quoth he, Thinke you that you have more cuishons and
carpets than every one of us? To whom he answered, I know right well, so God
me love, that yee have carpets, cuishons, beds, pallets and tables many more,
and that your dwelling house is farre larger and of greater receit than mine, as
who for your habitations make use of the earth and skie, and have as many beds
as there be couches and resting places on the ground. Besides, yee take for your
carpets and cuishons not so many as the sheepe affoord fleeces of wooll, but as
mountaines and fields doe yeeld brush and branch to make fagots of. And this
being the first time, that <hi>Gobryas</hi> supped among them, when he saw their coorse
and homely fare, he thought himselfe kept more plentifull and liberall cheere
than they. But after that he observed their moderate feeding (for there is not a
<hi>Persian</hi> of good education, who with any meate or drinke is perceived openly
either in his eies, to bee distempered, or by ravening and greedy eating, in his
mind to have lesse forecast, than if he were not at his meat: For, like as good
horsemen, for that they be not troubled on horsebacke, are able all the while
they ride, to see, to heare, and to say as they ought: even so, they at their meales,
thinke they should appeare openly to be wise, sober and temperate; supposing,
that to be stirred and disquieted after eating and drinking, is doglike, swinelike
and brutish.) He observed withall in them, that they demaunded one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such questions, as it was more pleasure to aske them than not: and cast
forth those prety jests and merry conceits, which being uttered, caused more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the delivery, than otherwise kept in: and that in all their mirth, they
were farre from contumelious and spitefull termes, farre from doing any lewd
and filthy act: farre from grieving and offending one another. But the greatest
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19319:66"/>
thing of all other in his opinion was this; that being in warre-service, they
thought not any of them who adventured the same perill, ought to have more
allowance at the table than the rest: but supposed that Feast to be best, wherein
they made their confederates that were to fight with them most valiant: Now
when <hi>Gobryas</hi> arose to goe home to his owne house, hee used, by report, these
words. I wonder now no more quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that we have more drinking
cups, more garments, and gold in coyne, and yet are of lesse account than you.
For all our care and study is who shall have most of these things: Whereas,
your chiefe endeavour is as it seemeth unto me, to be the best and most valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
men. When <hi>Gobryas</hi> had thus said, Goe to then, quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> unto him,
See that to morrow morning betimes, you shew your selfe here with your men
of armes well appointed, to the end that as we may take a view of your forces,
so you may conduct us through your countrey. Whereby also we shall know,
what parts thereof to account friendly, and what to repute as hostile. Having
thus communed togither, they tooke their leaves, and either of them went to
that which was meet for them.</p>

the foile and loose this that I have gotten, I might haply find some other place
of refuge: but in case hee win and get the day, I see your whole estate will bee
alienated from you and become other mens. Mine enemie he is, not because he
hateth me, but for that he supposeth it will be his losse if we be great, which is
the onely reason why he warreth upon us. But you, he not onely hateth and
that mortally, but taketh himselfe also to be wronged by you. To this both
of them answered. That as they had a care to performe the exploit, as who
knew as much as he told them, so they were exceeding sollicitous withall, about
the future issue of the present enterprise. Whereupon, thus began he first with

and be united togither? Even the <hi>Assyrians</hi> themselves, say they, that very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through which you goe at this time. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard this. What now?
my <hi>Gobryas:</hi> and accuse you not this young Prince newly come to the Crowne,
as one who in his deportment is very proud and insolent? Yes verily quoth <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryas,</hi>
for I found him so. But hath he carried himselfe in that sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> replyed <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
to you onely, or to some besides? so helpe mee <hi>Iupiter</hi> quoth <hi>Gobryas,</hi> to
many others likewise. But of his outrages committed upon feeble persons
what need I to relate? For, a much greater Potentates sonne then I am, and one
verily who was his companion as mine had beene, whiles he dranke and made
merry with him, he laid hands upon and guelded him: because as some have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out, a Concubine of his had praised him for his beauty and goodly perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
in saying that the woman were right happy, who might be his wife: but, as
himself now saith, for that he would have forced the said Concubine. And now
is he become indeed an Eunuch. But since his fathers death enjoyeth his Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norie
and Dominion. How then quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> thereupon, thinke you, that this
young Gentleman also would gladly see us, if he might be perswaded that wee
would aide and assist him? Yes, that he would, I dare be bold to say, quoth <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryas.</hi>
But to have a sight of him, my good friend <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it is an hard matter.
And why so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Because quoth <hi>Gobryas,</hi> he that will joyne with him,
must of necessity passe hard by Babylon. And what difficulty lyeth in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

said <hi>Cyrus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> For that, I assure you, upon my knowledge, there hath issued out
of that City a more puissant armie by farre; than that which you have in field
at this present. Moreover, this you are to know, that for this very cause the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
furnish you lesse with armour now, and bring unto you fewer horses,
than they did at first: Because your forces seemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto them that viewed the
same but small: and this rumour is already very much spred abroad. And
therefore in mine opinion better it were, that wee march warily and well
guarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> having heard <hi>Gobryas</hi> deliver such speeches, made answer in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
I approove very well ô <hi>Gobryas</hi> of this, that you advise us to stand upon
our guard, and to make our journeyes most safely. And considering the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
well, I cannot thinke in my mind of any surer way than to passe on, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto Babylon, if so be our enemies forces be there most puissant. For, many
they be in number as your selfe confesse. Now, if they shall take heart, and be
confident withall, they will upon my word, bee terrible also unto us. In case
therefore they shall have no sight at all of us, but thinke that wee keepe close
and unseene, as if we stood in feare of them, know assuredly quoth he, that they
will be delivered of the feare which they have conceived, and in stead thereof
gather more boldnesse, the longer it be that they see us not. But if wee march
now straight against them, wee shall find many of them weeping and wailing
still for those whom we have slaine: many having yet their wounds bound up,
which they received from us; and all of them carrying the fresh remembrances
of the late manhood and valour of this our armie, togither with the wofull
flight and disasterous calamity of their owne. You are besides ô <hi>Gobryas</hi> to take
knowledge of this, what an ordinary thing it is in most men, when they are
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19319:67"/>
confident and resolute, to carry an hautie and invincible minde. Let them be
affrayd once, the more they are in number, the greater will their affright and
amazednesse be. For, by many rumours and those evill, it is in them augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
upon many adverse occurrents also: by occasion likewise of many heavy
down-looks and astonied countenances, it gathereth still and groweth more
and more. In so much as, for the greatnesse thereof it is no easie matter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
it with comfortable words, or by leading against the enemies to put
heart and strength againe, or yet by drawing them away, to recover in them
any good conceit of themselves. But the more that a man exhorteth them to
resolution, the greater perils they thinke they are plunged into. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take throughly into consideration this point. For, if in the question of
warre and martiall exploits, we measure victories by this, whether side can le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
and number more men, good cause you have then, to be afraid on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
and we in very truth are in great jeopardie: but if, as heretofore, so now
also, battailes are tried and determined by the valour of those that sight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
you cannot doe amisse, if you be bold and confident. For, you shall finde
with the helpe of God, many more with us and in our Campe willing to
fight, than among them. And that you may yet take more courage unto you,
consider this also with your selfe. The enemies are at this present, in number
lesse by farre, than before they were discomfited by us: yea and fewer still than
what time they fled away from us. As for us, greater we are now than hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by reason that we have wonne a victorie: more puissant also and strong,
in regard of our good fortune, and withall more in number, by your comming
unto us. And doe not you henceforth detract from the honour of your owne
men, now that they be with us. For where Conquerours be, wote well <hi>Gobryas,</hi>
that even the very Lackeys and Pages in the traine that hang on, follow boldly.
Neither be you ignorant of this, that well may our enemies take a view of us
now: but know for a truth, that no way can we terrifie them more than in our
march against them. Sithens then my opinion is thus delivered, lead us forth
directly to Babylon.</p>

them came backe againe, such as had tumbled downe from their horses and

were falne: and many brought away rich booties with them. Now when the

and Hyrcanians, the<note n="*" place="margin">The Peet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> aforesaid</note> Homotims likewise of Persia, unto whom he made this
speech. <hi>Gobryas,</hi> my good friends, hath heretofore entertained us all, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gifts of hospitalitie. If now therefore, after wee have selected (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is) a due proportion for the Gods, and set by for the rest of the armie a
competent part, wee bestow upon him the remnant of the spoiles, wee shall
doe passing well: shewing our selves straightwayes to endevour for to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
those in courtesies who deserve so well at our hands. No sooner heard
they this, but they all approoved yea and commended the motion: but one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the rest added moreover and said. Wee must in any case ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> so doe.
For, thus <hi>Gabryas,</hi> as I take it, reputed us no better than beggers, because wee
came not with our proofes full of Daricke purses, nor dranke in<note n="*" place="margin">Goble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, or bottles.</note> cups of gold.
But if we thus doe, he wil perhaps acknowledge, that we may be liberall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
gold. Goe to therefore said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when yee have delivered up unto the
Priests the <hi>Deo-dands,</hi> and set aside as much as may suffice the armie, send for
<hi>Gobryas,</hi> and let him have the residue. So after they had taken all that was meet
and necessary, the surplusage they gave unto <hi>Gobryas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, <hi>Cyrus</hi> marched against the very Citie of Babylon, with his armie
arraunged in order of battaile, like as when the field was fought. Now when
the Assyrians issued not forth against him, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded <hi>Gobryas</hi> to ride
on, and in his name to summon the King, saying, That if he would come out
in person and fight for his country, himselfe would combat with him: but in
case he would not defend his country, then of necessitie he must give place and
submit unto the winners. So <hi>Gobryas</hi> rode so farre as hee might with safetie,
and delivered the said Challenge. Vnto whom the King sent out one to returne
his answere in these words. Thy Lord and Master, (<hi>Gobryas</hi>) saith, I repent
mee not that I have slaine thy sonne, but because I killed not thee also with
him. If yee are minded to fight, come thirtie dayes hence: For, now we have
no leisure, and cannot intend it, being as yet but in preparation for a battaile.
Vnto whom <hi>Gobryas</hi> said, God graunt that his repentance of yours may never
have end. For, evident it is, that ever since it came upon you thus to repent, I
am become a pricke in your sides. Then <hi>Gobryas</hi> related the answere of the
Assyrian King unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which so soone as he heard, he raised his Camp and
withdrew the Armie. And calling <hi>Gobryas</hi> unto him. Tell mee, quoth he,
Said you not erewhile, that he whom the Assyrian [King] did evirate, would
as you thought willingly side with us? Me thinks, said he, I dare warrant that
he will. For many times hee and I have freely communed togither. When
therefore you think it good, goe unto the man: but first handle the matter so
as that yee may sound him and know what he saith. And after you have fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
talked with him, if you perceive him willing to friend us, devise what
you can that he be not knowne to be our friend. For, in warre, neither can a
man by any meanes more pleasure his friends than if he seeme to be their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
nor endamage and hurt his enemies more any way, than if he make shew
to be their friend. Certes, I know, quoth <hi>Gobryas,</hi> that <hi>Gadatas</hi> would give a
great deale, to worke this king of Assyria some mischiefe, but it behooveth us
to consider what he is able to doe? Tell mee then, quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Thinke you
that the Captaine of the Fortresse situate in the Frontiers of this country, which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19319:68"/>
yee say was built against the Hyrcanians and Sacans, to be a bulwarke in time
of warre, for to defend these parts, will admit into it this Eunuch when hee
commeth with his power? Yes verily, quoth <hi>Gobryas,</hi> if he come unto him
unsuspected, as now he is. And farthest from all suspicion, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> hee
should be, if I besiege and assault his holds as if I were desirous to winne them,
and he againe make resistance and defend them with all his might: If I also for
my part take somewhat of his, and he againe for it, intercept as much of ours:
if he catch I say some others of our men, or else the very messengers whom I
send unto those that yee say are enemies unto the Assyrian King: Also, if such
as chaunce to be taken prisoners, give out and say, they are going to the armie
and bringing ladders for to skale the foresaid Castle walles. Againe, if the
Eunuch, as hearing thereof, make semblance, that hee is come to him with all
speed, for to give intelligence aforehand of these occurrents. Surely, quoth
<hi>Gobryas,</hi> I know very well, that if matters be thus carried, he will be ready to
receive him, yea and intreat him to stay with him untill you be departed. And
so, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being entred once into the Fort, he will be able easily to make
us Masters thereof. It cannot otherwise bee by all likelyhood, saith <hi>Gobryas,</hi>
whiles hee within practiseth and helpeth what he can, and you without more
hotely give the assault: Goe your waies then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and doe your ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
after you have acquainted the Eunuch with this plot, and dispatched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing accordingly, to be here prest and ready with mee. As for pledges
of assurance, you shall neither promise nor shew unto him greater, than those
which you have received from us. Hereupon <hi>Gobryas</hi> departed; whom the
Eunuch was glad to see: and so they covenanted and agreed in all points that
were meet and requisite. Now when <hi>Gobryas</hi> had related unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that hee
thought all was well and sure enough on the Eunuches part, for the execution
of these designments of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the very morrow after he gave an assault, and
<hi>Gadatas</hi> withstood him and defended the Peece. The Fort which <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke,
was the same that <hi>Gadatas</hi> had given order to be assaulted. As for the messengers
whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> dispatched before with instructions whither to goe, <hi>Gadatas</hi> suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some of them to get away and escape, to the end they might bring the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
forward and fetch skaling ladders: but such as he tooke, he examined by
torture in the presence of many. And when hee heard by their confession,
whereabout they went, hee addressed him immediately that very night to his
journey, as if he would reveale the same. Finally, hee menaged the matter so,
as that his words were credited: and so hee entreth the Castle as a friend, and
one that would doe his devoyr to aide him. And verily, for the while, he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Captaine of the said Castle, in making preparations all that hee
could for the defense thereof. But when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was come, <hi>Gadatas</hi> with the
helpe of those captives in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his armie, seized the Castle into his owne
hands. Which done, presently this <hi>Gadatas</hi> the Eunuch, having settled all things
in order within, came forth unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and doing his obeisance reverently, as
the guise is, saluted him in this manner. Welcome <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as I may say, God
save you and give you joy. And even so he doth truly, said <hi>Cyrus</hi> again. For, you
with the helpe of God doe not onely bid mee, but compell me also to rejoyce.
And I would have you to know for certeine, I am not a little proud, that I may
leave this fortresse to our Associates here, in termes of friendship: As for your

                  </note> nephewes of your owne. Thus said
<hi>Cyrus.</hi> Whereupon the Hyrcanian Prince, who even now and not before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
what was done, ranne unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and taking him by the right hand,
said: O noble <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the exceeding joy and comfort of your friends, how
much bound in thankfulnesse by your meanes am I to the Gods, for that they
have joyned mee in alliance to you? Goe you therefore, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Take
possession of that Castle, for which you love mee so affectionately: yea and
dispose of it so, as it may bee best worth and most acceptable to a friend of
ours, to the rest of our confederates, and above all to this <hi>Gadatas,</hi> who hath
wonne it and delivered it into our hands. But heare you Sir, quoth the Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Prince, Shall we when as the Cadusians, Sacans and my subjects are met,
call him also unto us, that wee may all, unto whom it apperteineth, lay our
heads togither and consult, how to our best behoofe and benefit we may hold
this fort? Hereto <hi>Cyrus</hi> also gave his assent. When they were met, whom the
charge of the Castle concerned, they agreed in this, that they should joyntly
have the keeping of it, unto whom it was commodious for to be a peaceable
and friendly neighbour; to the end it might be, as, a warlike and defensive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
for themselves, so a strong skants and offensive to the Assyrians.</p>
               <p>When this was done, the Cadusians, Sacans and Hyrcanians were much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
in the service of warre, and came up unto him with their forces more
cheerefully. And hereupon there assembled a power of the Cadusians to the
number of twentie thousand light Targuatiers on foot, and foure thousand
horsemen. Of Sacans ten thousand Archers on foot: and Carbires [or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
on horsebacke] two thousand. The Hyrcanians also sent unto those
that were there before, an addition of as many footmen as they could make;
beside a supply of two thousand horsemen. For, beforetime they had left the
greater part of their Cavallery at home, because the Cadusians and Sacans
mainteined hostilitie with the Assyrians. But, all the time that <hi>Cyrus</hi> sate here
about settling the estate of the Castle; the Assyrians inhabiting neere to those
parts, many of them led away their horses thither; many brought and put into
his hands their armour; For that by this time they stood in feare of all their
bordering neighbours.</p>
               <p>After this, came <hi>Gadatas</hi> unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> advertising him of certeine messengers,
who reported, how the Assyrian King, when he heard in what termes the said
strong Castle stood, tooke it to the heart, and withall made preparation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
his country. And therefore, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, if you will let me goe, I
will doe my best to save my forts yet. As for other things I passe the lesse. Then
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> Say you should at this present depart, when will you be at home? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
quoth <hi>Gadatas,</hi> by the third day I shall be able to suppe in mine owne land.
Why! doe you thinke saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that you shall finde the Assyrian King there
already? Yea verily, quoth he, I know I shall; For, the farther you seeme to
have marched forward, the more hast will he make. By what time, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
might I reach thither with my forces? Whereunto <hi>Gadatas</hi> made this answer.
You have now my Lord, a great army already, neither can you get unto my
habitation in lesse than sixe or seven dayes. Well, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Hie you thither.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19319:69"/>
Make you what speed you can for your part: I shall rid way and follow after,
as well as I may. So <hi>Gadatas</hi> tooke his leave and departed. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
togither all the Rulers and Chieftaines of his confederates, who seemed
by this time in number to be many, and those right hardly and martiall men, in
their Assembly made a speech to this effect.</p>

because he thinkes he hath sustained much damage by him: and haply
casteth withall thus in his mind, that if those who revolt unto us shall not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,
but contrariwise his confederates be by us utterly destroyed, within a

a man so friendly unto us and beneficiall. We shall besides performe a
deed of Iustice in thankfull requitall of a good turne; and therewith in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
worke a feat commodious for our selves. For, if it shall appeare in the eyes
of the world, that we aime at nothing more, than to exceed them in hurt doing
that annoy us, as also excell those in good doing who deserve well of us: great
reason there is, that by this meanes many will seeke unto us gladly for out
friendship, and more desire to be enemie unto us. But if we be thought to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<hi>Gadatas,</hi> with what eloquence I pray you, (before God I speake it) shall we
perswade others to gratifie us? How dare we praise and commend our selves?
or with what face may any one of us looke upon <hi>Gadatas?</hi> if wee so many in
number be overcome in well doing of him who is but one, especially being in
that case as he is.</p>
               <p>When he had thus said they all approved his speech and accorded, to goe in

<hi>Cyrus,</hi> since yee also give your assent, let us every one leave with our draught
beasts, with our wagons and chariots, such as are most meete to goe with the
same: And let <hi>Gobryas</hi> be Captaine of the convoy, and goe before them. For,
skilfull he is in the waies, and for all other occasions sufficient. As for our selves,
with the very best horse and men that we have set we forward, taking with us
victuals to serve for three daies. The lighter we be now loden, and the slighter
provided, the more pleasantly shall we dine, sup, and sleepe the dayes ensuing.
Now, for the order and manner of our march, let it be thus. First and formost,
you <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> lead those that be armed with corselets, for as much as the way
is even and broad. Place all your Centiniers in the Front: and let every hundred
march severally by themselves. For going thus thicke and close togither, wee

after your horsemen. Yee Captaines and souldiers both, as many as bee wise
looke to it diligently, that yee march in silence. For, by night, every thing must
of necessity, both be perceived and also wrought, by helpe of eares rather than
of eyes. And put case that any trouble and disorder arise in the night season, it
is much greater, and the same harder to be composed than in the day time. And
therefore, both silence is needfull to be kept, and order also as possibly to bee
observed. Now, for the night watches quoth he, (so often as ye are to arise in the
night) they must be alwaies appointed very short, and as many as may be: For
feare that any man by occasion of long wanting sleepe in his watch, be enforced
to take hurt in his march. And looke, when the houre of remoove and setting
forward is come, the signall must be given by winding an horne. To conclude,
when every man is furnished with necessaries, bee yee ready to take the high
way that leadeth to Babylon. And let each one, ever as hee beginneth to
march onward, hee exhort him that commeth behind at his heeles to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
on.</p>
               <p>After this, they retired to their Pavilions, discoursing as they went one with
another in this sort. What a singular memorie hath <hi>Cyrus?</hi> How many hath he
given directions unto? How hath he charged and commaunded them by name?
And, in truth, <hi>Cyrus</hi> attained unto this by his industry and diligence. For, he
thought it a great wonder, That whereas base artificers and mechanicall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faries,
know every one the severall names of the tooles belonging to their Art,
and the Physician likewise the termes of all the instruments, drugs and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19319:70"/>
which hee useth; the Generall I say of an armie, should bee so stupid and
blockish, as not to know the inferiour Captaines names under him, whom hee
must necessarily use as instruments when hee is minded either to surprise any
thing by way of prevention or to hold the same: when he intendeth I say either
to encourage or to put in feare. Moreover if at any time a Generall be disposed
to grace and honour one, he thought it seemely and decent to call the party by
name. Furthermore, of this opinion he was, that they who thought their Prince
tooke knowledge of them, were both desirous to be seene above the rest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiting
some brave service, and also readier than others to forbeare commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any lewd and unseemely act: This also he supposed to be a foolish and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
fashion, that when a Lord Generall would have a thing to be done in the
Armie, he should give order therefore, as some masters in their houses use to
commaund, namely in this manner, Let one goe for water, Some body cleave
wood, &amp;c. For, when they bid in this wise, he thought they would all look and
stare one upon another, and none goe about that which is commaunded: all are
in fault alike: yet is there not one ashamed of his fault or once affraid: because it
is common to him with many other. In these regards, whensoever hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
ought to be done, he called unto them all by name. And thus much
as touching the discreet judgement of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in these matters.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers then, for that time, when they had supped, appointed senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
and brought togither all things needfull, went to bed. And at midnight he
gave the signall [to dislodge] by sound of horne. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after he had said
unto <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> that he should give attendance in the very way, before the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the armie, taking his<note n="*" place="margin">Sarjeants.</note> officers [and guard] about him, went forth.
Within a while, <hi>Chrysantas</hi> with the Cuirace men in his conduct. Whom <hi>Cyrus</hi>
when he had given him guides of the way, commaunded to march faire and
softly, untill a messenger came unto him; For as yet all the armie was not on
foote. Himselfe standing still in the same place, looke whom he saw comming
toward him, he did put forward orderly in his ranke, but unto him that lagged
behind he sent to call him on. Now when they were all upon the way, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
certaine horsemen unto <hi>Chrysantas</hi> to tell him, how they all now had
put themselves in their journey, and therefore willed him to mend his pace and
lead on faster. Himselfe in person, mounted on horsebacke rode gently to the
Front of the armie and beheld the companies in ranke: and whomsoever he saw
marching in good order and with silence, to them he would ride close, and aske
who they were? and when he once knew, praise them he would: but if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any to be tumultuous and disorderly, after the cause thereof knowne, he
would labour to appease the misrule. One thing there remaineth yet, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the diligence and care which he shewed in the night march: namely that he
sent
forth before the whole armie certaine footmen lightly appointed, and
those not many in number: who being both seene of <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> and also seeing
him, should as<note n="*" place="margin">or priuy Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

enemies affronted it: to the end that if any encountred full opposite unto him,
he having the strength of his armie in battaile ray, might make head and fight
with them; but if they were seene any whereto flie, he might be most ready to
pursue them: for, he had ever about him, some appointed to follow the chace
when there was need of pursuit: others againe to abide with him. for, never

               <head type="sub">A Conspiracy against Gadatas. An Ambush layd by the Assyrian King:
Where hee received a great overthrow. How Cyrus saved
Gadatas and all his men.</head>
               <p>NOvv it happened, that a certeine great person one of <hi>Gadatas</hi> his men
of armes, considering how his Lord and Master was revolted from the
Assyrian King, thought this with himselfe, that if ought but well should
come unto <hi>Gadatas,</hi> hee might obteine at the Kings hand the seizure of all his
goods and lands. Vpon which project of his, hee sends one of his trusty ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
unto the said Assyrian King with these instructions: That in case he found
the Assyrian forces already in <hi>Gadatas</hi> his country, hee should give the King to
understand, that if he lay in ambushment, hee might take both <hi>Gadatas</hi> himselfe
and all his companie: willing him withall to signifie what power <hi>Gadatas</hi> had
in his conduct? likewise that <hi>Cyrus</hi> accompanied him not; as also, to shew
which way he would come. Moreover, to the end he might be the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
he charged his owne servants, to deliver up the Castle which himselfe
held within the territorie of <hi>Gadatas,</hi> with all that was therein, into the hands of
the King of Assyria. Furthermore, he promised that after he had slaine <hi>Gadatas,</hi>
he would come to him in person if hee could: if not, yet would hee from that
time forward take the Kings part. The messenger appointed for this errand
rode post and with great speed came unto the Assyrian King, and declared unto
the King the cause of his comming, which when he heard, he presently entred
upon the said Castle, and with a great power of horsemen, and a number of
chariots, laid wait in the villages, standing thicke thereabout. <hi>Gadatas</hi> when he
drew neere to those villages, sent forth certeine in espiall to cleere the coasts.
The Assyrian King having intelligence that these espies were comming, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
two or three of the chariots and some few horsemen to give ground
and flie, making semblance as if they were affrighted, and but few in number.
Which when those foreriders perceived, they not onely themselves followed
in pursuit, but also gave the Al-arme to <hi>Gadatas.</hi> Who being deceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
made after and followed amaine. The Assyrians then, for that they thought
<hi>Gadatas</hi> at the point to be taken, arose streight out of their embushment. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datas</hi>
with his companies seeing that, fled, as good cause they had: The other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
againe with as great reason pursued them. At which very time, that trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19319:71"/>
villaine who had plotted to forelay <hi>Gadatas,</hi> strake him: and failed in
deed of giving him a deadly blow, but smote him in the shoulder and so woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him. Which deed done, he went his wayes to joyne with those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in chace. For, being knowne who he was, hee togither with the Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
put spurres to his horse, and helped the King in his pursuit. Then and there,
be you sure, they that rode upon the heaviest and slowest jades, were taken by
those who had the swiftest steeds under them. And verily <hi>Gadatas</hi> his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
being all sore overlayed, for that they were tired out with their long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
no sooner espied <hi>Cyrus</hi> comming forward with his armie, but a man might
well thinke they were right joyous and glad, as if out of some storme and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
they had arrived to a safe harbour. <hi>Cyrus</hi> at the first sight, mervailed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at:
but when hee understood what the matter was, so long as they rode all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
toward him, he led his forces in order of battaile against them. But so
soone as the enemies knowing how the world went, reculed and fled, <hi>Cyrus</hi>
commaunded the light horsemen appointed therefore, to make hote pursuit,
and himselfe with the rest followed hard after according as he thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.
There, might a man have seene, some Chariots taken, out of which
the drivers were fallen, partly in the very turning and partly otherwise: others
againe intercepted by the horsemen and surprised. They slew also very many;
and among the rest, the traitour himself who had hurt <hi>Gadatas.</hi> Meane-while the
Assyrian footmen who were besieging <hi>Gadatas</hi> his fortresse, abandoned that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.
Some fled for succour into the Castle, which had revolted from <hi>Gada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas:</hi>
others got away before their enemies, and did put themselves into a great
Citie of the Assyrian Kings, whereinto himselfe with his chariots and horses
was retyred. Vpon these exploits thus atchieved, <hi>Cyrus</hi> returned backe into
<hi>Gadatas</hi> his country: and after order given unto those whom it concerned, to
take charge of the captives, he went directly to see how <hi>Gadatas</hi> did upon his
hurt. And as he went forward, <hi>Gadatas</hi> having by that time, his wound dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and bound up, met him on the way. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> saw him, he rejoyced
and said. I was comming to you, for to see how you did: And I, quoth <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datas,</hi>
so God me love, was going, to behold you againe and see what a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
you carry, bearing as you doe this brave minde: who, when I wist not
my selfe what need you had now of my helpe, nor you ever undertooke or
promised to doe this for mee, ne yet in your owne particular received so much
as any small pleasure at my hand; but onely for that I seemed unto you, in
some measure to benefit my friends, have so lovingly and with such affection
reskued mee: as that now for any thing in mee, I might have perished, but by
your meanes I am saved. And here, my good <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I report mee to the Gods
whom I take to record, were I as perfect and sound a man, as when I was new
borne, and had I begotten children, I doubt whether ever I should have had a
child of mine owne, who would have prooved so kinde to mee, as you have
beene. For, I have knowne other unnaturall children; (and even for example
this very King of Assyria that now is) who hath wrought his father much
more woe and trouble, than himselfe is able now to worke you. Whereas
<hi>Cyrus</hi> returned this answere. My <hi>Gadatas,</hi> You make a great mervaile of mee
now, letting passe I assure you a greater wonder. And what might that be,
quoth <hi>Gadatas?</hi> Even this, saith he, that so many Persians, so many Medes, so
many Hyrcanians, and all the Armenians, Sacans and Cadusians here present,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19319:71"/>
have hastened and beene so forward for your sake. Whereupon <hi>Gadatas</hi> brake
out into this prayer. O Iupiter, the Gods graunt unto these men many good
blessings, but unto him most, who is the author of this their so kinde affection.
And to the end, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that we may enterteine and adorne these whom you
so praise, here take such hospitall gifts as I am able to bestow, And therewith
presented unto him very many: that not onely whosoever would might sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unto the Gods, but the whole armie also throughout be rewarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the worth of these Acts so well performed, and speeding as well.</p>

peece of service by himselfe, without acquainting <hi>Cyrus</hi> with his designe,
and saying never a word unto him, made a rode into the territorie toward Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
and harried it. But whiles his horsemen were raunging abroad and strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
asunder, the Assyrian King issuing out of a Citie of his owne whereinto he
was before fled, came upon them at unwares, with his armie very well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and in order of battaile, to encounter him. And when he discovered them
to be the Cadusians onely, he charged upon them, and among many other slew
the said Commaunder of them. He tooke many horses also of the Cadusians,
and despoyled them of all that bootie which they had gotten and were driving
away. Thus the King of Assyria, after he had followed the Cadusians in rout,
so farre as he might with safetie, returned. As for the formost of the Cadusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
they recovered the Campe by the shutting in of the evening and so escaped
safe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> being advertised of this disaster, went forth and met the Cadusians.
As he saw any one wounded, him hee received and comforted, yea and sent to
<hi>Gadatas</hi> for to be cured. The rest he bestowed in pavilions by themselves togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and with great care gave order that they should have all necessaries, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
unto him as assistants in the businesse, certeine of the Persian Homotimi.
(For, in such cases as these, good and honest men are willing to set to their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
hands) And for his owne part verily, how much hee grieved it evidently
appeared, in that it being now supper time, when the rest were at supper, <hi>Cyrus</hi>
still with his<note n="*" place="margin">Scrj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="5 letters">

his good will left not one neglected and unlooked to, but if hee did not in his

to tend them. And so for that time they went to rest.</p>
               <p>By the breake of day, he made Proclamation by the publike Criers that the
Rulers of the other Associates, but the Cadusians all in generall should assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
togither: and unto them hee delivered these or such like words. My friends
and Confederates. An ordinary accident it is among men, that hath befal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unto you. For, men yee are, and that men should erre, is in my conceit, no
wonder. And yet by good right meet it is, that of this infortunitie we should
reape some profit. Namely, To learne, never hereafter to sever from the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19319:72"/>
whole body of the armie, any Regiment, weaker than the enimies forces. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speake I this, quoth he, that a man ought not sometimes to goe out, when
the case so requireth, with a lesse power, than wherewith the Cadusians ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
did set forth. But if one enterprise an exploit, imparting his minde first
to him, who is able and sufficient to helpe; and so goe forth, he may perchance
faile of his purpose and be deceived: yet as possible it is, that hee who stayeth
still behind, may delude the enemies, diverting them another way from those
who went forth. There are besides, other meanes to worke trouble unto the
enemies, and thereby to procure the safetie of friends. And so verily, he that
is gone apart from the rest, may not be coumpted absent, but to depend upon
the residue of the forces behind. But he that departeth, making no man privie
beforehand where he is, differeth nothing at all, from him, who of himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
undertaketh an expedition. Howbeit for this mischance, quoth he, that
hath happened, God willing, ere it bee long wee will be avenged of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
For, so soone as ever yee have taken a short dinner, I my selfe will bring
you where the deed was done: and there will we both bury our dead, and also
if God will, shew unto our enemies, that in the very place where they
thinke they have gotten the upper hand, there be others better men than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
in so much as they shall take no great joy, to see that plot of ground, on
which they slew our Associates. But in case, they will not come forth and meet
us in the field, let us set their villages on fire, let us harry and wast their country,
that they may have no pleasure, in the sight of those things which they have
done to us, but contrariwise sorrow, and grieve to behold their owne calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Goe yee therefore all the rest, quoth he, to your dinners. As for you that
are Cadusians: First, choose according to your owne law and custome, some
one to be your<note n="*" place="margin">Generall, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

may take the charge of you, and see what yee stand in need of. When yee
have elected him and dined withall, send whom yee have elected unto mee.
And so they did accordingly. But <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after hee had brought forth his armie,
and appointed him to his Regiment whom the Cadusians had made choice of,
commaunded him to lead the same arraunged in order of battaile close to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
to the end, quoth he, that if it be possible wee may encourage these men
againe. Thus set they forth, and being come to the place, they both entered
the Cadusians, and harried the country. And when they had so done, and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
victuall and other provision out of the enemies land, they departed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into the territorie of <hi>Gadatas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, considering that they who had revolted unto him, bordering as
they did upon Babylon, should susteine much detriment by so ill a neighbour,
unlesse himselfe were continually present with them, commaunded as many of
the enemies as he dismissed, to say unto the Assyrian King, and withall sent an
Herauld to denounce unto him in his name, that ready hee was for his part to
forbeare the husbandmen that tilled the ground, and would doe them no
wrong; in case the King likewise would permit their labourers and husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who had revolted unto him, to till their grounds in peace. And you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
quoth he, to the King, were you able to prohibit them, shall when you
have all done hinder but a few: For their territories are but small who have
turned from you to me: but it lies in my power to suffer a large country of yours
to be tilled. And as touching the harvest and inning of the fruits therein; if
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19319:72"/>
the warre continue, he shall reape and gather all, (as I suppose) that is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.
But if peace shall be established, who but your selfe shall have and hold
all? For surely, if any of my souldiers shall rise and take armes against you or
yours against mee, we will of both sides, quoth he, doe our best to chastice and
punish the delinquents. Having put these instructions in this wise into the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds
mouth, he sent him away. The Assyrians when they heard this message,
did the best they could to perswade their King, to condiscend unto these condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to leave as little warre behind, as might be. And verily the Assyrian
King, whether it were through the perswasion of his owne nation, or for that
himselfe was willing enough, and inclined that way already, assented thereto
Hereupon capitulated and covenanted it was betweene these two Potentates,
that the husbandmen should have peace, and the armed souldiers warre. Thus
much effected <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the behalfe of husbandmen. As touching pasturage for
their labouring beasts, he gave order unto his friends, That it should be assigned
and set out, as they would themselves, where their owne Demesnes and Seigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
lay: but from the enemies they drave booties wheresoever they could light
upon any: to the end, that unto his Associates the warfare might be the more
pleasant. For admit they gat no victuals and necessaries, yet the daungers were
all one: but to live of their enemies country, seemed to make their souldiery
and service the easier.</p>
               <p>Well, whiles <hi>Cyrus</hi> now made preparation to depart out of those quarters,
<hi>Gadatas</hi> came and shewed himselfe, bringing and driving before him many and
sundry presents, as having a large habitation, and the same well stored: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest, many horses of service, which he had taken from his owne men
of armes, such as he distrusted for their treacherous lying in wait for him. And
as he approached neere unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he spake in this wise. Here Sir, quoth he, I
bring now unto you these things, that you may for the present use them as you
need. But thinke this withall, that whatsoever beside is mine, the same is also
yours. For neither have I nor ever shall, a child of mine owne body begotten,
unto whom I may leave my house and inheritance, but when I die, my whole
line and name must of necessitie be extinct with me. And the Gods, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I
take to witness, who both see all and heare all, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that I have not committed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in word or deed, any unjust or dishonest act, whereby I should deserve these
calamities. And as he uttered these words, he bewailed his owne fortune, and
for very teares could speake no more. <hi>Cyru</hi> hearing his pittious mone, tooke
commiseration of the mans hard hap and calamitie, saying withall. As for the
horses, quoth he, I accept of them. For hereby shall I doe you a pleasure, all
the while I bestow them upon those men, who are better affected unto you, as
it appeareth, than those whose ere-while they were. And, the Persian Cavallery
I shall shortly make up, to the number of 10000 horsemen, the thing that I have
so long desired. Your other treasure, quoth he, take away, and keepe it to your
selfe, untill you see me have so much, as that in requitall I be not inferiour to
you. For, if at your departure you give me more than you receive at my hands,
I know not, so helpe me God, how to doe, but to be grieved and ashamed. To
this <hi>Gadatas</hi> said, Truly I beleeve you herein. For, I see your gentle nature and
franke disposition. But, see I pray you, whether I be able to keepe the same? For,
so long as we and the Assyrian King were friends, my Patrimony was thought
to be a very faire livelode and estate. For, lying as it did neere unto that great
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19319:73"/>
and populous Citie Babylon, looke what commoditie might grow from a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ample Citie, wee got and enjoyed the same: and what trouble or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrance
might arise from thence, we could retire hither home and be farre
remote therefro. But now, standing as we doe in termes of enmitie, evident
it is that after you be once departed, both we our selves shall be forelayed with
our whole family: and so farre as I can see, a pensive and sorrowfull life wee
shall lead, having our enemies so neere, and seeing them to bee more puissant
than our selves. But, peradventure you will say. And why thought you not so
much before you revolted? Certes, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because my minde fixed upon such a
wrong done, and blinded with very anger, considered not what was best and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
for me: but conceived and ever was with child of these fansies. Will it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be, that I shall be revenged of him, an enemy both to God and man? him,
I say, who mortally and continually hateth not one, if he doe him any wrong,
but if he doe but suspect another better than himselfe? And therefore, I thinke
verily, that being so bad as he is, all the confederates that he employeth in his
service, he shall finde worse than himselfe. And say, there bee any one that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
better than another; Bee assured, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you shall never need to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any good and valiant man, but he will be sufficient so to worke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive,
as to kill him to your hand that is his better. And as for molesting mee,
verily, he will I suppose with the helpe of those wicked ones overmatch me.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard him say thus, he thought, that he spake to the point, and
what was worthy to be considered. Whereupon he inferred presently and said.
How say you then <hi>Gadatas,</hi> have you not fortified your holds and castles with
garrisons for your owne defense and safetie, whensoever you shall enter into
them? And doe you not your selfe in person goe with us in this expedition,
that if God be still on our side, as now he is, this [wicked Prince] may stand in
feare of you, and not you of him? Goe along therefore with me, and what ever
of yours you take pleasure to see, or delight to companie with, have with you.
Certes, you may as I suppose stand me in very good stead, and I will endevour
likewise to my power for to pleasure you. Which offer when <hi>Gadatas</hi> heard, he
tooke heart againe and said. Is it possible for me to trusse up bag and baggage,
and to gather togither all that I have before you depart? For, desirous I am,
quoth he, to have away my mother with me. You may very well, quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
For I will stay for your sake, untill you say that all is well. So <hi>Gadatas</hi> for the
present tooke his leave, and by the advise of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> did put garrisons into those
Castles which he had fortified: and gat togither all such stuffe and furniture, as
might beseeme an ample and stately house for to be inhabited. Moreover, of
those about him he tooke such trusty friends, as in whom hee had delight: yea
and many likewise whom he distrusted: and of those, hee compelled some to
bring away with them their wives, others their sisters: to the end that being
yoked to them, hee might hold them in their alleageance. Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> having
<hi>Gadatas</hi> in his retinew, departed: Who served his turne very well, to direct him
in the waies, to shew him where water, where forage, provander, and corne was
to be had, to the end he might alwaies encampe in places of most plentie.</p>

               <p>NOw when he marched on, and discovering in his journey, the city of
Babylon, perceived besides that the way which he went, led directly to
the very wals, he called <hi>Gobryas</hi> and <hi>Gadatas</hi> unto him. Of whom hee
demaunded, if there were not another passage, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> might not approach
the wall so neere? Then <hi>Gobryas,</hi> There are, my Lord, quoth he, very many ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
but I thought you were now minded to lead your army as nigh as you
could unto the City, for to shew unto them within, your armie how brave and
puissant it is. For, when you had a lesse power, you came close to the very wall,
and they beheld us to be but few in number. And now, although the King be
in readinesse, as hee said himselfe he was preparing to fight, yet I know very
well, that when he vieweth your forces, he will thinke his owne to be yet unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
To this, <hi>Cyrus</hi> made answer thus. You seeme to mervaile my <hi>Gobryas,</hi> that
when I came with a lesse armie by farre, I advanced hard to the City wall, and
now having a greater power, am unwilling to march under the same. But mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile

                     </gap>
                  </note> passe by aloofe. For, all men advance forward, so arraunged, as they thinke
they may fight best: and yet those that be wise, use in withdrawing and rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their forces, to consider, how they may get away, not most speedily, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

with greatest safety. Now, of necessity, passe by wee must, with our wagons
stretched out in length to the view: but withall, other porters and carriers of
baggage very neere togither and hidden. And all these ought to be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where without armes. In which regard, if we march so, it cannot otherwise be,
but the strong and able men to fight, must be placed close to the weake and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And therefore, if the enemies would in any place sallie forth thicke out of
the City and charge us, wheresoever they shall encounter with us, they will be
able more fiercely to maintaine the fight, than we that thus passe by. Againe, to
those that march so<note n="*" place="margin">

great way off, and long first: Whereas they from the wals, may in a trice, both
runne to succour them that are so neere, and also as soone retire againe. But if
we passe along no neerer than so as they may see us, keeping onely the same
breadth as now we doe in our march, our number verily they shall behold, but
by reason of the glittering harnoise and armed men intermingled among, the
whole multitude and body of the armie must needs seeme terrible. Now, if as
we march in this order, they shall closely set upon us, wee discovering them
before a good way off, shall not be taken tardie nor unprovided. But rather, my
good friends, quoth he, they will not so much as give the attempt, when they
must goe farre from the walles: except they suppose themselves with their
whole power able to outmatch us and all our forces. For, thus to goe aside and
out of the way is a fearefull thing. When he had thus said, he was thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them all that were present to speake fully to the purpose. <hi>Gobryas</hi> therefore
led as hee commaunded him. Thus, as the armie passed aloofe by the Citie,

                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe held of, and drew backe so, as evermore hee made the rereward

few dayes following, hee was come unto the Confines of the Assyrians and
Medes, from whence he had first set out, finding there three fortresses of the
Assyrians, one of them which was the weakest he assailed and forced the other

               <head type="sub">How Cyrus returned to the Marches of Media, and laboured to appease the wrath

               <p>THESE exploits atchieved, <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent unto <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> requiring him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
to repaire unto the Armie, to the end they might devise togither
and consult, as touching the keeping of those holds newly taken in: as
also, that upon the sight of the Armie, he might advise farther concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affaires, what he thought meet to be done. Yet say, quoth he, that (if hee
thinke so good) I am ready to come unto him; there to encampe. Thus the

the tent, and with them the musicall chanteresses, selected for <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> which
they did accordingly. But when he that was sent to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> had delivered his
message, no sooner heard he it, but he thought it better, that the Army should
remaine there still upon the Confines. For, the Persians also whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> had
sent for, were now come unto him, being in number 40000 one with another,
of Archers and light Targuatiers. And therefore when <hi>Cyaxares</hi> saw that these
likewise much endammaged the Medes land, he thought it would be more for
his ease, to be discharged even of them, rather than to receive a multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
unto them. Now when he, who had the leading of this armie out of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,
asked <hi>Cyaxares</hi> according to the tenour of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Letter, whether he had
any need of the said forces? and he againe answered, that he had none; O he,
the very same day hearing of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his comming, went forth with his power
towards him. The morrow after, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> with the residue of the Medes horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that remained with him, did put himselfe on his journey. And when <hi>Cyrus</hi>
was advertised of his approch, he tooke unto him the Persian horsemen, who
by this time were in number much increased; all the Medes likewise and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,
the Hyrcanians also and other Confederates, as many as were best
mounted and armed withall, and so met <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and shewed unto him his
whole power. But <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> seeing such a shew of so many brave men accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> and contrariwise so small a traine, and the same of base accompt,
attending upon his owne person, thought it a great dishonour and disgrace unto
his Majestie, and thereat grieved not a little. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> alighted from his
horse, and when he came towards him for to kisse him, as the manner was, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi>
likewise dismounted in deed, but turned away and would not kisse him:
nay, hee wept amaine, that all men might see him. Whereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19319:74"/>
all others to goe aside and be still. But himselfe taking <hi>Cyaxares</hi> by the
right hand, and leading him out of the way under a row of certaine Date trees,
gave commaundement, to lay Median carpets and ruggs for him on the ground,
upon which when he had caused him to sit downe, he fate himselfe by his side,
and began to breake with him in this manner.</p>
               <p>Tell mee on<note n="*" place="margin">For Gods sake</note> Gods behalfe, my good Vnkle, why you are so angry with

from Kings in old time mine Auncestors, knowne also to be a Kings some,
and taken for a King my selfe, see how basely and unbeseeming my estate I ride.
Contrariwise with what a companie of my retinew, and with a warlike power
besides you beare a port here, and magnificently shew your selfe: It would have
grieved one, in my conceit, to have beene served thus at an enemies hand: but
so to be entreated of them, by whom there was least cause, it is before God, a
greater indignity by farre. And better it were for me, I suppose to bee buried
quicke tenne times in the earth, than to be seene so abject, and to see mine owne
servants and subjects, thus to neglect me, yea and to make a laughing stocke of
me. For, it is not unknowne unto me, that not onely you are of greater puissance
than I, but also even mine owne vassals are come to meet me more mighty than
my selfe: and so well appointed, as that they be able to doe mee more harme
than I can them. And as hee uttered these words, the teares came upon him
more and more, in so much as hee inforced <hi>Cyrus</hi> also to weepe, so as his eyes
stood full againe of water. Who after hee had staied and continued himselfe a
while brake out into these words.</p>
               <p>But you, <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> neither say truly nor deeme aright, in case you thinke that
the <hi>Medes</hi> by my presence with them are so well appointed, as to bee able for
to worke your woe. Certes, I nothing mervaile that you are wroth and
affraied. And whether you be offended with them justly or unjustly, let that for
me, goe by: For, well I know, that if I should plead in their behalfe, you would
take it to the heart. But, for a Prince and Soveraigne, to be angry and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with all his subjects at once, I hold it a foule fault. For, many enemies must
needs bee procured, when a man is terrible unto many. And when one is set
against all, he giveth them occasion to joyne all in one mind, and to draw in a
line. In which regards, be you assured, I sent these your men backe unto you
not without my selfe, as fearing on their part, left ought might by reason of
your indignation have fallen out, which we all should rue. And verily by Gods
helpe, for these matters you shall incurre no daunger so long as I am present
But whereas you thinke your selfe wronged by me, that goeth to my heart, if
endeavouring as I doe, all that I can to pleasure my friends most, I be thought
afterwards for my labour to worke and practise the contrary. Well, Let us not
thus rashly contest and blame one another: But see, if it bee possible in most
plaine termes what manner of injurie mine is? And verily, content I am for my
selfe to make that offer which is most just and equall. If it appeare that I have
done ill, acknowledge I will and confesse my fault. But, if it bee found, that I
have done nothing amisse, nor intended evill, will not you then yeeld, that you
have not beene wronged by me? It must needs be so quoth he. Nay, what and
if it shall evidently be knowne, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that I have beene the author of your

welfare? that I have studied to conferre as many benefits as I could upon you,
will you not judge me worthy of praise rather than of rebuke? That is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
quoth <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> Why! then saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> let us examine in particular every
thing that I have done: and so it will most evidently aopeare, what therein is
good, and what is bad? Begin we, I say, if you thinke that will serve, at the very
originall. For, what time as you perceived many of your enemies assembled,
and those already come forward against you, and invading your land; what did
you but send immediately to the State of <hi>Persia,</hi> craving their aide, yea and to
my selfe especially, intrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by your words: I came unto you in person, and brought unto you men, for
number many, and for valour the best I could. True it is quoth he, you came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
Tell me then, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> First, whether herein you condemne any injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Apparent it is quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> that hereby I must acknowledge your good dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Goe to then, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when your enemies were come, and that there
was no remedie, but fought they must be with, did you in that tryall perceive
me, either to shrinke for any paines, or to spare for any perill? No surely quoth
<hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I protest before God. To proceed, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> what time as by Gods
assistance, the victory was ours, and the enemies fled. When I requested you,
that wee might with our united forces, pursue them, and in common revenge
our selves of them, and what event soever ensued thereof, good or bad, to take
part indifferently? in these things can you impute any avarice unto me, as if I
sought mine owne advantage above others? At this, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> held his peace.
Then replied <hi>Cyrus</hi> and went on in this wise. Since it pleaseth you at this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to keepe silence rather than to answer: yet tell mee thus much I pray you,
whether you tooke your selfe to be wronged in that, when you thought it stood
not with your owne safety to follow the chace, I would not suffer you in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
person, to bee in any part of the daunger, but requested you onely to send
unto me some of your horsemen: Shew I say, whether in this request of mine,
I did you wrong, especially seeing I had already borne my selfe in your service
as a true confederate? And when <hi>Cyaxares</hi> said nothing to this also. Seeing then,
quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it is not your pleasure to answer unto this point: Speake yet from
henceforth, whether I wronged you, in that, when you made me this answer,
that perceiving as you did the <hi>Medes</hi> addicted to Ioviall mirth, you would not
have them to give it over, not force them to enter upon a daungerous peece of
service, Tell me I say, Thinke you that I offred you any hard measure, in that
I neglected to be angry with you, but eftsoones entreated of you afterwards,
that thing, than which I knew, there was nothing of lesse moment for you to
graunt, nor easier to be imposed upon the <hi>Medes?</hi> For, I prayed you onely to
give me such as willingly would follow me. Which being graunted, yet was
I never the neerer, unlesse I could perswade them. To them I went, I perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with them: and looke whom I could prevaile with, I tooke with me, and
went my waies with your good leave and permission. Now if you esteeme this
blame-worthy, then surely even to take any thing at your hands which you
frankly give, cannot, as it should seeme, be void of blame. To be short, Thus
and thus wee did set forth. when wee were gone, what was exploited by us
which is not to all men knowne? Was not our enemies campe by force wonne?

them yours, you see now in the hands and possession of your Friends: part
whereof, they bring to you, and part for themselves, who neverthelesse are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your dominion. And that which of all the rest is most honourable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
you see your owne Territories and Seignories enlarged, but those of
your enemies diminished. Your enemies Castles and Forts, you see wonne
and held by force: but your owne, as many as formerly were plucked from
you and in the possession of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> are now contrariwise reverted unto you.
Of these particulars to desire for to know, whether any were good<note n="*" place="margin">

This said, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ended his speech. And then <hi>Cyaxares</hi> returned this
answer.</p>
               <p>That these deeds which you have done, nephew <hi>Cyrus,</hi> be simply ill, I wote
not how it can or ought to be said. But this I would have you to know, quoth
he, that these good things be of this nature, that by how much more conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
they be, the more they depresse me. For I would rather you had augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
your owne dominion by my forces, than see mine owne enlarged by you
in this sort. And as these Acts are to you the Actour honourable, so to mee in
some sort they bring dishonour. As for goods and riches verily, I had leiffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
bestow them upon you, than to receive at your hands, those that you present
me with. For, I plainely perceive that you enrich me with such things, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I am become the poorer. And suppose, that I saw my subjects sustaine some
little injury at your hands, I should, me thinks, grieve lesse than now I doe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how great benefits they have received under you. Now if you thinke that
I weigh these matters inconsiderately, alter the case, and turne the same from me
to your selfe, and then take them into your owne consideration. Set case I say,
that a man should make so much of those dogs which you keepe for the safety
of your selfe and yours, as that thereby he cause them to be more familiar unto
him than to you, should hee with this obsequious diligence of his, please you
well? But say; that you thinke this but a small matter, consider this also, If any
one should frame those servi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ours of yours, (such I meane as you have and keep,
partly for the guard of your person, and in part to wait upon you,) so, as they
had rather be his than yours, would you for this good demerit of his con him
any thanks? Againe, to come unto that which men love best and accoumpt as
their owne most entierly: Suppose another man were so double diligent in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
about your wife, as that hee brought her in the end to be more kind
to himselfe than to you, should he by this well doing of his delight your heart?
He would misse in my conceit of that and come farre short; Nay, well I wote,
that whosoever did so, should of all others wrong you most. Moreover, to
speake that which most doth parallele this present griefe of mine, If any man
dealt so courteously with those <hi>Persians</hi> whom you have brought unto us, as
that they made choise to follow him rather than you, would you take him to be
your friend? I think verily no. Nay he would repute him a greater enimy to you,
than if he had killed many of them. Say, that some friend of yours upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of such a loving word as this, [Here, take of my goods as much as you
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19319:76"/>
will] should after he heard you so say, goe and seize upon all that he could lay
hand on, and so with your substance enrich himselfe, whiles you have not so
much as a meane use of them, could you possibly hold such a friend unreprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?
Semblably, my <hi>Cyrus</hi> I suppose that I have suffered, if not the same eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way, yet surely the like at your hands. For, true it is indeed which you say,
namely that when I graunted you leave, to take up all voluntaries, you went
away with them so, as that you had my whole power, and left me alone solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And now, forsooth, what you have gotten with the helpe of my forces, you
bring unto me, and enlarge this my dominion with mine owne power, whiles I
being no coadjutour with you in atchieving these commodities, shew my selfe,
me thinkes no better than a woman, in doing pleasures both to other men, and
also to these my subjects. So, by this reckoning, you appeare to be the man, and
I not, worthy to rule and be a King. And thinke you <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that these be benefits
and good turnes? and certainly you know this full well, that if you had respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
me any whit, you would have beene better advised, and bereft me of any
thing rather than of my honour and dignity. For, what boote gaine I by this
bargaine, to have my kingdome never so much enlarged and my selfe despised?
For, in this respect, ruled I the <hi>Medes,</hi> not because I am better and worthier than
they all, but for that they reputed me every way worthier than themselves. As
<hi>Cyaxares</hi> thus spake, <hi>Cyrus</hi> interrupted his speech and said. For Gods sake, good
unkle, If ever heretofore I have done you any pleasure, gratifie me now, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you in that I shall request of you. Make an end once of reprooving me,
and when you have made a proufe of us, how loyally we stand affected to you:
if it appeare that those atchievements of mine, were performed for your good,
embrace me as I do you, and take me to be your well deserving friend. If other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
then blame me and spare not. Well, quoth <hi>Cyaxares</hi> peradventure you
are in the right. And even so will I doe. What then, quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> Shall I be so
bold as to kisse you? Yes verily, if you be so disposed said he. And will you not turne away, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as you did erewhile? No, said he. And so <hi>Cyrus</hi>
kissed him. Which when the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> with the rest (and those were
many) saw: (For, they were all in suspense what would come of this in the
end,) they became immediately right glad and rejoyced. Then <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and
<hi>Cyrus</hi> both, mounted on horsebacke and rode before. The <hi>Medes</hi> followed <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi>
their King; For, <hi>Cyrus</hi> beckened unto them so to do. The <hi>Persians</hi> attended
upon <hi>Cyrus</hi> After whom the residue followed in order.</p>
               <p>When they were come to the Campe, and had brought <hi>Cyaxares</hi> unto his
Pavilion richly dight for him; They who were appointed thereto, provided all
things meet and necessarie for him. But the rest of the <hi>Medes,</hi> all the vacant time
before supper that <hi>Cyaxares</hi> had, repaired into the Presence some of their owne
accord, others by commaundement from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (and those were the greater
number) presenting unto him their gifts. One a deft and faire Cup-bearer: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a good and skilfull cooke: Here comes in one with a baker, another with
a singing woman, one brings drinking<note n="*" place="margin">or flagons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> cups, another gorgeous and trim appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.
And for the most part every one gave him one especiall thing or other,
out of that which they had gotten. In so much as <hi>Cyaxares</hi> began to retract, and
change his mind, confessing that neither <hi>Cyrus</hi> had stollen away their hearts
from him, nor the <hi>Medes</hi> were lesse observant unto him than before. When
supper time drew nigh, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> called for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and because it was long since
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19319:76"/>
he had seen him before, requested his company at supper. O good unkle quoth
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> will me not to doe that. See you not all these here, how by my impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
they are come hither? I should not do well therefore, to neglect them and
follow mine owne pleasure. For, thus it is quoth he: Souldiers thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unregarded, were they valiant before, become much lesse courageous; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f
cowards, they grow far more insolent and malapert. Your selfe therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
you have come a great way hither, go now to your supper, and if any
doe you honour, see you embrace and make much of them againe: invite such I
say and entertaine them with good cheere, that they may have the more assiance
in you hereafter. As for me, I will goe my wayes, about such affaires as I said.
To morrow morning betimes, all the principall men of employment, shall be
ready here before your roial tent, to shew themselves: to the end that we and you
togither, may consult what henceforth is to be done. And you being then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in place, put to question, and deliver your own opinion: Whether you hold
it expedient to continue the warre, or thinke it now a good time, to dispatch the
armie? Hereupon <hi>Cyaxares</hi> went to supper. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> calling to him such friends
of his, as were most sufficient both for wisedome and execution as need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
made this speech or the like unto them. My loving Friends, what we first
wished and praied for unto the Gods, the same through their goodnesse wee
have obtained. For, looke how farre we march on forward, so much ground
we get still. Our enemies we see to be impared: but our selves in number increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and in strength more puissant. In case our Associats newly come, would be
willing to stay with us, more powerable we shall be to effect any thing, whether
opportunity serve to winne the same by force, or to gaine it by perswasion. And
therefore, your part it is no lesse than mine, to worke this feat, that the greater
number of our said Associats may like well of their abode here. And, as in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a field, he that taketh most prisoners, is reputed the hardiest souldier, even
so when counsell and policy is required, hee that can draw the greater part to
our mind, ought by good right to be esteemed most eloquent in word, and most
valiant in deed. Neither speake I this, as if I would have you to premeditate and
exhibit some formall oration which you may pronounce to every one of them:
but order the matter so, that they who are by any of you perswaded, may shew
what they are by their deeds. This, I say is the charge which I would have
you to thinke upon. I for my part will endeavour diligently, that
the souldiers having what victuals and necessaries
I can provide for them, may deliberately
resolve of this warfare
and expedition.</p>

And therefore in the time that he dressed himselfe royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be seene, as hearing that so great a multitude atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at the gates: meane-while I say <hi>Cyrus</hi> his familiar

desired him to tarry, other the Hyrcanians. <hi>Gobryas</hi> came with one, and <hi>Sacas</hi>
with another. <hi>Hystaspes</hi> came with the Eunuch <hi>Gadatas,</hi> who also requested him
to stay. <hi>Cyrus</hi> understanding that <hi>Gadatas</hi> was long since full woe and even out
of the world for feare, least the Armie should breake up, smiling pleasantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, said. It appeareth evidently, ô <hi>Gadatas,</hi> that upon the perswasion of
<hi>Hystaspes,</hi> you thinke as you say. Then <hi>Gadatas</hi> stretching up his hands toward
heaven, devoutly sware: That hee was not mooved thus to thinke by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
of <hi>Hystaspes.</hi> But I know right well, quoth he, that if ye were gone,
my estate should utterly be overthrowne. And therefore came I of my selfe
unto him, to aske the question, what your resolution was, concerning the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the armie? It should seeme then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that I doe wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
charge <hi>Hystaspes.</hi> Yea surely said <hi>Hystaspes</hi> very unjustly. For, I gain-said
<hi>Gadatas</hi> and affirmed, that it was impossible for you to stay: alleadging withall,
that your father had sent for you. How now, quoth he: What is that you say?
Durst you indeed utter so much, whether I were willing or no? Yes in troth
said he. For I see you are exceeding desirous to be seene illustrious in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
among the Persians, yea and to recount unto your father, how you have
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19319:77"/>
atchieved every exploit. And for your selfe, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> have not you a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
to be gone home? No, I assure you, said <hi>Hystaspes:</hi> but here will I abide
in qualitie of a Generall, untill I have made this <hi>Gadatas</hi> Lord over the Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
King; Thus communed they togither betweene jest and good earnest.</p>
               <p>Meane-while, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> arrayed in his royall robes, came forth, and sate him
downe upon a Throne of State after the Medes fashion. When all were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
togither whom such affaires concerned, after silence made, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> spake
in this wise. My friends and Associates. Because I am here in place and Senior
to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> meet peradventure it is that I should enter into speech first. And in
my conceit, quoth he, It is now a time convenient, to debate of this point,
whether it be expedient still to continue warre, or to dismisse the Armie? Let
some one therefore deliver what he thinketh of this matter? Then, spake the
Hyrcanian Potentate to the question, first. My friends and Associates, I wote
not what need there is of many words, when the very deeds shew what is best.
For, well we all doe know, that remaining together we doe our enemies more
harme, than we can receive from them our selves. But, when we were severed
asunder one from another, then they dealt with us, to their owne greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and our most grievous paine. After him the Cadusian Commaunder opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thus. What should we speake of departure home, and living there apart;
When as even already in this very expedition, they get no good as it is seene,
who are disjoyned? For, our owne selves, (when we quartered but a while and
served apart from the body of our whole armie) payed dearely for it and abid
the smart, as yee all know well enough. After him <hi>Artabazus,</hi> he who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
claimed kinred of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> uttered his opinion in this manner. For mine
owne part, saith he, ô <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I doe thus farre forth dissent, from these who
have before me spoken to the matter in question. For, these men say, that wee
ought to tarry still here and make warre: but I affirme, that even when I was
at home I lived in warfare. For, many a time I came to the rescue, when ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
goods were harried and carried away. Yea and oftentimes I had employment
enough to defend our forts, against which, traines were laid: whiles I stood in
feare, watched and warded, yea and did all this at mine owne charges. But now,
I hold their fortresses, and feare them not at all: Nay, I make merry at their
cost, I eate and drinke, I say, of the enemies provision. As if therefore ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
stare at home were a continuall warfare, and this here a very feast, I am not of
the minde to dissolve this solemne and generall Celebrity. Next unto him
spake <hi>Gobryas.</hi> For my part, good friends and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ederates, I commend hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the faithfulnesse of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> For, he faileth not in the performance of ought
that he hath promised. But if he be once departed out of this country, evident
it is that the Assyrian King will bee at rest, and tast of no punishment for the
wrongs intended against you and done already unto mee. And I contrariwise
shall be sure to be evill entreated at his hands: because I have friended you and
become your Associate. When these had all delivered their opinions, <hi>Cyrus</hi>
spake in this wise.</p>
               <p>Neither am I ignorant, my friends, that if wee now breake up campe and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the armie, we shall our selves be in weaker case, and our enemies againe
in much stronger. For, bee there never so many of them disarmed, they will
soone cause other new armour to be made. They that are deprived of their
horses, will quickly after bee deprived of others. And in lieu of them who are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19319:78"/>
slaine, there will spring and grow up eftsoone a new supply to succeed. So
that no mervaile will it be, if shortly they put us to new troubles. The case stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thus: what meant I to moove <hi>Cyaxares</hi> for to propose this question as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the dissolution of the Armie? Know yee then, quoth he, It was for
feare of after-claps. For, I see those enemies ready to encounter us, with whom
if we encampe still here, wee shall never bee able to make our parts good in
fight. For, the winter commeth on apace. And say that wee our selves had
houses to put our heads in, yet I assure you, we want covert for our horses, for
our ministers and officers, and for the multitude of our common souldiers: and
without these we cannot possibly mainteine warre. Againe, the victuals in those
parts whither we have come, are by us already spent: and where wee have not
beene, it is all conveyed away for feare of us, into their strong holds: so that, if
the enemies enjoy them, impossible it is for us to come by the same. And who
is then so valiant, who is there so strong and lusty, as whiles hee wresteth with
hunger and cold, will be able to keepe the field? If therefore wee must warre
in this manner, I hold this and averre, that we ought rather to dismisse our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
willingly, than for want of meanes to bee driven forth against our wils.
Howbeit, if we be desirous still to lye in campe and continue the warre, This
course in my advise wee must take, namely, to endevour with all speed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seize
<note n="*" place="margin">Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ies.</note> them of as many souldiers of theirs as we can, and to fortifie as many as
we may for our selves. For, if this be effected, greater store of victuall shall
they have, who can take more from others, and lay the same up: besieged also
and assaulted they shall be who are the weaker. And verily, as now things stand,
our case is all one with Sea-fearing men. For, they make saile still, and passe
on continually: yet leave they that behinde them which they have sailed
through, no more their owne, than that which they have not yet sailed over.
Howbeit if we can take in their strong holds and castles: the same will alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the whole country from our enemies: and therewith all things will bee
more calme and quiet with us. Now, whereas peradventure some of you be
afraid, lest yee be put to lye in garrison, farre from your native countrey, let
not that trouble you. For, how ever wee Persians used to forraine countryes,
farre from home, may take in hand to keepe those places which be next unto
our enemies: yet, possesse yee and occupie the while those parts of Assyria
which border hard upon you. For, if we shall be sufficient to hold those mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
safely that be neerest unto them, yee that possesse the quarters farthest
from them, shall live in much rest and peace. For, in my conceit, they shall
never be able, neglecting their owne harmes and daungers hard at their doores,
to lay wait and practise against you so farre distant. When these reasons were
set downe, all the rest rose up, saying they would be willing, so to doe. Yea
and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> himselfe did no lesse. <hi>Gadatas</hi> also and <hi>Gobryas,</hi> both the one and
the other promised, if their Allies would give them leave to fortifie their
holds, to the end that the same also might be unto their said Associates friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and helpfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, seeing them all, prest to performe whatsoever he had said, in the
end concluded thus. If therefore, quoth he, we be fully minded to accomplish
all that we say, then there must be done with all expedition that which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
namely, we are to make fabricks and engins, to beat downe our enemies
walles and fortifications: provided wee ought to be of Carpenters and other
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19319:78"/>
workemen to raise towers and bulwarks for our selves. Then <hi>Cyaxares</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for his part to finde one fabricke for the said purpose. <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas</hi>
another: <hi>Tigranes</hi> also a third; <hi>Cyrus</hi> likewise for himselfe, said he would take
order for another. These designes being thus decreed, they got unto him the
said workemen and enginers, and every man provided such things as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for those workes. Yea, and such men were appointed overseers for the
worke, as were thought meetest for those purposes. As for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> perceiving
that the performance of these matters required time, kept his standing Campe
in a place which he tooke to be for health right holsome, and for the carriage
and bringing in of all things necessary, most passable. And whatsoever needed
defense, he ordered the matter so, that if at any time they encamped far off, with
the maine armie, those that remaine behind might ever be in safetie. Moreover,
enquiring of those whom he supposed to have best knowledge of the country,
from what parts his armie might get greatest commoditie, thither he led forth
evermore a foraging: thereby partly to provide all things necessary for the host
in greatest plentie, and in part that his souldiers being exercised in such jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
might the better stand to health and gather more strength: and withall in
their convoyes be put in minde to keepe their ranks in array. Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
himselfe.</p>
               <p>Now there were certeine fugitives from Babylon and captives, who gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
that the Assyrian King was gone into Lydia, and had conveyed with
him many talents of silver and gold, besides great riches otherwise and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all kinds. Whereupon the common sort and multitude of the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
supposed and gave it out, that for very feare he now remooved and carryed
his goods away. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> knowing full well, that hee departed for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
to sollicite and excite, if possibly he could some opposites to make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, prepared and made himselfe strong, resolute to encounter him, as
making no other reckoning yet, but to fight it out. And verily to this purpose,
he made up the full companies of the Persian Cavallarie; taking some horses a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
his prisoners hands, others, of his friends. For, such things as these he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all, neither rejected he ought that any one gave him, were it a faire ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
or a goodly Courser. Furthermore, he provided himselfe of Chariots,
both out of that store which he had taken from the enemie, and else-where also
as hee could. As for the old Trojane manner of chariots used aforetime,
as also the Cyrenaicks fashion of driving, which they use even at this day,

yea all those in Asia generally used their chariots so, as at this day the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renians
doe. Now was <hi>Cyrus</hi> of this opinion, that the best part, by all reason
and likelihood, of the armie (considering that the bravest and most valiant
men, use to be mounted in chariots) it but in the nature of light skirmishers
with shot, before the battaile, and for the atchiving of victory stand in small
stead. For, three hundred chariots, yeeld not above three hundred fighting
men, but require 1200 Steeds. To guide also and to rule the same, (such men
as by good reason they trust most, who are the very flowre of the armie) they
have 300 beside. And these are they, that doe no hurt at all unto their enemies.
This manner therefore of charioting he abolished: and in lieu thereof, devised
to make chariots fit for warre, with strong wheeles, because they should not
quickly breake, and with long axelltrees. For, that all things are the harder to

in manner of a turret, of strong quarters of timber, the height whereof raught

If you would now make semblance, as though you fled from me and so goe to

that we are desirous to learne. Well then, quoth <hi>Araspas,</hi> I will even now set

in case you give it out, that we are preparing, and upon the point in some place
or other to invade their Land. For, when they heare this, they can the worse be
assembled all togither with their whole puissance, whiles every one standeth in

may. For, it will be most availeable upto us, to have intelligence especially of

Furthermore, advise them to put themselves in ordinance of battaile, the best
way that shall be thought. For, after that you are departed, who seeme to know
their order of embattailing, they must needs bee arraunged in the same sort:
For, loth will they be, and afraid to change the manner of setting the field: and
if they should chance to alter it, they will be much troubled at the instant to
doe it in such hast. Thus went <hi>Araspas</hi> out of the place, taking with him his

For, this mans father who now is King, was his very good friend: howsoever he

<hi>Cyrus,</hi> did put themselves in readinesse, and the next day set forward on their
journey; promising upon their fidelity, that when they had learned what they
could of the enemies, they would repaire againe unto him with all speed possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And <hi>Cyrus</hi> verily (as he was a man who projected no small enterprises) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
all things for the warre magnificently. Neither tooke he order for such
matters onely, as his Allies thought meet, but also kindled an aemulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Friends: who might shew themselves in their armour most gallant,
in horsmanship most skilfull, in darting and shooting most cunning, and in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
most painfull? And these feats wrought he, what by training them forth
to hunting, and what by gracing and rewarding the best in every kind. Such
Captaines also and Rulers, as he saw most studious and carefull in this point,
that their souldiers should prove right expert and valiant, such I say, he did put
forward and embolden, as well by praising, as by gratifying them in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he could. And if at any time he sacrificed, or kept some festivall holiday,
he would then set forth and exhibit some games of price, respective to all those
feats which men practise for the use of warre. Yea and to the victour hee
gave rewards most magnificently. So that much joy and mirth there was
throughout his armie.</p>
               <p>And now by this time were all things in manner finished, which he minded
to use in his expedition, saving onely<note n="*" place="margin">Artillery.</note> engins. For the <hi>Persian</hi> horsemen were
growne already to the compleat number of 10. thousand: of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hed chariots,
that himselfe had provided, there were full one hundred: and of others that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bradatas</hi>
the <hi>Susian</hi> tooke in hand to make, according to the patterne of <hi>Cyrus</hi>
his chariots, there were as many. Moreover, <hi>Cyrus</hi> had perswaded <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> to
chaunge his <hi>Median</hi> chariots, from the <hi>Trojane</hi> and <hi>Lybian</hi> fashion: and to make
them after his owne. Of which sort also there was a third hundred. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
for the<note n="*" place="margin">Dromedaries.</note> Camels, were souldiers appointed to serve upon them: for every
one two archers. And the most part of his armie carried this mind, as if they had
wonne the victorie already, and as if the enemies were of no worth. Now
when as they stood thus affected and appointed: after that the <hi>Indians</hi> also whom
<hi>Cyrus</hi> had sent to discover, were returned from the enemies, and related how
<hi>Croesus</hi> was elected the Generall and Conductor of all their forces: How it was
decreed by all the Confederate KK. that every one should be present with all
his puissance, and bring with him great store of money, to serve partly for to
wage as many as they could levie, and partly to bestow by way of largesse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such as need required: Moreover, that many <hi>Thracians</hi> wearing swords by
their sides were already hired: and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> to the number of an hundred and
twenty thousand were under saile, and those armed with shields reaching down
to their feet, and great massie speares, such as they use even at this day, and long
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19319:81"/>
swords: Also that a power of <hi>Cyprians</hi> was comming by sea: And as for the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

That they were all arrived already: The <hi>Phrygians</hi> likewise of both
sorts, togither with the <hi>Lycaonians, Paphlagonians, Cappadocians</hi> and <hi>Phoemcians.</hi>
Furthermore, that with the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King, the <hi>Assyrians, lonians, Aeolians,</hi>
and well neere all the <hi>Greeks</hi> inhabiting <hi>Asia,</hi> were enforced to follow <hi>Croesus.</hi>
And that hee had sent unto <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> also for aide-souldiers. That the
maine armie was assembled about the river <hi>Pactolus.</hi> That they would march
forward to the Rendezvous at <hi>Thybarrhe,</hi> (where even now the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
the lower <hi>Syria</hi> that are in subjection to the King, use to hold their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings)
and how generall proclamation was made, that every man should tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate

the Captives also delivered almost the same Intelligence (for <hi>Cyrus</hi> had given
order, that some should be taken prisoners, of whom he might enquire and
learne somewhat: yea and sent out certaine Spies, in likenesse of slaves, as if they
had bin runnagates from him.) Vpon these newes I say, which the armie of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
heard, every man, as good reason was, began to muse and be sollicitous:
they walke also up and downe abroad more silent than they were wont, neither
seemed many of them to be cheereful and merry: but flocked togither in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
questioning and communing one with another every where, as touching
these occurrents. <hi>Cyrus</hi> perceiving then, that feare had possessed his armie tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout:
called togither the principall Captaines and Commaunders of all his
forces: yea and so many as whose discouragement might seeme to doe hurt, and
whose resolute courage doe good. Hee gave his owne<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>MY Friends and Allies, I have called you togither, because I saw som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
of you (upon the newes arrived from the enemies) farre like unto men
affraied. And I mervaile much, I assure you, that any of you should
be affrighted, for that the report goes that our enemies are gathered togither
especially, seeing that we our selves be assembled now many more in number,
than heretofore, when wee gave them an overthrow: and are besides through
Gods favour and grace, farre better appointed at this present, than ever before.
A wonder it is, I say, that when you see all this, yee are not bold and courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Oh the will of God, if yee be smitten now with feare, what would yee
have done, in case some had brought newes, that those meanes which make for
us had bin bent and brought against us: If, I say, ye had heard, First and formost,
that they who beforetime discomfited us made head againe, as carrying in mind
still that victory which once they had atchieved: then, that they, who at that
time defaited the velitary fight and skirmish of Archers and Iaveletiers, entred
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19319:82"/>
now eftsoones the field, and brought with them many more, and those equall to
themselves. Againe, if word had come, that like as these being in compleat ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
overcame the footmen then, so their horsemen now were comming
throughly appointed against our men of armes, and abandoning bowes [ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes]
and javelins, taking every man to his strong launce, advanced forward
and rode on with full intent to cope hand to hand. Semblably, that there be
chariots comming, which are not to be so placed, (as heretofore) turned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as ready to serve for flight: but as well the horses in the teeme drawing,

axel-trees: to the end that these also may drive directly and in a moment forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
assaile the ranks of those who affront them. Besides all this, that they have
<note n="*" place="margin">Dromedaries.</note> Camels, upon which they may ride forward and give the onset; beasts so hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous,
as that an hundred horse will not abide to see one of them. Furthermore,
that they march on, with turrets, from whence they will bee ready to helpe
their owne side, and to annoy you with darting, so as yee shall not be able to
fight on even ground. In case, I say, one should tell you who are affraied alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that our enemies had all these meanes; what would yee doe then, being so
troubled now as yee are with these flying rumours? That <hi>Croesus</hi> is elected Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of their Field; a man, so much more cowardly than the <hi>Syrians,</hi> as that
when they were in battaile foyled and put to flight, he seeing them vanquished
whom hee ought to have succoured as his Associats, ran himselfe away and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped.
And besides all this, it is verily bruited: that our very enemies thinke not
their owne forces sufficient to joyne battaile with us, but hire others, as if they
would doe better service for them in the field, than their owne selves. The case
standing thus, If there be any that thinke the enemies condition puissant and
the meanes they have terrible: but contrariwise our owne to be slight and of no
validity, such men I say, my friends, are meet to have their passe and to be sent
away unto our enemies. For, being there, they will stead us better than if they
were still with us.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus said, <hi>Chrysantas</hi> that <hi>Persian</hi> Lord, stood up and spake
thus. Mervaile not ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> if some hearing these newes which are reported,
have seemed sad and heavy of countenance. For, it was not upon any feare,
that they looked so but even for very griefe and indignation: Faring like to
those, who desirous and making full accompt to goe to their dinners, have some
worke imposed upon them, which must needs be done before they dine. And
no man will be glad I suppose, to heare of that. For, even so it is with us: Who
reckoning now to be in the way of getting great wealth, after wee understood,
that there was a piece of service yet to bee performed, looked heavily on the
matter, not for any feare, but desirous rather that the same were atchieved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
Howbeit, considering that we shall fight, not onely for <hi>Syria,</hi> which hath
plenty of corne, store of cattell and abundance of fruitfull Datetrees: but also
for <hi>Lydia,</hi> wherein there is affluence of wine, figgs and oyle: unto which the
sea floweth, whereby more goods are brought than any man hath ever seene.
We thinking, I say, of these matters, are no longer discontented, but most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and resolute: that we may the sooner enjoy also these <hi>Lydian</hi> commodities.
These words delivered hee: Wherewith all the united Associats were well
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19319:82"/>
pleased, and commended the same. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I am of this mind my wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thy
friends, with all expedition to march on against them: For, first by our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
comming, wee may prevent and surprise them even in those very places
where they are getting their provision: then, the sooner that wee come upon
them, the fewer necessaries about them shall we find in readinesse, and the more
wanting. This verily is mine opinion. Yet if there be any among you of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
judgement, thinking wee may take some course besides, either safer or more
easie, let him shew the same. Now when many there were who accorded, and
said it was necessarie, with all celerity to march against the enemies, and not one
replied to the contrary, <hi>Cyrus</hi> began his oration unto them, to this effect.</p>

               <p>MY Friends and Confederates, Our hearts, our bodies, our armour also
which we are to use, be long since, praised be God, in readinesse. And
now we ought to purvey and get together our voiage-victuals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
necessaries both for our selves and for the beasts wee employ in our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and that for no lesse time than 20. daies. For, by casting my accompt I
find, that we must be in our march forward more than 15. In which journey
we shall meet with nothing. For, all the provision is quite consumed, partly by
our selves and partly by our enemies, as much as possibly they could come by.
And therefore, gotten there would bee togither, meate sufficient, as without
which we can neither fight no nor live at all. As for wine, wee must every one
have as much as may serve to acquaint us to the drinking of water. For why?
The greater part of the way which we are to travell is altogither without wine.
And say, wee should for our journey provide good store thereof, yet would it
not hold out. To the end therefore that by a sudden default of it, wee fall not
into some diseases, this order wee are to take. Let us even at the first begin to
drinke water with our meat: Which if we now doe, we shall find no great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
For, whosoever feedeth upon<note n="*" place="margin">made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

we drinke wine, our minds will rest as well contented. But in processe of time,
we must cut off even that wine also after supper, untill by use and custome wee
have learned to be water-drinkers altogither. For these chaunges that are made
by little and little, cause nature to brooke and abide every alteration. And veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this is it that God himselfe teacheth us: Who withdraweth us from the

               <head type="sub">How Cyrus marched against his enemies in Lydia. The manner he used
as well in encamping, as in leading his
whole Armie.</head>
               <p>CYRVS then sacrificed: and for that the inwards of the beasts shewed
good lucke, he did put himselfe on the way with his armie. The first day,
he pitched his tents in the neerest place he could find: to this end, that if
any man had forgotten ought, he might goe backe for it; or if he found that he
wanted any thing he might provide it. And <hi>Cyaxares</hi> verily staied at home in
<hi>Media,</hi> with the third part of his <hi>Medes,</hi> because his countrey should not bee
disfurnished of souldiers: but <hi>Cyrus</hi> went forward, with as swift a march as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
he could. In the vaward he placed his horsemen: and before them, he sent
out alwaies certaine avantcurriers and spies, into the coasts and quarters lying
forward, such as were meetest to discover. Next after them, he led the carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
But when he came into any plaine and open ground, he made many ranks
and rowes of wagons and carriages. Behind these, followed a great battalion of
footmen, raunged foure square, to the end that if any carriage dragged behind,
such Captaines thereof as came formost and espied them, might see to it, that
they were not hindred and stopped in their march. And where ever there was an
over-narrow and streight passe, the armed souldiers received the same baggage
within them, and went on either side therof. Also if there chaunced to be any let
by the way, impeaching the passage, certaine souldiers were appointed beside,
to goe thither and remedie all. But for the most part in this march, they kept
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19319:84"/>
this order that every companie had their owne carriage with them. For, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
was given unto all the<note n="*" place="margin">

unto his owne companie, unlesse some important accident fell out to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Moreover every carrier went afore, having the watchword of his owne
Centinier, such as to all the souldiers of that companie was well knowne. And
therefore they kept their way close and round togither, whiles every one did his
best that none of their owne fellowes should be left behind. And so doing, they
needed not to seeke one another, and therewith were all things hard at hand in
more safety, whiles the souldiers throughout the host, had every thing sooner
and readier. Now, the Avantcurriers and Spies that were gone before, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
they saw men in the plaines getting forage and wood: perceiving also
draught-beasts to draw other things, and feeding the whiles: and by discovering
the coasts more remote, when they spied as they thought any smoake rising or
dust raised on high: by all these signes understood that the enemies armie was
somewhere neere at hand: Wherefore the<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Provost.</note> Captaine of these Spies dispatched
presently one of purpose to give intelligence thereof unto <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Vpon which
advertisement, he commaunded, that they should remaine still in the same place
of espiall, for to signifie unto him from time to time what new occurrent they
saw. Moreover he sent out a Cornet of light horsemen, into those parts before
them, with commission to doe their best for to intercept some or other of them
about the plaines, that he might learne the truth more certainly. Who did as
they were appointed. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe bestowed the rest of his forces in their
severall quarters, to provide whatsoever he thought necessarie, before he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the enemies too neere. And, first of all, he willed them to dine, then to
abide in their owne stations; and so to have an eye unto that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.
When they had taken their dinner, he called togither the Captaines
of the horsemen, footmen, and chariots, as also the Provosts over the Engins,
over the carriages also with their carts and waines. Meane time whiles they
came togither, those foreriders who had skowred the plaines, brought with
them certaine men, whom they had taken. And when these captives were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> they confessed, that they belonged to the enemies campe, and
were gone out, some to provide forage, others for fewell. For, by reason of the
great multitude in campe, all things were very scarce. <hi>Cyrus</hi> hearing them say so;
demaunded how farre off, their armie was? who answered, 2. parasangs. Then
<hi>Cyrus</hi> enquired further and said. What! was there any talke of us among them?
Yea forsooth, say they, and that very much: and namely that your hoast is on
foote, and approcheth neere. But, tell me further quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> were they glad
when they heard so? Nay verily said they, glad they were not, but exceeding
sad. And what are they doing now, quoth <hi>Cyrus?</hi> They are a training and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the souldiers in array, and even so they were yesterday and two dayes ago.
But who is he quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> that thus embattaileth them? Even <hi>Croesus</hi> himselfe
answered they, and with him a certaine <hi>Gracian,</hi> and another <hi>Median,</hi> one by
report who is fled from you and turned to them. Most mighty <hi>Iupiter</hi> quoth
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> ô that I might catch him, as I desire. After this he commaunded these
Captives to be had away, and returned unto those that were present, as if hee
had somewhat to say unto them.</p>

of thirtie galloping, and verily, they make toward us even and anon, haply
because they would gaine this<note n="*" place="margin">

surely we are but ten in all to make good the said hill. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> commanded
certeine of those horsemen, whom he had alwaies attending about him, to ride
hard under the said Barbican, and there to rest and keepe themselves quiet, so as
they might not be seene of the enemies: But, quoth he, when as our ten men
there abandon the place, arise yee and set upon them that climbe up the hill:
and to the end that ye be not hurt or annoyed by those of that great troupe:
goe you forth <hi>Hystaspas,</hi> quoth he, taking with you a Regiment of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

of any lewd act, neither for feare of me: but by me was he sent away of

as a doutie Knight: in that for our good, he hath exposed himselfe to daunger,
and undergone the aspersion of a crime imputed unto him. With that, they all
embraced <hi>Araspas</hi> and tooke him by the hand. Then said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Enough of
this. And now, <hi>Araspas,</hi> quoth hee, relate unto us what the present time
and occasion requireth wee should know, and say not lesse than truth one
whit as touching our enemies puissance. For, better it were, that wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
it to bee more, should afterwards see it lesse, than hearing it lesse
now, finde it afterwards much more. Certes, quoth <hi>Araspas,</hi> I have done my

best endevour, to know their strength most certeinly. For, present I was my

know not onely their number, but their order also. Yes verily, saith <hi>Araspas,</hi>
yea and in what manner they intend to embattaile and fight. Yet shew us first,
quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and that summarily their number. Their battalions all, quoth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raspas,</hi>

the Aegyptians] Surely, quoth <hi>Araspas,</hi> their<note n="*" place="margin">Myriarchs.</note> Colonels [over ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand]
ordered them so, as that every Regiment of ten thousand, bare every
way a hundred square. For, this manner of embattailing, was by their saying
after their country fashion. And <hi>Croesus</hi> I assure you was very loth to graunt
them thus to be arraunged. For, he desired all that he could, to hemme in your
armie on every side with his battalions. And to what end, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> desired
he that? Even because he might, quoth he, environ you with his exceeding
number: But first, Let them see to it, said <hi>Cyrus,</hi> least whiles they goe about to
encompasse others, they be not enclosed themselves. Well, we have heard of
you that which the time required. Now therefore let us proceed thus accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
After yee are departed hence, looke well to the armour both of your

ought to take their<note n="*" place="margin">Or breakfast.</note> dinners: to the end that if any opportunitie be offred of an

Also a side purple cassocke downe to his foot, with the skirts falling in plaits
beneath: togither with a<note n="*" place="margin">Or plume, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> crest upon his armet, of an Hyacinth or Azure dye.
All these ornaments had shee wrought for her husband unwitting to him, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
privily gotten the just measure of his armour. Which when he beheld,
he wondered thereat, and said unto <hi>Panthea,</hi> How now my wife, hast thou cut
and mangled thine owne Iewels and ornaments for to make mee this faire ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour?
No verily, quoth <hi>Panthea,</hi> I have not yet defaced the most precious
and richest jewell of all. For, if you Sir, appeare unto others, as you seeme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, your selfe shall be my greatest and most soveraine jewell. And as shee
thus said, shee fell to enarme him, and how ever she did what shee could, not to
be seene for to weepe, yet for all that, the teares trickled downe her cheeks. And
<hi>Abradatas,</hi> albeit hee was before a goodly man to see to, yet now after he was
thus dight and harnessed with this armour, he seemed right beautifull, and of a
most liberall presence, as being by nature also correspondent thereto. Then,
having taken of his charriottier the reines into his owne hand, hee addressed
himselfe presently to mount up into his chariot. But then, <hi>Panthea</hi> commanding
all those that were present to void, said thus unto him, My <hi>Abradate,</hi> If ever
there were any woman that esteemed her husband more than her owne life, I
suppose you acknowledge mee also to be one of them. And therefore what
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19319:86"/>
need I to particularize in every point? For, I am perswaded that the deeds
which I have done already, are of more credit with you, than the words which
I now speake. Howbeit although I bee thus affected, as you know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
yet doe I solemnely professe, my love to you-ward and yours also to
mee: and that I had rather togither with you having borne your selfe as a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Knight be enterred, than live with you disgraced, and taking disgrace my
selfe. So farre forth esteeme I both you and my selfe worthy of the best respect.
Moreover, in my conceit, we are much beholden unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> in this behalfe, for
that he daigned to enterteine mee a captive woman and selected for himselfe,
not using me as a slave with villany, nor as a free woman with disparagement of
mine honour: but when he had received me, kept me for you, as if I had beene
his owne brothers wife. Againe, when <hi>Araspas</hi> my Guardian revolted from
him, I assured him, if he would give me leave to send unto you, that you should
come unto him a more faithfull friend and a better, and every way by farre than
<hi>Araspas.</hi> Thus spake she, and <hi>Abradatas</hi> much delighted with her speech, softly
touching her head and therewith looking up toward heaven made this prayer.
O most mightie Iupiter, graunt that I may bee thought an husband meet for
<hi>Panthea,</hi> and a friend worthy of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who hath so honourably dealt with us.
With these words, he mounted the Chariot at the entry and doore of the seat
thereof. When he was thus gotten up, and that the Vnder-Chariotier had made
fast and shut the seat close after him: <hi>Panthea</hi> having no other meanes otherwise
to embrace him, kissed yet the very seat. And so the Chariot went forward:
But she closely followed after her husband unseene of him, untill such time as
he turning himselfe and espying her, said, Be of good cheere my <hi>Panthea,</hi> Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
and now depart. Then, her Eunuches and waiting women tooke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veied
her into her Caroch, and when they had laid her downe, they covered
her within the<note n="*" place="margin">

and his Chariot also made a goodly show, yet could they not behold him
untill <hi>Panthea</hi> was quite gone.</p>
               <p>Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had sacrificed with the favourable approbation of the
Gods, and the armie was set in aray as he commaunded; and had appointed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
Curriers one before another, he assembled his Captaines togither, and made
a speech unto them in this wise. Deare friends and Confederates. The Gods
shew unto us such signes in our sacrifices, as they did sometime when they gave
unto us our first victory. I will recall therefore into your minds, those points
which if ye remember, ye shall in mine opinion advance more couragiously to
battaile. For, in martiall prowesse, exercised ye are much more than your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
In the same yee have beene brought up and trained farre longer than
they, and joyntly one with another, have atchieved victory. Whereas, many
of your enemies with their Associates have beene foyled and vanquished.
And of both sides, as many as have not yet fought: those of the enemies part,
know well enough that they have for Assistants, such as will betray them: but
yee that side with us are sure, that yee shall hazzard the fortune of battaile with
them that are desirous to helpe their Allies. And it standeth to good reason,
that they who repose mutuall trust one in another, will joyntly sticke to it, and
fight with one accord: but they that distrust, must needs devise how every one
may soonest get away and escape. Advance wee therefore my friends, against
our enemies, with strong armed Chariots, against those that are not armed:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19319:87"/>
with horsemen likewise in compleat armour and horses bard, against those that
be naked; ready to cope with them hand to hand. As for you that are foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
yee shall deale with no other than yee have heretofore. The Aegyptians be

they have, than that they can either doe or see ought, and being raunged by
hundreds no doubt they will hinder one another in the medley, except some
very few: Now if they trust by preassing hard upon us, to make us give backe
and lose ground: First, they must beare-off the brunt of the horses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
then, of the yron harnois wherewith the horses are strengthened. And
say that any of them shall hold out and abide by it, how can they possibly at
once mainteine fight against the horsemen, and the maine battalion [of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men]
and the turrets beside? For, from those turrets, our men will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ready to succour us, and annoy the enemies so, as being by us slaine, they
will rather despaire than fight it out. Now, if ye thinke that yee want ought,
let me know: for with the leave of God yee shall lacke nothing. Againe, if
any man be disposed to say ought, let him speake his minde. If not, draw
neere to the sacrifices, and when yee have prayed unto those Gods, to whom
we have sacrificed, repaire unto your companies: See also that every one of
you put them in minde who are under your charge, concerning those points
that I have admonished you of. And let each one shew himselfe unto
those that are in his conduct, so undaunted and fearelesse, in
gesture, countenance and speech, as he may
seeme worthy of commaund and

<hi>Chrysantas</hi> Generall of the horse with his men of armes, and <hi>Arasambas</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
of the footmen on his left. Hee gave commaundement also, that they
should cast an eye to the maine Standard, to keepe even pace and to follow in

upon a long speare. And at this very day the King of <hi>Persia</hi> retaineth the

Armie by resting thrice, to refresh themselves. And by that time that
they had marched out-right twenty stadia, they began to descrie their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
power to approach and come forward against them. Now when they were
all evidently seene one of another, and the enemies determined on both sides to
environ the battalion [of footmen] afront them, they stood still with their
owne maine battalion: (For, otherwise there can be no encompassing round)
and then wheeled about therwith for to enclose the enemies in the minds: to the
end, that when they had embattailed themselves on both sides after the forme
of the Greek letter<note n="*" place="margin">

albeit <hi>Cyrus</hi> saw well enough, yet staied he never the more for it, but led still as
before, and perceiving how far off the enemies stretched out on both sides the
wings and points of their battaile: Marke you not <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> quoth he, where
the enemies begin to fetch a winding compasse? Yes, very well, saith <hi>Chrysan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
and I mervaile much thereat: For, me thinks they distract the points very
farre from their owne maine battaile: yea and from ours too, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I
assure you. And why so? said <hi>Chrysantas:</hi> because quoth he, lest if their wings
were neere unto us, and their owne maine battaile farre remooved, wee might
charge upon them. But how can they then afterwards helpe one another, said
<hi>Chrysantas,</hi> when they be so farre asunder? It is evident quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that their
purpose is, when their wings have proceeded so farre as to flanke us and to stand
against the sides of our host: then to turne short againe as it were into squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
and so at once on every side to set upon us. But what thinke you, saith
<hi>Chrysantas,</hi> is this their policy good or no? Good, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in regard of
that which they see: but in respect of that which they see not, they hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

Thinke that this present fight, is not onely for this dayes victorie, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of that also, which heretofore yee have atchieved; yea and for all felicity
whatsoever. As he came to some, he would use these words. From this time
forward we shall never have cause to blame the Gods, for they have put into
our hands, the meanes to attaine to many and those goodly chievances. But yet
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19319:88"/>
wee must my good souldiours play the parts of valiant men. To others againe,
such a speech as this he would use. What more gawdy feast could we possibly
bid one another unto, than to this? For, now the opportunity we have, bearing
our selves manfully, to stead and benefit passing well one another many wayes.
To another Company thus would he speake: Yee know I suppose my souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that these rewards are now proposed: to wit, unto winners. To chace, to
wound, to kill, to be possessed of goods, to gaine renowne and fame, to enjoy

contrary? Whosoever therefore loveth himselfe, let him enter battaile and fight
as I doe. For, with my good will no example shall I give of cowardise, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

who had served with him in the former battaile, he said: As for you my douty
souldiours what need I to speake unto you? For, yee wote well enough what a

both behold and also second you, neither will they suffer you to be forlorne and
succourlesse. Then <hi>Abradatas,</hi> For mine owne selfe, <hi>Cyrus.</hi> I thinke all well
enough with us. But for the sides of the battaile, I am perplexed and troubled.
For, I see that the enemies points be stretched out in length and those very firme,
by reason, as well of their chariots as all other forces: Whereas we have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
against those nothing but chariots. And therefore, but that the charge of this
place, is by lot fallen unto me, I would have beene abashed to be here: in such
safety, me thinks I am. Goe to quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> If you be well for your owne part,
take you no thought for them. For I trust, with the helpe of God to order the
matter so, that I shall shew unto you these sides of the enemies naked. And here
I beseech you not to give the onset upon the enemies, before you see even
those, whom you feare now so much, put to flight. (These brave words verily
gave <hi>Cyrus</hi> forth at the point of battaile, being otherwise none of these great
and vanting boasters.) But when you see these quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> once to flie, then
thinke me to be hard at hand, and then, lustily charge you. For then shall you
find the enemies to be starke cowards, and your friends right hardie souldiers.
And verily, whiles you have leisure, ô <hi>Abradatas,</hi> ride every way all about your
chariots, encourage and exhort your men to give the onset: partly by your
lightsome countenance embolden them, and partly by hopes relieve them. And
that yee may seeme the best and most valorous of all those that be mounted in
Chariots, kindle some emulation among them. For, know assuredly, that if this
be done, they will hereafter say, that nothing is more gainefull than<note n="*" place="margin">

So <hi>Abradatas</hi> gat up againe into his Chariot and did accordingly. But <hi>Cyrus</hi>
passed on, and being come to the left wing were <hi>Hystaspas</hi> was with halfe of the
<hi>Persian</hi> Cavallery, called unto him by name and said. You see now <hi>Hystaspas,</hi>
a piece of service, wherein there is need of your celerity and expedition: For,
if now we can get the start of our enemies, and fall first to the killing of them,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19319:89"/>
there shall not one of us die. <hi>Hystaspes</hi> smiling hereat: Let me alone quoth hee
with the enemies afront. And for those on the side, give you the charge to
others that they be not idle. Why! quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I my selfe will take them in
hand. But, <hi>Hystaspes,</hi> remember you this: that unto whomsoever of us God
shall give the upper hand, in case there remaine still any daunger of hostility,
we alwaies set upon that part that maketh head and maintaineth fight. Having
thus said hee went forward, and being come as farre as to the side and to the
Captaine of the chariots which were there, he said unto him: Come I am to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
you: But when you perceive once that we charge the enemies at the<note n="*" place="margin">

untill he was behind the wagons, hee commaunded <hi>Artagerses</hi> and <hi>Pharmathus</hi>
to stay there with a thousand footmen and as many horsemen. And so soone as
ye understand, saith he, that I fall upon them that are in the right wing, take yee
also them in hand, that be opposite unto you. For, yee shall fight against the
point in that place, where the maine battalion is become weaker: And keepe
yee embattailed as yee are, in a thicke squadron, that yee may be the stronger.
And verily the enemies horsemen (as yee see) are raunged hinmost: against
whom in any wise oppose the raunged troupe of the Camels. For know this
assuredly, that before ye fight, ye shall see your enemies to become ridiculous
and to make you good sport. After these directions given, <hi>Cyrus</hi> crossed over to
the right side.</p>

did set up a signall unto the said wings, to proceed no higher, but

there was on all parts a deepe silence, for feare of the future event. But when

that the enemies were mightily discomfited and quickly put to flight. When

had commaunded. Their Horses could not abide these Camels a great way
off, but as their nature is, being madded, some runne away, others flung out of
their ranks, and some againe rushed one upon another. For, thus fare horses,
when once they espie Camels. And <hi>Artagerses</hi> with his owne men in good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray
and himselfe well appointed preassed hard upon them thus disranked: and
withall put forth his Chariots at once both on the right side and also on the
left. Whereupon many of them, to avoid the Chariots were killed by those
who followed at the wing: and as many there were, who flying from them,
were intercepted and caught up by the Chariots. <hi>Abradatas</hi> also, for his part
slacked no time, but crying alowd, Follow me friends, follow mee, spared no
horse-flesh, but by pricking his Steeds drew blood of them good store. And
with him the rest of the Chariotiers made a violent impression upon them.
Then immediatly the enemies Chariots fled from them, some taking their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
with them, others leaving them behind. But <hi>Abradatas</hi> passed directly
through them, and violently assayled the Phalang of the Aegyptians: and togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with him, they also who stood embatteled next, did set upon them. And,
as many waies else it is cleere, that there is no battaile more strongly arraunged,
than that which consisteth of friends assembled to fight togither: so, at this
time, that companie of his about him, shewed no lesse. For, they were his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
friends and companions at his table that stucke close to him and joyntly
charged the enemie. The rest of the Chariotiers, when they saw how the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
with a strong troupe stiffely abid the shocke, withdrew themselves
toward the Chariots as they fled, and followed after them. But <hi>Abradatas</hi> his
companie, where they had once broken in, because the Aegyptians could not
give backe, by reason of those their fellowes who stood thicke about them on

in word, it fortuned that <hi>Abradatas,</hi> for that his chariot wheeles were
flowne off, by reason of so many confused heaps of all sorts, fell out of it with
others besides that accompanied him in this exploit, who having borne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

place. The Persians following hard after, rushing thither where <hi>Abradatas</hi> &amp; his
companie had made the overture, disranked the enemies and killed them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
But the Aegyptians where they stood still, in good order, not disarrayed
(and these were many in number) advanced directly forward all a-brest against
the Persians, where there was a hote and fierce conflict pell-mell, with launces,
chasing staves and swords. And, to say a truth, the Aegyptians had the ods
as well in number as in weapon. For, they bare stiffe and long Launces (which
even at this day they use) shields also which covered their bodies much more
than the<note n="*" place="margin">

else to punch and shoove from them, fitted as they were to their shoulders.
And therefore locking their targuets togither, they went on and thrust from

them. But the Persians were not able to sustaine their force, considering they
carried their light bucklers of wicker at armes end: but softly retired<note n="*" place="margin">

to have the worse, and to be wounded afresh from the Turrets. They then who
stood behind in the rere, would suffer neither Archers nor Darters to flye, but
lifting up and bending their swords at them, forced them both to shoot arrowes
and also to fling darts. Hereupon grew a great carnage of men, and a mightie
noise and clattering, as well of armours as of<note n="*" place="margin">or, missive.</note> casting weapons of all sorts, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
with a wonderfully cry: whiles some called to their fellowes, others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
them to fight, and a third sort cryed unto the Gods for their helpe.
Meane-while, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who had pursued in chace those that stood against him,
came: and seeing the Persians put backe and lose ground, he grieved at it:
perceiving also that by no other meanes he could sooner stay the enemies from
preassing still forward, than by wheeling about and riding at their very taile, he
commaunded his men to follow him, and so rode hard upon their rereward.
Thus they assaile and wound them behind, yea and kill many of them looking
another way. Which when the Aegyptians perceived, they cryed, That the
enemies were hard at their backs, and withall, amid their wounds, were faine to
turne head upon them and make resistance. Then fought horsemen and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
one with another. And there it fortuned, that one being falne under <hi>Cyrus</hi>
his horse, as he lay trampled under foot, with his sword stabbed the horse in
the bellie: whereupon the beast, winsing and flinging out with his heeles for paine
of the wound, never rested untill he had cast and overthrowne <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But here
a man might have seene, what a worthy matter it is for a Prince to be loved
of his subjects. For, presently they all did set up an outcry, and with exceeding
violence, fought togither right manfully. Here was thrusting to and fro: here
were blowes given and taken reciprocally. But one at length of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his
guard, alighting from his owne horse, mounted him thereupon. Now when
<hi>Cyrus</hi> was gotten up, he might by that time see the Aegyptians beaten downe on
every side. For, both <hi>Hystaspas</hi> was come already with the Persian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallery,
and <hi>Chrysantas</hi> also. Howbeit he would not suffer them any longer to
run upon the Aegyptians battalion: but commaunded, from without, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
arrowes and darts at them. Now, after he had ridden all about, untill
he was come unto the fabricks, he thought good to get up into one of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets,
to espy whether any other companie of the enemies stood to it and fought
in any place. When he was once aloft, he saw the whole field and plaine before
him full of horses, men and chariots: so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

others losers: to wit, the enemies running away, and his owne men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the upper hand. And verily, of those that were discomfited, he could see
none any more but onely the Aegyptians. Who being driven to a streight, cast
themselves round into a ring, so as their armour was onely seene, and they set
close covered under their shields. And now verily, nought did they else, but
abide many and grievous extremities. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, wondring at them and pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their distresse, to see so hardy and valiant men to die, caused all those to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre,
that charged them on every side, not permitting one of them to fight any
longer. He sent withall an Herault at Armes unto them, demaunding whether
they would all of them perish, for their sakes who had betrayed them, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19319:90"/>
save their owne lives, with the reputation of brave and valourous soldiers.
Vnto whom they answered, And how can we be saved, and yet reputed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

see to abide by it and willing to fight it out. But, from henceforth, replyed
the Aegyptians: By what good and notable Action of ours may wee possibly
be saved? In case, quoth he, yee deliver up your armes into our hands, and
joyne with them in amitie, who when it lies in their power to destroy you,
choose rather to save your lives. Which when the Aegyptians heard, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
this question: Say, we enter into league and friendship with you, In what
manner would you carry your selfe to usward? Then, answered <hi>Cyrus:</hi> I will
doe well by you, and looke for the like at your hands, as of true liege men.
And what good turne is that said they, which you will deigne us? Whereto

               <p>IN this battaile, the Aegyptians alone of all the enemies bare themselves
courageously and wonne renowne: and of those on <hi>Cyrus</hi> side the Persian
horsemen seemed to performe the bravest service. In so much, as that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of armour, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> caused them to be made for the men of Armes,
continueth still in credit and price to this very day: Also those sythed Chariots
were in high esteeme: so that even in this age, the King who reigneth in those
parts, reteines the use alwaies of that warlike kinde of Chariots. The Camels
onely affrighted the horses and did no other hurt. For, as they that rode upon
them, slew none of the horsemen, so were not they killed by the horsemen:
because there was not an horse that came neere unto them. And even that, was
thought then to doe good. Howbeit, there is no valiant man of any worth and
qualitie, willing either to keepe a Camel for his saddle, or to practise fight and
service from their backs. Thus therefore being come againe to their wonted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19319:91"/>
manner and fashion, they are employed onely as beasts for carriage. As for <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
his souldiers, after they had supped and appointed their Sentinels, betooke
themselves, as meet it was, to their nights rest.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Croesus</hi> upon this overthrow immediatly fled with his armie to Sardes:
the other nations departed and tooke the way homeward, every man reaching
so farre as possibly he could by night. The morrow morning when day appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Cyrus</hi> led his power forthwith directly to Sardes: And no sooner was he
come to the walles of the Citie, but he planted his Ordnance, and bent his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
of Artillery, intending to give an Assault thereto, and prepared ladders
to skale. Whiles he was busied hereabout, he caused the <hi>Chaldaees</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi>
the night following to get up unto those munitions and bulwarks of the <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
which seemed most steepe. Now, he that guided them was a <hi>Persian,</hi> one
who had beene a servant to a garrison souldier within the Castle of the City: A
man, that had learned both the descent downe to the river, and the ascent also
into the Castle. But when it was once knowne that the said high<note n="*" place="margin">or Castle.</note> fortresse
was surprized, the <hi>Lydians</hi> all abandoned the wals, and fled every man whither
he could. <hi>Cyrus</hi> by the breake of day entred the City, and gave commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that no man should breake his ray or quit his place. But <hi>Croesus</hi> being
shut close within his royall Palace, cryed out unto <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Howbei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a strong guard about him, went in person to the Castle that was newly
wonne. Where, seeing how the <hi>Persians</hi> kept the Piece (as requisite it was) and
the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> armour no where to bee seene (for, runne downe they were to
rifle and ransake houses) presently he called their Captaines togither, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them with all speed to avoid out of the Armie; For, I cannot quoth
he, endure to see them that breake order and forsake their ranks, to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with pillage, above others. And know yee this assuredly, quoth he, that
I had determined with my selfe to make you that serve with me, such as all the
<hi>Chaldaees</hi> might report to be happie. But now, mervaile not all, if some one
stronger than your selves, set upon you as yee depart from hence. Which the
<hi>Chaldaees</hi> hearing, were so strucken with feare, that they besought him to lay
downe his anger, saying, they would restore all the money and goods which
they had taken. To whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> made answer, that himselfe had no need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
But if yee would have me saith he to cease my displeasure and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Bestow all that yee have gotten vpon them that kept the Castle: For, if the
rest of the souldiers shall perceive, that they who forsake not their ranks and
stations, gaine greater commodities than others, all will goe well on my side.
And even so did the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> as <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded. And as many as had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
themselves obediently, received much money and goods of all kinds.
Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had pitched tents for his owne souldiers in that place of the
City wherein hee thought most commodious for them to abide in armes, hee
gave commaundement, that to supper they should goe. Thus having set all
things in order, he commaunded that <hi>Croesus</hi> should be brought unto him. No
sooner saw hee <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but he said, All haile, my Lord and Master. For, this is
the name that Fortune hath graunted both you to use from henceforth, and me
also to call you by. And you likewise quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> All haile ô <hi>Croesus,</hi> since
we both of us are mortall men. But, would you, my <hi>Croesus,</hi> quoth he, giue me
any Counsell? I would to God, saith hee, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I could deuise some good
thing for you. For, I might thinke, that the same would be gainefull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19319:91"/>
to my selfe. Then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> listen O <hi>Croesus</hi> what I shall say.
Whereas I see my souldiers spent, by taking exceeding paines, and plunged into
many daungers, thinke now that they hold in possession the richest Citie in all
Asia next to Babylon, I judge them worthy to receive some benefit for their
service. For, this I know, that unlesse they reape some fruit of their travailes, I
shall not have them long obedient unto mee. Howbeit, my meaning is not to
give them the spoile of this Citie. For I suppose, that not onely the Citie
would thereby be utterly destroyed, but I wote well also, that in the rifling
thereof, the worst will speed best. Which when <hi>Croesus</hi> heard: Give me leave
I pray you, quoth he, to say unto some of the Lydians, whom I will make
choice of, that I have obtained at your hands thus much, That there shall be
no pillage at all, and that you will not suffer their wives and children to be
quite undone: In regard of which grace and favour, That I have promised
unto you in the name of the Lydians, that they shall willingly and assuredly
give unto you as a ransome whatsoever is faire and of best price in all Sardes.
For, if they shall heare thus much, I am assured they will come with what
beautifull thing or precious jewell either man or woman hath here. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
by another yeere, the City will be replenished with many goodly things
for you. Whereas, if you fall to sacke and spoyle it, you shall have your very
arts and sciences, which are the fountaines, they say, of all good things, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
utterly. Moreover, seeing and knowing all this, you may come and consult
further hereafter of saccage at your pleasure. But first of all, quoth he, send you
for mine owne treasure: and let your officers require the same at the hands of
mine, the keepers thereof. <hi>Cyrus</hi> approoved all that <hi>Croesus</hi> had said, and gave
consent to doe accordingly. But tell me first my <hi>Croesus,</hi> quoth he, and that to
the full, what was the end of those points which were delivered unto you from
the Delphicke Oracle? For, it is reported, that you have highly honoured <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
and done all in obedience to him. Helas, I would it had prooved so, quoth
<hi>Croesus.</hi> But the truth is, My deportment to <hi>Apollo</hi> hath beene such, as to doe
all from the very first cleane contrary unto him. How came that about, quoth
<hi>Cyrus?</hi> enforme me I pray you. For these be wonders, and paradoxes that you
tell me. First and formost, saith <hi>Croesus,</hi> setting behind me all care, to enquire
of that God, those things that were necessary for mee, I would needs make
proofe, forsooth, whether he could answer truth or no? And well knowne it is,
saith he, I will not say, that God, but even very men who are good and honest,
cannot of all things abide to be discredited: and if they perceive themselves
once that they are not beleeved, they love not those that distrust the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
knowing that I had committed a grosse absurditie, and was farre from
<hi>Delphi,</hi> I send unto him about children. But he, at the first time gave mee not
so much as an answer. Yet afterwards, when by presenting unto him many gifts
of gold and silver both, and by killing very many beasts in sacrifice, I had at
length pacified him, as I thought; to this my demaund, how I might doe for
children? hee answered me, that children I should have. And verily, a father
I was of children (for in this also I assure you he lied not unto me.) But when
they were borne, I had no joy nor comfort of them. For, the one of them was
all his life time dumbe and never spake word: the other being growne to excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
proofe, dyed in the very flowre and best time of his age. Depressed thus
with these calamities as touching mine issue, I send eftsoones to know of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19319:92"/>
God, by what meanes I might lead the rest of my life in greatest felicitie? and
this answere he returned to me.</p>

               <p>Vpon the hearing of this Oracle, I rejoyced: For, I thought that the God
by enjoyning to me a most easie matter, gave me happines. For, I supposed, that
as other men might partly know some, and in part not: so every one knew
himselfe well enough. And verily all the time following, so long as I lived
quietly in peace, no cause had I after my sonne his death, to complaine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
But being once perswaded by the <hi>Assyrian</hi> King to undertake an expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to warre against you: I entred into a world of daungers. Howbeit, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
I did safe for that time, without sustaining any hurt. So, that herein I
blame not the God. For, so soone as I perceived my selfe unable to hold out
with you in fight, by the helpe of God, both I and also my companie gat away
in safety. But now eftsoones, waxing more proud by reason both of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
wealth, and their perswasions also who requested me to be their Generall:
allured also by the rich gifts which they bestowed upon me: sollicited againe
by men who by way of flattery bare me in hand, that if I would take upon me
this soveraigne government, all the world would be ruled by me: Lord I should
be of all, and the greatest Potentate upon earth: By these and such like words
I say, being puffed up; so soone as all the Kings and Princes round about me
had elected me for their Generall, I tooke upon me to conduct this royall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:
as if I had beene the onely man sufficient for that supreme greatnesse.
But in truth, herein I knew not my selfe: For that I thought I was able to match
you in the field: who first descended from the Gods, and then, reckoning Kings
for your progenitours, have even from your childhood practised vertue and
chivalrie. Whereas, the first of my auncestors that ware a diademe, I heare say,
became at once, a King and a Free-man. By good right therefore punished I
am for mine ignorance in that behalfe. But now at last, good <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he,
I know my selfe: and thinke you Sir, that <hi>Apollo</hi> spake true when he said, That
if I knew my selfe, I should be happy? For, this question verily, I put unto you
of purpose, because you seeme able to give the neerest conjecture thereof by
this present occasion, seeing in your hand it is to effect the thing. Then said <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
Impart unto mee your counsell concerning this matter. For, considering
your former felicitie, I pitie your present condition, and herewithall, I permit
you to enjoy your wife whom you have, your daughters also (for, I heare
say you have some) together with your friends, your servitours, and the table,
such as hitherto yee have lived at. As for battailes and wars, I<note n="*" place="margin">Or, free you from.</note> disable you:
If it be so, quoth <hi>Croesus,</hi> then, for the love of God, deliberate no further what
answere to give unto me as touching my happinesse. For now, I protest unto
you: If you doe thus as you say, it will come to passe, that the same life which
others have reputed most blessed, and to whom my selfe have accorded, I shall
now both have and hold. Then replyed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> And what person enjoyeth this
happy life? Even mine owne wife, quoth he, O <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For, of all good things,
of all delicacies and delightsome pleasures shee hath beene partaker with mee:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19319:92"/>
but of the cares about attaining thereto, of warres also and battaile shee never
had part with me. And after the very same manner, you also seeme to prepare
me, as I did her, whom of all mortall wights I loved most entirely. And
thereby, bound I am of dutie to offer yet more gifts and oblations unto <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
in token of thankfulnesse. These words of his, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard, he much
admired the quietnesse of his minde: yea and from that time forward, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so ever he went, <hi>Croesus</hi> he had continually with him: either for that hee
thought to reape some good by him, or because he supposed, it would be best
for his owne safetie and securitie. And so for that time they went to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

All the rest of his companie save onely certaine of his familiar friends, avoided,

They say also, that his Eunuches and servants are a digging for him now
dead, a grave upon a certaine little hill: and the woman her selfe sitteth on the
ground; who having dressed and adorned her husband with such things, as she
had, holdeth his head resting upon her knees. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard this, he smote
his thighs: and forthwith mounting on horsebacke, and taking with him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men of armes rode to see this woefull spectacle. Likewise he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas,</hi> to take with them, what ornaments they could get, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
so friendly and valiant a man thus deceased, and to seeke him out. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
if there were any one that had either any Heards, Kine, Oxen, or

was: to the end that the same might be killed and sacrificed in the honour

sitting upon the ground, and the dead corps there lying, he wept for very

beene by the Aegyptians, and dissevered from the body with an arming sword:
which when he saw, he grieved so much the more. The Lady also, setting up a
pitious cry, and taking the hand from <hi>Cyrus</hi> kissed it, and fitted it againe as well
as she could in the right place: saying also, The rest of his body, O <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is in
the like case. But, what should you see and view the same? And all this I know,
quoth she, hath he suffred for my sake especially, and perhaps nothing lesse for
yours. For, I foolish and silly woman that I was, used many words to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him, so to carry himselfe as might beseeme your friend and one worthy
of mens commendation. And as for him, I know very well, he never conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
what he did, but how he might by any brave exploits and worthy service
gratifie you. Therefore, he verily for his part hath had a noble and renowned
death: whereas I, who exhorted him thereto, sit here alive. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had
continued a good while silent and weeping still, at length hee spake and said.
This Knight, Madame, hath made an excellent end. For he died with victory.
But here, you shall take of me these things, wherewith to adorne his body (for
both <hi>Gobryas</hi> and <hi>Gadatas</hi> also were in place, and had brought with them good
store of funerall ornaments) and for the time to come, know this, that of other
things to doe him honour, there shall be no want. Nay, there be many of us,
that proportionally to our estare and degree, will in memoriall of him erect a
monument: yea and in his honour, killed there shall be whatsoever is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

but in regard of your chastity and all manner of vertue besides, as I will grace

was dead, she should wind both her husband and her, in-one and the same shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

skriked out aloud, and enwrapped them both according as <hi>Panthea</hi> had given

was wonderously affrighted, and went to see, if haply he might helpe and doe
any good. At which very instant, her Eunuches who were in number three,
seeing what was befallen, drew forth their cimiters also, and in the very place,
where shee had commaunded them to stand, slew themselves. In memoriall

               <p>AFter all this, the <hi>Carians</hi> vpon some discord and variance that arose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, growing to civill warre, those I meane, who held and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited

and engins, and warlike rammes to be made, to the end hee might raze
their holds and castles who would not come in and yeeld obedience unto him.
But into Caria he sent <hi>Cadusius</hi> the <hi>Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in military feats, and besides very gracious and of pleasant behaviour,
him I say, he sent with the conduct of an armie: In which expedition, the <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
and Cyprians</hi> right willingly joyned with him. Which was the cause that
he never did set any <hi>Persian</hi> Lord over the <hi>Cilicians</hi> and the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> but stood
contented with their owne native Kings. Howbeit, he imposed a tribute upon
them, and enjoyned them to serve in his warres, as occasion required. Now
when this <hi>Cadusius,</hi> Generall of the forces above-said, was come into <hi>Caria,</hi>
there presented themselues unto him certaine <hi>Carians</hi> of both factions, ready
to receive him into their strong forts and walled townes, for to endamage the
adverse side. But <hi>Cadusius</hi> did by both alike, and shewed vnto them the same
countenance: saying unto those with whom hee happened to parle, that they
spake to right good purpose, and propounded conditions standing better with
reason than the other: willing them withall, to carry the businesse so closely, as
that their opposites might not know they were entred into amity with him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
semblance as if by this meanes he meant to set upon the adverse side more
unprovided. Moreover he required security on both parts: to wit, that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
should sweare for to receive the <hi>Persians</hi> into their walled townes without
all fraud, and to the behoufe of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the <hi>Persians:</hi> also that himselfe should
take an oath, that he would enter into their forts without guile and to the good
of those that admitted him. Which when he had made sure, he appointed unto
them both, one and the same night, without the knowledge either of other: and
in it with his Civallery entred their Castles, and so at one time, became master
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19319:94"/>
of both their said fortresses. So soone as day appeared, sitting in the mids with
his army about him, he called before him, such persons of either side, as were
men of worth and action, who being in place, and looking one upon another,
tooke the matter very ill: supposing they were on both sides circumvented and
deceived. But <hi>Cadusius</hi> made a speech unto them to this effect. I sware unto you,
O yee <hi>Carians,</hi> that I would enter these holds and castles without all guile, and
for their benefit who received me. Therefore, If I should destroy either of you,
I iudge my selfe to have come in, to the hurt and hinderance of the <hi>Carians:</hi>
But if I make peace betweene you, and worke it so, that yee may in safety till
your grounds, I suppose then, that my comming is for your good and profit.
And therefore, behoovefull it is, that from this day forward, yee commerce
friendly one with another, follow your husbandry without feare, and contract
mutuall marriages betweene your children reciprocally. Now if there be any
of you besides the true meaning hereof, goe about to offer injurie: know they,
that both <hi>Cyrus</hi> and we will be enemies unto them. From thenceforth, were the
said Castle gates set open, the wayes frequented with passengers resorting to
and fro, and the fields full of husbandmen tilling the ground. On both sides
they kept holidayes and made feasts; In a word, all places were with peace and
joy replenished.</p>
               <p>Soone after, there arrived certaine messengers from <hi>Cyrus</hi> [unto <hi>Cadusius</hi>]
demaunding of him, whether he stood in need of any forces or munition? Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom he made answer, that he could make use, even of the armie which he
had already else-where. And no sooner had he uttered these words, but he led
away his power, leaving behind him in the said walled townes, souldiers in
garrison. But the <hi>Carians</hi> earnestly besought him to stay, which when he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to doe, they sent unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> requesting him to send <hi>Cadusius</hi> unto them for
to be their Governour.</p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>Cyrus</hi> had sent away <hi>Hystaspas</hi> with an armie, into that <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>
which boundeth upon <hi>Hellespontus.</hi> Therefore, after that <hi>Cadusius</hi> was come,
he commaunded him to follow with his power, that very way where <hi>Hystaspas</hi>
was gone before: to the end that the <hi>Phrygians</hi> might the rather yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
unto <hi>Hystaspas,</hi> hearing once that other forces were to joyne with his: And
verily those Greeks which inhabit the sea-coasts, by giving many presents,
wrought so, that they were not compelled, to admit the <hi>Barbarians</hi> into their
fensed townes: but onely to pay tribute, and goe to serve in the warres, whither
<hi>Cyrus</hi> should commaund them. But the King of <hi>Phrygia</hi> prepared to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his owne guard, as if he would defend his strong holds and not obey: and so
he openly gave it out and sent defiance. But when his Captaines were once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from him, so that he was left alone, at the last he rendred himselfe into
the hands of <hi>Hystaspas,</hi> for to receive his doome of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Then <hi>Hystaspas</hi> leaving
behind him strong garrisons of <hi>Persian</hi> souldiers in the fortresses, dislodged, and
led away with him over and above his owne forces, many <hi>Phrygians</hi> as well
horsemen as targuatiers. Now <hi>Cyrus</hi> had given authority and commission unto
<hi>Cadusius,</hi> after he had ioyned with <hi>Hystaspas,</hi> to bring those <hi>Phrygians</hi> with their
armour, who made choise to side with him: but such as chose rather to fight, to
unhorse and disarme; and commaund them all to follow with slings. Thus were
they at that time employed.</p>

up his charge, and who doth not. Then said <hi>Cyrus;</hi> You doe well, good <hi>Croesus,</hi>
to provide thus for the worst. But surely, they shall for me, carry the goods,
who are worthy, even to be owners thereof: so that if they embecile or steale
any of it, they shall but rob themselves of their owne goods. Which said, hee
put those notes into the hands of his friends and Captaines, that they might take
account and know, whether they that had the charge of those things delivered
them backe safe and sound, or no? The <hi>Lydians</hi> likewise, as many as he saw to
shew themselves gallantly in armes on horsebacke and in chariots, such also as
endeavoured every way to performe that, whereby they thought to doe him
pleasure, he led with him in his armie. But whom he perceived to follow him
unwillingly, from them he tooke their horses, and gave them to those <hi>Persians,</hi>
who first had served with him in the warres. Their armour he burnt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
themselves to follow after with slings: Yea and all those without
armes, whom he had vanquished and subdued, he forced to exercise the sling
thinking that kind of weapon and manner of service most base and servile. For,
how ever it falleth out, that slingers otherwhiles if they be in place, with other
forces stand in very good stead: yet by themselves, put them altogither, if they
encounter but a few of such as use weapons for close fight at hand, they are not
able to hold out the skirmish. Now in his journey toward <hi>Babylon,</hi> he brought
under his subjection by the way, the <hi>Phrygians</hi> inhabiting that great <hi>Phrygia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> the
<hi>Cappadocians</hi> also and <hi>Arabians</hi> he subdued. And with the harnois and weapons
of all these, hee furnished the <hi>Persian</hi> horsemen to the full number of 40000.
Semblably many of the Captives horsemen he distributed among all his Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
throughout. So, he came before <hi>Babylon</hi> with a mighty power of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
with many archers also and darters, but with slingers innumerable.</p>

               <p>CYRVS being now set before <hi>Babylon,</hi> with his whole armie, invested the
City. Then accompanied with his friends, and such of his Associates as
were men of Action, himselfe in person made a bravado and rode about
the towne. After he had well viewed the wals thereof, he intended presently to
withdraw his forces from the city. At which time a certaine fugitive from out
of the towne came and gave him intelligence, that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> would sally
forth upon him, as hee should retire with his armie: For when from the wals
they beheld this maine battaile of yours saith he, it seemed but weake. And no
mervaile in very truth, that it should be so. For, when they encircled the wals
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19319:95"/>
being so large in compasse, it could not otherwise be but the said maine battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must grow thin, and beare a small<note n="*" place="margin">or, thicknesse.</note> depth with it. Which newes when <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
heard, standing in the mids of the armie with his guard about him, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
the souldiers heavily armed, to display and stretch out the said bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion
from both<note n="*" place="margin">or, poynts.</note> ends, and to goe off, close by that part of the armie that
stood still untill such time as both the said points raught unto him, and enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the very mids. Which when they did: both they who kept their standing
now that the bodie of the battaile was double in thicknesse, as also those that
went from both ends, were more emboldened. For they that stood still, were
presently neere unto the enemies. But when by this manner of passing to and

as well they that went off, by reason of them before, as they before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
for that those behind joyned unto them. By meanes of displaying and sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the battaile in this manner: the best must needs bee raunged formost and
hinmost, but the worst cast into the mids. Which order of embattailing see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be well provided both for to fight, as also to keepe them from flight.
Moreover, the horsemen and light appointed skirmishers in the wings, approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

were in this wise put in array, they gave backe from thence<note n="*" place="margin">by little and little.</note> foot by foot, so
farre as a dart shot raught from the wall. But when they were once without
their reach, they turned their faces toward the city: and verily at the first, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
stepped some few paces forward, they shifted full upon their shields: and
stood so, as they might behold the wall at full, and the farther they were off,
they shifted so much thinner. Now when they thought themselves to bee in
safety, they retired in a continued order togither, untill they were come unto
their tents. And after they were encamped: <hi>Cyrus</hi> calling to him his best war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
and men of action, said thus unto them.</p>
               <p>My Friends and Associates, we have viewed the city round about: and how
it is possible to force by assault the wals, so strong and high withall, I cannot
see. But this I suppose, that the greater multitude of people there be within the
City, so long as they yssew not forth to fight, the sooner shall they be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with hunger. Vnlesse therefore, yee can alleadge some other way, my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
is, that presently we lay siege and beleaguer them. Then spake <hi>Chrysantas:</hi>
This river here which is above<note n="*" place="margin">or, a quarter of a mile.</note> 2. furlongs over: runneth it<note n="*" place="margin">along the mids.</note> through the
mids of the city? Yes verily answered <hi>Gobryas,</hi> and so deep it is withall, that
two men standing one upon the head of another will not reach above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Whereby the city is better defended with the river than with the wals.
Let these matters goe by, quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, unto <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> which are above
our strength, and after that we have with all speed taken measure, we must of
necessity quarter our selves accordingly, and goe in hand to dig a mighty deep
and broad trench, to the end that we may have need, of as few warders as may
be. Having measured therefore all about the wals, leaving a space from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sufficient for great<note n="*" place="margin">or, platformes</note> bulwarks, hee digged an exceeding great trench round
about the wall, casting up the earth toward themselves. Then, the first thing
that he did was to raise skonces hard to the river side, making their foundations
upon Date trees, which tooke up no lesse than<note n="*" place="margin">

these trees he built upon of purpose, that hee might seeme especially, to lay
siege unto the city, and in case the River should breake into the trench, yet
it might not carry away the said<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>And thus verily were they imployed. But the <hi>Babylonians</hi> upon the wall,
made a mocke at this manner of siege, as who were stored with victuals within,
for 20. yeeres and more. Which when <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard, he divided his armie into
12. parts, that each part might by turnes watch and ward one moneth in the
yeere. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> likewise hearing of that, derided them so much the

with him a number of men, and opened the heads of the trenches toward the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
Which done, the water in the night time flowed and ran into the trenches,
and thereby, the chanell of the river, keeping his way through the city, became
so passible, as that it might be waded through by men. Whiles this was thus
in hand about the river, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded, the <hi>Persian</hi> millenarie<note n="*" place="margin">

as well of foot as horse, to come unto him, leading their regiments of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands

at their backs arraunged, as they were before. And they verily presented
themselves accordingly. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> causing officers and ministers both foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and horsemen to enter into the drie part of the river, commaunded them
to found whether the bottom thereof were firme ground and passible or no?
And after they had brought word backe, that it might be waded through, hee
assembled the Captaines as well of foot as horse, unto whom he made such a
speech as this. This river, my loving Friends, hath left his ordinary course that
leadeth into the City. Let us enter in therefore with confidence fearing nought,
Considering that they against whom we now advance, be no other than the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same, whom when they were well friended and backed with associats, when
they were all awake, sober, armed and in order embattailed, we defaited. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
now, we march against them, what time as many of them are asleepe, many
drunke, and all out of order. But that they shall perceive also, that we are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
within the City, they will be farre lesse able to fight than now: For that
they shall be astonied and amazed at this unexpected surprise. And if any man
haply thinke, that wee shall have a hote welcome at our first entrance, for feare
least the townsmen get up to the rouses of their houses, and from thence assaile
us with shot on every side, let this most of all embolden you: For, if any of them
shall climbe up to their house-tops, we have a God to helpe us, even<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>Vulcane.</hi>
For, the porches of their houses be soone set on fire, the dores are made of Date-tree-wood,
and those vernished and laid over with Bitumen, which will soone
catch fire and burne. As for us, good store we have of matches and torches,
which will quickly kindle and make a great fire. We have pitch and hirds like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19319:96"/>
that will as suddenly flame out. Whereby, it will come to passe, that of
necessitie they must either forsake their houses or bee soone consumed to ashes.
Goe to therefore and with good courage take armes. And I my selfe in the
name of God will lead you in this service. As for you <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas:</hi>
shew us onely the wayes, for, yee know them full well: and so soone as we be
entred into the Citie, guide us and bring us directly with all speed to the Kings
Palace.</p>
               <p>And that verily, said the souldiers about <hi>Gobryas,</hi> can be no wonderfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For, the court gates will not be shut: being as it is a time of banquetting:
and the whole Citie this night, seemeth altogither set thereupon. But we shall
light upon the Warders, before the Palace gates, which are wont alwaies to
be placed there,<note place="margin">

slacke our businesse, but goe with all speed, that we may take them most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided.
The word was no sooner spoken but they went forward. And looke,
whomsoever they met in the way, they were wounded and some slaine out-right;
others fled backe againe into the Citie, and part of them made out-cryes
and shours. Semblably, the souldiers about <hi>Gobryas</hi> and <hi>Gadatas,</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them with like shours, as if themselves had beene drinking and banquetting
as well as they. And so marched they on in great hast, so farre as to the Kings
Palace. And verily <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas</hi> with their Companies being in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of battaile, found the Court-gates fast shut: but such as were appointed
to encounter the Warders, ranne upon them drinking, as they were, by a great
light [fire] and presently dealt with them as with enemies, whereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
a huge noise and rumbling hurry: which hurliburly when they within
heard, (for the King commanded to see what the matter was) certaine of them
did set open the gates and ranne forth. Then <hi>Gadatas</hi> his souldiers seeing the
gates standing wide open, rushed in, chasing them as they fled backe againe into
the Palace, and beating them downe before them, untill they came as farre as to
the King himself, whom they find standing with his cimiter that he had, drawn.
And him, the souldiers about <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas,</hi> being many in number over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
and dispatched. They also about him were slaine every mothers sonne:
whiles one opposed somewhat in their way, another did what he could to flie
and escape, and in one word whiles every man defended himselfe by what
meanes he might. In this meane while, <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent forth certaine Comets of
horsemen into the streets, with commandement to kill whomsoever they found
out of their houses: but to as many as kept within doores, he made Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by the mouth of those that were skilfull in the Syriacke tongue to abide
still within house: And looke, who was taken abroad without doores, there
was no remedie but dye he must. And thus did they accordingly. Then came
to them <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas:</hi> who first of all worshipped the Gods by way
of thanksgiving, for that they were revenged of that wicked and impious Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:
then, weeping abundantly and leaping for very joy, they kissed both the
hands and feet of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> When it was day light, They that kept the fortresses
and Citadels within, perceiving that the Citie was wonne, and the King slaine,
rendred up their holds likewise. <hi>Cyrus</hi> immediatly seized them into his owne
hands, and sent garrison souldiers, togither with Captaines into them. Hee
gave leave unto those, for to bury their dead, that were of kinne or neere allied
unto them. Also hee commaunded the Heraulds to make proclamation: That
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19319:96"/>
all the Babylonians should bring out and deliver up their Armes. And where-soever
in any house there should be found harnois or weapons, he commanded
as many as were therein to be put to death. So they brought forth their armes
accordingly which <hi>Cyrus</hi> bestowed in the forts, that they might be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
against the time of need. Which done, the first thing that he went in
hand with, was to call for the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </note> Magi. And because the Citie was taken by
force of armes, he charged precisely, that the first fruits of the spoile, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all the shrines and chappels, should be selected apart for the Gods.
After this, as well private houses as stately and princely edisices, he distributed
among those whom he supposed to have a hand in that exploir. And thus
as it was thought good and decreed, he awarded the best unto the best. But if
there were any man, that imagined he had a lesse part than he deserved, he willed
him to come forth and declare so much. Moreover hee published by way of
proclamation, that the Babylonians should till the grounds, pay<note n="*" place="margin">

obedience and service to them, unto whom every one was allotted. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
he proclaimed thus much, that both Persians and those who any wayes

to stay with him, they should terme as their Lords and Masters to whom

               <p>AFTER all this, <hi>Cyrus</hi> being now desirous to compose himselfe so, for his
owne person, as beseemed the State of a King, by the advise of his
friends, thought it good, that with least envie he might be seene seldome,
and with greatest Majestie. This he wrought in this manner. First, by delight
he tooke up his standing, and gave audience to as many, as had any thing to say
unto him: Whom, so soone as he had answered and dispatched, he sent away.
Folke perceiving that they were thus admitted and had free accesse, flocked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him in multitudes infinite. Thus whiles they preassed forward and thrust
to come neere unto him, there grew much stirre and fighting withall: in such
sort as his Serjeants and Officers did all they could to voide the numbers of
them, and to make way themselves to come unto him. And if any even of his
friends putting the people by, came within sight, <hi>Cyrus</hi> would reach forth his
hand and draw them to him, saying in this wise: My friends, stay a while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
I have dispatched this multitude out of the way, and then shall wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
togither at ease. So, his friends gave attendance: But the concourse of
people conflowed still more and more, so that he was prevented by the evening,
before he could have leisure to conferre with his friends. Therefore said <hi>Cyrus</hi>
unto them. It is hight time now my friends (for this day) to breake up the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.
To morrow morning faile not but come early. For I would gladly
speake with you. When these his friends heard him say so, they departed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
and that apace, as having beene punished all day long, and wanted even
the necessaries of this life. The next morning <hi>Cyrus</hi> came againe to the same
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19319:97"/>
place. But then, he was beset with a greater throng by farre of people, such as
were desirous to have accesse unto him, and much sooner were they there, than
his friends aforesaid. But he having placed all about, a great guard of Persian
Halberds and Partisanes, gave commandement, that none should be so hardy
as to present themselves unto him, save onely those his favourites, and the chiefe
Rulers as well of Persians, as of his Associates. Who when they were all met
togither, <hi>Cyrus</hi> spake unto them in this manner.</p>
               <p>My friends and Confederates, Albeit no cause we have to blame the Gods,
for that hitherto, we have not archieved all that we wished and prayed for, Yet,
if the performing of brave exploits bring this withall, that a man cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himselfe as he would, nor take delight and solace with his friends, Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
for my part, all such selicitie. For, both yesterday ye perceived, that from
the very morning betimes, wee began to give audience unto suiters, and gave
not over before eventide: and now also yee see, these are here come farre more
in number than those yesterday, to put mee unto new trouble. And therefore,
if a man should give way unto these, I accompt hereby, that little use yee shall
have of me, or I of you. And sure I am, that of mine owne selfe I shall have
very small or none at all. There is also, quoth hee, another thing beside, that
I see, very ridiculous, For, howsoever for mine owne part I stand affected to
you as I ought, yet of all these that throng here about mee, I know in manner
not one, and they nathelesse are all of this disposition, that if by thrusting and
importunitie they can prevent you, they will presume to obtaine at my hands
their requests and be served before you. But I would think it meet and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that if any man have need of me, he should make meanes to you my friends,
seeke your favour, and request you to bring them to mee. But some man haply
will aske me why I did not carry my selfe so at first, but lay open so, as I did, to
all commers? To whom I answere, that I knew the state of warre affaires was
such, as it behooved not a Soveraine Commander, to be wanting either in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
knowledge of all things requisite, or in execution of such exploits as by
any occurrents be presented. And if Generals themselves were seldome seene

be put in execution. But now, seeing that this warre so toylesome and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is layd asleepe, my very soule deemeth it to stand with equitie, that it also
may have now some repose. And therefore si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hence I am in doubt my selfe
what course to take, that not onely our owne estate, but theirs also, of whom we
ought to take the charge, may stand upright: let some of you advise, what in
his conceit he sees most behoovefull. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had delivered these words,
<hi>Artabazus</hi> stood up, him I meane who sometime claimed kinred of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and
thus spake. Now I assure you, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you have done passing well
to enter into this discourse. For, my selfe even from my childhood began to
desire your friendship. But seeing how you stood in no need of me, I durst not
be so bold as to come unto you. Afterwards when you hapned to request mee
upon a time frankly to relate unto the Medes a message from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I argued
thus with my selfe, that if I performed cheerfully this service for you, I
should be very inward with you, yea and enjoy your conference whensoever
I would. And verily that affaire I executed so, as that you commended mee
highly therefore. After this, the Hyrcanians were the first that joyned with us
in amitie, what time as wee were exceeding desirous of Allies, so that wee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19319:97"/>
their Societie, as if we had beene desirous to carry them about in out
armes. And who then but they? When this was done, and our enemie
campe forced, I thought then, you had no leisure to attend me: neither could:
blame you for it, but beare with you. Then comes mee <hi>Gobryas,</hi> and he became
a friend unto us, whereat I did rejoyce: after him, <hi>Gadatas</hi> likewise: whereby
it came to passe, that still it was an hard matter for mee to be acquainted with
you. Semblably, when the Sacans and Cadusians became out confederates,
good cause there was that they should be honourably entertained. For why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they honoured you. But after that wee were returned thither againe from
whence we first set out in our expedition, because I saw you much busied about
the erecting of a Cavallery, about Chariots, Fabricks and Engins of Artillery,
I made this accompt, that when you had beene once past this care and trouble,
you would have beene at leisure to regard mee. Howbeit, when the fearefull
newes came, that men of all nations were banded &amp; in hostile manner assembled
against us, I understood very well, that these were affaires of right great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
But yet, if God gave once good successe therein, I was perswaded fully
in my heart, that you and I both should then converse mutually togither. And
now that wee have fought a great field and wonne the victory: Now that wee
have brought <hi>Sardes</hi> and <hi>Croesus</hi> under our subjection: Now that we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Babylon, subdued and conquered all before us, yet could not I yesterday,

me with my fists against many that stood in my way. But when you tooke and
drew me once by the hand, willing me to stay by you, then, forsooth, I was well
holp up, abiding with you all day long without meat &amp; drinke. Now therefore,
if by any meanes it be possible, that we who have done you best service, may
likewise be chiefe about you and enjoy you most, it is well: if not, then will I
denouncest soones in your names, that all depart from you, excepting us onely,
who from the beginning have beene your friends and followers. At these
words, both <hi>Cyrus</hi> and many others also laughted heartily. But <hi>Chrysiantas</hi> the
Persian arose and spake in this wise. Heretofore, by good reason, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you
have shewed your selfe abroad in the eyes of all men, as well for those causes,
which your selfe haue alleadged, as also because we were not they, whom you
were chiefely and above the rest to respect. For, we were present also for our
owne particular. But necessary it was for you by all meanes possible, to winne
the multitude, to the end that every one might be most willing to undergoe
the same travailes and perils togither with us. And now, seeing your condition
is not otherwise, but you may oblige others also unto you, whom you thinke
meet, it is now high time for you to have the benefit of your house and home.
For otherwise, what fruit should you reape by your Soveraine rule, if you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
want your owne dwelling place, than which there is no land or possession
in the world more sacred, more secret, more proper and familiar? Moreover,
thinke you not, quoth he, that even we also blush for shame, to see you resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for to alive abroad, keeping our selves within doores, and seeming to be in
better case than you are? When <hi>Chrysantas</hi> had opened his minde in these
termes, many there were who accorded thereto. Whereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> entred the
Royall Palace; and here they that brought the treasure take in Sardes, rendred
up the same. After hee was entred in, First, hee sacrificed unto <hi>Vesta;</hi> then to

               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:19319:98"/>These complements finished, he began to apply his minde, to the settling of
other affaires. And taking into consideration, what a charge he undertooke in
going about to governe many men: and intending to keepe resiance in a<note n="*" place="margin">Babylon.</note> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which among others of great name, was most renowmed and stood so ill
affected unto him, as the most enemy Citie in the world could be unto a man:
pondering I say these things in his minde, hee thought it requisite, to reteine a
guard about his person. Considering also full well, that men in no place can
sooner and easier be overcome, than at eating and drinking, bathing, lying abed
and sleeping, he did cast about, whom in these premisses he might keepe about
him most trusty. Hee thought withall, that the man could never be true and
faithfull, who loved another more then him who stood in need of his guard.
And therefore he observed, that such as had children, wives of their owne fitted
to their minds, or beloved<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> Catamites, were by nature forced to affect them
most. On the other side, seeing that<note n="*" place="margin">Guelded men</note> Eunuches wanted all these, he concluded
that they would set most by them, that were able to enrich them most, by
whom also they might be relieved if they were wronged, yea and advanced to
greatest honours. And he supposed, there would none goe beyond himselfe,
in conferring benefits and favours upon such. Furthermore, in regard that Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches
bee of base accompt among other men, for that very cause, they had
need of a Lord and Master to be backed and assisted by. For, there is not one,
but would in all things deeme himselfe worthy to bee in better place than a
guelded Eunuch, unlesse some better thing be a barre thereto: But, that Eunuch
who is faithfull to his Master, findeth no impediment, but he may be chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him. And whereas in some one this reason may most of all prevaile to the
contrary, namely, that such evirate persons become weaklings and cowards:
<hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe was not of that minde. And here he argued strongly from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in other living creatures. For, horses be otherwise fierce and untractable,
if they once beguelded, how ever they leave their biting and ceasse to be fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold,
yet are they neverthelesse serviceable in the warres: and Buls if they be
libbed and made Oxen, are not so stomackfull and stubborne as they were:
howbeit they abate nothing of their strength and abilitie to worke. Sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

                  </note> cullions be taken from them, use no more to leave and lose
their Masters, but are never the worse to watch and keepe the house, no nor to
hunt abroad. Even so it is with men in this kinde: more mild and gentle they
are, being bereft of this fleshly lust: yet be they never the more negligent, in
the execution of such things as they are enjoyed to doe, nor lesse industrious
in service on horsebacke, nor one jote disabled for launcing their darts, ne yet
lesse desirous of honour. Nay rather, both in martiall feats and in their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
they shew evidently, that they have kept still in their hearts a certaine emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and desire of victory. And that they be trusty withall, they have shewed
good proofe in the murders of their Masters. For, none there be, that have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
better testimony of their approoved fidelity, in the calamities and distresses
of their Lords, than Eunuches. And say, it may be thought that they have lost
some bodily strength [being thus evirate] yet in the warres the same is suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by use of weapon, which make the weake and strong all one. Vpon these
considerations, having begun first at his Porters and doore-keepers, hee chose
for the Squires of his body, Eunuches all. And for that he thought this guard
not sufficient, to make head against a multitude of those, that carried an hostile
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19319:98"/>
minde against him, he devised, whom he might beside elect out of others to
be most faithfull Warders for his Court and Palace. Knowing therefore, that
the Persians remaining at home in their country, lived exceeding hardly by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
of povertie, and tooke excessive paines, as well in regard of the rough and
hard soile of Persia, as for that they maintaine themselves by their own labour:
hee supposed that they above all others would most embrace this condition
of life with him. Hereupon he draweth our of them a guard of ten thousand
Pensioners, who night and day should watch and ward round about his Palace,
so long as hee abode there at home: and in case hee went forth any whither,
march also on either side of him, in good array and well appointed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he thought there was need of garrison-souldiers for all Babylon through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
and those sufficient persons, whether himselfe remained within the Citie, of
were gone forth, he placed a standing garrison in Babylon, whom he appointed
to receive their wages at the Babylonians hands, for that he intended to keepe
them disfurnished of all things, to the end they might be brought very low,
and so by consequence, with least adoe be held in awe. And versily, this see
watch and ward then appointed for his owne person and for the Citie of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
continueth still in the same manner even to this day. Moreover, casting
about, how he might hold his whole Empire thus archieved, as also enlarge the
same by further conquest, hee thought that these<note n="*" place="margin">

to retaine still about him such valiant Knights, as by the help of God
had gained so famous victories, and to take order that they might be trained

them, but that of their owne accord, (as deeming these things to bee
most commendable) they might persist therein, and with all diligence ensue
vertue, he called unto him, the abovesaid Peetes: the principall men besides
of Armes and action, as also those, whom he thought most meet and worthy
to be part-takers both of travailes and availes. And when they were all assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

               <p>MY deare friends and loving confederates, wee yeeld unto God, as our
bounden duty is, exceeding great thanks, for that he hath granted unto
us those blessings to enjoy, which we thought our selves right worthy
of. For now, possessed we are of a large country and fertile soyle: Lords we be
also over them, who by tilling and husbanding the same, shall finde us and
maintaine our living. Houses wee have also and the same well furnished with
utensiles necessary. Neither thinke any of you, that in possessing all this, he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the goods or lands of other men. For, a perpetuall, law this is throughout
the world, that when their Citie is wonne, who stand out in armes, as well the
bodies of them within that Citie, as their goods and whole estates be due unto
the winners. And therefore, unjustly shall yee not possesse those things that yee
hold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if yee permit those enemies to retaine ought, it is of your meere
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19319:99"/>
courtesie, that yee tooke not the same quite from them. But as touching that
which is henceforth to be done, this verily is my determination. If we give our
selves to idlenesse, and the voluptuous sensualitie of cowardly persons (who are
of opinion that there is no other misery, but labour and paines taking, like as,
to live at ease and exempt from labour, is the onely pleasure and true felicitie)
then I avow and say, wee shall quickly be of no reckoning nor worth, to our
owne selves, yea and soone forgoe all these goods that were enjoyed. For, to
have been once valiant men, is not sufficient, to the perpeuitie and perfection of
valour, unlesse a man daily persevere therein, even to the end. But like as other
Arts and Sciences if they be forlet, grow to be of lesse esteeme: and our very
bodies otherwise healthy, and in good plight, if they be let loose to slouth and
idlenesse, turne eftsoones to be diseased and misliking: even so temperance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence
and fortitude, whensoever a man slacketh their exercise by disuse, grow
shortly to vice and lewdnesse. Therefore wee must not in any wise be remisse
and take our ease, ne yet abandon our selves to the pleasures and delights pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto us. For I assure you, in my conceit, howsoever to gaine a<note n="*" place="margin">Or Empire.</note> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is a great matter, yet a much greater peece of worke it is, when one hath
wonne it to hold it. For, oftentimes his fortune is to obtaine it, who sheweth
himselfe onely but bold and venterous: but to retaine and keepe still the same
which he hath gotten, cannot be effected, without the gift of<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> temperance and
of continency, nor without much study and diligence. Vnderstanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all this; we ought now to exercise vertue much more than we did, before
we attained to this great estate: Yea, and know we must that a man shall have
then the greatest number to envie him, to lay wait for him, yea and to become
his mortall enemies, when he hath most in his possession: especially if he hath
gained both wealth and observance, (as wee have done) from men against
their wills. Certes, we are to thinke, that God will be on our side. For, unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we have not come by all this, nor by treacherous slights, but being forlayed
our selves, revenged wee are for our owne wrongs. That therefore, which next
after this is best, let us endeavour to be furnished with: And that is this, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
our Empire by being better our selves than those, whom wee rule. As for
heat and cold, meats and drinks, labour and sleepe, common they must be of
necessitie to us with our very servants: Howbeit let us so communicate therein
with them, that we endeavour first and principally, even in these matters to be
seene more vertuous than they. But in martiall discipline, and military exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
we ought in no wise to communicate with them, whom we are minded to
make our<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. As workefolke and husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> labourers and tributaries: For, in these exercises it behooveth us
to goe beyond them; knowing thus much, that God hath shewed these meanes
unto men, for to be the instruments of liberty and blessednesse. And like as we
have stripped them of their armour, so wee our selves ought never to be disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as knowing this, that they who have alwaies weapons neerest at hand, may
make most accompt to hold as their owne, whatsoever they desire. Now, if any
there be, that reasoneth thus, what are wee the better for effecting that which
we would, if we must of necessitie endure hunger, thirst, cares and travailes
still? To him I answer, We ought thus much to learne, that good things bring
so much the more joy with them, by how much the toyle was greater that
went before the archievement thereof. For, travaile is meat alone and sauce to
valiant and hardy men: And without this one thing, namely, the need of that
which one obtaineth, nothing be it never so costly can be provided, to make it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19319:99"/>
sweet and savory. And if those things which men desire most, God hath from
heaven furnished us with: but that the same may seeme most delectable, some
one provideth for himselfe: such a man shall have this advantage, and be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
case, than they that live more slenderly, in that he shall get the most tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
cates, when he is hungry, enjoy the pleasantest drinks when he is thirstie,
and take the sweetest repose, when he hath need of rest. Which being so, thus
I conclude and say: That we ought now to straine our selves to the uttermost,
for to play the parts of good and honest men: to the end that we may have in
the best manner and with most contentment, the use of these benefits, and not
taste of that which of all things in the world is most grievous. For it is nothing
so grievous, never to have gotten good things, as heavy and irke some to forgoe
the same, after a man hath once had them. Furthermore, this also yee are to
consider, what pretense or colour we have to be more idle and negligent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
than heretofore? Is it, for that wee are now in place of soveraine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?
But it is not meet, that the Ruler should be worse than the subject. Or
is it because wee seeme to be in an happier estate now, than beforetime? And
will a man say indeed, that in prosperitie Cowardise is to be borne with, and
pardoned? Or, because we have gotten slaves to serve us, shall we chastife them
if they proove lewd and naught? But how befitteth it him, who is bad and
blockish himselfe, to punish others for lewdnesse and stupiditie? Moreover, I
would have you to thinke of this also. We forecast to feed and maintaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that keepe our housese and guard our bodies. And how can it otherwise be
but a starke shame for us to imagine that we ought to entertaine others for the
guard and safetie of our persons, and be not a guard to squire and defend our
selves? For, this we ought assuredly to know, that there is no defense or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
like to this, as when a man himselfe is honest and vertuous. For, that of
necessitie must goe alwaies with him and beare him companie. But, whosoever
is void of vertue, in all congruitie, no thing besides can proper and speed well
under his hand. What is then to be done? say I, and where should we practise
vertue? wherein is our study and industry to be employed? I will tell you,
my friends, no new and strange thing: but, like as in Persia, the noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

shew our selves unto our children, as the best precedents to follow: and our

when they shall neither see nor heare any filthinesse and dishonesty, but spend

That a good Prince nothing at all differeth from a good
Father. For, as Fathers provide for their children, that they
never want ought that good is, so <hi>Cyrus</hi> seemeth now unto
mee, for to advise to those things, whereby especially
we may live in perpetuall weale and happinesse. But, for as much as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
his mind not so fully, as it behooved, I will endevour to open the same
more at large, and instruct therein such as be ignorant. For, consider with your
selves what enemie-state could ever be wonne by them, that were not obedient
to their Prince? What Friend-City kept, by such as did not obey? What army
of disobedient souldiers was ever able to get the victory? By what meanes more
may men in battaile be defaited and lose the field, than when each one begins
to seeke a way by himselfe for his owne safety? What good exploit besides
can bee performed by those that obey not their superious? What Citie can
otherwise be orderly governed? what houses preserved? or how else can ships
arrive at their desired haven? And even we our selves by what meanes more are
we come to that wealth which now we possesse, than by obedience to our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers?
For, hereby it came to passe that with speed we touched at what place we
should: and following our Captaines as we did in number togither, no man was
able to stand in our way and abide our force. To conclude, we have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by the halves, but fully accomplished all that we were commaunded. If
then, it be evident, That to obey a Prince and Soveraigne, availeth most to the
attaining of wealth and honour: Wote well also, that the same is the best way to
keep the said good things as we ought. And heretofore verily many men ruled
us, when we governed none: but now the state of you here present is such, as that
yee be all Commaunders, some of more, some of fewer. Like as therefore, yee
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19319:100"/>
thinke it meet and requisite, that yee should rule your servants under you: even
so let us our selves, obey those unto whom by duty wee are bound to be obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.
But thus much difference ought there to be betweene us and servants, that
whereas they doe service unto their masters against their wils, we ought of our
owne accords, (in case we would be free indeed) to doe that which is of most
worth. And this shall you find quoth he, that even there, where the State is not
governed by way of Monarchie, that Common-wealth is never by enemies
brought under subjection, which is most willing to obey the<note n="*" place="margin">Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Magistrates. Let
us therefore give attendance as <hi>Cyrus</hi> willeth us, at this our Soveraignes Court:
and exercise our selves in those matters, whereby principally we may be able
to hold such things as ought to be preserved: Let us be prest to serve <hi>Cyrus</hi> at
all assaies, and in his affaires whatsoever. For, this we are to know very well,
that <hi>Cyrus</hi> cannot possibly find ought, wherein he may use our helping hand for
his owne benefit, but our part also will be therein. The selfesame things, I say,
will be to us also commodious, like as we have the same enemies and no other.

                  </note> the Honorable persons and Gentlemen of quality, should
continually wait at Court, and tender their service unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> in all occasions,
as he thought good, untill he gave them their discharge. And as it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
then, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so at this day observed it is of those, who are under the Empire of
the King of <hi>Asia:</hi> They frequent right dutifully the Palaces of their Princes. And
as in this present treatise it is declared, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> instituted a forme of Empire,
whereby he might preserve the same firme to himselfe and to the <hi>Persians:</hi> even
so, the Kings his successours, from time to time retaine the same ordinances, and
doe likewise at this day. And verily it falleth out herein as in other things. The
better that the Prince is, the more sincerely are the auncient ordinances of the
State kept: and the worse he is, the more untowardly goe all proceedings. Well,
those honourable persons repaired ordinarily to the Court-gates of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
mounted upon great horses, with their launces accordingly: For that this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was so decreed, by those chiefe men of marke, who togither with him had
made this conquest of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Howbeit <hi>Cyrus</hi> afterward instituted other officers, unto whom he committed
the menaging of other affaires: as who had under him both receivers of his<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venewes,
and stewards also for the disbursing of his expenses, Masters and
Overseers of his works, keeprs of his demaines and treasure, and purveiours of
necessaries for diet and hous-keeping. Moreover he appointed certaine Escueries
of the Stable for his horses, masters of Venerie and Sergeants of his hounds,
such as he thought had skill and dexterity, to traine and fit these beasts for his
owne use and purpose. As for those persons whom he was minded to retaine
next about him, for society in preserving his owne happy estate, and who might
become right excelllent in their place, he betooke not this choice and charge
unto others, but thought that care belonged to himselfe: For, hee wist very
well, that if at any time he were to fight a field, he must out of all that number,
elect those for his neerest assistants and trusty officers, with whom he had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in greatest daungers. He knew likewise, that out of them he must choose
his Centurions and Colonels as well of footmen as of horsemen. And say,
there were at any time need of Generals in his owne absence, he considered that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19319:101"/>
out of these they were to be sent. Moreover, he was not ignorant, that some of
these he should imploy as Presidents under him of Cities, and Deputy Rulers
of whole Provinces: others also to be sent forth in Embassage. For that hee
thought it a matter of greatest importance, to treat and negotiate by the meanes
of them, and so to obtaine what was requisite without warre and force of armes.
Now, if they, whose service was to be used, in the effecting of his weightiest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
were not such as they ought to be, he supposed it would not be well with
his royall estate: But if they were as they should be, then he supposed all would
prosper with him. Being settled therefore in this opinion, hee bent his mind
wholly thereunto. Furthermore, of this jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ement he was, that himselfe ought
semblably to practise vertue: For, he thought it unpossible for a man not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
in his owne person, as he should be, to excite others to brave and lawda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
actions. And in pondering all these points, he perceived that the contriving
and compassing of so high designes required principally time and leasure. And
therefore he supposed, that he might not in any wise neglect the provident care
about revenues of the Crowne: as wisely for esteeming, that in the wealding of
so great a State, there must of necessity be much expense. Againe, considering
that he had large possession of his owne demaine, if he were in person evermore
busied about them, hee knew it would be an occasion to withdraw his mind
quite from the care of preserving the safety of the whole Empire. Casting
therefore how he might well order his owne oeconomicall state, and himselfe
enjoy rest, he looked in some sort into the order and discipline of military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.
For in warre the Decurions for the most part take charge of the Decuries:
the Caporals oversee the Decurions: the Colonels of thousands, the said Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals:
The leaders of ten thousand, those said Colonels. Whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to passe, that albeit there be many<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> thousands</note> miriades of men in an armie, yet there
is not one souldier of them all, but he is regarded and seene unto. So that when
the Lord Generall himselfe is disposed to employ his armie, sufficient it is to
give charge unto the Myriarches [or Commaunders of ten thousands.] <hi>Cyrus</hi>
considering the reason of this order in military affaires, framed thereto sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
his domesticall matters. And by this meanes, when he conferred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
but with a few, his houshold businesses were not forlet. Thus, from
that time forward, more repose hee had than others who tooke the charge
but of one house or of one ship. And so having ordered his owne estate, hee
taught those also about him to take the same course. So, by this meanes hee
provided for the easement both of himselfe, and of those also who belonged
neere unto him.</p>
               <p>After this hee did set in hand to ordaine, what kinde of persons they
should be whom he would have to be of his inward companie. First therefore,
as many as were able to live of themselves, putting over unto others the tillage
and husbanding of their lands, if they gave not attendance at Court, he enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
after them: because he supposed those that thus waited would doe nothing
that was evill and unseemely: partly for that they were in the Princes presence,
and in part by reason they knew themselves to be marked and seene whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they did of men of the best note. And for those that kept away, he thought
they were absent, in regard of some Intemperance, injustice, or negligence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore thus perswaded of them, he forced them to be present. For, hee
gave commaundement to some one or other of his chiefe favourites, to seize
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19319:101"/>
upon the goods of him who usually frequented not the Court, and to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>

openly and say, that he entred upon his owne. This was no sooner put in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
but immediately, they that were thus despoiled came with compla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
as if they had beene wronged. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> did put them off a great while, saving
his leasure would not serve to lend his eare to such persons: and even after he
had heard their cause, yet deferred he a long time the debating and deciding of
their suites. And in so doing, he supposed, that as he taught them to wait and
give better attendance: so they would be lesse offended with him, than if by
chastisement he had forced them to wait. This I say was one meanes to teach
them for to attend. Another way he had, and that was thus. Whiles they were
in presence he enjoyned them very easie ministeries, and the same most gainefull
to themselves. A third device he practised besides, namely in that he never
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> dealt ought among those that were absent: but the most effectuall meanes
was, meere necessity: that if any one would by none of all these be brought
to it, he would take from such an one his goods and bestow the same upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whom he thought sufficient and able to be ready at his commaund in all
occasions. Thus got he a profitable friend for an unprofitable. Well, in this
manner dealt <hi>Cyrus</hi> with those that were absent. And even the King who r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
at this day, inquireth into such, as being by their place and office bound
to give attendance are away. But looke who presented themselves, those hee
thought he should excite most, unto noble and excellent actions, if as he had
soveraigne commaund over them, so he endevoured to shew himselfe unto his
subjects most of all others adorned with vertues. For, it seemed he conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thus much, that even by positive and written lawes men are made better.
But a good Magistrate he supposed to be unto his people a seeing law: as who
was able to reduce into order, to note also and to punish him that was disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Being of this mind, first and principally above all things, he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
at this time more religious and respective of Gods worship, because he
had sped to happily in his affaires. And then it was first ordained that the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> Priests should chaunt hymnes continually by breake of day unto the honor of
the Gods, and daily to offer what sacrifices unto which Gods themselves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.
These ordinances instituted then, continue still at this day by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from King to King successively. And herein especially did other <hi>Persians</hi>
imitate him, because they were fully perswaded, they should be the happier
if they served the Gods in that manner as he did, who was of all other most
happy, and their Prince beside. Againe, in so doing, they thought to be in his
favour and to please him. <hi>Cyrus</hi> also himselfe was of opinion that the religious
devotion of his subjects was behoovefull for him; directed herein by the same
reason that they are, who upon grounded judgement are more willing to goe
to sea and to saile in their companie that feare God and be religious, than with
those that are tainted with irreligion and impiety. Moreover, this accompt
made he, that if all those that accompanied him were devout, they would be
better affected one to another, and more respective of him, and in no wise per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>petrate
any ungodly act against his person, who thought himselfe to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
right well of the whole society of his favourites and courtiers. Further
more, making it knowne abroad, to esteeme highly of this one thing, that no
friend or confederate of his should be wronged, as one who had an exact insight
in law and precisely observed the same he thought this would ensue of it, that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19319:102"/>
others likewise forbearing filthie lucre, would by just and lawfull meanes onely
chuse to better their estates. He supposed also they would all be more shame-faced
and modest, in case he made open shew, to have that reverent regard of
them all, as neither to speake an undecent word nor commit any foule deed.
And that this would proceed thereof, he collected by this argument. For, men
are wont to give better respect, I say not to a Magistrate, but even to those of
whom they stand not in awe, if they be modest and bashfull, than to such as be
shamelesse and impudent: yea and perceiving any woman to be modest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
they respect them also with semblable reverence when they behold them.
Likewise, he thought that those about him would persist constantly in their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance
to him, if he graced and rewarded in the eyes of the world, those
who without excuse or refusall, obeyed him, than such as seemed to be endued
with the greatest vertues, and such as could not be acquired without exceeding
labour and paines. And as he was of this judgement, so he professed the same
continually in all his practise. By shewing also his owne moderation and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
he provoked all others the rather to use the same. For when as men see
one in his carriage modest, who hath greatest meanes to warrant his insolency,
others who have smaller meanes, will not openly be seene to commit any inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
parts. And in this wise distinguished he, betweene bashfull modesty and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
temperance, saying that bashfull persons forbeare wickednesse abroad in
the sight of others, but temperate men avoid the same in secret corners. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
continency, he thought his courtiers would be given thereto the more,
in case he bare himselfe so continent, as not by any pleasures presented unto
him, to be plucked away from good things, but willing to undertake travailes
joyned with honestie, before all delights whatsoever. And verily, being thus
disposed in himselfe he effected this, that among those in his court, there was
much comely order, whiles the inferiour sort gave place unto their superiours,
and yet carried a respective reverence and decent gravity one unto another. A
man should not have seene one there, either in anger crying out uncivilly, or
in mirth laughing excessively. But whosoever had beheld them, would have
thought they had lived canonically indeed, to the very rule and squire of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and decency. Well, thus they partly did, and these examples they saw
who conversed in Court.</p>

he tooke hunting to be the best simply as in generall, of warlike feats;
so the truest practise especially of good horsemanship. For in this regard, they
must of necessity chase and follow wild beasts as they flye; it maketh them
most fit and expert in riding any ground whatsoever; it causeth them also to be
most deliver and expedite in performing any service on horsebacke, by reason
of the ambitious and eager desire they have to take the said beasts. And herein
also he acquainted those of his inward dependancy and favourites, with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19319:102"/>
and continency, enabling them to endure travaile, cold, heat, hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
and thirst. And now even at this day, the King himselfe and his traine about
him practise this ordinarily. And that he thought none worthy to beare sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
rule, who was not better than the subjects whom he ruled, appeareth
evidently to every man, as well by that, which heretofore hath beene related,
as also by this, that in exercising his Courtiers after this manner, himselfe above
them all, by labour, practised as well sobriety and temperance as military arts
and warlike feats: For as he trained others forth a hunting, when time served,
and no necessity compelled him to stay at home, so himselfe also upon urgent
occasions detaining him, hunted wild beasts kept of purpose in parks about
home. And then, would neither he himselfe take any supper before he had sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,
nor give his horses provender before they were well exercised and ridden. To
this hunting, his manner was to call <hi>the Scepter-boarers</hi> of his Court. By reason
therefore of this continuall exercise, himselfe excelled in worthy deeds: they
also who accompanied him surmounted as much: And verily such a precedent
and example he shewed himselfe unto others. Moreover whom he saw of all
the rest most earnest followers of good and honest actions, those adorned hee
with gifts, with places of government, with preeminence of higher rowmes,
and with all manner of honours. Whereby it came to passe, that he kindled in
them all, an ardent desire and emulation, whiles every one strived to be thought
of <hi>Cyrus</hi> most excellent. Furthermore thus much also to our thinking have we
observed in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that not herein onely he thought magistrates should surpasse
their subjects, namely, to be better than they, but to charme also and enchaunt
them, as it were, otherwise, after a cunning sort. And therefore made he choice
himselfe to goe in a side and loose <hi>Median</hi> robe, and perswaded also his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
and Favourites to weare the like. For, <hi>Cyrus</hi> thought, that if any defect
were in the bodie, this manner of vesture would hide the same: and besides
make them that were arrayed therewith, to carry a right goodly presence with
them, and to seeme most personable. For the <hi>Medes</hi> use under this habit, such
a kind of shooes, as they might underlay closely and out of sight, thereby to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
taller than they are. He permitted them likewise to use painting under
their eyes, to the end they might be thought to have more beautifull eyes than
they had: also to rub colours into their skins, to seeme of better complexion
than they were by nature. Besides, hee inured them to this, neither to spit no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
snit openly in sight, nor to turne their bodies to the aspect of any shew, as men
that admired nothing, nor regarded nouelties. And all these things hee suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make somewhat for this, that they might bee lesse contemptible to those
vnder them. And verily after this manner framed hee those whom hee meant
should rise by him, and become deputies under him, both in their exercises,
and also in carrying a port and majesty over them. But such as hee ordained
for to serve, hee neither stirred up to ingenuous labours, nor permitted once to
beare armes. Howbeit, hee provided for them so, as they never went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meate or drinke competent, for the attending of any liberall exercises. For,
those servants, so often as they<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </note> did put up any wilde beasts, and drave them
into places for the horse-mens game, hee suffered to take victuals with them
into the Forrest where they hunted, but none of free condition allowed hee so
to doe. Also when hee was to make any iourney, hee led them to the waters
like as labouring beasts. Now, when dinner time was, hee would stay with
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19319:103"/>
them untill they had eaten somewhat, to the end they should not faint for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
And by this usage, he wrought so with them, that even these also, as well
as the nobles and men of best marke called <hi>Cyrus</hi> Father, as taking such care for
them, to the end that without making any question, they might alwaies beare
the yoke of servitude.</p>
               <p>Thus established he the whole <hi>Persian</hi> Empire in great safety, and was fully
confident, that toward himselfe from the nations which he had subdued, there
was no daunger at all. For, he reputed them feeble and weake, he saw them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished
and without good order: and withall, there was not one of them that
either by night or day approached neere unto his person. As for those whom
he tooke to be the bravest and hardiest men and saw armed in troupes, and knew
some to be leaders of horsemen and others of footmen: Many also of them
whom hee perceived to carry an hauty mind (as who were sufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund)
and to draw neerer than the rest to his guard and to the squires of his
body, for many of these oftentimes had entercourse with <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe (a
thing that of necessity could not be avoided, because hee meant to make use of
their employment.) From these I say, there was some doubt and daunger of
harme to grow unto his person, and that many and sundry waies. Wherefore
when he devised with himselfe by what meanes he might be secured from them:
to disarme them that thereby they might be disabled for the warres, he would
not allow: as supposing that to be meere injustice, and deeming it to threaten the
subversion of his owne Empire: Againe, not to admit them to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and openly to shew that he distrusted them, he thought was the next way
to stirre coles and kindle rebellion. This one device for all these he deemed both
to serve best for his owne security, and to stand most with his honour: to wit,
if possibly he could bring those of best worth, to be more friendly affected to
himselfe than they were one to another. And therefore by what meanes as we
thinke, he attained thereunto, namely to win their love, we will endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
First and formost, at all times he shewed unto them especially, as much as
he could, humanity and kindnesse of heart, supposing this with himselfe, that as
it is no easie matter to love those which seem to hate us, nor to will well to them,
that are ill minded unto us: so it is impossible, that they whose love and good
will is once knowne, should be odious unto those who thought they were belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of them. Wherefore so long as he was not so well stored with money, nor
had wherewith to be liberall: by provident care over them whom he kept about
him, as also by his forwardnesse in paines taking before them: by open declaring
that he rejoyced at their well doings, and grieved at their misfortunes, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to win their hearts and gaine their friendship. But after he had gotten so
much aforehand, as that he was able by bountifull giving to be beneficiall, he
judged as we suppose, first and principally that men esteemed no benefits of the
same cost and value more welcome and acceptable, than the participation of
meats and drinks. Being I say of this opinion, he tooke up this order first, at his
owne table, that what meats himselfe used to feed upon, the like thereto should
alwaies be served up unto him: but sufficient to content and satisfie many men
besides. And looke, what viands soever were set upon the bourd, he ever dealt
among his favourites whom he thought well of, all the same, save onely such
dishes as himselfe and those who sat with him at the table fed upon: thereby to
shew that he was mindfull of them, or else to testifie his bounteous mind. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19319:103"/>
he was wont to send meats unto them, whose diligent service either in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
watch and ward, or in obsequious attendance, or in some other actions, he
highly admired: thereby to declare, that he would have them know, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
he was to gratifie them. And even his very houshold servitours he would
honour and grace, by sending them dishes from his owne table, whensoever he
had commended any of them. Yea and all the cates for his said servants, hee
would have to stand upon his owne bourd, thinking that even this also would
win their hearts, and gaine a certaine love from them, like as we see it usually
doth in<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> children.</note> hounds. And if he were desirous that any of his friends should be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and loved of many more besides, even to them also would he send some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
from his owne bourd. In so much, as at this very day, unto whom men
see any viands sent from the Kings table, they all count them so much the more,
as whom they repute to be honourable persons and able enough to doe them
good and to speed their suits if need required. And not onely in these respects
aforesaid, whatever is sent from a King is acceptable and delightsome, but also
in very deed, those meats which come from a Kings table, be exceeding sweet
and delicate. And no mervaile they should be so: For like as all other arts be in
great cities most perfect and exquisite, even so Kings meats are above other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
curiously and finely handled. For, in small townes it falleth out, that one and
the same man maketh a bedsted, a doore, a plough and a table (yea and many a
time beleeve me, the same party also buildeth an house, and is well appayed if
by this meanes he can meet with any to set him aworke, whereby he may find
a competent living. And verily it cannot be, that he who practiseth many arts
should performe them all very well and excellently.) Whereas in great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
cities, because many men have need of one and the same thing, one seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
science is sufficient for each man to maintaine and keep him. And many a
time, lesse than one whole and entier mystery will doe it: For yee shall have one
man make shooes for men: another for women. Yea and that which is more,
one man findeth a good living by sowing shooes onely, whiles another liveth by
bare cutting them out. In like manner you shall see one, that cutteth out and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
garments, and doth nought else: another practiseth none of all that, but set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and soweth the peeces together. And therefore it must needs be, that he who
is occupied in the shortest peece of worke, is able to doe that passing well. The
selfe-same thing is to be seene in our diet and house-keeping. For, whosoever he
is that hath one and the same man to make his bed, to cover the bourd, to mould
loaves and to make bread, to dresse now this dish of meat, then that, he must in
my conceit have every thing done but so so, and as it hapneth. But when one
man hath enough to doe to boyle, another to rost flesh, one to seethe fishes, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to fry or broyle them, and another to make loaves of bread and those not
moulded after divers fashions, but serve the turne it will if in some one kind the
same be passing well and perfitly done, it cannot then otherwise be, but that these
things in this wise made, should every one be excellently wrought: and so by
consequence, the fare in Court surpasseth all other. Well, after this manner in
winning the hearts of those about him, he went farre beyond all other Princes.</p>
               <p>But how in all things else he excelled, for making much of them, I will now
declare. For, albeit he outwent all other Potentates in this, that hee received
most revenues, yet he surmounted them much more in liberall gifts. And this
munificence began in <hi>Cyrus</hi> first, and hath continued ever since to this present
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19319:104"/>
day, with all the Kings of <hi>Persia.</hi> For, who is he that hath richer friends and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites
openly knowne, than the <hi>Persian</hi> King! What Prince is seene to array his
followers in more gorgeous and sumptuous robes than this King? Whose gifts
are knowne to be such, as some of this Kings are? to wit, bracelets, collars and
cheines, horses also with bridles and trappings of gold? For, in <hi>Persia,</hi> none may
have these but of the Kings gift. Who but he, hath the name by his large gifts
to bring this to passe, that he is preferred in love before brethren, parents and
children? who besides him was able so to be revenged of his enemies, distant
though they were from him many moneths journey, as the King of <hi>Persia?</hi> who
againe, but <hi>Cyrus</hi> having conquered a mighty Monarchie, ended his life so, as at
his dying day he could get the name of a father among all his subjects? and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it is, that this name is attributed unto him rather who giveth benefits, than
to one that taketh ought away. Moreover we have heard it reported, that such
as are called the<note n="*" place="margin">Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>.</note> Eyes and Eares of Kings, he procured to himselfe by no other
meanes but by largesse and giving great rewards. For, when he highly fed with
gifts those who brought him intelligence of all such occurrents, as were meet
for him to know, he effected thus much, that very many men both spied and
listened after somewhat, to bring the same to the Kings eares, whereby some
commodity might accrue unto him. Hereupon it came, that a King was thought
to have many eyes and as many eares. Now, if any man think that a King ought
to have one to be his especiall eye and no more, he taketh not the thing aright.
For, one man is able to see or heare but a little. And if that one have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
all the rest may seeme to be enjoyned negligence. Besides, whomsoever
they perceived once to be that eye of the King, him they might know well
enough they ought to beware of. But the case is nothing so: For, the King gives
eare to every one, that saith he hath either heard or seene ought, worth regard.
Thus, there are thought to be many eyes and eares of a King: and in every place
men are affraid to let fall any words that are not for his behoufe, as if he heard
all, and likewise to do any thing, against his good estate and dignity as if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
were in person present to see all. And so farre off, was any man from da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to give out any reproachfull speeches against <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that every one demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
himselfe so, as if all that were in place conversed continually in the eyes and
eares of the King. Now, that mens hearts were thus knit unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I know no
better reason that men can alleadge than this, that for small kindnesses he was
willing ever to give great gifts. And no mervaile that he excelled thus in boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
giving, being as he was exceeding rich. But this rather deserveth to be
spoken of, that albeit he was in regall estate and dignity, yet he surpassed, for
courtesies and favours to his friends and dependants. Certes reported it is of
him, that in no one thing was he so much abashed to be overcome as in kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to his friends. And to this purpose, reported there is this Apophthegme of
his: For he was wont to say, that the parts required in a good heardman and a
good King were femblable. And as it was the duty of a pastour, after he hath
made the beasts under his hand in good plight and happy, (For that verily is the
felicity of cattaile) then to use them: even so a King ought to make use of those
Cities and that people which himselfe before had made fortunate.</p>

Now when hee had gone round about them all, and <hi>Croesus</hi> his minister
brought the letters aforesaid: then <hi>Hystaspas,</hi> You are to make use of mee also,
quoth he, ô King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as of a wealthy man. For, loe, here am I enriched of

ô <hi>Croesus,</hi> our Treasure that we have gotten already: Consider the rest by him,
and reckon what great summes of money I am provided of, in case I stand in
need of them for any purpose. <hi>Croesus</hi> when he had cast the accompt, found,
as they say, that it amounted to much more than hee said <hi>Cyrus</hi> should have
found in his Exchequer, if hee had beene a gatherer and laid up continually.
When this appeared thus, See you not, ô <hi>Croesus,</hi> quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that I also am

yea, and to set hirelings and trust them with the keeping of the same. But
I accompt my friends by mee enriched to bee my treasuries, and the keepers
both of my person, and also of my goods more sure and faithfull, than if I
should wage garrison-souldiers, and trust them with the custodie thereof. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing also will I say unto you. That which the Gods have put into mens
minds, and thereby made them all indigent and poore alike; the same affection
verily, I my selfe am not able to conquer and subdue. For, I cannot have my
fill of money no more than all others. But, in this point mee thinkes, I goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
most of them: in that when they have gotten togither more than will
suffice their turnes, part thereof they bury in the ground, part they suffer to rot

and be marred: And what with telling, measuring, weighing, winnowing, ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,

have all at home, they neither eate more than they can beare (for then would
they burst) nor put on more clothes, than they can carry, for so they should be
sweltered and stifled: but their superfluous money and riches troubles and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
them not a little. As for mee, I serve and honour the Gods with my
goods, and ever covet to have more still. And when I have gotten it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what surplusage I see over and above suffisance, therewith I supply the penury
and want of my friends. By enriching men, and bestowing benefits liberally
upon them I winne good will and amitie: The fruit whereof I reape, to wit,
securitie and glory. And such fruits as these, neither fade and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

growing over-ranke corrupt any man: but glory and good name the more it
is, the greater and fairer it groweth still: the more portable it is, and oftentimes
causeth them to be the lighter that beare it. And for your further knowledge, ô
<hi>Croesus,</hi> take this also with you, quoth he. I esteeme not those the happiest men,
that possesse most and have greatest store in their custodie (for by this reason
the Warders of towne walls should be most fortunate, For, the keeping they
have of all within the said townes) but who can get most goods justly and use
the same well and honestly, him I repute most blessed, and his money and
wealth also. And as <hi>Cyrus</hi> delivered thus much in word, so he was knowne to
performe it in deed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore perceiving most men to endevour, if they were in good health,
to be furnished with necessaries, and to lay up in store such things as served for
the dyet of healthfull persons: seeing withall, that they tooke no great care, to
have in readinesse meanes requisite, if they should fall sicke: he thought it good
to be provided also in this behalfe. Whereupon he entertained about him the
most skilfull Physicians that were to be had. And looke what meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
any man put into his head to be good and expedient for him: were
they in the nature of [purging] medicines, or meats, or drinks, there was not
any of them, but he would be stored therewith, and have ready in his Cabine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.
And if at any time, one of them whom it skilled most to be cured, fell sicke,
him would hee visit, and minister unto him whatsoever was needfull. Yea,
thankfull he was unto the Physicians, if one had healed any of them, although
he had taken and used in the cure some drugges which himselfe had laid up for
his owne store. These meanes and many other such he practised, for to be in
chiefe esteeme with them, of whom he desired to be loved.</p>
               <p>Moreover, of what things he published solemne games and proposed prises,
minding thereby to kindle and stirre up in mens minds a strife, about brave and
worthy feats, the same wanne <hi>Cyrus</hi> praise and commendation: because his care
was, that prowesse should bee practised. And verily, these games and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
bred and imprinted in the best sort contentions and emulations one with
another.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ordained in manner of a law, that whatsoever was to be
decided either by way of Civill Action or by tryall in Combat, they whom
it concerned to have their causes determined, should have recourse togither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Iudges. And thus it is evident that the adversaries of both sides had an
eye unto such Iudges, as were simply best, and their greatest friends. And hee
that was cast and had the soyle, envied them that had the better hand, and hated
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19319:105"/>
those that pronounced not sentence on his side. Contrariwise, he that overcame,
pretended, that he had the victory by right, and therefore thought not himselfe
beholden unto any. Semblably, they who sought to be in most favour with
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> bare envie one to another, like as it fareth with others that live in Cities.
And therefore the most part wished one another rid out of the world, rather
than procured the mutuall good either of other. Whereby it appeareth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
that his drift and policy was, that the greatest and best persons about
his Court, should all of them love him, rather than reciprocally to affect one
another.</p>

               <p>AND now declare we will in what manner <hi>Cyrus</hi> the first time came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
riding forth of his Royall Palace. For, the majestie of this set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of his, seemeth unto me one of those arts and cunning casts,
which made his Imperiall State not to bee contemned. First, therefore, ere he
went forth on horsebacke, hee called togither unto him those that were in any
place of government under him, as well Persians as others: and dealt about
unto them <hi>Median</hi> side-robes, (and this verily was the first time, that ever the
<hi>Persians</hi> ware this <hi>Median</hi> habit) and in this distribution, he said withall unto
them, that he was minded to ride unto the sacred groves especially selected for
the Gods, and togither with them, there to sacrifice. Be ready therefore, saith
he, betimes at the Court gates, clad in these robes before the Sunne rise, and
stand yee in such ray, as <hi>Phera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from mee. And when I am gone before, follow yee after, every man in
the same ranke and place wherein he standeth. And if any of you can thinke
of a better and comelier way for us to ride forth than this is: let him acquaint
us therewith, when we shall returne backe againe. For, as yee shall thinke it
most seemely and best, so, shall every thing be disposed respectively. After he
had bestowed upon the worthiest persons the fairest robes, hee brought forth
other <hi>Median</hi> garments likewise of the same fashion, (for provided he had
many vestures of divers and sundry sorts, making no spare either of purple
and scarlet, blacke and puke, or of red, or of sanguine colour. And having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
some of these to every Captaine: Decke herewith, I bid you, quoth he,
your friends, like as I doe you. Then one of them who were present said, And

Why! Doe not you thinke me now adorned, when I thus dresse and
trim you. Certes, quoth he, were I able to doe you good that are my friends,
what robe soever I wore, therein should I seeme fine and gorgeous enough.
Thus when they were departed, they sent for their friends, and clad them rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in those robes. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> for that hee supposed <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> (by his degree a
Commoner) to bee a wise understanding man and beside handsome and feat,
and withall very formall, and one that would let slip no occasion to gratifie
him: and who before-time had approoved that Decree, of honouring every

he might make this progresse of his, most acceptable to his affectionate friends,
and as terrible to his enemies. Now when they both had considered well here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
and were accorded in one and the same point, hee gave <hi>Pheraulas</hi> in
charge, that this riding forth the next day might be ordered so, as they thought
it most decent and commendable: For mine owne part, quoth he, I have given
warning already, that they be all obedient to you, in the marshalling of this

this furniture and carried it accordingly. Whom when the Captaines
and Rulers aforesaid saw, You are become say they, ô <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> some great
man now, in that you are to direct us also in those things that are to bee done.
Not so, quoth <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> as God love mee. So farre am I from being such an
one as you take mee: that I am ready even to be a Porter also, to carry bag and
baggage among you. For, see how I bring here with me, these two shag clothes
of tapestry, the one for you, and the other for him there: but take you the choise
of them: whereupon the partie that was about to receive the said saddle cloth,
forgetting all envie, presently asked his advice, whether of them he should
take. And when <hi>Pheraulas</hi> gave him counsell to lay hold of that which hee
tooke to be the better: If you will blame mee, quoth hee, for giving you the
choise, hereafter when I shall execute my function, you shall finde mee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this distribution as he was commaunded, tooke order for all things that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

as the manner is in these dayes to put them forth whensoever the King<note n="*" place="margin">When they muster before him.</note> view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them. Semblably, on the right hand stood the Persians, and the rest that
were Associates, on the left hand of the way. After which manner were the
Chariots placed, halfe on the one side, and halfe on the other. Now when the
Court gates were set open, First, were led forth goodly faire Buls<note n="*" place="margin">In ranke.</note> foure by

personable as himselfe: whether it were so in very deed, or by some other
meanes, I wote not: but however, <hi>Cyrus</hi> seemed a much taller and goodlier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
When they beheld him as he passed along, they all adored him; either for
that some had a commandement to begin this manner of adoration, or because
they were ravished and amazed with the sight of so rich and stately aray: or
else for that <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe seemed to carry such a majestie and beautie in his

were deputed therefore under him. For they, quoth he, will acquaint me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
Whereupon, they went away, and immediatly turned to the men of
armes, consulting to whom each one should repaire? But <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when hee was
disposed to have any of his favorites most honoured of the people, would by a
messenger send for them severally by themselves to come unto him, and thus
say: Whensoever any of these here, that accompany me in my traine, informe
you of ought: if the matter that hee mooveth be frivolous, give no eare nor
take heed of his words: but looke who seemes to preferre a just supplication,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19319:107"/>
make me acquainted therewith, that upon deliberation in common togither,
we may dispatch such businesses with expedition. And verily, all the rest,
whensoever <hi>Cyrus</hi> called them, obeyed, and with all their might &amp; maine came
riding unto him: partly to amplifie all they could, the Soveraine Majestie of
his Empire, and in part to shew their owne double diligence and obedience.
But one <hi>Darpharnes</hi> there was rude and ill bred above the rest; who had this
conceit in his head, that if hee were not so forward in comming at his call, hee
should be reputed a jollier fellow and more free than others. Which when
<hi>Cyrus</hi> perceived, before he was come upon a time and had communded with him,
he sent under hand one of those<note n="*" place="margin">Scepter-bearers, or, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

him to say unto the man, that now he had no more employment for him. And
from that time forward never sent he for him againe. But when a companion
of his, that was called for next after him, made his appearance unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: <hi>Cyrus</hi> rode out himselfe to meet him, and of those lere-horses that
went by, bestowed one upon him, commanding withall one of those Mace-bearers,
to lead him forth for him, whither he would himselfe. Which as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as saw, tooke it to be some great grace and honourable favour. Whereupon
ever after many more men did him observance.</p>
               <p>Thus when they were come to the sacred<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Semblably unto the Sunne, burning Horses all whole in like sort. After this,
they killed other beasts for sacrifice to the Earth, doing as they had direction
from their Priests the Magi. Afterwards, to the tutelar Gods of Syria they
did likewise. Which complements being performed, because the plot of ground
was even and faire, hee erected a goale at the end of a race to the length of five
stadia. Wherein hee commanded, that<note n="*" place="margin">Notion by nation.</note> tribe by tribe, they should put out
their Horses to runne their best, for the Prize. Himselfe with the Persians ran
a course and wonne. For why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he was most expert in Horsemanship. Of the
Medes, <hi>Artabates</hi> gate the victory; for, <hi>Cyrus</hi> had given him an Horse (of

their Horsemen. Of the Sacans a private souldier, and he with his Courser
gained ground, and out-rid the other Horses well-neere halfe the race length.
Hereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> asked the young man, whether he would exchange his Horse
for a kingdome? Who answered, I would not willingly take a kingdome for
him. Yet I would not sticke to make a friend with him, and bestow him upon

I have taken up this clot, I may throw among them. With that, <hi>Cyrus</hi> pointed
where there were a great sort of his friends and favorites. Then the young
man shutting both his eyes close, threw the clot from him, and it light upon
<hi>Peraulas,</hi> as he rode by: For, it chanced even then, that he was to declare some
errand that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had given him. When he was strucken, hee never turned for
the matter, but rode on still to doe that businesse which hee was enjoyned.
Then the Sacan opened his eyes, and asked whom he had hit? Not one, quoth
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> so helpe me Iupiter, of all those who are here present. Why then, I am
sure, quoth the young man, much lesse any one of those that bee absent. Yes
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19319:107"/>
verily, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you have hit him yonder that rideth pricking so fast, by
the Chariots. How is it then, quoth the other, that he turneth not againe? No
doubt, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he is some franticke fellow, and not well in his wits, as it
should seeme. Which when this young man heard, hee went streight to see
who he was, and found him to be <hi>Pheraulas:</hi> whose beard was all agore blood,
and fouly berayed with earth besides: For, his nose bled with the blow. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come unto him, he asked whether he had beene smitten, with that which he
flung? Even as you see, answered the other, how thinke you of it? Why
then, quoth he, I bestow upon you, this faire Courser under mee: Take him I
pray you for my sake. And why so, quoth <hi>Pheraulas?</hi> then, the Sacan related
unto him the whole matter, and said in the end, I have not missed I trow, but
met with a good and worthy man. Then <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> you should have given
him to a richer man if you had done wisely. Howbeit I accept your gift: and
I beseech the Gods (whose will it was, that you should light on mee) to give
me grace so to carry my selfe as that you may never repent of this your gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon mee. And now for this time, quoth he, get up upon my Horse
and ride away: And I will be with you anon. And thus they exchanged. To
conclude, among the Cadusians <hi>Rhathonices</hi> was the winner.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Cyrus</hi> did put forth Chariots one to one for to runne a race. And
to the Victors he gave both Oxen to sacrifice and make merry withall, and also

the price for victory. But, of the said flaggons he bestowed his part on <hi>Pheraulas,</hi>
because he thought he had done so well in ordering this riding forth out of the
Court. And verily this solemne pompe of riding, as it was instituted first by
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> so the King for the time being, continueth still at this day, save onely that
there be no beasts for sacrifice so often as the King sacrificeth not. When these

<hi>Cyrus,</hi> dranke to him and gave them likewise unto him when hee had done.
The Sacan beholding in the place goodly faire carpets and coverings, with
much trim furniture besides, and a number of houshold servants. Tell mee
<hi>Pheraulas,</hi> quoth he, were you at home also in your countrey reckoned in the
number of rich men? what rich men meane you? said <hi>Pheraulas.</hi> To bee
plaine, I was one of them that got their living by their hands. For, even my
father before mee, labouring hard himselfe for a poore living, kept mee bare
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19319:108"/>
and brought mee up with other children at schoole. And when I was past my
childhood, because he was not able to finde mee in idlenesse, hee had me away
with him into the field, setting me to labour and till the ground. Then and there
I kept and maintained him likewise to his dying day, digging and delving with
mine owne hands, and sowing a peece of land, little though it were in quantity,
yet nothing bad (I may say to you) but of all others most true and just. For,
what seed so ever it tooke, the same it yeelded againe truly and justly, with
increase for usury though not very great. And yet one time above the rest, upon
a speciall fertilitie, it rendred double as much as it received. Thus you see tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in what sort I lived at home. But all this riches now that you see here, <hi>Cyrus</hi>
hath freely bestowed upon mee.</p>
               <p>Happy man are you, quoth the Sacan, as in other respects so in this, that
of a poore man you are become wealthy: For, I suppose you have much more
joy and pleasure in your riches, because when you hungred after it, you attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereto and grew rich. And thinke you, my good Sacan, quoth <hi>Pheraulas,</hi>
that I live now much more merrily, for the greater store of goods that I pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse?
ywis, you are deceived. For, wote you not that I eate, drinke and sleepe
with no greater contentment one whit, than when I was a poore man. Thus
much I gaine by having a great deale, that I must looke to the keeping of more
than I did, I must deale more unto others, I must carke and care more, and so
by consequence have much adoe. For my houshold<note n="*" place="margin">

them need the Physicians. One brings mee word that either my Sheepe are
worried by the Woolfe, or mine Oxen falne headlong from some steepe
downe-fall: or else hee telleth mee, that some disease is come among my cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.
Whereby, quoth <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> I am of this minde, that I feele now
farre more griefe and sorrow by possessing much, than heretofore, when I had
but little.</p>
               <p>Yea marry, quoth the Sacan, you say very true: yet when you see this world
of wealth safe and in good case, you take more pleasure than I doe, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees.</p>
               <p>But, it is not, saith <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> so great a joy to be possessed of riches, as griefe
to forgoe the same. Doe but marke what I say, and you shall finde my words
true. There is not one of these wealthy men driven to breake his sleepe for
joy, but of such as lose ought, you shall not see one able to sleepe for
sorrow.</p>
               <p>Neither shall a man see, I assure you, quoth the Sacan, one of them also to be
sleepy for joy, that are<note n="*" place="margin">or, getting.</note> taking any thing. True, saith the other: But the case
is not alike. For, were it as sweet to keepe, as to get, the rich should be in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
state by far than the poore. And, trust mee truly, it cannot be chosen, my
Sacan, but he that possesseth much, must likewise spend as much upon the Gods,
upon his friends, upon guests and strangers comming in. Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
taketh great delight in his money and riches, know he this for certaine, that
he also is much vexed, when he is at any expense.</p>
               <p>But, for my part, I protest before Iupiter, quoth the Sacan, I am none of
these: but I repute even this to be a felicitie, that a man which hath much, may
likewise dis-spend much. Why then, before God, quoth <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> what should
let, but that you all of a sudden may become very happy, and withall make
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19319:108"/>
mee happy too? For, take in Gods name all that is here: Have and hold it,
use and bestow it at your pleasure. As for mee, doe but finde and maintaine
mee as you would your guest and no otherwise: Nay, keepe mee more bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly
than a guest. For, it shall suffice mee to take part with you of that which you
have. You doe but jest with mee, I am sure, quoth the Sacan. With that
<hi>Pheraulas</hi> sware unto him and said, that hee was in good earnest and spake as
he thought. Yea, and more than so my good Sacan: I will obtaine of <hi>Cyrus</hi>
other things besides for you: namely, that you shall not bee tyed to waite and
give attendance in his Court: nor to goe in any voyage and serve in the warres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but remaine still at home with all this wealth. This I say will I effect both for
your sake and mine owne. Over and above, looke what commoditie else I can
procure, either by my dutifull service unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> in Court, or by any warlike
exploit in the field, I will bring the same to you, that you may have the rule
of more still. Onely doe you thus much for mee, as discharge mee of this care.
For may I once be delivered from these troubles and live at ease, I thinke you
shall stead me much, and I likewise shall the better serve <hi>Cyrus.</hi> These words
thus passed betweene them and as they covenanted, so they did accordingly.
The one reputed himselfe happy for being Lord and Master now of so much
wealth: the other againe thought he was most happy, because he should have a
Procurator in his place to procure him rest and leasure for to doe that which
contented his minde. This <hi>Pheraulas</hi> was of a gentle nature, courteous and
amiable to his friends, neither thought hee that there was so great pleasure or
gaine in making much of any thing as of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, he supposed, that of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creatures in the world, man was simply the best and most thankfull: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he did and observing, those that were praysed by any, how studious
they were to praise them again, and how they endevoured to requite one kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and pleasure done, with another: such as they know to be kinde unto them,
how they requite with like affection: whom they see to love them, how they
cannot hate: and as for their parents, how willing they are with all respect to
doe them pleasure and honour both quicke and dead, much more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures use to doe in their kinde! For, to speake of all creatures beside,
he perceived they were more unthankefull and lesse mindfull of benefits recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
than man. Thus therefore was <hi>Pheraulas</hi> wonderous glad, that being free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the care of other possessions, he should be able to converse among his
friends: as the Sacan also, because in the possessing of much, hee should have
the fruition of much. Thus the Sacan verily loved <hi>Pheraulas</hi> well, because hee
ever brought him somewhat: and <hi>Pheraulas</hi> him likewise, for that he was ready
to take all that came: and notwithstanding he alwaies endeavoured to procure
him more and more still, yet it troubled him never the more. In this manner
lived they and loved togither.</p>

to advance his State most, and their willing minds to do him
greatest honour. To whom he adjoyned <hi>Artabazus</hi> the <hi>Median, Tigranes</hi> the
<hi>Armenian,</hi> the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Commaunder of the Cavallery, and <hi>Gobryas.</hi> As for
<hi>Gadatas</hi> he became<note n="*" place="margin">or, Captaine.</note> Ruler under him of the Scepter-bearers: and according to
his direction, all the house-keeping of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was ordered. And when there were
any at supper with <hi>Cyrus, Gadatas</hi> did not so much as sit downe, but tooke the
charge of all, and waited: But if no guest were there, himselfe supped with him:
For he tooke delight in his presence and company. In regard of which affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and diligence of his, he was highly esteemed of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and of others in the
Court likewise for <hi>Cyrus</hi> his sake. When guests invited to supper came, <hi>Cyrus</hi>
placed them not one with another hand over head without respect: but whom
he vouchsafed most honour, him did he set on his left hand, because the same
hand is more exposed to daunger of wait-laying that the right: the second in
dignity he placed on the right hand, the third againe on the left hand, and the
fourth on the right. If there were any more, he marshalled them in the same
order. And he thought it very expedient, to declare how he honoured each
one. For, where men suppose, that he who surpasseth others in worthinesse shall
receive neither praise nor prize, evident it is, that there is no emulation among
them, who shall excell. But where the best is seene to be in the highest place
and to have the precedency of the rest, there doe they all with exceeding ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
enter into open strife and contention. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> verily after this manner
shewed who were of greatest authority and reputation with him, beginning first
with the order of their sitting with him and standing about him. Howbeit he
would not that any man should challenge that place then assigned as his owne
for ever: but he brought up this custome as a law, that according to their good
and vertuous deeds, they should be advanced to an higher degree of honour,
and as any one demeaned himself more basely, he should come down to a lower
place. For, <hi>Cyrus</hi> thought it would redound greatly to his owne shame, in case
any person promoted to the highest roome in sitting, should not be seene abroad
for to enjoy many ornaments and favours by him. And as in <hi>Cyrus</hi> time these
matters were thus carried, so in these daies, we understand the same order hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
still. When they were at supper, <hi>Gobryas</hi> thought it no wonderous matter,
that every thing was served up unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> in so great plenty, being a Prince so
puissant, and the Ruler over so many: but he mervailed rather at this, that having
afchieved so great exploits, if any toothsome and deinty cates came before him,
he would not enjoy the pleasure thereof alone, but take the paines even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
his friends about him, for to receive part thereof. Nay, he saw him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a time, to send unto some that were absent, such deinties as haply he had a
speciall mind unto himselfe. Whereby it came to passe, that after they had
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19319:109"/>
supped themselves, <hi>Cyrus</hi> would send from the very table one way or other, all
the dishes as many as they were, whereat <hi>Gobryas,</hi> I was of opinion heretofor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

us have no such words. Nay, but was I any whit slacke, said <hi>Hystaspas</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to you? No, neither quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Commaunded you me at any time, that
which I performed not accordingly? I can find no fault with you answered <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
And whatsoever I did, could you ever perceive me to doe it not cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
nor with delight and pleasure? No I assure you quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For, herein
of all other I can least find fault with you. What is it then, For the love of
God quoth he, and wherein hath <hi>Chrysantas</hi> so prevailed with you, that hee
should be preferred to a more honourable place than my selfe? Shall I tell you
the reason saith <hi>Cyrus?</hi> what else, quoth <hi>Hystaspas?</hi> And will not you be angry,
quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> when you heare the truth? No verily saith <hi>Hystaspas,</hi> but rather
very glad will I be, if I may know that I am not wronged. Goe to then, saith
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> you shall understand, This <hi>Chrysantas</hi> here, first and formost, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
untill I sent for him: but was alwaies present to attend and follow our
affaires before he was called. Againe, he did not that onely which he was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
but whatsoever himselfe knew expedient for us to be done, that did he.
Moreover, if at any time a matter was to be delivered by speech unto our Allies
and Confederates, whatsoever he thought decent for me to say, therto he would
advise me: But whatever he perceived, I was desirous that our Associats should
know, but yet upon a bashfull modesty, loth my selfe to utter unto them, hee
would declare the same in such termes, as if it had beene his owne opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So
that in these cases, what can be alleadged to the contrary, but that he is more
carefull for my good and commodity, than mine owne selfe. Furthermore, this
is his saying that he stands alwaies contented with his present fortune as suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for him, but for me he sheweth himselfe provident and forecasting in my
behalfe, what good I may have by any thing added to my estate. To conclude,
in my welfare, he taketh more joy and pleasure, than I doe my selfe. At these
words, <hi>Hystaspas</hi> said, Now so love me, Lady <hi>Iuno,</hi> as it doth me good at the
very heart, that I demaunded those questions of you. And why so especially<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
I pray, quoth <hi>Cyrus:</hi> because saith he, I will endeavour what I can, to doe the
same. But for one thing, I know not what to doe: namely, how, and in what
sort I might shew my affection, when I rejoyce in your good fortune and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare?
Whether I must clap my hands, or laugh, or what else I should do? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<hi>Artabazus,</hi> you ought then, quoth he, to daunce the <hi>Persian</hi> daunce. At which
they all laughed a good. Now as the banquet went on still and they began to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19319:110"/>
drinke more liberally, <hi>Cyrus</hi> demaunded of <hi>Gobryas.</hi> Tell me, <hi>Gobryas,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are you more willing now, to bestow your daughter in marriage upon one
of these Gentlemen, than at your first acquaintance with us? And will you give
me also leave quoth <hi>Gobryas</hi> to say a truth? Yea verily, saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
needs to be answered with a lye. Why then, saith <hi>Gobryas,</hi> know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
That much more willing I am now, than heretofore. And can you render
a reason why? quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Yea that I can answered <hi>Gobryas.</hi> Say on then quoth
<hi>Cyrus.</hi> Because quoth he I saw them as then, to endure both paines and perils
willingly, but now I perceive they can beare prosperity wisely, and with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
And truely, ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> in my conceit, it is an harder matter to find a
man to beare well the favouring, than to brooke the frowning of fortune. For,
of the one may grow pride and insolency in many: but the other breedeth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and temperance in all. How now <hi>Hystaspas,</hi> saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> have you heard
what an Apophthegme <hi>Gobryas</hi> hath delivered? Yes that I have quoth <hi>Hysta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spas.</hi>
And if he come out with many such sentences, he shall have me sooner to
become a suiter unto his daughter, than if he shewed me many drinking cups.
And I assure you saith <hi>Gobryas,</hi> Many of these and such like sayings of his, I
have put in writing: of which I will not envy you the having, in case you es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouse
my daughter. As for drinking cups, because me thinks you set no store
by them, I wote not whether you should doe well to bestow them upon this
<hi>Chrysantas</hi> here, because he hath stolen your seat from you. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Certes
<hi>Hystaspas</hi> and yee my friends here present, If yee tell me when any one of you
will in hand with marriage, yee shall see in what good stead I also will stand
you, in your wooing. Then <hi>Gobryas,</hi> If a man would marry forth his daughter,
whom should he acquaint with that businesse? Whom but me! quoth <hi>Cyrus?</hi>
For I am passing good at such a feat. What feat is that? quoth <hi>Chrysantas:</hi> even
the skill to know what marriage is meet for each person. Then, for the love
of God quoth <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> Tell me what kind of wife will best fit me, &amp; be most
sutable to my person? First, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a little woman; because you are but
little your selfe. For if you should match with one of stature tall, you must bee
faine to leap up to her, (as these little dogs doe) whensoever you would kisse
her upright. In good faith quoth <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> very well considered of you, For
I am nothing made at all for leaping. Then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> A woman with a flat
nose were very meet for you. And why so, saith <hi>Chrysantas:</hi> because, quoth he,
your selfe are<note n="*" place="margin">or, Hawke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>osed.</note> hooke-nosed. For, you know very well, that flat noses and
hooked, will couch and close best togither. Say you then, quoth <hi>Chrysantas,</hi>
That when one hath supped well, as I now have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a wife that goeth supperlesse
to bed, were meet to lye with him? yes verily quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For they that are
full, have round and copped bellies, but their bellies be flat that are empty, and
have not had their suppers. But can you tell me for Gods sake, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> what
manner of wife is good for a cold King? Herewith <hi>Cyrus</hi> laughed and so did
the rest. And as they were altogither set a laughing, In this one point verily
quoth <hi>Chrysantas</hi> I envie you especially, in your royall estate: And, what is
that saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because quoth he being as you are so cold and dry your selfe,
yet you can make us all to laugh. And would not you quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> give a great
deale, to have these things told you, and report made unto her of whom you
desire to be so highly esteemed, that you are pleasantly conceited? Thus passed
they the time skoffing and jesting merrily one with another. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:19319:110"/>
brought forth a sute of womans apparaile and ornaments thereto for <hi>Tigranes,</hi>
which he willed him to give unto his wife, because she had borne her selfe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this expedition, with her husband. To <hi>Artabazus</hi> he gave a cup of gold,
and to the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Captaine a Courser, with many other faire and rich gifts.
As for you, <hi>Gobryas,</hi> I will bestow upon you an husband for your daughter.
Then, me you will give I trow quoth <hi>Hystaspas,</hi> that I may have those written
sentences of his. Why, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> have you any estate of your owne, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the dowry of the Damoisell? Yea, that I have quoth he, God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the same worth much more money. And where I pray you lyeth that
wealth of yours? Even there, quoth <hi>Hystaspas,</hi> (pointing to <hi>Cyrus</hi>) where you
sit that are my friend. And that is enough said <hi>Gobryas</hi> to content me. And
therewith presently he raught forth his hand and said, Give me him <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for
I am ready to receive him. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> taking <hi>Hystaspas</hi> by the right hand, gave
him unto <hi>Gobryas,</hi> who received him accordingly. After this, he bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Hystaspas</hi> many goodly gifts, to send unto the young Lady his spouse: and
withall, taking <hi>Chrysantas</hi> close unto him, he kissed him. Then <hi>Artabazus,</hi> As
<hi>Iupiter</hi> me helpe ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth he, that cup which you gave unto me, and the
gift which you bestowed upon <hi>Chrysantas,</hi> be not both of the same gold. But
I will quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> give you the like. And when? asked he: Thirty yeeres
hence quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> See then quoth he, you order the matter so, and provide
against that time; as from whom I will expect so much, and not dye in the
meane while. Thus for that present, ended their feast and merry meeting.
When they were risen, <hi>Cyrus</hi> also arose and accompanied them to the very
gates.</p>

And verily the posterity descended from those who then stayed, enjoy the same

When he had dealt away gifts among them, at their departure, and taken such
order, as neither Captaine nor souldier had cause to complaine, hee dismissed
them. After this, he distributed among his owne souldiers, what money and
treasure he got at <hi>Sardes.</hi> To the Colonels verily over ten thousand men, To

their charge) according as they found each one worthy. And thus they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that which was meet in equity. Which largesse being done: some there
were, who gave out of <hi>Cyrus</hi> these or such like speeches. Certes, he must needs
have much treasure himselfe, who hath given to every one of us so liberally.
Others againe answered and said, And what great thing is it that he hath? It is
not the manner of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to seeke wholly to be enriched, but he taketh more
pleasure in giving to others, than in keeping for his owne use. When <hi>Cyrus</hi>
perceived what words men gave out, and what opinion they had conceived of
him, he assembled his friends with all the men of action and quality, and to
this effect spake unto them. I have seene ere now, my good friends, men in the
world, who would be thought to possesse more than they doe in deed, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thereby to appeare more liberall. But in my mind quoth he, they come
short of their reckoning, and are haled away cleane contrary to their intent.
For, when a man would be accoumpted rich, and is not seene withall, to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
his friends, after the rate of that wealth, me thinks it is enough to set the
brand upon him of base illiberality. Againe, there be others, who would not
be knowne how rich they are: And they also in my judgement, deserve but
badly of their friends. For, by reason that their estate is unknowne, oftentimes,
friends in their need acquaint them not therewith, and making no mone unto
them are deceived. But I take this to be the part of the best plaine-dealing man,
to make his power and substance knowne, and then accordingly to endeavour
for to shew his goodnesse and honesty. And therefore what riches of mine
may be seene: I am willing of my selfe to shew unto you: and looke what can
not be seene, I will relate unto you by word of mouth. Having thus said, one
part of his treasures, which were many and faire, he gave them leave to see: the
rest that were laid up out of sight, he recoumpted unto them. And in the end,
these words: My friends, This accoumpt yee ought all to make: That these ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
here are no more mine than yours. For, I doe not gather them, either to
spend them all my selfe, or to weare them out, which were a thing impossible:
but partly to have evermore about me wherewith I may at all times reward any
of you, as he performeth any brave service: and partly, that whosoever among
you thinketh that he stands in need of ought, he may come unto me and receive
what he wanteth. And there an end of these his words.</p>
               <p>Now when he had well settled as he thought his estate in. <hi>Babylon,</hi> so as he
might take a journey abroad, he addressed himselfe to make a voiage into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
and commaunded the rest to be in readinesse. And when he supposed that he
was sufficiently provided of all things needfull and requisite for such an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he remooved and tooke his journey. But here I purpose to put downe,
how orderly his armie and traine so great as it was, both in taking up their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
by the way, unpacked and discharged their carriage, and at their setting
forth againe, trussed up bag and baggage, as also how quickly they made stay
and sat downe in any place, as need required. For, where ever the King encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
they all pitch their tents about him, as well in summer as in winter. And
<hi>Cyrus</hi> verily at the first ordained, that his owne Pavilion should be set so, as it
might have prospect into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> how farre off, from his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19319:111"/>
Royall tent, the Guard and Pensioners should quarter and have their lodgings.
After them, he assigned for the bakers the right hand; and for the cooks and
victuallers the left. He appointed for the horses [of service] the right side, and
for the other labouring and draught beasts the left. Semblably all things else
were digested so, as that every man knew his owne place, as well by measure as
by the plot of ground. Now, when they dislodge and are upon their remoove,
every man packeth up such baggage as he is appointed to use. Others there be
againe, ready to lay them upon the Sumpter beasts: whereby it comes to passe,
that all the porters and carriers come together unto those packs and trusses, that
they are appointed to bring, and every one at once layeth his owne stuffe upon
his owne beasts. So that the same time that serveth for the pitching and setting
up of one tent, is sufficient for all. And at one and the same instant, were all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
discharged and laid downe likewise. Moreover, every man had his charge
what to doe, for purveying of victuals and all necessaries in due season: so, that
one and the same time serveth for one part and for all, to make provision there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And as there was a severall place set by for the purveyours of necessaries
meet for them, so his armed souldiers in pitching of the campe, had that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which was convenient for each kind of armature and munition. They knew
also which it was; and in generall held and occupied it so as they never differed
about it. Certes, even in a private house and family, <hi>Cyrus</hi> thought it a speciall
matter, to be carefull for the order and fit placing of every thing in it. (For, if
one hath need of ought, he is not to seeke whither to goe and where to find it)
but he supposed it was a much more excellent thing, that in a campe the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tribes and regiments should be placed in good and convenient order. For,
by how much, the occasions in warre be more sodaine, so much the greater is
their delinquency, who slacke any time and be tardy therein. But in warfare, he
saw that exploits of great consequence, were performed by those that were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at hand in due time. In which regard, very diligent and carefull he was, to
have every thing placed fitly and in order. First of all, he tooke up a lodging for
himselfe, in the mids of the Campe, because that place was strongest. Then
had he next about him (as his manner ever was,) his trustiest men: and round
about them the men of armes and chariotiers. For, he supposed it needfull for
them, to quarter in a place of security: because, if any sodaine Al-arme be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the Campe, they have not use of their armes out of hand: but their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
requireth a long time ere they can be armed, in case they meane to goe
forth with them into the field for to doe any good. Moreover on either hand,
as well the left as the right, both of himselfe and of his said horsemen, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velotiers
with their light bucklers were planted: but behind and before, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.
As for the souldiers heavily armed and such as bare massie targuets, they
compassed all the rest, in manner of a wall: to the end that when need was, that
the horsemen should make themselves ready, these souldiers so well appointed
standing afore them might abide the longest brunt, and give them respit and
time enough to arme in safety. And like as those heavily armed souldiers lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and slept keeping their order and array stil, even so did the Iavelotiers lightly
armed and the Archers. That if any Al-arme were in the night, like as those are
prest to wound the assailants close at hand, so these Archers and Darters might
be as ready to shoot their arrowes, and launce their Iavelins from them in the
defence of those armed souldiers, if any enemies approached and affronted
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19319:112"/>
them. Furthermore all the Captaines had certaine<note n="*" place="margin">

By which meanes, like as in Cities, the wiser sort can point unto the
dwelling houses of most Citizens, but especially of such as are of employment:
even so the ministers and servitours of <hi>Cyrus</hi> knew in what places to find their
Captains and what Ensignes or colours belonged to every one. And thereby, if
<hi>Cyrus</hi> had occasion to use any of them, they needed not to seeke up and downe,
but ran readily the next way to every one. And because each nation was apart
and not intermingled one with another, it was much sooner seene, both when
any kept his owne ranke in order as also whether they did not that which was
commaunded. Being thus marshalled, he thought that if any enemie either by
night or day assailed him, they should come upon his campe no otherwise, than
if they sell into a place of ambushment. And, for a<note n="*" place="margin">

and to wind about with it, in good sort, on the right hand, or on the
left, or in the reare: but he supposed also, it appertained to that skill, for to be
able to divide it if need required, and each part thereof to bestow for most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
yea and to lead it on speedily, where occasion is of prevention. All
these points, and such like fears he thought did belong to that Captaine<note n="*" place="margin">

is expert in the ordinance of a battaile: And even so right carefull and studious

and sodaine accidents: Howbeit in the pitching of his campe, he used
for the most part this dispose, which I have rehearsed.</p>
               <p>Now when they had journeyed so farre as they were come into the <hi>Medes</hi>
countrey, <hi>Cyrus</hi> turned in to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> for to lodge with him. And after they had
embraced one another, <hi>Cyrus</hi> said first to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> that there was provided for
him in <hi>Babylon,</hi> a choice dwelling house with stately edifices: that if he came
thither he might keepe his Court there, as in his owne. Then, bestowed he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him very many and those right goodly presents. <hi>Cyaxares</hi> when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them at his hands, sent his daughter unto him: who brought with her for
him a golden Coronet, a paire of bracelets and a collar of gold, with a most
beautifull <hi>Median</hi> robe. Here, quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I give unto you <hi>Cyrus,</hi> this young
Lady mine owne daughter to be your wedded wife. For so, your father espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
my fathers daughter, whose sonne you are. And this is even very she, whom
you being a child, many a time in our house, were wont to sport with and dandle
as a nurceling. And when any one asked her, whose wife she would be? she was
wont to make answer, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> should be her husband. And with her, I give
over and above, for a dowry the Kingdome of <hi>Media,</hi> and enfeoffe her wholly
in it, since I have no issue male of mine owne legitimate. Thus said <hi>Cyaxares.</hi>
Vnto whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> made this answer. The parentage, good Vnkle <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I
commend, The young maiden I praise, and of the dowry I like well enough:
but before I conclude of a marriage, I will have the consent of my father and
mother. And albeit <hi>Cyrus</hi> thus said, yet bestowed he upon the Damoisell, all
those gifts, wherein he thought hee might gratifie <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> Which done hee
tooke his leave and went forward on his journey for <hi>Persia.</hi>

meet to present unto his father and mother and other his friends there: yea and
such as might beseeme the Head Magistrates, Auncients, and noble Gentlemen
called <hi>Homotimi,</hi> in generall. Moreover he gave a largesse among all the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
both men and women, even such congiaries as at this day the King useth to
deale among them, whensoever he commeth into <hi>Persia.</hi> After this, <hi>Cambyses</hi>
assembled a Councell of the Elders of <hi>Persia,</hi> togither with such Rulers as had
the menaging of the weightiest affaires in Common-wealth. Who being come
togither, he called <hi>Cyrus</hi> also unto them, and then made a speech to this effect.
My Lords of <hi>Persia</hi> and you likewise my sonne <hi>Cyrus:</hi> I heartily affect you
all, as good reason I have, both the one and the other. For, as I am your King,
so you <hi>Cyrus</hi> are my sonne. Meet it is therefore, and in all congruence it besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that I open here before you, whatsoever I may seeme to know, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
your good and welfare. As for you the <hi>Persians,</hi> in times past yee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
my sonne, when yee did put an armie into his hands, and chose him Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
thereof. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> being once the Commaunder of that power, by the
assistance of God hath made you <hi>Persians</hi> renowned with all men and honoured
throughout all <hi>Asia.</hi> And verily, as the valiantest Knights of those that served
under him, he hath enriched, so to the very multitude of Common souldiers,
he hath truly paid their wages and found them food. Moreover, by erecting a
Cavallery among the <hi>Persians,</hi> he hath effected, that they be as good horsemen
upon the plaines as others. If yee therefore hereafter persist in this mind still,
yee shall procure one unto another manifold commodities. But if either you
for your part <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being puffed up for the late good successe of fortune, shall
goe about to be an absolute Lord over the <hi>Persians,</hi> thereby to make a private
gaine of them, as over other nations: or yee that are natives and subjects, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of his puissance, endeavour and practise to depose him, and overthrow his
royall estate, know this for certaine, that yee shall hinder one another in the
atchieving of many great and noble exploits. To the end therefore, that these
inconveniences befall not unto you, that yee may enjoy all good blessings, I
have thought it meet after we have sacrificed togither and called the Gods to
record, to make this covenant, that you <hi>Cyrus</hi> for your part in the behalfe of
the <hi>Persians,</hi> if any one either enterprize the invasion of the <hi>Persian</hi> land, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to breake and abrogate the <hi>Persian</hi> lawes, shall be aiding and assisting to
them with all your might: and yee likewise, that are <hi>Persians,</hi> if either any Alien
goe about to dispossesse <hi>Cyrus</hi> of his Kingdome, or if subjects rebell and revolt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19319:113"/>
from him, shall be ready to assist both your selves and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> according to his
Commandement. And verily so long as God shall lend me life, mine is the
Kingdome of <hi>Persia:</hi> but after my decease, <hi>Cyrus</hi> shall be King thereof, if he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive.
Who, when he<note n="*" place="margin">

sacrifices for you, like as now my selfe doth sacrifice. But whiles he makes his
abode in another country, I suppose it will be expedient for you, that one of our
line and blood, whom yee thinke the very best, performe that which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to religion and the worship of God. When <hi>Cambyses</hi> had uttered these
words, both <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the Rulers also of <hi>Persia</hi> agreed thereto, and by enacting a
decree ratified the same. And as they then capitulated and passed these Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
calling the Gods to witnesse, so at this time, the <hi>Persians</hi> and their King
doe constantly observe the same.</p>
               <p>After these affaires thus accomplished, <hi>Cyrus</hi> departed, and when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
backe into <hi>Media,</hi> by the consent both of his father and mother, he tooke
to wife the daughter of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> aforesaid: of whom the speech goes even at this
day, that she was exceeding beautifull. Howbeit, some Historiographers there
be, who write that he wedded his mothers sister. But she had beene doubtlesse
by this time an old stale woman and<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </note> no fresh Damoisell. No sooner was the
marriage solemnized, but presently he tooke her with him and departed.</p>
               <p>After he was come to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he thought good now to send Lieutenants Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
and Presidents into those nations which he had subdued. As for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of Garrison-Castles, and those Colonels likewise over thousands, who
had the keeping of the country, he would not have them to obey any but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
For, this forecast he had (considering how it would prejudice his owne
State, in case any of those Rulers and Lieutenants, presuming upon their wealth
and the multitude of men under them should beare themselves insolently, and
shake off the yoke of their alleageance) namely to have in readinesse within
the Countrey, such as would make head against them. Intending therefore to
bring this about, first he thought it good policy, to call togither the chiefe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of sort, and to declare this businesse unto them, that they might take
knowledge upon what motives they went thither who were to be sent. For, by
this meanes he thought they would take it the better. But if any such were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Governours and Deputies first, and then afterwards should understand
so much, he supposed they would beare it hard, as who might thinke all this was
done for their infidelity and his distrust in them. Having therefore assembled
those [principall Gentlemen] togither, hee spake much after this manner unto
them! My good friends, we have in those Cities which we won, both garrison
souldiers and also Captaines over them, such as then wee left behind us: unto
whom at my departure I gave no other charge busily to meddle in, but only to
defend their Forts. And those surely will I not put out of their places of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
considering they have duly observed their commission. But other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
and Governours I meane to send, for to be Presidents over the people and
inhabitants of the countries, who gathering tribute and receiving the revenues
of the State, are to pay the garrison souldiers their wages, and to performe all
services necessarie: Also, to as many of you as here live, and whom I employ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
my affaires in foraine parts: I thinke it meet, whiles I send them away unto
these nations about some businesses which they are to menage, for to assigne
house and lands there, to the end that tribute may be brought hither unto them,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19319:113"/>
and when they come thither, they may be lodged and entertained in their owne.
When he had thus said, he gave houses and subjects to commaund, in all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which he had conquered. And even at this day, the posterity descended
from them, who at that time received these Donations, remaine still in possession
of those lands, situate and lying, some in one countrey, and some in another<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
whereas, they themselves abide at the Court with the King. But necessary it is
moreover, quoth he, that yee consider of those Deputies and Governours who
are to goe into these Provinces; that they be such, as will be mindfull, to send hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also what good thing and speciall commodity there is in each land: to the
end that we also residing here, may be partakers of all the profits, that any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
yeeldeth wheresoever. For, if any fearefull and dangerous object should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it selfe unto them, we must for our parts defend them. Thus having said, he
concluded his speech. And then such friends of his, as he knew desirous to goe
upon those termes abovesaid, he made choise of, and sent them as Lords-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
who were in his judgement, most meet and worthy, to wit, into <hi>Arabia,
Megabystus;</hi> into <hi>Cappadocia Artabatas; Artacamas</hi> into <hi>Phrygia</hi> the great: and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santas</hi>
into <hi>Lycia</hi> and <hi>Ionia.</hi> Into <hi>Caria, Cadusius</hi> according to the <hi>Carians</hi> request.
Into <hi>Phrygia</hi> lying upon <hi>Hellespont</hi> and into <hi>Aeeolis, Pharnuchus.</hi> But into <hi>Cilicia,
Cyprus,</hi> and to the <hi>Paphlagonians</hi> he sent no Governors, because they seemed of
their owne accord and unsent for, to joyne with him in the journey of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
Howbeit, these nations also he commaunded to bring in their tribute. And as
<hi>Cyrus</hi> ordained it in those daies, so at this time also: the garrisons in every Castle,
are at the Kings dispose. The Colonels also over every 1000. of garrison soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
are by the King appointed, and their names enrolled and remaining with
the King.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he gave all those LL. Governours in charge whom he sent out,
to endeavour with all their whole power for to imitate his example in all things
that they saw him to doe. First and principally, to ordaine a troupe of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Chariotiers, out of those <hi>Persians</hi> and Allies who followed them in
their traine. And as many as were endowed with Lands and<note n="*" place="margin">

studiously given to temperance, they might shew themselves ready to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by the Lord Governour as occasion required. Also their children to be
trained up at the Court, like as the manner was with him. Item, that each Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
or Governour aforesaid, should bring those his Courteours attending upon
him, forth a hunting, and to exercise both himselfe and those about him in such
disports and pastimes as tend unto warfare. And whosoever saith he in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his puissance and regiment, shall be able to shew unto me most charriots
meet for service, the greatest number likewise of horsemen right expert and
skilfull, him will I honour and reward as a singular Associate in warre, him will
I consider, as a speciall preserver with me both of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire and mine.
Let there be also quoth he among you certaine degrees of seats, and see that the
best warriours and most valiant Knights, sit in higher place, as it is the order
with me. As for your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

houshold servants, and then to be sufficiently furnished for to impart an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

exploit. See likewise that ye be possessed of parks, and keepe wild beasts in them
for game: and never either your selves cause meat to be set upon the bourd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19319:114"/>
yee have laboured, nor give your horses hay, unlesse they be first exercised.
For, it is not possible that I being one man alone, with all the humane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and prowesse that is, should preserve the weale of you all: but necessarie it
is, that I being a valiant person my selfe, should assist you with mine owne also
and those redoubted Knights. Yee likewise ought to be hardy your selves and
with those brave and valourous men about you to aide me. Moreover I would
have you consider thus much, that none of these points which now I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
unto you, I doe impose upon slaves, but whatsoever I say that yee ought
to doe, the same I endeavour to practise first my selfe. To conclude, like as I bid
you imitate me, so teach yee those subordinate and inferiour Magistrates within
your jurisdiction to follow you. And as at that time <hi>Cyrus</hi> first ordained, even
so at this day, are all the garrisons under the Kings dominion kept, all the
Courts of the Grand Rulers in like manner served and attended: all houses and
families as well great as small in the same sort ordered. Of all them that be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in ordinary, they who have carried themselves best, are graced with higher
seats above the rest: all their journeyes are likewise appointed and disposed.
And generally many matters are compendiously dispatched by few Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
When he had given this charge to these Lieutenants and Deputies, how
every one was to frame and digest his affaires: and withall assigned unto each
of them a certaine power of souldiers, he dismissed them, with a warning given
to them all, to prepare themselves and be in readinesse: For that the yeere next
ensuing, he intended an expedition, and meant to review and muster all his men,
horses and chariots. Which laudable custome being first begun by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> wee
understand, (by report) continueth still. For, hereupon some great man or other
yeerely visiteth the Provinces with an army: Who, if any one of the foresaid
Governours stands in need, is ready to helpe: if any beare himselfe insolently,
him he reduceth into order, and teacheth to be wiser. Is there any one that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth
the bringing in of Tribute? is slacke in protecting the inhabitants? or
looketh not to the ground that it be tilled and husbanded; or leaveth ought else
undone that is commaunded, he it is that brings all into good frame againe:
but if he cannot effect this by himselfe, he giveth notice therof to the King.
Then he no sooner heareth the matter, but consulteth deliberately about the
party thus delinquent. And oftentimes they, of whom it is commonly said,
<hi>The Kings sonne commeth downe: The Kings brother; The Kings Eye, &amp;c.</hi> be the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitours
and Overseers: yea sometimes when they are not seene at all themselves.
For every one of these is called backe againe out of the way, whensoever the
King commaundeth.</p>
               <p>Moreover we are given to understand of another invention of <hi>Cyrus</hi> (which
concerneth the greatnesse of his Empire) whereby he quickly had intelligence
brought unto him, how the State of things went. For knowing by experience,
how farre an horse would carry a man in a day without tyring, hee appointed
stable-roomes distant so much one from another, and therein post-horses and
persons of purpose to looke unto them. He appointed also in every of these
places, a man, fit both to receive packets of letters, and to deliver them as they
were brought: Who also should take the weary horses, and make supply wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
fresh, to send forward. And it is said, that otherwhiles this manner of riding
post, gave not over all night: but after the day-messenger; immediately succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
another for the night. Which being thus ordered, some say, that his posts
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19319:114"/>
dispatched their journeyes faster than Cranes flye. Which saying if it be not
true, yet thus much at leastwise is evident, that of all journeyes by land, it is of
greatest speed. And this good came thereof, that so soone as one perceived any
occurrent, the same was looked unto with all expedition.</p>

               <p>AFTER a yeere come and gone, <hi>Cyrus</hi> assembled all his forces at the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez-vouz
in Babylon. And the report goeth, that he was able to bring
into the field 120000 men of Armes; of sithed Chariots 2000. of
footmen, to the number of 600000. Which power being come togither and
in readinesse, he entred into that expedition, wherein he is said to have conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all those nations that inhabit, as farre as from the entrance of Syria unto
the red Sea.</p>
               <p>After this, he made they say another voyage, wherein he subdued Aegypt.
From which time the Empire of <hi>Cyrus</hi> extended, East to the red Sea: North, to
the Euxine Sea. Westward it confined with Cyprus and Aegypt: South-ward,
with Aethiopia. The bounds and marches of which Countryes, some be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

In so doing, he led his life all the yeere long in the temperate heat and
cold of the Spring. And so affectionately beloved was <hi>Cyrus</hi> of all men, that
people of every Nation, thought it went not well with them, if they sent not
unto him a present of what rarities either grew, or were fed, or made by art in
their country. Semblably, there was not a Citie or private person any where,
but he tooke himselfe made for ever, in case he could doe a pleasure unto <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
For, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> received of every one such things, whereof the givers had plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
so he bestowed liberally upon them againe, what he knew was geason and
scarce with them.</p>
               <p>When he had lived thus untill he was farre stept in yeeres, being very aged
he made a journey into Persia, which was the seventh voyage thither after hee
came unto his Empire. By which time his father and mother (as by course of
nature) had beene long dead. Where, after he had sacrificed according to the
lawes, and solemnly led the daunce among the Persians, after the manner of the
countrey, and as his custome was, dealt gifts among them all, as hee lay asleepe
one time within the Palace, he dreamed, and saw such a vision as this: Him
thought that one came unto him resembling a personage more venerable and
fuller of majestie than any mortall wight, and said, Prepare thy selfe, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
to a journey, for shortly thou shalt depart unto the Gods. With this dreame
and vision he awoke and seemed in manner to take full knowledge, that
the end of his life was neere at hand. Whereupon he tooke immediatly beasts
for sacrifice, and slew them to the honour of Iupiter the Patron and tutelar God
of his native countrey, to the Sunne likewise, and to other Gods resiant upon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19319:115"/>
the tops of the mountaines (for so the Persians use to sacrifice) and then to
this effect conceived his Oraisons.</p>
               <p>O Iupiter Protectour of this my native soyle, ô Sunne, and all yee other
Gods, accept of these Sacrifices, as the absolute perfection and finiall of many
noble and excellent Actions: as the tokens beside, of thanks-giving unto you,
for that yee have signified unto mee, as well by the entrails of sacrificed beasts,
as celestiall signes: as well by augury of birds as presaging Osses, what I was to
doe in all my affaires, and what not? Many-fold thanks of dutie I render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, for that I have alwaies agnized your especiall care over mee, and never
in all my fortunate and triumphant state, exalted my selfe aboue the condition
of a mortall man. And now I humbly beseech you vouchsafe unto my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
wife, friends, and native country, long felicitie. And in mine owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
I crave this grace, that yee would grant unto mee such an end, as may be
answerable to the life ye gave me. When he had thus done and returned home
to his Palace, he had a minde gently to take his pleasant repose, and thereupon
quietly laid him downe upon his bed. Now when bathing time was, his
Groomes and Chamberlaines for that office appointed, came in and put him in
minde to wash: but he answered them, that hee sweetly tooke his rest. Others
likewise according to their place; when due time was, set his supper before him.

who fortuned then to be in Persia as having accompanied their father thither.
He sent also for his friends and the chiefe Lords and Rulers of Persia. When
they were all come togither, he began in this wise to speake unto them.</p>
               <p>My children, and yee my friends all, that be here in presence: The end of
my life, as I evidently perceive by many signes, draweth on apace, and is now
come. Your parts it is therefore, so soone as I am departed this world, both
to say and doe by mee in all respects, as a blessed and happy man. For, as during
my childhood I was thought to have envied the best things meet and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
for that age: so, in my youth I reaped the fruit of such actions as besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
young yeeres. Likewise, being growne to the maturitie of mans estate, I
had the benefit of those deeds, which were answerable to mens ripenesse and
perfection. Yea and as I waxed still elder and elder, me thought I perceived my
strength with progresse of time to encrease ever more and more. In so much
as I never found mine old age feebler, than the prime of my youth. Nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I, that I ever enterprized or desired ought in my heart, but I atchieved
the same. My friends verily have I seene by my meanes made fortunate: but
mine enemies brought into servitude. Mine owne countrey, which heretofore
was of no accompt nor commaund in Asia, I leave now ennobled and in sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
honour above others. And of all that ever I wonne and got, I know not
what one parcell, I have not held and kept still. And albeit for the time past,
all matters have succeeded to my hearts desire, yet for that I was accompanied
with a certaine feare, lest I might for the future, see, heare, or feele some adverse
calamitie, the same would not permit me to be hautie and proud at all, nor yet
over-joyous for my present fortunes: And now, if I my selfe forgoe this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory

mee. My country also and friends in blessed case: How can it then bee

mine, as that I have learned to give place unto mine elders, not brethren onely,
but other natives also, in the way as I meet them, in sitting also and making any

to honour above others aged persons, and likewise to be duly honoured your

unto you, as from one who pronounceth nothing else but things received

suppose that I leave a greater dominion indeed, and the name of an absolute
Roialtie unto your elder brother, but certenly to you I bequeath a felicitie and
happie estate, more void of trouble, and freed from all vexation. For, I assure
you, I see not what worldly pleasure you can want. Certes, you shall enjoy
all things on earth, that may bring delight and content unto man. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and affection to difficult enterprizes hardly to be atchieved, the busie cares
in many affaires, a restlesse course of life, whiles the minde is sollicited and
pricked with the emulation of mine acts and worthy exploits: to lye in wait
and espiall for some, to bee forelayed and live in feare of the practices of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
These be the troubles and dangers that of necessitie accompany a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Monarch more than you. And these things, wote you well, interrupt
ones joy with manifold troubles. And you my sonne <hi>Cambyses,</hi> I would have
you to know, that it is not this golden. Scepter that is able to preserve your
Kingdome and Royall estate. But many friends and those trusty, are unto
Kings the truest appay and surest Scepter to rest upon. And never thinke that
men are naturally borne faithfull friends unto you (for if that were so, the same
men would be true and loyall unto all: like as other things in one nature are
seene to bee the same unto all indifferently,) But every Prince must himselfe
make men trusty and fast unto him: and made they are such, not by force, but
rather by beneficence and bountie. If you therefore would gaine others unto
you, for to bee assistant in the preservation of your royaltie, begin not at any
other before him, who is sprung from the same stocke that you are, to wit,
your owne brother. And verily you see, that naturall Citizens are more neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
linked unto us than strangers: such as eate, drinke, and daily converse with
us, more than those that live apart and be unacquainted with us. They then,
that are come of one seed and the same blood, nourished by the same mother,
brought up in the same house, loved of the same parents, calling one father
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19319:116"/>
and one mother, how can these otherwise be but of all others most inward and
familiar? Suffer not then, those good blessings to be in vaine bestowed upon
you, whereby the very Gods lead brethren to the entertainment of mutuall
amitie: but over and above this foundation already laid, build forthwith other
workes of love: and thus your reciprocall friendship shall continue for ever
invincible. And to say a truth, he regardeth his owne selfe, who taketh care
of his brother. For, unto what other person is a brother (if he be a mightie
man) such an ornament as to his brother? And who beside is able to honour
a puissant Potentate so much as a brother? And whom will a man, having a
great person to his brother feare to wrong, so much as hee will his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
See therefore that no man obey him sooner, nor be readier to come and
assist him than your selfe. For neither his prosperitie, nor adversitie concernes
any man more properly than you. Consider moreover in gratifying whom,
you should hope to gaine more or winne greater thanke, than if you doe your
brother a pleasure? In succouring, shall you get a firmer Ally than him? whom
is it more unseemely or dishonest not to love, than a brother? and whom in
all the world is it more decent and befitting, to honour above the rest than a
brother? It is a brother onely, and none but he, ô <hi>Cambyses,</hi> who if hee have
the principall place of love with a brother, incurreth not the envie of others
thereby? For the tender love therefore of our tutelar Gods, my children: As
yee have any desire to gratifie mee your father, honour yee one another. For,
yee doe not I trow beleeve and know for certaine, that when I end this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life, I shall become nothing at all and have no more being. Neither did
yee so much as erewhile see my soule visibly, but by the operations which it
had, yee conceived of it as of a reall essence. Or know yee not yet, what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
doe their soules who have suffred violence and wrongs strike into murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
hearts, and what<note n="*" place="margin">

Thinke yee, that the honours done to those that are departed, would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
so long, if their spirits had no power and strength remaining in them?
For mine owne part, my sonnes, I could never be perswaded to beleeve, that the
soule all while it is contained within this mortall body should live, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
die, when it is departed from it. For, this I see, that the soule quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
these mortall bodies, and giveth life to them, so long as it remaineth
therein. Neither could I ever be brought to thinke, that after the soule is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from this blockish and senselesse body, it shall be it selfe void of sense
and understanding: But when the pure and sincere<note n="*" place="margin">or soule.</note> minde is once departed, then
by all likelihood and reason, it is most wise. After the dissolution of a man,
every thing is seene to returne againe unto its owne kinde, save onely the soule,
which neither present nor absent can be seene.</p>
               <p>Consider moreover, quoth he, that nothing in the world resembleth mans
death neerer than sleepe. But the soule of a man whiles he sleepeth, sheweth
most of all her divinitie, yea and foreseeth future things, being as it seemeth, at
such a time at greatest libertie. Is it so then, as I perswade my selfe it is? doth
the soule quit and forsake the body? In all reverence and honour therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my soule, performe that which I request you to doe. But were it nothing
so, but that the soule as it abideth in the body, so it perisheth with the same,
yet feare yee the Gods who are immortall; who see all things and bee omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
who maintaine and keepe this orderly course of the whole world, so
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19319:116"/>
certaine, perpetuall, infallible and for the grandeur and beauty thereof so inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable.
Feare the Gods I say, that yee may neither commit nor devise any
impietie or injustice. Next unto the Gods, reverence all Mankinde, which in a
continuall succession is perpetuall. For the Gods doe not cover you with
darkenesse, but all your actions must of necessitie be exposed to the eyes of the
world: which, if they be pure and void of iniquitie shall make you powerfull
with all men: but if yee devise and practise to wrong one another, yee shall be
disreputed with all men. For, no man, were he never so well aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cted, can trust
you any longer, when he sees him to receive injury [at your hands] who is
linked most neere in the bond of friendship. If then, this remonstrance of
mine be sufficient to instruct you, in your deportment one to another, it is well:
if not, yet at least wise learne of them who lived before us: for, this is the
best way simply of teaching and instruction. Many parents there have beene
who constantly persisted in love to their children, and many brethren likewise
to their brethren: yea and some of both sorts have plotted the cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one against another. Whether of them therefore yee know to have reaped
more good by that which they have done, if yee make choise of their deeds
and follow their steps, yee shall doe very well. But hereof peradventure I
have said enough. And now my sonnes, as touching my body, when I have
once finished the course of this my life, see yee enshrine it, neither in gold nor
in silver, nor in any thing else, but presently with all speed enterre the same.
For, what is more happie, than to be committed unto the earth, which as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beareth, and as a nource feedeth all things faire and beautifull, all things
good and profitable. I have beene otherwise, at all times a respective lover of
mankinde, and even now me thinks, I have a longing desire to bee partaker of
that, which is so beneficiall unto mankinde. And now verily, my soule seemeth
to faile mee in those parts, wherein by good reason it beginneth to faile all
other men. Therefore if any of you be desirous, either to take me by the right
hand, or to see mine eyes any more, whiles I am ye: alive, let him draw neere
unto mee. But when I am dead once and covered: I charge you my sonnes,
nay, I beseech you in any case, that no man, no not yee your selves preasse to
see my corps. Call the Persians all in generall, yea and mine Allies unto my
Monument, to congratulate, and rejoyce in my behalfe, for that now I shal be in
safetie, and past all evill and paine, whether I remaine with God in heaven, or
become nothing at all. And as many as shall come to performe mine obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies,
use them with that bountie and liberalitie, as is fit to be exhibited in the
solemne funerals of a blessed and happy man; and so dismisse them. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
Remember this last lesson from me. If yee bee beneficiall unto your
friends, yee shall be more able to chastice your foes. Adieu my deare and
welbeloved children, and recommend as much from mee unto your mother.
Likewise my friends all, both present and absent, Farewell. When he had thus
said and raught unto them all his right hand, hee closed his owne eyes and so
changed his life.</p>

               <p>THat the Empire of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was of all the Kingdomes in Asia, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
and most spacious, appeareth by the very testimony of it selfe. For,
bounded it was Eastward with the Red-sea, and North-ward with the
Euxine. In the West <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> confined it: and <hi>Aethiopia</hi> in the South.
Being of so great and large an extent, yet governed it was by the onely counsell
and wisedome of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> And as he honoured and lovingly respected his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
as if they had beene his children: so they againe reverenced him as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
No sooner yeelded he to nature, but straightwaies his very children fell
out and were at variance soone after, great Cities and whole Provinces revolted:
all things went backward and grew worse and worse.</p>
               <p>To verifie these my words: I will begin first with religion. For, thus much
I know, that before-time, the King himselfe and those that were under him, if
they had either sworne unto those, that otherwise had committed never so great
outrages and hainous facts, would precisely keep their oath: or if they had but
given their right hand for assurance of any covenant, would constantly make
the same good. And verily, had they not beene thus resolute in this point, and
gotten such a name therefore; there would not one have trusted them: like as at
this day no man hath any affiance in them considering their impiety is so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:

                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> in
that expedition of his, have beleeved them: whereas presuming so much as they
did, upon that auncient conceit of their fidelity, they yeelded themselves unto
the enemie: and being brought before the King, were made shorter by the heads.
Yea and many of the Barbarians themselves, who undertooke this voiage with
them deceived by faire promises and plighting their troths, some one way, some
another were overthrowne and perished thereby. And yet in these dayes, they
are I assure you in this respect much worse than they were. For, in times past
if a man had either put himselfe into daunger for the King; won a City, subdued
a Nation, or otherwise exploited any brave service for the honour of the King:
these were the men who had honours heaped upon them. But now adayes, if
any like unto <hi>Leomythres</hi> (who leaving his wife and children, his friends children
also as hostages with the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> King, transgressed and brake the greatest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of security that were) doe that which seemeth advantageous onely
for the King: such as they are most highly advanced, and goe away with the
greatest dignity. Which the people of <hi>Asia</hi> seeing, are themselves also fallen all,
to impiety and injustice. For, as the Princes and Rulers be affected, such for the
most part proove the subjects under them. And by this meanes, more godlesse
they are and perfidious now, than heretofore.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the practise of getting money, they are more injurious like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than before-time. For, they apprehend not onely such men as have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
many trespasses, but those also who never yet have done any wrong or
made offence, but contrary to all right and equity extort and wring money
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19319:117"/>
from them perforce. Wherby it is come to passe, that innocent persons thought
to have much wealth, are no lesse affraid than malefactors. And therefore, such
as these are neither willing to deale and commerce with greater persons, nor yet
dare joyne with others to serve in any of the Kings wars. And hereupon, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
warreth against them, may at their pleasure raunge up and downe and
overrun their country without impeachment, or any to make head against them:
partly, by reason of their impiety to Godward, and in part, for their iniquity and
injustice to men. And so, by this meanes, their minds be infected and perverted
every way, farre worse in these dayes than in times past. And thus by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
That they have not that regard of their owne bodies as heretofore, I
will now declare.</p>
               <p>For, whereas in old time, forbidden they were by law, either to spit or to
blow and snit their noses (and plaine it is that they intended not by this law to
spare the excrementi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous humours of the bodie and retaine them, but because
they would have their bodies to be firme and sound by labour and sweating.)
Now a dayes, however the restraint of spitting and snitting be in force still, yet
no man hath any care of exercise and labour. Moreover, provided it was by
order of law among them in those dayes, that they should eate but one meale
a day: whereby they might have the benefit of the whole day besides as well
to doe their businesse as to labour and travaile. And now, it holds still to eate in
deed but once a day: but when they begin to fall to their meat as timely as they
that goe soonest to dinner, they sit by it eating and drinking so long, as they are
wont who latest goe to bed. In like manner, a law there was among them, that
no great<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> pots or flagons should be brought into their feasts and banquets; the
reason was, that by restraint of powring downe over-much drinke, their bodies
and minds both, should be lesse weakened. And verily in these dayes the manner
continueth still o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bringing in none of those [pots.] How beit they handle the
matter so with their liberall drinking, that in lieu of such bringing in, they are
carried forth themselves: namely, when they be so drunke, that they are not able
any longer to stand on their feet, and to goe forth upright. Againe, this was one
custome of the countrey, whiles they were in any journey, neither to eate nor
drinke the while, ne yet to be seene openly by the way, to doe any of those
things which necessarily ensue upon meat and drinke. And surely, at this day
they observe indeed that order precisely, to forbeare such matters: but they
make so small journeyes, that no mervaile it is, if they forbeare also such need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
businesses.</p>
               <p>In old time they used to goe on hunting so often, as that their very hunting
alone was a sufficient exercise both for horse and man. But after that, King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
and his<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> minions, began to set their minds overmuch upon drinking
wine, they neither went themselves to hunt any more as they had done, nor yet
trained others forth to hunting. Nay, they openly envied, yea and hated them as
better men than they, who could abide to take paines, and with their horsemen
went forth a hunting.</p>
               <p>The custome, that their children should be brought up about the Court, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
still (I must needs confesse) at this day: but to learne the feat of riding
and to practise the same, that is quite laid away and extinct: because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
not, where they may come to reputation. And whereas children by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
causes afore-hand pleaded and decided; were thought to learne justice; that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19319:118"/>
fashion is cleane altered and perverted. For they see evidently those to goe
cleare away with any matter, who give most. Furthermore, children in times
past learned the natures and vertues of those simples which spring and grow
out of the earth, thereby to make use of medicines holsome, as also to avoid
what was hurtfull. And now, they seeme verily to teach the same still: but it is
how they may doe most mischiefe thereby. Thus it commeth to passe, that in
no place in the world, there be more killed or miscarry by poysons than there.</p>
               <p>Againe, much more addicted they are now to dainties than in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his daies.
For then, however they tooke to the fine robes and trim apparell of the <hi>Medes,</hi>
yet they used ever the <hi>Persian</hi> discipline and continence: now, they neglect the
paines taking and enduring of travaile which came from the <hi>Persians,</hi> and suffer
it quite to die: but they embrace and retaine still the effeminate wantonnesse of
the <hi>Medes.</hi> And here I am disposed to lay open their delicate life. For, in the
first place, it is not enough to have their beds made soft under them: but their
very beds feet (I would not else) must stand upon tapestry: to the end, forsooth,
that the bare floore might not make resistance, but the carpets somewhat give
backe againe. Of the fine pastry works and baked meats served up to the table,
they have abridged none of the old inventions: but now, they devise still every
day more than other. And even so doe they in other boyled and rosted viands.
For, in both sorts they entertaine those Cooks, that evermore invent new. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
in winter-time, they thinke it not enough, to cover their heads, bodies,
and feet onely: but they have for their hands also and their very fingers ends
furred mittins and shag-glooves. In summer, the shade neither of trees, nor of
rocks and hils will serve their turnes: But within them they devise other bowres
and artificiall shades besides, to coole them. And verily, who can get the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number of<note n="*" place="margin">as Tankards, Bowles, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers and Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</note> drinking cups, they take themselves to bee no small men, but
passing well furnished and adorned. Now in case they come indirectly by them,
and by wrongfull meanes, they never bash at the matter, nor thinke it any shame.
For, injustice and filthy lucre is rise among them, and growne unto an excessive
head. Moreover in former times, it was the manner of the country, that no man
should be seene openly to goe a journey on foot, for no other cause, but that they
might proove most skilfull and expert in horsemanship. But now, what with
saddles and saddle clothes, they hang more furniture on their horsebacks, than
upon their very beds: Neither passe they so much for skilfull riding, as they do
for soft sitting.</p>
               <p>And now to come unto their martiall feats, stands it not to very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that they should come farre short of that which was in old time? whose
manner it was in those dayes, that if they held any land in fee of the King they
should finde horsemen out of it, and those served abroad in the wars. And as for
such as lay in garrison for defence of the countrey the while, if there were any
necessity of warre-service, they had wages allowed them, well and truly paid.
But now adayes, Sergeant-porters and doore-keepers, Pantlers, Bakers, Cooks,
Butlers, Cup-bearers and groomes of the Baines, Sewers to set meats upon
the bourd and to take away, Groomes of the Chamber, for to bring men asleep,
and to waken them againe: neat fellowes to anoint, to paint, to rub, to trim
and tricke up the carkasse, to set every thing about the body, point device by
art and number: all these be they, that the great Magnificoes have made their
men of armes to serve at all assayes, and take horsemens pay. And truely, these
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19319:118"/>
make a goodly shew for number and multitude: but in the warres I assure you
there is no use of them at all. And that appeareth well enough by the events
that ensue thereof. For, yee shall have enemies sooner than friends conversant
in their land. And verily, <hi>Cyrus</hi> when he tooke his horsemen from among the
light skirmishers afarre off, and furnished them with compleat armour and their
horses likewise, giving every one of them a launce in his hand, brought in the
close fight at armes end. But now, neither doe they skirmish lightly and aloofe
with the enemie any more, nor yet joyne and cope together: Semblably the
footmen in these dayes have their light bucklers, their short courtell-axes and
cimiters to serve in the warres and to fight close as they did in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his time:
howbeit even these will not willingly so much as come to buckle at handfight.
Neither use they their hooked chariots in that sort as they were ordained by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
For he advancing and honouring his Chariotiers, made them good souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and had them upon all occasions prest to assaile armed enemies. But the
<hi>Persians</hi> in these dayes, knowing not what they be that are upon the said Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots,
thinke one as good as another, and those that be unpractised, able to equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
the trained. A certaine kind of onset and charge they give, I must needs
say, but before they come among the enemies, either they willingly drop out
of their chariots, or else leap forth of purpose. Whereupon the Chariots and
teemes both, being abandoned of their drivers and rulers, do many times much
more hurt unto their friends, than to their enemies. Certes, they being privy to
themselves, and knowing well enough how slenderly they be appointed for
the warres, withdraw their heads out of the field: neither dare any of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himselfe to battaile, without aide of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> Nay, they know well
enough that they must have <hi>Greeks</hi> in their armie, whensoever they meane either
to make warre one with another, or upon the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>Thus have I performed, as I thinke, that which I purposed and undertooke.
For, I say and avow, that the <hi>Persians</hi> and their Associats, are in these dayes more
irreligious in the worship of the Gods, more unkind and unnaturall to their
kinsfolke, more unjust to others, and for martiall affaires more effeminate than
in former times. To conclude, if there be any man disposed to hold up a side,
and maintaine the contrary to this position that I have set downe, let him but
consider their own deeds and actions, and he shall find that they will testifie on
my behalfe, and verifie my words in the end. <gap reason="foreign">
