            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu may juſtly wonder that I who am a Stranger to you, ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a Specifick Medicine to one whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience can furniſh him with many; but the Reaſon why I do it, is, becauſe your Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101906:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Station in the Colledge renders you the more capable of recommending it to the Practice of other Phyſicians. I confeſs the thing hath been known by Name a long time, but it hath not been brought into ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe; and this was the Fate of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian Bark,</hi> untill we know who made ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull Experiments of it, and brought it into Great Reputation.</p>
            <p>I have in my Travels through ſeveral Parts of the World, made many curious Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the uſe of ſpecifick Remedies, and I have Communicated ſeveral, as ſome at <hi>London</hi> can tell you. I know no more need of Publiſhing my Name, than the Author of <hi>The Whole Duty of Man</hi> had for Not-divulging his. I am ſure my Deſign is not private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but Publick Benefit.</p>
            <p>I hear of very conſiderable Cures that have been wrought at <hi>London</hi> by the Uſe of ſome Spicificks that I have made made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and that encourages me to tell the World of more, in Imitation of the Example of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101906:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great Eſquire <hi>Boyle,</hi> who was my particular Friend.</p>
            <p>The Learned and Curious Sir <hi>John Floyer</hi> at <hi>Litchfield,</hi> hath been wonderful Kind in Communicating many Specificks, and put us in a way to find out the Nature and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Druggs by their taſtes and ſmells; and he ſaith that he doth not queſtion but that the Artificial Jumbles of many Medicines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether will in time be rejected, and every Ingenious Practicer will chiefly make uſe of Simple Medicines, by which his Patient will be more ſuddenly, ſafely and pleaſantly Cured.</p>
            <p>When I call to mind the Practice of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> who wrote their Books and Publiſht their Receipts in the Language of the Countrey where they dwelt, I judge I may well be excuſed from Blame.</p>
            <p>The Specifick that I recommend is the Tincture drawn from the true <hi>Nephrittick Wood,</hi> which comes from <hi>Hyſpaniola</hi>; it may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101906:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be known from the ſpurious ſort by its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating a Blew Sky-coloured Tincture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spring-water, which the other will not do: By its peculiar quality it reſiſts the Petrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Diſpoſition of the Reins and Bladder, it cleanſeth thoſe parts from mucilaginous ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Humours, which are apt to lodge in the Urinary Paſſages, and by its Abſterſive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty it prevents the Coagulation of Sand and Gravel, it dilates and lubrifies the Uretors, and cauſeth an eaſie expulſion of ſmall Stones, and cures a Suppreſſion of Urine and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury; it heals the Excoriation, cauſed by the Acrimony of the Humours, and eaſeth Pain in making Water; it cools the Reins, and mitigates the ſcalding Heat of Urine, and diſſolves the Stone as far as any Medicine is capable of doing it.</p>
            <p>I could give you many ſtrange Examples of great Cures wrought with it: And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly a Woman much afflicted with the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury, with an acute Pain in her Hip, and frequent reaching to Vomit, ſhe took Sixty Drops of the Tincture, Morning, Noon, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101906:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Night, in Ale and White-wine dulcified with Syrup of Marſh-mallows, ſhe voided in a Months time Nine Ounces of Gravel, and thirty ſmall Stones like great Pins-heads, and found great Eaſe.</p>
            <p>A young Gentleman who was ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly wrackt with the Stone that he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to be Cut, but a Friend coming in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to take the Drops of the Tincture drawn out of this Wood in Oyl of Walnuts, and it gave him Relief, and prevented the Return of his Pains, he continu'd it two Months.</p>
            <p>I my ſelf frequently take the Spirit, and ſometimes the Extract, in all my Drink, fifty or ſixty Drops at a time, and find great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: I draw the Spirit and Extract with <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wine.</p>
            <p>An old Man who had frequent ſtopping in his Water, with twitching ſmart Pains, and ſometimes bloody Urine and great ſcalding, was wonderfully eaſed by the uſe of this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101906:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Tincture, taken in Spaw-waters, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Milk ſweeten'd with Honey. It's endleſs to give Inſtances, I therefore take leave to Subſcribe my ſelf</p>
