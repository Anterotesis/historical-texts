            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Rom. XIII. † 1.</bibl>
               <q>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p n="1">1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the higher</hi> [supreme, or super-eminent] <hi>powers,</hi> it is manifest, are <hi>Rulers:</hi> for that the Apostle giving the reason why the Christians must be subject to them, calls them so; saying, <hi>For Rulers are not a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to good works, but to the evil,</hi> V. 3. And that which he adds agrees only to a <hi>person</hi> endued with power or authority, and not at all to <hi>power</hi> or authority in the <hi>abstract, The power is the Minister of God to thee for good, and bears not the sword in vain, and is a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil,</hi> V. 4. And thus we find <hi>powers</hi> signifie in other places of Scripture: as <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 11. <hi>They shall</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43132:4"/>
               <hi>bring you unto the Magistrates and Powers.</hi> Tit. 3. 1. <hi>Put them in mind to be subject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magistrates</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 28.</note> So that to acknowledge authority, whilst we war against our Rulers (which is <hi>Resisting</hi>) is not sufficient to excuse us.</p>
            <p>And the Rulers which the Apostle speaks of, are the <hi>Civil:</hi> those (as you see) that <hi>bear the Sword,</hi> and <hi>execute wrath,</hi> i. e. cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral punishment, which agrees not to the <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore they are particularly those Magistrates which ruled over the <hi>Romans</hi> at this time: <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was the <hi>head</hi> and chief; and the several <hi>Officers</hi> that were <hi>under</hi> him and <hi>appointed</hi> by him. And thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> giving the same Command to the Christian <hi>Iews</hi> that were scattered in several parts of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> (<hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar's</hi> Dominion) expresses it, in his 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. 13, 14. saying, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether it be to the King, as supreme; or unto Governours, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that doe well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Commandment to the Christians under the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment doth extend and belong to <hi>all other</hi> Christians even to the end of the world, under what <hi>sort</hi> of Government soever they are, whether <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy</hi> or <hi>Democracy:</hi> viz. to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the supreme Civil Power, and to all that by that Power are put in Authority. For the reason of the Commandment is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,</hi> which the Apostle gives, namely, that Rulers are <hi>God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, God's Ministers for good to them that doe good, and for wrath to them that doe evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us see what the Commandment doth <hi>mean, Be subject.</hi> A <hi>Commandment</hi> it is, even as it is a Commandment for Servants to obey their Masters, and Children their Parents, and for Wives to be subject to their Husbands: and not a <hi>counsel</hi> or advnce, as if it might be done when we see it <hi>convenient,</hi> and omitted at our <hi>pleasure</hi> according to our discretion without any <hi>sin</hi> against God. For the Apostle tells us v. 5. that <hi>we must Needs be subject,</hi> and that not only <hi>for wrath,</hi> but also <hi>for Conscience-sake:</hi> And again, that <hi>they that resist the power, resist the Ordinance of God,</hi> and that for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>they shall receive to themselves Damnation,</hi> v. 2.</p>
            <p>Now this Commandment doth mean, that we must <hi>obey</hi> the Powers. So we have heard St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself explaining it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Put them in mind to be subject to Principalities and Powers, to Obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</hi> When the thing is <hi>lawfull</hi> which they command, it must he <hi>done.</hi> Upon which account <hi>tribute,</hi> which they enjoyn, must
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43132:4"/>
be <hi>paid</hi> them: this being in no wise contrary to any of God's Laws; insomuch that sometimes we may pay it even to Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. And therefore as the Christians at <hi>Rome</hi> did now pay it, so the Apostle commands them to continue in the same duty: <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>For this cause pay ye tribute.—Render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom.</hi> And he reckons it Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers <hi>due,</hi> for that they are <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 6.</note> 
               <hi>God's Ministers, attending continually upon his service,</hi> government and the ministration of Iustice. Upon which account also we are to <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> them: as he also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the same place, <hi>Render fear to whom fear is due, honour to whom honour.</hi> For neither is this in any wise contrary to the Law of God.</p>
            <p>But then if the <hi>thing</hi> which they command be <hi>sinfull,</hi> we must <hi>refuse it.</hi> As the Apostles themselves have taught us by their own examples: <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 4. 19. &amp; 5. 29.</note> who being commanded by the Rulers of the Iews <hi>to teach no more in the name of Iesus, refused</hi> to obey that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, telling them, that they <hi>ought to obey God rather than men,</hi> and <hi>appealing</hi> unto them whether this was not <hi>right.</hi> So when <hi>Saul</hi> commanded his footmen to <hi>slay the innocent Priests,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 22. 17.</note> they <hi>refused</hi> to doe it, because it was <hi>wicked.</hi> And when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that all should <hi>worship the Golden Image</hi> which he had set up, <hi>Shadrach, Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> told him, <note n="†" place="margin">Dan. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>they would not serve his Gods, nor worship the Image.</hi> And when <hi>Darius</hi> with his Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Governours, Princes, Counsellours and Captains had made a Royal Statute, that <hi>no one should ask any petition of any God or Man, save of Himself, for thirty days,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">C. 6. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Daniel</hi> notwithstanding <hi>pray'd to the Lord as he was wont to doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though the <hi>sinfull thing</hi> may not be <hi>done,</hi> yet the <hi>Rulers</hi> must not be <hi>resisted,</hi> otherwise than by <hi>prayers</hi> and tears, <hi>intreaty</hi> and persuasion, <hi>reasoning</hi> and discourse, <hi>reproof</hi> and admonition: <hi>Arms</hi> must not be taken up against them, and war waged with them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account; but their <hi>penalties</hi> must be submitted to, and their injuries born with <hi>patience, peace</hi> and <hi>meekness.</hi> And thus are they indeed <hi>obeyed,</hi> by <hi>submitting</hi> to them; thus <hi>subjection</hi> is paid them, by <hi>yielding</hi> to their power and authority. As wives are subject to their husbands, children and servants obey, the one their parents, the other their masters, <hi>in all things</hi> (<note n="†" place="margin">Col. 3. 18, 20, 22.</note> as it is commanded them) when what is <hi>lawfull</hi> they <hi>doe</hi> at their command, and <hi>refusing</hi> what is <hi>unlawfull,</hi> they patiently <hi>submit</hi> to their pleasure; and though they <hi>punish</hi> them for their refufal, do not resist with <hi>blows,</hi> and cast off their yoke by <hi>force.</hi> And <hi>thus</hi> to be <hi>subject,</hi> so as not to <hi>resist,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43132:5"/>
is the meaning of our Text. For it immediately follows thus, <hi>Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God: and they that resist,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We must next consider the <hi>Extent</hi> and latitude of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Let every soul be subject.</hi> As the <hi>Iews</hi> say <hi>every soul,</hi> so <hi>we</hi> say <hi>every body:</hi> and the meaning both of them and us is <hi>every man.</hi> Forasmuch then as <hi>every man</hi> is to be subject to the Higher Powers, it is undenialbe that <hi>no one</hi> of what rank and quality so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is <hi>exempt</hi> from their jurisdiction: no <hi>Christian</hi> (for to <hi>such</hi> the Apostle writes) not the greatest <hi>Saint,</hi> not the eminentest <hi>Doctor,</hi> not the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves; who as they gave the Precept to others, so most certainly held <hi>themselves bound</hi> to perform the same. And what can be more manifest than that <hi>one</hi> as well as <hi>other, Clergy</hi> as well as <hi>people,</hi> living in the same Kingdom, are <hi>Subjects</hi> of the same <hi>Secular Powers</hi> there? and being <hi>Subjects,</hi> must be <hi>Subject</hi> to them? St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath determined the case, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13, 14.</note> when he reckons the <hi>King Supreme Governour:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> also, <note n="†" place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> who here calls Rulers that <hi>bear the Sword,</hi> the <hi>Higher Powers. These</hi> he requires <hi>every soul</hi> to be subject to: of these he speaks again so universally, <hi>Whosoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth,</hi> &amp;c. Be he then Priest or Pastor, Cardinal or Kirk-man, Legat or Pope that doth so, he <hi>offendeth,</hi> and incurreth the <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> threatned, <hi>They shall receive to themselves damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus given you an exact account of the Apostle's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, God's Commandment by his Servant: The first thing which I shall consider is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether the Apostle means we should be subject to <hi>evil</hi> Powers, and not resist <hi>such</hi> by force of arms. Here the Seditious and Rebellious always take <hi>shelter,</hi> saying, The Rulers oppress, persecute, govern illegally, command what God forbids, and forbid what God commands. <note n="*" place="margin">Nos non imperium, nec divitias pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

This they will say, and feign as much abuse and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and contrive their story as plausible and seemingly true as their wit can devise: for that otherwise they would be utterly condemned of all men for raising War, which is so great a plague to a Nation, and for resisting honest and good Rulers, which is gross profaneness; neither would they have any hope of gaining the people unto their assistance, nor of obtaining their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, which is spoil and rapine, riches and honour, dominion and greatness, and perhaps revenge of some petty injuries. It ought to

Thou who judgest others, be judge sometimes of thy self; view the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of thy conscience, and who art clearly seen of all, see thy self.—Dost thou wonder that the anger of God increases, for the punishment of men, when that increases daily which is punished?—The truth is this which the Prophet delivers, that God can restrain adversities, but the crimes of sinners are the-cause that he doth not help.<q>Is God's hand (<hi>says he</hi>) weak, that he cannot save? or is his ear heavy, that he cannot hear? But your sins separate betwixt you and God:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43132:12"/>
and because of your iniquities he turneth his face from you, and will not pity.</q>—As if it were a light thing, that your life is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with variety of raging vices, with the iniquity of lamentable crimes, with all bloody rapines, that true Religion is subverted by false superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that God is not sought nor feared at all: ye worry the servants of God with unjust persecutions.— ot by us, but for us do all those things happen which descend from the divine indignation. —In the terrible day of judgment will the wicked say, What doth our pomp and the glory of our riches profit us? all those things are gone as a shadow. Then repentance, sorrow, weeping, praying will be fruitless and avail nothing. Provide therefore for your welfare whilst ye may.—Believe [<hi>convert</hi>] and live, and you who for a time make us sad,
rejoice with us for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus may Prince and People be <hi>happy,</hi> if they will be <hi>holy,</hi> doing their duty each to other, and both to God. But when sin abounds, judgment breaks forth like a <hi>whirl-wind,</hi> we know not how: and that, if it reforms us not in <hi>this</hi> life, in the <hi>other</hi> changes upon us into <hi>eternal</hi> burnings.</p>

But returning in the year 1673, was taken, and kept Prisoner till 1676; when in</hi> December <hi>he was brought to his tryal, and there the Bishop of</hi> Galloway <hi>and the Lord</hi> Halton <hi>deposed, that having asked him, what moved him to make such a bloody attempt, he answered That</hi> he did it because the Arch-bishop was an enemy to the people of God. <hi>In his</hi> Speech <hi>which was found in his pocket at his Execution at</hi> Edenburgh, (Ian. 18. 1676/7) <hi>and whereof he had transcribed several Copies, he thus justifies himself,</hi> I am brought here that I may be a witness for Gods despised truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, who am called to seal the same with my blood. I bless my God that he hath thought me so much worthy to lay down my life in testimony of the Cause of Christ. <hi>In a</hi> Letter <hi>to a Friend thus he writes,</hi> As to Rebellion and Treason (as they term it) I answered to my Lord Chancellor, That it was no Rebellion, but a Duty which every one was bound to have performed in joining with that Party: As to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> I looked upon him to be the main instigator of all the oppression and bloodshed of my brethren. —I prosecuted the Ends of the Covenant, which was and is (in that part) the Overthrow of Prelates and Prelacy. These Murthering Prelates ought to be killed by the avenger of blood when he meeteth them. <hi>And in another</hi> Speech <hi>he hath these words,</hi> Happy shall he be that taketh this Prelatical brood, and dasheth them against the stones. <hi>And yet as bad as this man was, the Fanaticks</hi> owned, justified, honoured <hi>him. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie's</hi> Advocate, <hi>who pursued him, receiving a</hi> threatning Letter, <hi>and the common talk of the Town was, that Mr.</hi> Iames Mitchel's <hi>blood should be</hi> revenged <hi>upon the</hi> whole order. <hi>From the West a private</hi> Message <hi>was sent to the Arch-bishop, to assure him, that if Mr.</hi> Iames <hi>were hanged, another should not fail to</hi> execute his design. <hi>And you shall next see, that they were as good as their word.</hi>

               <q>In the year 1679, <hi>May</hi> 3. the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> as he was riding in his Coach from <hi>Kennoway</hi> to his House, was assaulted betwixt a 11 and 12 a clock in the forenoon by 11 or 12 of these ill-principled men: who wounded the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43132:16"/>
Postilion in the face with a Sword, and stopped the Coach, and fired a Pistol at the Arch-bishop: but that missing him, they called to him by the name of <hi>Dog, Villain, Betrayer of Christ and his Church,</hi> &amp;c. and bad him come out of his Coach <hi>to receive what he deserved for his wickedness against the Kirk of Scotland.</hi> Upon this his Daughter got out of the Coach, and fell on her knees, begging her Father's life: but they regarded neither prayers nor tears, threw her down several times, trampled on her, and wounded her. The Arch-bishop came out of the Coach, and seeing he must die, kneeled down to one of them, and said, <hi>Since you are resolved I must die, spare the life of my child here; and for this, Sir, give me your hand.</hi> And thereupon stretching his hand towards the cruel man, he had for a return a very great <hi>blow</hi> with a Shablè, which almost <hi>cut off</hi> his hand; and the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain re-doubling his stroke, gave him <hi>another</hi> great wound upon the left <hi>eye.</hi> This stroke knocked him down: but getting upon his knees again, he said, <hi>Gentlemen, it is now enough, you have done your work;</hi> and holding up his hands (as well as he could) to heaven, he fervently cryed out, <hi>Lord Iesus; have mercy on my soul, and receive my spirit.</hi> Whilst he was in this posture of devotion, they wounded him in his <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>other</hi> parts of his body, till in a kind of composure he laid down his head upon his arm, saying, <hi>God forgive you, and I forgive you all.</hi> After this they gave him no less than <hi>sixteen</hi> wounds on his <hi>head,</hi> insomuch that it seemed to be all <hi>one wound.</hi> And <hi>pieces</hi> of his scattered skull and brains were some days after found on the ground. Having thus hacked and cleft his head, some of them as they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away thought they heard him groan, which made them go back, and to make sure work, <hi>stir up</hi> his <hi>brains</hi> in the skull with the points of their Swords. Thus he died. <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 63.</note> It was made apparent upon the examining of the Inhabitants of <hi>Magus</hi> upon Oath, that these bloody Assassines, and many others which were strongly presumed to have been Abettors and Contrivers of this Murther, were notorious <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> frequenters of <hi>Field-Conventicles,</hi> and followers of Mr. <hi>Welsh</hi> and other intercommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rebellious <hi>Preachers.</hi>

            <p>Eutactus Philodemius, Origen of Civil Power (<hi>printed</hi> 1649.) p. 32. There is no reason why an office of so great trust as the government of a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43132:21"/>
Kingdom should be Hereditary, in respect of the miserable effects that must ensue.</p>
            <p>Regal Tyranny: (<hi>Printed</hi> 1647.) p. 38. Though the King be the Supreme Officer (which is all and the most he is) yet he is not the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power; for the absolute supreme power is the people in general, made up of every individual; and the legal and formal supreme power is only their Commissioners, their Collective or Representative body chosen by them, and assembled in Parliament. <hi>P.</hi> 43. The House of Lords are mere Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Incroachers, and were never intrusted by the People with any Legislative power; who merely sit by the King's Prerogative, which is a mere shadow, and in truth nothing at all, there being no Law-making power in Himself, but merely and only at the most a Law-executing power; who by his Coronation-Oath is bound to pass and assent to All such Laws as his People or Commons shall chuse. <hi>P.</hi> 57. It is scarce possible to commit that act of Tyranny that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> is not guilty of: and therefore <hi>de jure</hi> he hath absolved all his people from their Allegiance and Obedience to him. <hi>P.</hi> 61. It is lawfull in the sight of God as well as man for a people to withdraw their Obedience to that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, or King, that refuseth to govern them by legal justice; but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth them contrary to the end of the trust reposed in him. <hi>P.</hi> 85. Only the legal Commissioners of the people, commonly called the Commons of <hi>England</hi> have an original and true power to erect judicatures, and not the King, who is not to give a law unto his people, but his people vnto him. <hi>P.</hi> 92. Our House of Peers are no legal Iudicature at all, nor have any true Legislative or Law-making power at all in them, having never in the least derived it from the people, the true Legislators and Fountain of power, from whom only and alone must be fetched all deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power that can be esteemed just.—Up with the pretended power of the Lords by the roots, and let them sit no longer as they do, unless they will put themselves upon the power of their Country, to be freely thereby chosen as their Commissioners to sit in Parliament: for in right all their actions now are unbinding and invalid.</p>
