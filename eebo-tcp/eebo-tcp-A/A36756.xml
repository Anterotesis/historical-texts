            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <l>Y'Are welcome, — and we hope y'are all sharp set,</l>
            <l>Good Appetites excuse a homely Treat;</l>
            <l>This was intended for our selves alone,</l>
            <l>From whom our Masters fear'd no cens'ring frown:</l>
            <l>But aw'd, and dazl'd by your piercing eyes,</l>
            <l>(For, though expected, you like Death surprize)</l>
            <l>They humbly bow, — and beg a kind excuse,</l>
            <l>For straiten'd time, and a disorder'd House;</l>
            <l>Hoping, the want of practice, fitting dress,</l>
            <l>And glorious Scenes, may make our failings less:</l>
            <l>As if defects could purchase good success.</l>
            <l>This might appease an accidental Guest;</l>
            <l>But you'r invited, and expect a Feast:</l>
            <l>Enlarged hopes, and longing looks y'have brought,</l>
            <l>Fine Dances, Songs, and Shew, swell ev'ry thought:</l>
            <l>Such things our Masters meant; but strove so fast</l>
            <l>To win the prize, we fall with too much hast.</l>
            <l>Like eager Gard'ners, that make Nature post</l>
            <l>The Flow'rs to early births, which being forc'd,</l>
            <l>Their sweet perfume and native beautie's lost.</l>
            <l>If we miscarry, let them feel the smart,</l>
            <l>They hardly gave us time to read a Part:</l>
            <l>Yet — if w'are out, — I fear 'twill break my heart. —</l>
            <l>Courage! be gone dull fear, and sullen doubt:</l>
            <l>The Cause! the Cause we fight shall bear us out.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Beauties Triumph,</hi> — Beauty! your joy and care,</l>
            <l>The crown of Peace, and the reward of War.</l>

               <hi>Ladies,</hi> Your int'rest your assistance calls;</l>
            <l>Your Empire's lost if <hi>Beauties Triumph</hi> falls:</l>

               <hi>Epilogue,</hi> spoken by a young Lady.</head>
            <l>LIke cloister'd Nuns with virtuous zeal inspir'd,</l>
            <l>From publick noise, and vicious ease retir'd,</l>
            <l>Here we have all that's by the good admir'd.</l>
            <l>While thus the loosest of our time is spent,</l>
            <l>'Tis advantageous, sweet, and innocent.</l>
            <l>And when our thoughts to serious things are bent,</l>
            <l>One in rich works with lively colours tells</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s Rape, or mourning <hi>Philomels:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Each chast beholder sighs and drops a tear,</l>
            <l>To burn the well-wrought Silk they scarce forbear,</l>
            <l>So sad and moving does the work appear:</l>
            <l>Oh that the Ravisher were here! one cries,</l>
            <l>Thus would I rend the bloudy Tyrant's eyes;</l>
            <l>Then for his crime some harmless Flower dyes,</l>
            <l>Whose falling head, as if indeed 'twere pain'd,</l>
            <l>Sheds dewie tears upon the murth'rers hand.</l>
            <l>Some Hero's praise in sacred Verse kept long,</l>
            <l>Another sings to th'Lute —</l>
            <l>While ev'ry string seems turn'd into a tongue,</l>
            <l>And sends soft ecchoes to the joyfull Song.</l>
            <l>Anothers diff'rent mind more pleasure takes,</l>
            <l>In various forms to mould the painted Wax;</l>
            <l>Such shape, such beauty in each piece is shown,</l>
            <l>Nature sits pale, or blushing on her own,</l>
            <l>To see her pride by curious Art out-done.</l>
            <l>While buzzing Infamy, with venom'd wing,</l>
            <l>Haunts clam'rous pleasures that in Cities ring,</l>
            <l>Thus we enjoy the sweets without the sting.</l>
            <l>When riper age with flatt'ring care's oppress'd,</l>
            <l>Toil'd with false joys, 'twill sadly be confess'd,</l>
            <l>Of all our lives these happy hours were best.</l>
