         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in your Lordſhip, (upon Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s
Motion) ſo ſpeedily and effectually to Addreſs
your ſelf to his Majeſty for a Reprieve of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Diſpoſed of as ſhall ſeem beſt to your Lordſhips great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
If it be thought uſeful, (as I hope it may be a loud
Caveat againſt bold and daring Impiety) I humbly deſire it
may not <hi>ſteal</hi> abroad, but take along with it the <hi>Honour</hi>
as well as <hi>authority</hi> of your Lordſhip's <hi>Imprimatur.</hi> That
Learned and Charitable Perſon which Preſents it to your

what I have now Preſented to your Honour is ſincerely the

I hope they may in ſome meaſure contribute to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

which I moſt humbly and heartily begg. God continue
your Honour to be what you are, as great an Ornament to

            <p>THAT they who have ſeen the former ill Example of my
Life and do now look on this diſmal Concluſion of it,
might not be Spectators diſappointed; as I had great
Reaſon ſo I had a good Occaſion to encourage me in
this following Account.</p>
            <p>That Great God that brings Good out of Evil, ſo ordered it,
that that very Evening after my Condemnation, I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a very ſeaſonable Viſit from a<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Lloyd.</hi>
               </note> Reverend Perſon,
Indeed the Viſit was but ſhort, and our Diſcourſe alſo interrupted
with Matter not ſo pertinent to that Lamentable Occaſion, ſo that
(being under great Diſturbance) I could make little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it; but as I lay on my Bed that Night, about one or
two of the clock, it came into my thoughts again; and upon
the ſearch of my Memory, I recollected two things, which, in
Anſwer to my earneſt Requeſt for his Aſſiſtance, that Worthy
Perſon had directed me to. The firſt was, to Glorifie God:
The other, as a means to promote that Chief End, to wipe off
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100636:4"/>
all I could of the Scandal and Reproach which my Vicious Life
and Ignominious Death reflected upon my Function; and both
theſe, He told me, could not be more Effectually performed,
than by a full Confeſſion of my manifold Enormities. I then
reſolved upon it, and as ſoon as I could procure Pen and Paper,
ſet about it; being willing with all my Heart to Juſtifie the Holy
and Righteous God, and all I can to Vindicate that Reverend
Employment from unjuſt Aſperſions, though it redounds never ſo
much to my own Shame and Reproach: and cannot otherwiſe be
imputed to my Profeſſion, but as the Effect of great Ignorance of,
or great Malignity againſt Canons and Conſtitutions ſo Regular
and Orderly in every Circumſtance, ſuch as ſtrictly oblige to great
Circumſpection and Exact Walking; from which Excellent Rules
I wretchedly departed, as appears by the following Audit of my
Life and Actions. I had made no conſiderable Progreſs in that
Work, but I found my ſelf interrupted by that Conſideration,
That God would not Approve or Licenſe <hi>David's</hi> Intention of
Building him a Temple to Glorifie his Name in, becauſe his hands
had been too deeply concerned in Blood. 'Twas of no Difficult,
but of very diſcouraging Application; but whether this were a
Deſign of Satan, or a plot of my own Corruption, or a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of both, I will not ſtand to Examine. The Advice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Able Perſon ſo Encouraged me, and baffled the Objection,
that it vaniſhed of it ſelf. That removed, I conſidered, that
being now ſummoned to a ſpeedy Appearance before the Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and moſt Dreadful Tribunal of the Juſt and Righteous Judge of
all the Earth, there to Anſwer for thoſe many and heinous
Sins, viſible in my Vicious and Ill-led Life; I hold my ſelf obliged
to enter into a narrow Search, and a very cloſe Inſpection of my
Heart and all my Wayes. And though my Crimes be ſo Crying
and Publick, the Aggravations of them ſuch as make them ſ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſinful, that the ſhame of them doth cover me, my Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
for them, and the juſt Reward due to them here on my Body,
hereafter on my Soul, in the more dreadful and terrible Miſeries
of Eternal and unquenchable Burnings, that theſe Sins muſt needs
draw upon me, if the hand of Infinite Mercy does not ſnatch me
as a brand out of the Flame; though, I ſay, theſe General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
have almoſt diſtracted my Thoughts, yet I cannot find
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100636:4"/>
any reſt till I have made a more diligent Scrutiny, a more diſtinct
and particular diſcovery of all that Wickedneſs that was damm'd
up in my Heart, as the Spring and Fountain; and burſt out
thence into ſuch Rapid and impetuous Streams of Prophaneneſs in
my Life.</p>
            <p>Such were my Irregularities, that I have juſt Cauſe, and had
long ago reaſon to ſmart under the ſeverity of<hi> David</hi>'s<hi> Reproof</hi>or rather of<hi> David's </hi>God: So the words run,<hi> Pſal. 50. 16. But
unto the wicked, ſaith God, What haſt thou to do to declare my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
or that thou ſhould'ſt take my Covenant into thy mouth, ſeeing
thou hateſt Inſtruction, and caſteſt my words behind thee, and haſt
been partaker with Adulterers: </hi>but then,<hi> Conſuetudo peccandi tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebat
ſenſum peccati. </hi>I was of proof againſt the ſtroaks of Divine
Comminations.</p>
            <p>But now that my Sins have found me out, and Gods Juſtice has
overtaken and arreſted me, ſo that I am to be a Spectacle to the
World, I may be heard to publiſh my Sin, and leave this Warning
behind me; that <hi>all that ſhall hear or ſee it, may fear, and do no more ſo
Wickedly:</hi> And in particular, that they who by my ill Life have
been led to ill thoughts of that Holy Profeſſion and Calling ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured,
or of that pure Church of which I was an unworthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and a more unworthy Teacher; may no more blaſpheme the
Function of the Miniſtry, the Chriſtian Faith, or the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> but be rather ſtruck with Horror at my baſe Apoſtacy
and Impiety, and that by my Example <hi>He that ſtands may take heed
leſt he fall,</hi> and ſuch as are fallen may be moved to <hi>Remember their
firſt Love and doe their firſt Workes;</hi> leſt the like Horrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
purſue and overtake them.</p>
            <p>Let the Circumſtances of my Condition add weight to my
Words; Dying men have no Temptation to warp them from
Sincerity, they cannot then be ſuſpected either to Lye or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:
And though my former preaching was blaſted by my
Scandalous Living, and could not be of any Worth or Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
yet theſe my laſt Words, together with my ſad Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will (I hope,) ſo Affect all Perſons, as to engage their Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of what I ſay.</p>
            <p>I confeſs then, to Gods Glory and my own Shame, that
the Hand of Heaven had been exceeding bountiful to me; that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100636:5"/>
great God that filleth with his Bleſſing every living thing, had
loaded me with Benefits; <hi>of his Fulneſs I received Grace for
Grace, John</hi> 1. 16. that is <hi>Copia &amp; Abundantia Gratiae,</hi> he had
given me all things richly to enjoy; I had no Reaſon to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
as if my Portion had been ſparing and penurious, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Temporals or Spirituals.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I had my Birth and Education not amongſt them that
are Aliens from the Common wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and Strangers
to the Covenant of Promiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the Pale of the Church,
and not in a Church ſtuffed with Error and Superſtition, but
in a Church ſo refined and reformed, that it is become the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
upon Earth. A Church that teacheth no other Doctrine
but what Chriſt and his Apoſtles delivered, derives none of
its Principles from the puddled Fountain of vain and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Tradition, but <hi>a ſure Word of Prophecy</hi> is that Spring that
ſends forth all her Doctrines; a Church that gives no Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to Sin, nor Countenance to ſuch vicious Perſons as
(Alas!) I have been; all her Articles, all the Parts of her Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
all her Cannons and Conſtitutions are Pure and Holy; and
ſuch, as all they that ſincerely obſerve them ſhall certainly be ſaved.
In this Church I lived, though not according to its Rules; and in
this by Gods Aſſiſtance I ſhall dye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But this was not all, God by the outward Miniſtration of
his Word and the inward Operation of his Spirit wrought ſo on my
Heart, that for ſome time his Fear was before my Eyes, ſo that I
walked tenderly, and endeavoured to keep my Conſcience void
of Offence, towards God and towards Man; I ſerved him in
Secret, and Studyed to glorifie him in my whole Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In this Path I walked when I was dedicated more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to his Service, and by Impoſition of Epiſcopal hands
was in Anti-Epiſcopal times, ordained a Miniſter of his Holy
Goſpel. This ſhould have been my Crown, and my Joy, but is
now my Shame and Reproach, that I knew God, and was
<hi>an Inſtructor of the Fooliſh, and a Teacher of the Simple,</hi> to me
therefore it may be ſaid, <hi>Thou who teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not
thy ſelf? Thou that ſayeſt a man ſhould not commit Adultery, doeſt thou
commit Adultery?</hi>

3. God alſo bleſſed me with competent abilities for the diſcharge of
that Function, ſo that had I proſecuted my ſtudies with that induſtry
and diligence as I did other vanities, I might have attained to greater
improvements of my own and others underſtandings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God provided plentifully for me; by the favour of a noble and
an honourable Patron I was ſetled very comfortably as to all the
concerns of humane life, <hi>My lot was fallen in a very fair ground, yea I
had a goodly heritage;</hi> my portion was ſo far from being ſcanty, that
I had enough and to ſpare, and (till of late) I was beloved of my
Pariſhioners, and reſpected in my Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſame bountiful Providence bleſſed me with as worthy Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
a very faithful affectionate Wife, tender of my perſon, careful
and induſtrious about my affairs, one that had a very good right to
<hi>Solomons</hi> Character, <hi>Prov.</hi> ult. One that bleſſed me with four ſweet
Children, and brought me within the reach of that promiſe, <hi>Like a
fruitful vine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in all reſpects God dealt graciouſly with me, ſo that I was
happy as any of my Neighbours; and now how much have I to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for, who had receiv'd ſo many Talents, but inſtead of employing
them in my Maſters ſervice, did not ſo much <hi>as lay them up in a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,</hi>
but like a prodigal child <hi>waſted all this in riotous living!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I come to the laſt and worſt of my condition; wherein
without any favour or partiality to my ſelf, I ſhall make a diſcovery
of my ſhame, and expoſe my vicious practices to the eye of the Sun.</p>
            <p>That tenderneſs that was on my Conſcience was not long-liv'd; my
own corruptions, with the Devils temptations, ſoon overcame it:
then returned the Devil attended with ſeven more worſe than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into my ſwept and garniſhed ſoul. An unclean, a filthy Devil he
was. Then I violated my Baptiſmal Vows, and my Ordination En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
and the Faith of Wedlock, and delivered my ſelf <hi>to work
all uncleanneſs with greedineſs;</hi> I had <hi>eyes full of adultery, that could
not ceaſe from ſin.</hi> The Devil had prepared for me a ſad companion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100636:6"/>
and partner in my debaucheries; ſhe was eaſily tempted by me,
and proved afterward a conſtant temptation to me, and has
been the great occaſion of this diſmal concluſion of our wretched
courſe of life. This being ſo remarkably the ſin of this preſent Age,
I will enlarge a little, to conjure all Married perſons to keep that
<hi>Bed undefiled.</hi> When that Faith is once broken, the comforts of the
married life quickly expire and come to an end: nor is there any
ſtop; but ſuch perſons ſoon paſs over all the ſtages of ſin; they run
from one wickedneſs to another, till at laſt they ruin both ſoul and
body. Open your eyes therefore, and not only look, but contemplate
upon theſe dreadful and tragick inſtances, oh <hi>Adulterers</hi> and <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes,</hi>
and be not enſnared with a Whores charms; truſt not to her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
though confirmed with her Oaths, and Execrations, and Tears;
they lead on to all manner of ſin; they will waſte your Eſtate, divide
your Family, ruin your Health, deſtroy your Soul; and if ever you
need her friendſhip, ſhe will moſt perfidiouſly betray you.</p>
            <p>But on no ſort of men ſhall the judgments of God more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall, than on the Hypocrites, who think either to hide, or perhaps
to gild over their abominations, ſo as to make the moſt monſtrous
and deformed of their luſts and vices, peeping under the vizor and
mask of Religion, look to deluded eyes with the beauty and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of real virtues.</p>
            <p>I thought my ſin well ſecured under the protection of one of
theſe; I vainly fancied it was done in ſecret, and that it ſhould never
be brought to light; but I was deceived: the ſcandal of it became ſo
publick, that my Right Reverend Dioceſan the preſent Lord Biſhop
of <hi>Hereford,</hi> came to the knowledg of it, reproved and admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me for it, and ordered his Court to take cognizance of it. It
burſt out with that violence, like water long dammed up, that all
took notice of it; the love of my friends, the malice of my enemies
alarm'd me with it; and what I thought to be an <hi>Arcanum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
my partner and my ſelf, is now become <hi>Vox populi;</hi> the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
rings and ecchoes again with it. To this I oppoſed my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
denials, and thoſe confirmed with Oaths and Execrations, which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100636:6"/>
I too frequently uſed for my own purgation. I ſtood alſo upon points
and forms of Law, which I thought would have born me out.</p>
            <p>But all this while, though a very ſlave to my luſt, and in abſolute
vaſſalage to my fleſh, yet I briskly receiv'd the aſſaults of all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
my impious practices, and with that ſucceſs, that I promiſed
my ſelf as complete a conqueſt over them, as I had obtained over
my own Conſcience, whoſe accuſations I had almoſt perfectly ſtifled,
ſo that it made but few and very feeble Attempts upon
me.</p>
            <p>Once indeed it charged me very furiouſly; and having the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a great fit of ſickneſs, it made ſuch aſſaults upon me, that ſin
had like to have loſt its hold, for I was driven into great fears, and
deep apprehenſions, (Oh that I had ſtill continued ſuch a Convert!)
thoſe fears extorted confeſſions, the confeſſions begat vows and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;
but wo is me, they all proved abortive, for I ſoon returned to
my vomit, and the health of my body renewed the diſeaſe of my ſoul;
the tyrant Sin ſoon recovers its dominion, and ever ſince Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
has been kept under hatches. And to palliate and hide my ſin
the more, I ſtudied to be more elaborate and zealous in my Preaching,
to the great ſatisfaction of my Hearers; only I ſeldom medled with,
or but very tenderly touched my own beloved ſin; I went about all
the parts of my Miniſterial duty ſo carefully, and diſcharged them
with ſuch approbation, that the judgments of many charitable and
well-meaning perſons not only acquitted me of the vices I ſtood char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with, but I deluded their good opinion into ſome thoughts of
my innocency and virtue.</p>
            <p>As in the caſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the fowls of the air fell on the carka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the beaſts that were offered in ſacrifice; ſo unclean and vicious
thoughts haunted all my duties and performances; only with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<hi>Abraham</hi> drove away thoſe, but theſe I fed and entertained ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
without the leaſt diſturbance to my Conſcience. Indeed at the
Sacrament ſome fears would ariſe, and the conſideration of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
execution of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> whereby they became mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of Divine vengeance in the very place where they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their ſin, would ſometimes arreſt my confidence, and fill me with
apprehenſions leſt ſome like judicial proceeding ſhould be ſerved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me alſo, for daring to preſent my falſe fires upon Gods Altar,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100636:7"/>
which engaged me in ſome ſhort liv'd reſtraints, that ſeldom exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two or three days; by theſe arts I built me a houſe without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
I procured to my ſelf ſome falſe quiet, and ſo deceived my
ſelf as well as others; for now that the ſtorms and tempeſts, the winds
and floods of affliction beat againſt it, I am very ſenſible how it
ſhakes and is ready to fall on my head, now I have moſt need of ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and protection. Not that I deſpair, that I ſhall yet through the
Grace and mercy of God, and thoſe excellent aſſiſtances he hath ſent
me, ſtick to the Rock of my Salvation. 'Tis of dreadful conſideration
(I know) what the Scripture ſays of the <hi>Hypocrites portion.</hi> But now
God hath taken off the mask, I can't be conſidered under that notion,
an open ſinner, a very great and hainous one is my Character;
and I am ſure Chriſt came to call ſuch to repentance.</p>
            <p>Although I never grew to that proficiency in ſinning, as to be
of the Head-form, and to herd my ſelf amongſt them that ſay,
There is no God, no Judgment to come; yet I muſt confeſs I had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
if not utterly laid aſide the thoughts of thoſe things; and
all my care and contrivance was how to hide my ſin from the eyes
of man. 'Tis my wonder now, though then I thought not of it,
how I ſhould ſo baffle and beſot my Reaſon and Underſtanding, as
well as Conſcience, and run ſo counter to what I demonſtrated
to, and inculcated on my Neighbours in a Diſcourſe on <hi>Eccleſ. 11.
9.</hi> where I conſidered and argued, and at laſt concluded in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the neceſſity of Judgment; and in the cloſe ſhewing the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of the Judg, I inſiſted ſufficiently for that occaſion upon
his Omnipreſence and Omniſcience; and that he does commonly
make ſignal diſcoveries, even in this life bring to light our cloſeſt
contrivances; and yet the impreſſions of that quickly wore out
of my own memory. But I find, and (in my inſtance) you may
read, <hi>That nothing is ſo ſecret but ſhall be revealed: and what is
done in cloſets, ſhall be publiſhed upon the houſe-top. Be not deceived
therefore, God is not mocked.</hi> He will not ſuffer ſin to lye always
concealed, but will bring to light the hidden things of diſhoneſty;
and when once ſin is detected, he will much leſs indemnifie it, and
ſuffer it to go unpuniſhed; what though the world commend
you, if your own Conſcience condemn you; and God who is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100636:7"/>
than your Conſcience knoweth all things. <hi>Whither ſhall I fly
from his preſence? Who when I ſaid the darkneſs ſhall cover me,
made the darkneſs to be light about me, for the darkneſs and the light
are both alike to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now arrived at the height, and by many lower ſteps
mounted even to the top of impiety, to which by a long courſe
of many Adulteries I have been fitting my ſelf: ſo ſucceſsfully
have I fought the battels of this helliſh Commander, that now
he thinks me courageous enough to be led into a more bloody
field. Having by many former repeated acts, arrived at laſt
to a habit in ſinning, my Conſcience became ſo ſeared and paſt
feeling, that I was not afraid to commit this horrid Murther,
for which the Law has ſo juſtly judged me; a crime of a
crimſon complexion, of a ſcarlet tincture; a crime that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bids defyance to God and Religion, but the very Dictates
and Principles of Nature and Humanity, would abhor and even
ſtartle at the ſuggeſtion to it; a crime indeed not to be
thought on without horrour; ſo formidable and affrighting,
that abſtracted from its aggravating-circumſtances, it required
a conſcience of full proof in Satans ſervice to attempt it. To
deſtroy an innocent Babe, had cruelty enough in it; but to offer
violence to the fruit of ones own body, was ſuch a monſtrous
piece of barbarity, as admits not of a parallel. I cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
another inſtance. God grant the Repentance may bear ſome
proportion to the vaſt dimenſions of the ſin.</p>
            <p>When I firſt entred on this diſſolute courſe of life, if any
body could have ſuggeſted to me where it would have ended,
I ſhould certainly have anſwered with the <hi>Syrian, Am I a dog
that I ſhould do this!</hi> yet I am the Dog that did it. Sin in
its minority is eaſily oppoſed; at firſt to reſiſt it, requires not
ſo much labour; but there is no withſtanding when it has
attained to maturity: the heights of wickedneſs appear ſo
monſtrous at a diſtance to one that is but newly entering
upon it, that he flatters himſelf he ſhall never come thither;
but after long continuance in it, and ſuppreſſing many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100636:8"/>
violating our Vows and Reſolutions, after many Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to ſhift off the imputation, apologies to excuſe or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
it, Oaths and Execrations to deny it, a man becomes
ſtrangely altered; he is not what he was, but is inſenſibly
brought more and more into the ſnare of the Devil, who leads
him captive at his pleaſure; and one ſin draws on another,
and each of a more deformed production than another. Like
the Serpents of <hi>Africa,</hi> who by their promiſcuous Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have engendered ſuch ſtrange and ugly Monſters as Nature
never intended: Whoſo allows and licenſes himſelf in the
practice of any one ſin, though he think it never ſo ſmall, that
man involves himſelf in a fatal kind of neceſſity to admit of
a train to attend and ſupport it. Try not thy ſelf, but truſt
my words, who (with ſorrow confeſs) I find the Experiment
to be true. And if thou art under any temptation to drive
a trade in ſin, though never ſo ſmall, and haſt made ſome
ventures already, and perhaps haſt receiv'd ſome returns of
profit or pleaſure, Oh! conſider and learn from me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
what a horrible wrack and devaſtation it will bring
upon thee at the laſt; Oh remember the precious Soul is
aboard the Veſſel; and if the tempeſtuous wrath of God, and
the Hurricanes of his ſevere but righteous Judgments ſhould
overtake and ſink thee, then would it appear to thee how
great thy folly was, and how irreparable thy loſs; conſider
the pleaſures of ſin are but for a ſeaſon, and thoſe in low
degrees; hazzard not therefore for them a fulneſs of joy, and
thoſe pleaſures that are for evermore; reſiſt the firſt beginnings,
cruſh the Cockatrice.—Every ſtep thou makeſt in ſin, brings
thee in greater danger; repentance may be denied, or come
too late. Nor ought any man to expect that when he hath
yielded himſelf up to the power of his luſts, it may not end
as infamouſly and miſerably as mine has now done.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have gone; and truly here I thought to have
ſtopt; but my Priſon-walls, how cloſe ſoever, cannot keep out
the Report, That I am repreſented in this City, where for many
years I have been a ſtranger, under no better notion than that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100636:8"/>
of a common Drunkard; a ſoul and ſcandalous charge,
which (as all other imputations) admits of a deep dye from
my perſon and profeſſion; and as it makes way for all other
ſins to which the Devils temptations ſhall prompt our forward
natures, is a vice of pernicious conſequence. But how far I am
concerned, is not time now to conceal.</p>
            <p>I remember the time, and I believe 'tis not forgot in my
late Neighbourhood, when I had a very competent ſhare of
temperance and ſobriety; I can truly atteſt, that an Alehouſe
or a Tavern had none, or but a very little of my cuſtome:
If at any time my occaſions invited me to them, or their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
urged me, I went not in without reluctancy, I thought
not them places for me; therefore while I ſtay'd, I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie,
and I haſtned my departure: and this was my practice
for ſeveral years. He that conſiders my circumſtances, can't
in charity ſuſpect I need Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>But alas! I too well remember the time, and I can give
but too good an account of the occaſion of my fall (in any
degree) into a ſin ſo contrary to my nature; I the rather
reflect on it, and I wiſh I may do it with a proportionable
ſorrow, becauſe it was the Child of what was too much the
ſin of my nature, Luſt and Uncleanneſs; theſe involved me in
quarrels and contentions; I had ſuits depending both in the
Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Courts; and to ſupport the credit and
intereſt of the Cauſes, I ſpent I confeſs, too much of my time,
too much of my Money in publick Houſes, to treat the
friends and favourers of the Suits, eſpecially thoſe whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
it was to promote and continue them; there I ſtaid
long, and drank to intemperance; and this I came to do
about two or three years ſince; but I have examined and
humbled my ſelf, and I thank God, do not find my ſelf
burdened with any extraordinary guilt upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>Let not therefore the people by their unjuſt detentions of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100636:9"/>
dues, force their Miniſters to legal ſeverities upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
what is due, part with willingly, and let it not be
wrung out by Suits and Law-contentions; I can't certainly
(in theſe circumſtances) be ſuſpected of any ſelfiſh deſign to
promote my own intereſt in any pleadings of this nature; I
have received my laſt, I expect no more; 'Twill be their
advantage therefore, not mine, to admit of theſe perſwaſions;
you can't tell what influences you loſe, what inconveniences
you incur by any ſuch injuſtice, I will leave it to your own
collection, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10, 11. Beſides a blaſt upon the
Eſtate, it leaves a blot upon the Name; ſuch people as ſtrive
with the Prieſt, being by the Prophet ſtiled the worſt of men,
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 4. But as to the people, whether they will hear, or
whether they will forbear, I have done my duty in leaving
this Writing behind me.</p>
            <p>Let it not be thought preſumption by the Clergy, in one who
in his life-time had too many experiences of the ill effects and
inauſpicious conſequences of ſuch differences, now at his death to
leave his advice againſt them; you know where they begin,
but you can't tell either where or when they will end.
They are fires which a ſmall matter kindles, but commonly
improve themſelves into ſuch a flame, as a whole Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
affords not water enough to extinguiſh, and ſometimes
are not quenched till they conſume to aſhes the ſubjects that
feed them: Not to reckon up all the miſchiefs it does, there
is too much in this one, the hindrance of the ſucceſs of your
Miniſtry. As you will be tempted to Preach to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of your Cauſe, ſo the people will receive all your duties
with prejudice; and while you quarrel about the Tythe, the
Devil takes the advantage to ruin thoſe ſouls of which you
muſt give a ſevere account. The ſecuring or regaining of the
Churches Rights, was the anſwer wherewith I ſtopped the
mouths of all objections: But now I find to my ſorrow, that
the gaining of ſouls, the rights of Chriſt, which he purchaſed
with his own blood, is upon no account to be neglected or
prejudiced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100636:9"/>
Thus far have I gone, and in all probability much farther
had I proceeded, if my merciful God, by a ſtrong and irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible
providence, had not ſtood in the way and reſiſted me;
for nothing leſs would conquer my ſtubborn and maſterleſs
Nature. As I deſire to ſubmit to it with ſilence and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo through the aid of his grace, I hope to improve it
to his Glory, and to ſuch ſpiritual advantages for my ſelf, as
will adminiſter great cauſe of eternal gratitude and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p>Now what more can I ſay? I am become the reproach of
men; all that ſee or hear of me, either <hi>ſhoot out the
lip,</hi> or <hi>ſhake the head at me:</hi> they either inſult upon my fall,
or are much troubled at it; for no body can be indifferent upon
this occaſion.</p>
            <p>You workers of iniquity, be afraid of the judgments of God,
and take no advantages or encouragements from my fearful
backſliding, but rather tremble at it. Let this my Confeſſion
reach your Conſciences; believe it, Religion is true, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of ſin are the moſt inſupportable things even in this world;
but how much more ſhall they be ſo in that blackneſs of
darkneſs for evermore. If you felt thoſe agonies I have been
under, that Raok I have been on, you would certainly loath
the pleaſures of ſin, and abhor the thoughts of it. Pray credit
my experience. To be brought to the Bar of an Earthly
Tribunal, there to be Arraigned for the precious life, before
a Judge that will not ſpare thee; to hear thy Jury find thee
Guilty, and thereupon the Judge proceed to Sentence againſt
thee: Theſe are affrighting and amazing Conſiderations. But
I am able to give you aſſurance, that theſe are (by vaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees)
inferiour to that conſternation that ſeizes the guilty Soul,
in conſideration of its ſudden ſummons to appear before the
Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100636:10"/>
Think not the worſe of Religion, or of this Church, or of the
Miniſtry, for what I have done. Chriſt cloſe twelve, and one
of them was a Devil. Be not hardned in ſin by what you
have heard of me, but be terrified rather by what is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
me.</p>
            <p>And for ſuch as have not known theſe depths of Satan, yet
are under temptations, and make light of ſome ſins, eſpecially
the too too faſhionable ſin of Uncleanneſs, ſtay in time, as you
love your Souls; delude not your ſelves with theſe vain
thoughts and argumentations, I will onely go ſo far in ſin, to
ſuch a ſtage in wickedneſs, and no farther; by theſe ſtairs am I
come up to this dreadful height, that it amazes my thoughts
to look down the fearful precipice I ſtood upon. When once
men have forſaken God, and caſt his fear behind their backs,
there is no force can keep ſuch from running into exceſſes of
riot. Truſt not therefore to your ſelves, but by me learn, that
you who do forſake God, may be forſaken of him, and
delivered up to the ſnares of a whoriſh woman, out of which,
all your ſtrength ſhall not diſintangle you; and there is no
wickedneſs of ſo black and ſwarthy a complexion, but ſuch a
man is capable of committing it. Had you but a proſpect of
the ſlavery, or would be but perſuaded of the thraldom of that
condition, and convinced, with what labour, and care, and
diligence they run on the Devils errand, and do his drudgery,
filling every corner of their life with trouble and anxieties,
and that attended on with extreme hazard and danger, which
(as in my caſe) moſt commonly ends too in utter and irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ruine; and then burſts out the filth and ſhame that was
hitherto concealed, with that ſtrength, as is noiſom and
offenſive to all men. Certainly theſe Conſiderations but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
adverted to, eſpecially when proved by ſuch dreadful
and lamentable inſtances, would leave ſome impreſſions, and
contribute towards a reformation.</p>
            <p>And as for you that tremble at the judgments of God,
while you ſtand, take heed leſt you fall. Give diligence to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100636:10"/>
make your Calling and Election ſure: Work out your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with fear and trembling; take heed and beware of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from God, and of ſlacking in, much more of an utter
ſlighting and rejection of Religious duties; for ſuch an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy
is often attended with ſome ſtrange deſertion. God had
done ſo well for me, that it might have been juſtly ſaid,
What more could have been done for him? and you have
heard how in all circumſtances. I lay in the Sunſhine of his
favour, being repleniſhed with Divine bleſſings. I could
have ſaid with the Prophet,<note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 2.</note> 
               <hi>He maketh me to lie down in

too rank and ſurfeiting. <note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note>
               <hi>Jeſuron-like, I waxed fat, and

inculcated upon others,<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 11, 12. &amp; 8. 10, 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> his caution to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> I
degenerated into <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin; inſtead of acknowledging, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
God my Saviour, and my mind becoming earthly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,
I lightly eſteemed the Rock of my ſalvation: Therefore
he in his moſt juſt judgment delivered me up to the luſts of
my own heart. And you ſee what a courſe I have run, and
where it ended. You therefore that know his name, dread his
judgments, walk humbly before him, and <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 6.</note>
               <hi>in all your ways ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him,</hi> not <hi>truſting your own underſtanding,</hi> or your
own hearts, with the government and direction of your ways.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of perſons I ſhall humbly preſume
to leave a warning for: Not that I think my ſelf able to
teach, or inſtruct their underſtandings; but the ſad circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of my preſent condition encourage my hope, I may
have a perſwading influence upon them, that what they

A deep meaſure of Repentance, a greater proportion of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

            <p>The day after my Sentence there came to viſit the Priſoners
one Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Ordinary of <hi>Newgate.</hi> He was pleaſed
to tell me (but in Private) that he obſerved me at my Tryal
Gazing about the Court and the Galleries, where Sate ſeveral
Gentlewomen. I confeſs I was formerly too apt to delight in
ſuch ſights, and let in abundance of Sin at thoſe windows of
my Soul; but at that time I had other thoughts and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
the cauſe of that diverſion was to ſpy out ſome Witneſſes
I thought Material, which though they were in Court I could
not find, and ſo loſt their Evidence; This ('tis very probable)
may have been the obſervation of others as well as Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi>
therefore I inſert this juſt Apology.</p>
            <p>My Partner in the Guilt and Tryal, though not in the
Condemnation, was pleaſed to load me with ſeveral Calumnies.
I will only Note thoſe that the Court inſiſted on, and I hear
are yet diſcourſed to my prejudice in the City.</p>
            <p>Firſt it was Alledged that ſhe was committed to my Charge
and Government by her Father in her Minority and Childhood.
This Report is ſo generally ſpread, and indeed ſounds ſo ill, that
ſeveral ſince my Tryal have diſcourſed it as a great Aggravation;
to commit ſo foul a thing againſt ſo Great a Truſt, and ſome
have repaired to me for Satisfaction; to whom I then gave as
I do now the World this Account, That Her Father was a
Gentleman whom I never ſaw, or had the leaſt Intercourſe
with</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100636:13"/>
There are two more Accuſations, which I would not ſo much
as name, but that I found them the only Ingredients that
Imbittered my Cup both at my Trial, and at my Sentence; The
one was, That I ſhould attempt and endeavour to vitiate her at
Nine years old. The other, That I had for that purpoſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her Judgment, and miſinformed her Conſcience to believe
Polygamy lawful: Impeachments highly Criminal againſt the Law
of God, and (as I am told) Capital againſt the Laws of Man; I
confeſs I have Sins that exceed them, yet I never was guilty of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe; and in the midſt of abundance of Guilt, I find a
little Comfort in this, That I never proſtituted the Word, or any
Ordinance of God to ſerve the turn of Luſts.</p>
            <p>There is ſome offence taken, as I hear, at my Charging her with
what ſhe denied at our Trial, ſhe did indeed ſay, That ſhe knew
<hi>Nothing of the Fact,</hi> for which we were Queſtioned, which ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
by Arguments that could not modeſtly be ſpoken in
that place, without ſuch unſavoury and noiſom demonſtrations:
I affirm, Upon the word of a dying Man, That both her Eyes did
ſee, and her Hands did Act in all that was done: I am dead in
Law, and I know my ſayings are no Evidence againſt her; but
the next time we meet at the Bar, which we ſhall infallibly do, and
two thouſand Witneſſes ſhall be produced againſt us, that is, Her
Conſcience and Mine, theſe things will be found to be true; and
as ſuch I aſſert them, as I ſhall ſuddenly anſwer it before the All-ſeeing
and Heart-ſearching God. Thus I have ſatisfied the deſires
of ſome of my Friends, done my ſelf Right, without doing her or
any perſon in the world wrong.</p>
            <p>As to the World, after excuſing my ſelf of things with which I
am unjuſtly charged, I ſhall charge my ſelf with one thing which
every one does not conſider. It is indeed, a great Aggravation of
my Sin againſt that poor Infant; That I, whoſe concern it was
to provide for its ſafety in all Reſpects, ſhould in all deprive it, as
far as in me lay; For by that barbarous Act upon its Body, I have
done what in me lay to Murther its Soul, by depriving it of the
ordinary means which God had ordained for its Salvation, The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Baptiſm. Though I am not of his Opinion, who for
his ſeverity in this Caſe, was called <hi>Durus Pater Infantum;</hi> yet by
the judgment of my own Conſcience I find my ſelf to be <hi>Durus
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100636:14"/>
Pater,</hi> that I never once ſo much as conſidered this; ſo that the
poor innocent and harmleſs Babe, is only beholding to the Mercy
of its Heavenly, and not at all to that of its Earthly Parent for the
Happineſs I hope it now enjoys.</p>
            <p>I have done with the World, of which I have no more part;
and I praiſe God that he has choſen this way to take me out of it.
I ought not to let ſo great a Mercy paſs, without a due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If God had not by this ſevere Courſe opened my Eyes and
alarum'd me to Repent, and given me time conſiderable, and great
Aſſiſtances to perform it, I might have been ſurpriſed with ſome
ſudden Death, and infallibly ſunk headlong into Hell; from which
I have good hopes to be preſerved through the Mercy of God, and
the Merits of my bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer,<note place="margin">Non ex Gradu a<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> Lord, The Great and Dreadful God, the Impartial Judge of all
Men, I bluſh to lift up my Face to thee my God, Righteouſneſs
belongeth to thee; for thou art Juſt and Holy in all thy Wayes: But I
am a Vile and Miſerable Sinner, the Reproach of men, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
belongs to me but Shame and Confuſion of face. Thou, O Lord,
haſt dealt Mercifully and exceeding Bountifully with me; I was Early
taught to ſeek and ſerve thee; I felt the motions of thy Grace, and the
Powers of the World to come, to awaken my Conſcience. Thou didſt call
me to thy Service to ſtand and miniſter at thy Altar, and thou didſt give
me ſuch a meaſure of the good things of this life as was not only beyond
my Deſerts, but Expectations; But I have forſaken thee and rebelled
againſt thee: I waxed wanton in my plenty, and kicked againſt that
light and Eaſie Yoke which I ſhould have taught Others to bear. I drew
near to thee with my lips, but my heart was far from thee, and with
my polluted hands I have preſumed to compaſs thine Altar, and to touch
the holy things thereof; therefore it was juſt with thee to give me up
to my own Hearts Luſts, and to deliver me over to Judicial hardneſs,
that ſeeing I might ſee and not perceive, and hearing I might hear and
not underſtand. I have ſerved divers Luſts and Pleaſures; My Eyes
and Heart were full of Adultery, ſo that I could not ceaſe from Sin.
Nor have I ſinned alone, O Lord; for I have drawn many with me into
the ſnare of the Devil; ſo that my Sins are Innumerable, and Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by many Circumſtances; but moſt of all that I was called by thy
Name, ſo that thy Enemies do blaſpheme it upon my account. I have to
all this added that Execrable Sin of ſhedding Innocent Blood, and done
what I could to ſtifle the motions of thy Good Spirit: But now my Sins
and thy Righteous Judgments have found me out, I acknowledge this
is in great Mercy to my Soul, that I might not lye and periſh in my Sins.
I am Confounded and Aſhamed, I Abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes: I
Confeſs I do not only deſerve to die this Infamous death, but to be caſt out
of thy ſight into Outer-darkneſs; for thou art of purer Eyes then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Iniquity, and the Deceitful and Blood-Thirſty man thy Soul abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;
ſo that I may juſtly fear my Prayers are Abomination to thee; yet
whither ſhall I flye from thy Preſence? thy Hand hath overtaken me, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100636:15"/>
I am now to appear at thy Judgment Seat: My Soul is full of Terrour,
and I am afraid of thy Judgments. The Remembrance of my Sins is
Grievous to me, the Burden of them is Intolerable: Yet my only Hope is,
that thou art Gracious and Merciful, Slow to Anger, Ready to Forgive,
and thy Son gave Himſelf to die, and bore our Sins on his own Body. He
ever lives and maketh Interceſſion for Sinners, and is able to ſave to the
uttermoſt all that come to thee, O God, by Him. I confeſs I come at
the laſt Moment, when I have nothing elſe left me, and ſo thou mayſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reject me. Yet, O moſt Merciful God, take pity on the Work of thine
own Hands: Beget in me, for Chriſt his ſake, a deeper Senſe of my Sin
and Guilt, that I may Tremble for fear of thy Judgments, and Cry to
thee Night and Day. Let none of this little time that is given me to
Repent, be loſt: For thy Name ſake pardon mine Iniquity, for it is great;
And deliver me from Blood-guiltineſs, O God, thou that art the God of
my Salvation: Open my Heart and Lips, that my Mouth may ſhew forth
thy praiſe: That Sinners ſeeing thy Judgments and my Repentance, may
be Converted unto thee; That I, who by my vitious Life have ſo much
Diſhonoured Thee, may by my Death Glorifie Thee. O hear and have
Mercy on me; Pity and Pardon, O moſt Merciful Redeemer, waſh my
defiled Soul with thy moſt Pretious Blood, and for the Glory of thy Mercy,
ſend down upon me thy free Spirit to Convince me of Sin, and of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and of Judgment: And Grant me, a Wretched, and Forlorn
Sinner, ſome of thoſe Comforts, that may Support me under thoſe Agonies
that are ſo terrible. O Viſit me with thy Salvation, Speak Comfortably
to me; ſay to my Soul, Thy Sins are forgiven thee. Lord deliver me
from the fears of Death, and be with me in my laſt paſſage; Give me

Example not to ſin againſt thee. Give true Repentance to all whom I have

give her grace to do it, leſt a worſe thing befall her. Provide a faithful

The ſlowneſs of the blow God will make up by the heavineſs

my Reprieve.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> Moſt Holy and Righteous Judge of the whole World, give a
ſinful and miſerable Wretch leave to proſtrate himſelf before
the Throne of thy Grace, and implore that Mercy which I have
formerly deſpiſed and abuſed. I am not worthy, I confeſs, to lift up
my eyes towards Heaven, and it becomes me in the greateſt dejection
of Spirit to ſigh and groan under the load of my ſins, which have
been ſo great and many, ſo bold, ſo preſumptuous, and ſhameleſs,
that when with an awakened Mind I reflect upon them, I am ready
to ſink into Hell, and deſpair of any Mercy. O God, how have
I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof, and have not
obeyed the voice of my Teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that
admoniſhed me! How ſwift have my feet been to run into evil, and
how backward and averſe have I been to any thing that is good!
O the injuries which I have done my Neighbours, the abuſe of my
Wife and Children, my ſelf, and thy good Creatures, the prophane
neglect, nay contempt of thee and the Duties of thy Worſhip and
Service—The remembrance of all this is dreadful, the burden
is intolerable: How ſhall I appear before Thee, at whoſe rebuke the
mountains quake, ſince I could not think of appearing before an
earthly Judge without ſhame and affrightment of ſpirit? O Lord,
work in me a greater dread of thee, with a greater ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of face now that I am in thy preſence; for which end be pleaſed
to repreſent unto me effectually the wickedneſs and baſeneſs and
vileneſs of all my evil doings, as well as the guilt and juſt deſert
of them, O that I could hate and abhor them more than that death
which I expect very ſhortly to ſuffer for them. Beſtow on me, O
Lord, that ingenuous and godly ſorrow which worketh repentance
and unfeigned purpoſes of Amendment of life. They come too late
indeed, I may juſtly think, to find Acceptance with thee; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not without fear and trembling, and a great ſenſe of my unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings
I look up unto thee, acknowledging thy infinite goodneſs, if
thou wilt vouchſafe me but the ſmalleſt hope of mercy.</p>
            <p>Mercy, mercy, good Lord, caſt me not quite out of thy ſight for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100636:21"/>
Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, who gave himſelf for us to redeem us from
all iniquity. It is the beginning of ſome mercy and an Earneſt I
hope of more, that thou haſt made me ſenſible of mine offences, and
that thou haſt wrought in me a reſolution to forſake them, and ſome
love to a godly, ſober, and righteous life. Help me, O Lord, to
manifeſt the ſincerity and uprightneſs of my Soul in theſe reſolutions
as much as I am able, by giving thee hearty thanks, that the hand
of Juſtice has overtaken and laid hold upon me, and put a ſtop to
the further miſchief which I might have committed, and by making
a free and open Confeſſion of my Crimes, and taking the ſhame which
belongs to me before others, and by acknowledging that I am unworthy
to live, and by earneſt Admoniſhments to all to be warned by my
Example, and to ceaſe betimes to do evil, and learn to do well. O
God, that I could glorifie thee a little in my latter end after this
manner, and till I come to receive my deſerved puniſhment, help
me to ſpend my time in bewailing my ſins, in humbling my ſelf before
thee for them, in ſetting my heart againſt them, in ſtudying and
admiring, with the greateſt affection, the Holy life of the Lord Jeſus,
in calling other Offenders to Repentance, and exhorting them thereby
to give thee Glory. Deny me not Grace, I beſeech thee, to enable
me thus to employ my ſelf, that I may have ſome taſte of thy Mercy,
and the fear of death may be abated by ſome hope, that when my
Soul ſhall be parted from the body, thou O bleſſed Jeſus, wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, though ſo unworthy, into ſome of the Heavenly Manſions.

(as I ſhall by and by anſwer to the God
of Truth) you will finde nothing but the truth,
ſhall be publiſhed more fully, and to your better
advantage, than I could poſſibly make it here.
It a few words therefore.</p>
            <p>You may in me ſee what ſin is, and what it
will end in: you may in me ſee the lamentable
and irreparable miſchiefs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs and
Hypocriſie in particular; and what it is for one
who was the Member of Chriſt, to make himſelf
the Member of a Harlot. It is a ſin that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
goes ſingle and alone: it is the Mother-ſin
to abundance more, and they more ugly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
than it ſelf: I have found it by ſad and
woful experience. It led me to Lying, to Oaths
and Execrations, to conceal and defend it: Nay,
I went further, to adviſe, contrive, and aſſiſt in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100636:22"/>
what might procure Abortions; which certainly,
in the ſight of God, was Murther in intention.
Nor ſtopt it there, but went forward to murther in
Act and Execution: for which crying ſin I am
come hither to ſatisfie the Law of man, and do
acknowledge the Juſtice of that Sentence.</p>
            <p>And Oh that all you may fear and tremble at
God's holy and righteous Judgments, which
have overtaken me; and that they may make you
take warning to avoid the Snares of a whoriſh
woman, and eſpecially to keep the Married bed
undefiled.</p>
            <p>Beware of hypocritical pretences to Religion,
of coming to the Holy Sacrament while you live
in thoſe filthy practices. Do not grieve or
quench the Holy Spirit of God, nor ſtifle the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
of your own Conſciences, leſt God leave
you (as he did me) to work all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs with
greedineſs; and leſt at laſt you be brought to this
moſt miſerable condition to which he has most
juſtly brought me, to whoſe moſt righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I do ſubmit. I forgive all the world, as I
deſire to finde mercy at God's hands through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. I do earneſtly deſire you, by me to
take warning not to continue in ſin, for in the
end it will finde you out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:100636:22"/>
As to my ſin, I have but two things to ſay:
one I have cauſe exceedingly to lament, and that
is, the great Scandal I have thereby brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Religion, and the holy Function of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.
The great diſparagement which reflects on
theſe, I look upon as the moſt hainous Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my looſe and licentious life: Therefore
I pray you take up no prejudices againſt them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Account: they are holy and good, and
grant no Licenſes at all to ſuch wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
practices as I have been guilty of.</p>
            <p>The other I have ſome reaſon to rejoyce in:
'Tis true, my ſin has expoſed the whole Nation to
Judgment, for <hi>through Blood the Land is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi>
but this is my comfort, that God by this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
makes me expiate that Guilt, for the
Judgment falls upon my own pate; but I hope,
through the mercy of God, and merit of Chriſt,
will proceed no further than my body. I deſire
all that hear me, to take warning, not to continue
in ſin, but betimes to <hi>ceaſe to do evil, and learn
to do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Lord be with you all, and have mercy
upon my poor Soul; for which I deſire you
to pray with me and for me to the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my life,</p>
