            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The outward Reformed Church (for at this time I ſhall be ſilent concerning the inward Reformed Church, and the Ages of its ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſounding forth the everlaſting Goſpel) was an Infant under <hi>John WICLEF,</hi> and the Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a Boy under <hi>John H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> a Youth under <hi>

               <p n="16">16. Hence it is that theſe Seven Reformations are called the Seven laſt Plagues, and every Plague is ſo much the greater, as it is later; which the experience of the paſt Reformations do abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſs.

Every Age hath its Excellence and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both common in the Proverbs of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and the ſame you will find in the ſeveral Ages of the Reformation, if you mind it. The praiſe of Infancy is Innocence, its ſtain is miſery; and the ſingleneſs of manners in a Child is ſpoil'd by his

Untowardlineſs and Weakneſs; the Vigor of Youth is ſtained with Fickleneſs and Inconſtancy; and the great Courage of Young men is marr'd by their Raſhneſs; the Strength of Manhood, by their Want of Moderation; the Gravity of Aged Men, by Self-love; and the Perfection of a full Old Age, by Cowardlineſs.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Apply to your ſelves, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> theſe Praiſes and Reproaches of the ſeveral Ages, which (will ye, nill ye) by the following Diſcourſe you will find in your ſelves. In the mean time we ſhall follow the Text of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and all along apply it to you, that you may have the more reaſon to know your ſelves and your Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Peter WALD</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Lions,</hi> by his reproving the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was the firſt by whom the Reformed Church concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and in his time preparation was made for the pouring forth of the ſeven Vials, which the Roman Beaſt did vainly endeavour to prevent by ſo many bloody Wars. <hi>For a great Voice</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture Prophecy) <hi>was heard out of the Temple, ſaying to the ſeven Angels, Go and pour forth the Vials of the wrath of God upon the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>And the firſt Angel went,</hi> in the perſon of <hi>John WICLEF, and poured forth his Vial,</hi> in teaching that the Pope was Antichriſt, and that Purgatory, the Worſhipping of Saints and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Tranſubſtantiation and Indulgences, were his contrived Inventions, <hi>upon the Earth</hi> of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities and Monaſteries, in which the <hi>Beaſt</hi> doth dwell, <hi>which aſcendeth up out of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50034:7"/>21. <hi>And there was an evil and ſore boil,</hi> becauſe the before ſuppreſſed Doctrine of the Waldenſes was now revived and rectified, <hi>upon Men,</hi> Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks and Monks, <hi>who had the Mark of the Beaſt,</hi> the Popes Academical and Monaſtical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, Orders, and Dignities, <hi>and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped his Image,</hi> the Body of the Canon Law, compiled to maintain the Popes Vicedeity againſt the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Thus the Reformed Church brought forth the Child it had conceived by <hi>WALD,</hi> and the Firſt Hill of the Papal Throne was levell'd; for <hi>WICLEF</hi> being baniſhed out of <hi>England,</hi> by divine providence inlightened all <hi>Bohemia</hi> (the <hi>Pathmos</hi> of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>) which was the full effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Firſt Vial <hi>upon the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. The praiſe of this firſt Reformation was its Innocence, for it was a moſt juſt thing; its ſtain and reproach was (not from it ſelf, but from the Genius of the Time and Age) miſery, even cries and tears, by reaſon of the Antichriſtian Yoak; becauſe Infancy was not capable of any greater perfection.</p>
               <p n="24">24. View your ſelves, my Brethren the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> in this Looking-Glaſs, and take notice of this firſt Vial compared to Infancy, that you may with the more clearneſs come to know both your ſelves and your Brethren; that ſo you may toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, co-operate to the total ruin of the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="25">25. The Perſecution acted by the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> in the year 1655, and for ever to be deteſted for ſo many frightful Inſtances of unparallell'd Cruelty, will give the <hi>Pope</hi> his Deaths wound;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50034:8"/>
and that in this the Prophet ſpake true, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent will ſhortly declare: the very remembrance of which Perſecution hath oft inflamed my mind (in the ſtrength given me by God) undauntedly to promote the down-fall o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the curſed Pope and all his Councellors employ'd by him, for the propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Faith, and the rooting out of Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. For as the beginning and Foundation of the outward Reformation was firſt laid by <hi>Wald,</hi> ſo from this Maſſacre of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the fifth year of my Infancy) the fatal Foundation was laid of the outward Ruin of the Papal Seat.</p>
               <p n="26">26. From the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who ſcattered their Seed through <hi>Germany, France, Bohemia, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> under the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>Wiclef</hi> was born in <hi>England,</hi> being the Infant of Reformation, who ſoon after happily grew to be a Lad in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bleſſing of the moſt High. For <hi>the ſecond Angel poured forth,</hi> in the Perſon of <hi>John Hus,</hi> being confirmed by the Writings of <hi>Wiclef, his Vial</hi> of the Doctrines of <hi>Wiclef,</hi> and communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kinds, <hi>upon the Sea</hi> of the Roman-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>German</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>And it became like the Blood of one that is dead, John Hus and Jerome of Prague,</hi> being (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Faith and ſafe Conduct given them by a Synod of 346 Archbiſhops and Biſhops, 564 Doctors, and 1600 Dukes and Nobles) burnt alive. At which Synod theſe curſed Doctrins were confirmed, That <hi>Faith was not to be kept with Hereticks, and alſo, that (notwithſtanding Chriſt both inſtituted and adminiſtred the Supper in both kinds) Lay People were to be deprived of the Cup;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50034:8"/>
And every living Soul,</hi> retaining Chriſts true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Supper in both kinds, <hi>died</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing involved in Wars upon account of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned breach of Faith, <hi>in the Sea</hi> of the whole Empire; every one being forced to ſight, either for the Truth or againſt it: both Huſſites and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Imperialiſts, being now in Arms.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Now as ſoon as the Reformed Church grew to be a Lad, the Vice alſo which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that Age, began to appear in it; for the Huſſites grew ſo intractable and untowardly by their inteſtine hatred and diſſentions (being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Calixtines and Taborites) that they fell upon one another with no leſs fury than they did upon the Pope; ſo that in this ſenſe alſo it was true, <hi>That every living Soul died.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29. Yet the Childiſh Simplicity which at this day is found amongſt the Bohemian Brothers and Siſters, conveighs to us the ſweet Odor of this ſecond Reformation, notwithſtanding that all <hi>Bohemia</hi> groans under the curſed Papal Yoak. Rejoyce ye <hi>Huſſites, my Brethren</hi>! Rejoyce! for I bring you glad Tidings; Your Countrey ſhall be reſtored to you after a few Weeks, according to a Divine, not Humane account. O learn to know the time of your Viſitation, and put off the untowardlineſs and weakneſs of Children, and inſtead thereof put on their ſimplicity of Chriſtian Manners.</p>
               <p n="30">30. The whole World ſtood amazed at the ſecond Angels pouring forth his Vial <hi>upon the Sea,</hi> for almoſt an hundred years together, in the overthrows given by the Huſſites, which were the Shame of the Empire, the Reproach of the Pope, and the Wonder of all the Godly; which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50034:9"/>
yet were onely Preparatory for what was to follow.</p>
               <p n="31">31. For the <hi>third Angel poured forth,</hi> through <hi>Ulric Zuinglius, his Vial</hi> of Papal errors, <hi>upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of the Rhine, <hi>and upon the Fountains of Water</hi> of <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Suevia.

Concerning which <hi>John</hi> ſaith; <hi>and I heard the Angel of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſaying, Righteous art thou, O Lord, who art, and who was, and the Holy one! That thou haſt thus Judged, becauſe they have Shed the Blood of thy Saints and Prophets, thou haſt alſo given them Blood to drink, for they are worthy: And I heard another voice from the Altar ſaying, yea Lord God the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, true and Righteous are thy Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="32">32. O Bloody Youth of the Reformation! Not alone terrible by reaſon of the Wars which grew more Bloody every day than other: For it was moſt Bloody to our fellow Brethren, becauſe of their Ficklenes; whereby their Livelineſs and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor failed, before it failed, for a plague to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of Chriſt, who follow him in words but not in deed.</p>
               <p n="33">33. For almoſt at the very ſelf-ſame time, <hi>the fourth Angel poured forth,</hi> through <hi>Martin Luther, his Vial,</hi> by declaring that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was the great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the great <hi>Whore</hi> of the <hi>Revelation, upon the Sun</hi> of the Roman-German Empire, being the head of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of ten Kingdoms, and conſequently upon the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, who calls her ſelf the <hi>Sun.</hi>

               <p n="35">35. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> had ſcarce poured forth the Third <hi>Vial,</hi> but <hi>Luther</hi> comes and pours forth the Fourth, and the difference between them was the ſame, which is between a Youth and a Young Man; ſo that no wonder if they drew all Mens Eyes upon them; for <hi>Zuinglius</hi> with great force evinc'd that the Pope was Antichriſt, but <hi>Luther</hi> with greater: The former was indued with an extraordinary Vigour and Livelineſs, the later with a moſt undaunted Courage: and they carried on ſucceſsfully the work of Reformation, as long as they turned the edge of their endeavour only againſt Papal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="36">36. But when they began to write concerning the Myſteries of the Chriſtian Faith, without

the inward and outward Light of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (according to the comprehenſion of their own Reaſon, from the dead Letter of Scripture) there preſently aroſe amongſt them thoſe lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Controverſies and Contentions about the Holy Myſtery of the Body and Blood of Chriſt received in the Lords Supper, by means of which, this one Tree became firſt divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two contrary Branches, as it happened in the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="37">37. For the firſt and ſecond Spirit moſtly joyning it ſelf with the fourth, and the third with the fifth, have produced two Capital Sects, and together with thoſe two, innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble others, which at length, by means of the ſixth Spirit, ſhall be either brought to one Sheep-fold in the ſeventh Spirit, or elſe be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rooted out. But which are thoſe ſeven Spirits of which you here ſpeak? (for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you'll ask this Queſtion.) They are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Spirits which are before the Throne of God, proceeding from God by an Eternal Emanation, whoſe properties are moſt clearly to be ſeen in theſe ſeven laſt Plagues; inſomuch as they do abundantly reveal the Signature of the whole Reformation paſt, preſent, and to come, to the inlightened Sons of God: concerning which ye have already read ſomething revealed in the fore-going Application of the ſeven Ages of Mans Life, and will read more in that which follows.</p>
               <p n="38">38. The <hi>Switzers,</hi> and many dwelling about the <hi>Rhine,</hi> followed <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> whereas <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine took moſt in <hi>Saxony,</hi> with his own Countreymen; and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> conferring with

                  <hi>Luther</hi> at <hi>Marpurg,</hi> but not agreeing, becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> took thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> to be underſtood <hi>Corporally and Really</hi>; but <hi>Zuinglius Significatively,</hi> at parting they promiſed to bear with one another in mutual Charity, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any thorow Union and Agreement.</p>
               <p n="39">39. This was the Spring of the tears of the Godly; from hence aroſe thoſe Sacramentary Wars, as they are pleaſed to name them; and in that Name retain the mark of <hi>Romaniſm</hi> 666. O <hi>Zuinglians!</hi> O <hi>Lutherans! my Brethren</hi>! hear theſe true words. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was fickle, and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> raſh in his Contention about the Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the matter not deſerving ſuch Diſputes, much leſs thoſe bloody Wars, by which you now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh your Sects from each other!

               <p n="40">40. The words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body, This is my Blood,</hi> are to be underſtood concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Coeleſtial Body and Blood, not concerning his Earthly Body and Blood, which hung upon the Croſs: under his Earthly, Viſible, Body, his Inviſible, Heavenly, Body, hung upon the Wood of the Croſs; and under the appearance of his outward Blood, his Inviſible, Heavenly Blood was ſhed; neither do our Souls ſtand in need of the mortal Body or Blood, but of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and new Body, which ſprings from Chriſts immortal Body, that therein it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come partaker of Chriſt, and member of his true, every where preſent, eternal, and divine Body.</p>

I ſpeak this by experience, for I my ſelf (though a poor, miſerable, and afflicted Man) have ſeen Chriſt appearing in our Earthly Form, and yet at the ſame time filling all; and with theſe very Eyes I ſaw all the Saints appearing in his Body, who yet were every one of them diſtinct and divers from his Humane Body.</p>
               <p n="43">43. See here, I pray you, my deareſt Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what hitherto ye have not ſeen; it is the Letter that kills you, the Spirit of which alone doth quicken. The Devil doth extreamly envy Men the Body and Blood of Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt could not have left us a more precious Treaſure than that of his Body and Blood; which is the reaſon why the Enemy (whilſt <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> were contending together) did ſow ſuch tares in the matter of the Lords Supper, inſomuch as the miſchief done thereby can never be ſufficienly expreſſed.</p>
               <p n="44">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50034:11"/>44. O ye <hi>Zuingliaens</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi>! Learn hence who your <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> were, and with all how raſhly you have carried it toward your Brethren, abuſing the Divine Call of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi> O <hi>Lutherans! Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>! How are ye degenerated? Ye have no reaſon to be ſo puft up with <hi>Luthers</hi> Call, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing that is perfect appears during the ſeven Plagues, much leſs under the fourth, which is yet ſubject to great Frailties. Ye have fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Articles according to your own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and have eſtabliſhed your own Opinions, to the prejudice of Truth, and in ſo doing have brought the Pope, and <hi>Lateinus</hi> 666 again upon the Stage, though in another dreſs; and alas! have only increaſed the number of Wolves and Bears for to devour the Fleſh of the Pope.</p>
               <p n="45">45. O ye <hi>Lutherans,</hi> my Brethren! I obſerve that the modern Prophets, in an hidden parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical way, do attribute far worſe things to you, than they do to your Brethren, whom ye have condemned. O conſider that Youth is like Wax, moſt eaſie to yield to Vice, but as hard as Stone to relent and turn from it! Conſider it I ſay; and now ſhew your ſelves as eaſie to receive the day of Truth, as ye have been to admit the darkneſs of your moſt Antichriſtian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices.</p>
               <p n="46">46. The Manly Age of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (who are ſo hateful to you) will ſhew you, that you are the Youthful Age of the Reformed Church, and will unteach you your hatred, cauſed by the envy of the Devil. <hi>Luther</hi> the Angel of the fourth Vial, was the Plague of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> throughout all the German Empire, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50034:12"/>
the ſeveral Kingdoms belonging to it, whilſt he lived, and dying will be the death of that Son of Perdition, in the three following Angels.</p>
               <p n="47">47. For <hi>the fifth Angel poured forth,</hi> by <hi>JOHN CALVIN his Vial,</hi> not only rejecting the Pope, but likewiſe all Papal Ceremonies, Images, Rites, and Inſtitutions, <hi>upon the Throne of the Beaſt, France,</hi> being the inheritance of the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, and Eldeſt Son of the Pope, and where for 74 years together the Pope kept his reſidence. <hi>And his Kingdom was darkened,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacre, and the Kings terrible end; <hi>and they gnawed their Tongues,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the unhappy ſucceſs of the accurſed League, <hi>for pain,</hi> for the fruitleſs pains they had taken; becauſe the Blood of the Martyrs did make the Church to grow and thrive the better. <hi>And they blaſphemed the God of Heaven,</hi> when they ſaw the Progreſs the Reformation made in the Low Countreys, upon their revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the King of <hi>Spain; becauſe of their pains,</hi> taken in the Spaniſh Inquiſition, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranical Government, <hi>and their ſores,</hi> of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny overthrows received from the perſecuted French and Dutch. <hi>And they repented not,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not attribute theſe ſignal inſtances of the Divine Vengeance unto God; <hi>of their Works,</hi> their Perſecutions, Maſſacres and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties committed under pretence of defending the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Sure enough the Church of the fifth Vial was arrived to Mans eſtate, which grew up under the preſſure of ſuch horrid Perſecutions, and was never purer than when it counted moſt Martyrs. It was this Church held forth moſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50034:12"/>
lively inſtances of Patience and Humility, and is therefore to be praiſed before others for her Strength and Fortitude, though at the ſame time to be blamed alſo before others, becauſe of her immoderation in the point of the Divine <hi>Predeſtination and Call</hi> to Salvation. For this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Error, ſo big with many groſs Errors, was that dangerous Rock, which whilſt the <hi>Luh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="49">49. The greateſt Error of all the Reformed Churches, hath, is, and will be, the vain perſwaſion, whereby they think themſelves happy in the knowing and owning of this or that Article, and that all who do not know, oppoſe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the ſame, are damned.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Know O Man! It is not Knowledge can make thee Bleſſed, nor Ignorance that can damn thee, but a Righteous, or Unrighteous Life; the former of which conſiſts in loving of God and your Neighbour, the other in hating them. What if it pleaſed God to try thee, O <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, with this Error, whether thou wouldſt prefer the Life and Love of Chriſt, before ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Diſputing about Opinions? How wilt thou bluſh at the laſt Judgment, when thou ſhalt ſee many condemned; whom thou haſt bleſſed, and many bleſſed whom thou haſt condemned? Theſe are no ſlight words, but well worth your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration.</p>
               <p n="51">51. But as for you, O <hi>Calviniſts</hi> or (if you

would rather) <hi>Reformed,</hi> quicken your Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, open your Underſtandings, that you may ſee your Error in its very root. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaith, <hi>We know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, even to thoſe who are called according to his purpoſe. For whom he did fore know, he alſo did praeterminate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born amongſt many Brethren. Now whom he did praeterminate them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified, and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="52">52. The Apoſtle ſaith well, <hi>Whom he did fore-know, them he alſo did praeterminate,</hi> placing Gods <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> before his <hi>Praetermination,</hi> not <hi>whom he did praeterminate, them he alſo fore-knew,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Praetermination</hi> before <hi>Fore-knowledge,</hi> as ye <hi>Calviniſts</hi> do, when you expound this place, not underſtanding the infinite difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other. Again, Theſe words <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="53">53. For this <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> and <hi>Praetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the moſt high God, is the moſt juſt Ballance, wherein your common Error is weighed:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50034:13"/>
for hence it appears, that God did fore-know us from Eternity, and from this fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge did praeterminate all of us; but not prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate us that he might fore-know us. It is certain that in God Fore-knowledge and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination are, beyond all Humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, together and at once, but not ſo in us, in whom Fore-knowledge and Praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination are two different things, as all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions are. God fore-knew the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and from this Fore-knowledge he did praeterminate the whole Work of Redemption; but God did not praeterminate the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that from this praetermination he might fore-know the whole work of Redemption, which is contrary both to Scripture and Nature.</p>

               <p n="76">76. My dear Brethren! hitherto you have been miſtaken in your blind Zeal, and being loaded with Prejudices, have rejected thoſe who were ſent to you from God, ſhould you go on to do ſo againſt your Conſcience and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, how dangerous would it prove to your Souls?</p>
               <p n="77">77. O <hi>Lutheran Iſrael</hi>!

Now underſtand it: examining them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, whom hitherto becauſe of the riddle of their Prophetick ſtile (as yet either loſt or unknown) being ſeduced by ſome of thine own party, thou haſt undervalued and neglected.</p>
               <p n="79">79. Pray what is more common in our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of ſpeaking and writing than ſuch expreſſions as theſe? The King of <hi>France</hi> dies not, <hi>Rudolf</hi> is yet alive, King <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is not dead yet, <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> flouriſheth ſtill. And why ſo? becauſe though a Prince be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet in his Children and Succeſſors he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes immortal and eternal. And what is more common in Scripture Prophecies, than to have a thing fore-told of one and fulfilled in another?</p>
               <p n="80">80. <hi>Frederick</hi> the Fifth is not yet dead, not <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, the firſt lives in the Elect of the Reformed Church; the later in the Sons of the Antichriſtian Whore. <hi>Frederick</hi> indeed was mortal, but the Church he was of, immortal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50034:19"/>
and though <hi>Ferdinand</hi> be dead, yet the Papal Church is not ſo yet, in whom <hi>Ferdinand</hi> is yet to be found. As long as God ſhall have any in the Reformed Church, who endeavour the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or Ruin of the Papal, to the end that the Propagation of Chriſtianity amongſt the Nations may be no longer obſtructed, ſo long will <hi>Frederick</hi> yet be Fighting for God againſt the Pope, and be King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which was the Mother of the Infancy and Child-hood of the Reformed Church, and conſequently of the whole Church of God, which ſhall at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to its full and perfect Age. And on the contrary, as long as the Devil ſhall have his Miniſters, who revere the Papal Blaſphemies, inſtead of the Word of God, and do in any manner perſecute the truth, ſo long will <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> continue to be the bloody defender of the Beaſt.</p>
               <p n="81">81. <hi>Frederick</hi> doth not live in his Family, which is his Bodily Off ſpring, but in his Spiritual Off-ſpring; and though all his Family ſhould die, yet would not he. And the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> whoſe Bodily Houſe is now nearer to Death than ever, that it might be a Figure of his Spiritual Houſe and Family. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> is dead indeed to us, but not to God; and ſo likewiſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi>; and they ſhall both ſee the day of Deliverance; the one ſhall rejoyce, the other grieve and mourn; of which (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the preſent ignorance) it is better to be ſilent then to ſpeak further.</p>

               <p n="92">92.

               <p n="93">93. Memorable was that third Conjunction of the two Superior Planets in the Fiery Trigon, in 1663, together with the preceding great Conjunction of all the Planets in the Fiery Sign

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50034:23"/>
our Modern Prophets, and I had already began in the fore going line, to apply them to the numbers of our Witneſſes, which are yet alive, which yet after two days pauſe I blotted out again, contrary to my cuſtom; becauſe both the impulſe of my mind, and a two days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, abundantly perſwaded me, that I had much more reaſon to be ſilent than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare any thing about this matter.</p>
               <p n="104">104. I ſay contrary to my cuſtom; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever from my Soul-mind-ſpirit, flows once into my Pen, never needs any blotting out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our inward Dictator, who is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibly hid under the outward, ſcarce ever ſuffers us to miſtake, it being rare for our hand to make a blot, inſomuch, that what is once writ continues written, though I want the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Dictation, which is very different from our way of writing.</p>
               <p n="105">105. The impulſe of my mind; becauſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the paſt Contentions, by which our yet living Witneſſes (whether ſtanding in the firſt, ſecond, or third principle) did greatly trouble and hinder me, who was yet ignorant of ſuch Frailties; for they meaſuring others, with the meaſure of their own principle, went aſtray from their Call, and led others into the ſame Error with themſelves.</p>
               <p n="106">106. And two days conſideration; for the longer time ſome intervening occaſions gave me of conſidering, the greater need I found to blot out what I had begun to write, and not at all to meddle with the Numbers of ſuch as were yet alive; for I conſidered that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caught in the riddle of their own Principle,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50034:24"/>
would not be able to underſtand nor bear the clear opening of the term of years, which was given to them infolded in a Prophetick Riddle; and being too tender promoters of their own will, did ſhorten this fearful and univerſal work of God, according to their affections, not ſeeking the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt with their whole heart.</p>
               <p n="107">107. You do not purely ſeek the Glory of God in his Son, whoſoever you are, that do ſo anxiouſly call for a ſhortning of the time; whereas it would become you wholly to leave the time in the will of God, till all that is to be done, be accompliſhed. Make haſte, my Brethren, make haſte, to ſow the Seed ye have received from God, in the Hearts of Men, leaſt contrary to Natures Order, you ſhould ſeem to hope for a Harveſt before the Seed time, as hitherto ye have done, and by the ſame miſtake have unhappily loſt your ſowing ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="108">108.

yet ſhall I in what follows more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly make it out to you; to the end at length you may learn to be wiſe, and leave the ways of <hi>Cain.</hi> For the Spirit of God in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets doth every where accuſe the coldneſs of your Charity to your Fellow-brethren, without which Charity, your <hi>Reformation</hi> is nothing but a Deformation of Chriſtianity, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance without reality.</p>
               <p n="136">136. O my <hi>Lutheran</hi>-brethren, ye have been colder than the <hi>Iſeland</hi> Snow in your Charity to your Brethren the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and they again to you, notwithſtanding you were neareſt to one another; and that by reaſon of your Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about ſome Articles of Faith, not about the Life of Chriſt: in which Articles ye have moſt Antichriſtianly placed your Salvation, and not in the Holy Life of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="137">137. Chriſt taught you to pray, <hi>Forgive us our Debts, even as we alſo forgive our Debtors</hi>; which you have indeed daily prayed, and yet continue to pray to your own damnation. You do not forgive your Debtors their Debts, and yet you ask the ſame forgiveneſs of God, and receive it too, even the ſame you have exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards others, and askt of God.</p>
               <p n="138">138. You have out of envy laid great Debts to the account of many holy Men of God, who have been extraordinarily call'd amongſt you; which if they had really been chargeable with, yet ought ye to have forgiven them, as having daily promiſed to God ſo to do; but in ſtead of this, ye have contrary to your Prayers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, condemned thoſe alive and dead, who are a thouſand times more happy than your ſelves.</p>

               <p n="140">140. I have in this Diſcourſe, O <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Reformed,</hi> moſt nakedly opened my peaceful heart to you all; I have diſtinctly ſhew'd you the Good and the Evil which is amongſt you: I have laid before you the Means of a true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>; under the Title of Fellow-brethren I have laſht your moſt Antichriſtian Enmities: I have entirely forgiven all my Debtors amongſt you, and at the preſent do forgive you my <hi>deareſt Brethren,</hi> any Debts of your threatned Writing againſt me, if ſo be you eſteem the ſame as not written; having only deſign'd it in your ignorance, to the end your nakedneſs may not be expos'd to the view of the World.</p>
               <p n="141">141. The <hi>Truth,</hi> which is become <hi>Man,</hi> will in me triumph againſt all his Enemies, and your Poſterity in <hi>Sweden, Denmark, Saxony, Holland, England, France,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> will be of my ſide, not of yours, when in the time of their great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, they ſhall underſtand their Call out of the Prophets, if ye in your time ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to hear and underſtand it; which God forbid.</p>
               <p n="142">142. For then the <hi>Eternal Goſpel</hi> which ye had rejected, would be taken from you, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to our Brethren of the Eaſt, the <hi>Turks, Perſians, and Tartars,</hi> and from thence would

onely reflect its Light to you, as from its Center; ſo that then you would never again be able to buy that Living Water, to quench the thirſt of your Souls, ſo nigh unto you for nothing.</p>
               <p n="143">143. As long as there is yet hopes of your Repentance, ſo long ſhall ye be my Fellow-bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but as ſoon as your laſt Breath is paſt your Lips, you ſhall then either be my Fellow-brethren ever or never.</p>
               <p n="144">144. What I have ſaid of you, the ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Turks, Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> as well as of Nominal Chriſtians; becauſe <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> with others who are Strangers to the Name of Chriſt, if they heartily glorifie Chriſt by a Righteous Life towards God and their Neighbours, though they have no Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Knowledge of Chriſt, are notwithſtanding partakers of him, and that in a nearer degree than our Nominal Chriſtians, <hi>notwithſtanding their Mahometaniſme, which in time muſt be totally done away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="145">145. Would you know the reaſon of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion? Conſider the riſe of <hi>Mahomet</hi>; was not he raiſed in the Wrath of God to be a Scourge to the Roman Antichriſt? and if you view the Roman Idolatry with their Saints and Sainteſſes, you'll find that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are juſtifiable, not in reſpect of their own Law, but in regard of the Scandal they received from <hi>Rome</hi>; for which reaſon alſo the Execution of the Sixth Judgment (which is to paſs upon Univerſal <hi>Rome</hi>) is committed by God to <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="146">146. Wherefore take heed of thoſe <hi>three frogs,</hi> before explained in the Sixth Vial, who by their contrary Opinion, will be generally very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

to Sectarians, in maintaining that the Ruin of <hi>Mahometans</hi> is at the door. Take heed ye do not vainly perſwade your ſelves that the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Empire will have its period with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring of the Dominion of the Watry Trigon, about the year of Chriſt 1782, becauſe the ſaid Empire had its firſt riſe under the ſame; for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Prophecy doth aſſure us, that the Sword of the Mouth, not a bloody one, ſhall deſtroy the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Deſtroyers of European <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="147">147. A hard Meſſage this is, but yet a very true one; nor to be feared by any of my Fellow-brethren that follow the words of God! For our God hath pointed out a <hi>Pella</hi> for his own to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to in the <hi>North,</hi> and in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in thoſe words which he ſpoke to <hi>Chriſtina Poniatovia,</hi> when ſhe was a Figure of this our Sojourning, ſaying; <hi>Behold I will ſcatter my People amongſt the Nations, and I will ſend them into a ſtrange Land! I will lead them out before the ſtorm of my ſwift Wrath break forth, that they may be preſerved when I ſhall rain down Fire and Brimſtone. Wherefore as thou didſt flee, ſo ſhall they; many with trembling, not knowing whither to turn themſelves; but I will ſhew them their way, neither will I take my Mercy from them. And I will give unto them their Spiritual Bread in abundance, even my Holy Word, that with it they may more freely, quietly, and undiſturbedly feed and ſatisfie their Souls: I will moreover add thereunto the Bread of the Body, and all neceſſaries of Life; neither will I be wanting to them in any thing, ſo they do but confide in me, and take me for their Refuge. For my Name is a moſt ſtrong Tower, if the Righteous flee to me, he ſhall be ſaved in the evil day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="148">148. This our God fulfilled to the <hi>Bohemians</hi>

and <hi>Moravians,</hi> who, to praefigure our Diſperſion, were driven into Exile by the moſt Antichriſtian Wickedneſs of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second.</p>
               <p n="149">149. And our Heavenly Father doth yet daily fulfil it in us, who in a Figure live amongſt the Nations, being led forth, and daily more to be led forth, into a ſtrange Land: and the words before alledged will put you upon great thoughts, who do not underſtand that this our leading forth will be before the breaking forth of the ſtorm of the ſwift Wrath of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="150">150. Will you yet continue to call them Fools whom God hath adorned with his <hi>threefold Crown of Wiſdom?</hi> Will you proceed to afflict your Fellow-brethren, with your Corporal and Spiritual Impriſonments, whom God will deliver from your Eternal Captivity? Alas! o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your Eyes! open them I ſay: what ye have done to your Fellow-Brethren, ye have done to your ſelves <hi>Temporally,</hi> if you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but <hi>Eternally,</hi> if ye be damned.</p>
               <p n="151">151.

               </p>
               <p n="152">152. Ye <hi>Lutherans</hi> have proclaimed <hi>Luther</hi> to be the <hi>Angel of the Eternal Goſpel,</hi> and have ſlain your ſelves with your own Sword, becauſe there are <hi>Seven Angels</hi> mentioned, correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with the <hi>Angels of the Seven Vials</hi>; who was then the firſt of theſe? who the Second? who the Third? and ſo forth; and which of them was <hi>Luther</hi>? Anſwer me: but I know you'll be ſilent.</p>
               <p n="153">153. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks thus concerning the Fourth Angel, anſwering to <hi>Luther: And I ſaw, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a White Cloud, and upon the Cloud one ſitting like to the Son of Man, having upon his Head a Golden Crown, and in his Hand a ſharp Sickle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="154">154. To whom I pray can this be applied in <hi>Luthers</hi> time? The Devil indeed in <hi>Luthers</hi> time exerted his ſtrongeſt endeavours to overthrow the Kingdom of Chriſt, in the <hi>Anababtiſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at Munſter</hi>; neither was it without a cauſe that he mingled theſe Tares amongſt the good Wheat of the Kingdom of Chriſt, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the <hi>External and Eternal, Literal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Goſpel,</hi> might not joyn their force toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p n="156">156. And therefore they were not all Arch-Hereticks, who are ſo commonly accounted; but rather Promoters of the Eternal Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their proper Angel, and Fore-runners of the Paradiſick Reign of Chriſt, <hi>all which</hi> (being armed with Divine Aſſiſtance) <hi>I ſhall publickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine</hi>

Neither ſhall thoſe execrable Hereſies, which are almoſt by a general conſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to <hi>David George,</hi> deter me from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Defence of his Innocence; ſince thoſe things which are brought in againſt him by <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and others, though ſeemingly proved by his own Writings, have no more truth in them, than had the Phariſees Teſtimony againſt Chriſt about his re-building the Temple in three days.</p>
               <p n="158">158. That place of the Revelation hath moſt truly been fulfilled in the Reſtorers of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel; where it is ſaid, <hi>And none could learn the ſong, ſave onely the Hundred forty four thouſand who were bought from the Earth</hi>: and will yet daily be fulfilled more and more.</p>
               <p n="159">159. The Everlaſting Goſpel, is nothing elſe but the Everlaſting knowledge of the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which never was the ſame it is now, nor never will be the ſame it hath been: and in this one line you have the whole foundation of the Everlaſting Goſpel, which none, under the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Letter of the <hi>Seven Vials,</hi> hath, doth, or will be able to underſtand, without the teaching of the holy Ghoſt, who is the Dictator of the Everlaſting Goſpel; neither will it be fully known to all, <hi>until the Seven Plagues of the Seven Angels be finiſhed.</hi>

               <p n="160">160. As great a difference as there is between the outward Letter of Scripture, and the Spirit of the Letter; ſo great is the difference between the Reformers of the outward, and the Reformers of the inward Papacy, as to their knowledge of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="161">161. Neither are the failings of each of them

to be meaſured by any other rule; and the <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful errors which have been publickly expoſed under the name of the Eternal Goſpel,</hi> by miſtaken inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, ſhall be publickly examin'd by me in a Letter, where (in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt) all <hi>the Antichristian Tenets</hi> of the Quakers, and other ſuch like, are totally overthrown. More might be ſaid, than hath been; and yet more may not be ſaid at preſent, than hath been.</p>
               <p n="162">162.

               <p n="163">163. It was thy duty to have examined <hi>Rothe</hi> according to the Scriptures, but not to impriſon him? All thy Preachers who deny Prophecy in this our age, and do endeavor to confute the Paradiſick Reign of Chriſt, and the fore-going Converſion of the Turks, Jews and Heathens, to that one Sheepfold of Chriſtendome, are blind <hi>Sauls,</hi> if their zeal be ſincere; but devilliſh frogs if maliciouſly they perſiſt to oppoſe the truth.</p>
               <p n="164">164. Set <hi>Rothe,</hi> mine and your Brother, at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and after publick prayers, examine him with a burning zeal for truth, taking care above all things that he diſtinguiſh, what in his writings is his own, from what hath been dictated to him by God; adjuring him that he deliver the ſame without any addition or diminution whatſoever. In thoſe which are his own Writings, bear with his human frailties in Brotherly love; in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Writings you muſt admit of none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

Writings of his you may then compare with the Writings and Prophecies of <hi>Kotterus, Chriſtina, Drabicius, Kregel, Herman,</hi> immediately received from God, with which they will be found to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all main points, if they come from God; but on the contrary will be found to diſagree, in caſe they proceed from a lying Spirit.</p>
               <p n="165">165. Having found their agreement, then be alſo obedient to God, and rejoyce in that thou art alſo called; liſtening not only to the voice of the Ancient, but alſo of thy New Prophet. But in caſe thou findeſt them to diſagree, then commit him to the Mercy of God, and the Prayers of the Church, not to priſon, that ſo thy Chriſtian Charity may re-appear. This is the true way of knowing true Prophets, but the other is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian; this agrees with the Scripture, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is contrary to it.</p>

DEarly beloved, I am about to ſeal my weighty <hi>London Epiſtle</hi> (which I wrote about Fifteen Months ago for a farewell (being then ready to take my Journey for <hi>Rome</hi>) with the Seals of a moſt <hi>Weighty Poſtſcript,</hi> after my ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the <hi>North,</hi> from my <hi>Eaſtern Voyage</hi>; with which <hi>Seals</hi> it hath pleaſed the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Hoſts</hi> to ſeal the ſaid <hi>Letter, in the Eaſt as well as in the North.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> becauſe the moſt High hath led me moſt wonderfully (according to what he had before ſhewed to <hi>Kotterus,</hi> and pointed out the way by the late <hi>Comet</hi>) for the ſpace of Five Months, even unto <hi>Eaſtern Rome,</hi> for the ruin of <hi>Weſtern Rome,</hi> at the ſame time when the <hi>Eaſtern Turk</hi> and <hi>Northern Moſcovite</hi> were fiercely engaged together; and the Book which <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſaw fall from Heaven (being all covered with Gold, and of a Triangular Form, between the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Northern</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50034:34"/>
will ere long be viſible to the whole World, to the amazing of the Lions, who by reaſon of the fierceneſs of their Conteſt do not yet ſee it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the <hi>North,</hi> becauſe the Almighty hath there diſcovered the fatal Decrees and Deſigns of <hi>Weſtern Rome,</hi> againſt his People, for the fatal Fruſtration of which he had ſent me towards <hi>Rome</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi>; as alſo for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling and promoting of all our Modern <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Wiſe-men,</hi> and <hi>Scripture-learned</hi>; and He, even He himſelf, hath been pleaſed to put his Work in ſuch a forwardneſs againſt my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that at length his People being affrighted with ſo great dangers, and forced by ſo many neceſſities, might double-fill that Cup to the Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> in which ſhe hath mixed her Poyſons for the Deſtruction of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Juda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. O moſt accurſed Pope! How will now the Rumours from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and from the <hi>North</hi> affright thee? Didſt thou think to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh thy tottering Throne in <hi>London?</hi> ſure thou haſt forgot what place <hi>London</hi> is; but well haſt thou done, in ſo doing, for thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thy ſelf by thine own Blindneſs. For <hi>England</hi> in her <hi>Wiclef</hi> brought forth that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant which the Church had conceived by <hi>Peter Wald</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> and the firſt Spirit is ſo nearly conjoyn'd with the Seventh, even the Infancy of the <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> with its Old Age, that it will appear that thou haſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by haſtned thine own Ruin in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence it was, that when at <hi>Cadiz</hi> (a place famous amongſt Academicks) I heard
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50034:34"/>
the firſt News of the <hi>Engliſh Conſpiracy</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I was then beſet with many Troubles) I rejoyced with great Joy to ſee that my <hi>Jehova</hi> was making way according to his Promiſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence it was, that when at my firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I underſtood, not onely that one <hi>Coleman</hi> was one of the chief of the Conſpirators, but alſo that there had been ſtrange reports raiſed of me in remote places, and particularly at <hi>Breſlaw,</hi> my Birth place, becauſe of the likeneſs of my Name with his, it raiſed very various thoughts in me, and at length moved me with indignation (yet being unmoved) until at laſt I found reaſon to praiſe again and again ſo wonderful a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, upon ſuch a ſpecial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd for occaſion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence it was that at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> on the ſelf ſame day on which <hi>Drabicius</hi> Fifteen years ago (after that a Draught of the Seat and Throne of Glory had been preſented to him) had together with the <hi>Youth</hi> cryed the Cries of a Crier (27 [17] of <hi>May</hi> 1665) I likewiſe cried again and again the Cries of a Crier, whilſt with my outward and inward Eyes I ran o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the particulars of this <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Conſpiracy</hi>: indeed I was aſtoniſhed, and joyfully praiſed the wonderful, yet viſible Direction and Guidance of God amidſt the Horror and Dolor of theſe Modern Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For reading the 81 Articles of <hi>Titus Oats</hi> his <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> which he dedicates to the King himſelf, I found ſo great an Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50034:35"/>
the dates of the Conſpirators Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the time of my Countermotions, for the ruin of the Pope and his Creatures, that it appears I was diametrically oppos'd to them, who, when they intended to ſubdue <hi>London</hi> under their Yoke, was from thence to begin my Journey for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which will prove ſo fatal to the Pope and all Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and was at the ſame time to write this preſent <hi>Letter</hi> (of ſo great moment) for a farewell, which during my abſence, hath been in vain ſuppreſs'd by the ſelf-love of ſome, becauſe <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath made it the more remarkable by the ſhame of thoſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heroes, who preſumed proudly to judge and hinder ſo great an undertaking.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Read, my Brethren, my Fifteen Songs, and mind well their ſeveral Dates, and you'll find that the Truth of Chriſt hath deſtroyed the accurſed Foundations of Papal Falſhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the ſame time when they were moſt buſie to raiſe them.

It was for very great Reaſons that our <hi>Examined Fore-runner</hi> of the wonderful Five, Years, was by a perpetual Dedication pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Three <hi>Charles's</hi> of <hi>Europe, viz.</hi> To the <hi>Lutheran Charles,</hi> the <hi>Reformed Charles,</hi> and the <hi>Papal Charles,</hi> all at one time, and of one Name defending the three great Names of Religion.</p>

many Croſſes and Loſſes, and beſides, having been at the very point of Death, hath been expoſed as a pleaſing Spectacle to the Papiſts, at the ſame time when they deſigned the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Reformed Charles,</hi> by ſo numerous a knot of Ruffians, and whilſt the <hi>Papal Charles</hi> is taken up with Nuptial Conſultations. It is your Duty O <hi>Reformed Iſrael and Juda,</hi> to dive more deeply into the ſecret Deſigns of the Papacy than hitherto ye have done, which ſets you together by the Ears, hiding their Aims under various fallacious pretences and ſeeming aſſiſtances, till at length being tired and weakened through theſe Wars, ye, are forced to an Agreement, becauſe ye can fight no longer.</p>

               <p n="15">15. Wherefore at length learn to be wiſe, and own Gods Viſiting of you by his <hi>Prophets, Wiſe-men, and Scripture-learned,</hi> and with ſerious thoughts conſider the Hiſtorical Application of the Vials in this preſent Epiſtle, which is the one onely mean to recover the true Unity of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches,</hi> and their firſt Love: For let the curſed Pope know, <hi>That this very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle ſhall yet ſtrike him with more Horror than an Army of an Hundred thouſand Warriours; and five ſmooth Stones</hi> taken out of the Valley of the Prophets, which I have put into the Scrip of this Writing, will be ſufficient in my Sling, to deſtroy him in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts, according to the Prophets.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And as for you <hi>Wiclef-Waldenſes, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, Zuinglians, Lutherans and Calviniſts,</hi> my moſt dear Fellow-brethren, joyn all your Forces together, and call a <hi>GENERAL CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NCIL,</hi> wherein you may examine, follow, and fulfil the Writings of your <hi>Prophets, Wiſe-men, and Scripture-learned</hi>; and as for all the Grievances and Scruples which are yet
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50034:36"/>
found amongſt you, ſince they owe their riſe onely to Prejudices and opinionative Conceits, they will in due time fall of themſelves. It is moſt true, becauſe under the pouring forth of your Plagues, ſo much matter hath been made for more Plagues, that the Papal Fury before its own fall will threaten yours, as hath been Propheſied, but the Almighty will turn it by, of which this Writing may give you a fore-taſte.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Take heed of rejecting (as hitherto moſt Antichriſtianly ye have done) what ye never read or underſtood, but examine all in the Gold-Ballance of Scripture, according to the Literal and Spiritual ſenſe of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; examine, I ſay, thoſe who are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Spiritually; and thoſe that are Literal Literally, and all Antichriſtian Miſtakes will preſently diſcover themſelves. The Literal ſenſe of the Scripture is but one, whereas the Spiritual and Myſtical ſenſe is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand-fold; and to confound the Literal ſenſe, with ſuch infinite Myſteries of the Spiritual ſenſe, as ſome Carnal Academicks do, muſt needs produce a ſtrange Confuſion.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The <hi>Prophets, Wiſe men, and Scripture-learned,</hi> do often ſeem to contradict one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, when their Literal ſenſe is not clearly diſtinguiſhed from their Myſtical: and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets indeed, at all times, becauſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions expreſſed or implied, and becauſe of the riddle of the myſtical future ſenſe, as to places, perſons, and times, have been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of falſhood, by Carnal and Literal Men,

               <p n="19">19. Have not the Modern Prophets of this Age in their own days, as well as at this preſent, been ſuſpected of falſhood and little regarded, becauſe of the darkneſs of their words, and the ſeeming Contrariety of Events? But what will ye ſay if amongſt ſuch differing and at divers times appearing Prophets, who all lived before I was called or inlightened (whoſe Names I have here and there alledged in theſe and other Writings) ye ſhall read and hear that theſe following 28 Particulars (all which point at me indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, and have their proper fulfilling at this very time) were fore-told, as it were with one Mouth; <hi>viz. My Father, Mother, the Year, Month and Day of my Birth, my Malignant Conſtellation, my Chriſtian Name, Name and Surname, my Countrey, City, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant, the Year and Month when I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, the Year of the</hi> Holland <hi>Motion, my Seal, Learning, Writings, leaving of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, my rejecting the Degree of Doctor, my reſtoring of Scripture, unſealing of the Prophets, my Voyage to</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>my haſting, and fall thereby occaſioned, my foſter Mother a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, my doubled five Years time, and laſtly my Age of Twenty eight Years.</hi>

               <p n="25">25. Theſe three places will abundantly bear witneſs of the Harmony of theſe Numbers, and of the miſtakes of all thoſe who hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have interpreted them, and I ſhould have been afraid of opening this laſt place (which takes ſo large a compaſs) but that I read in the Prophets themſelves, that it is lawful at preſent to unlock that Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Numbers: For the 1176 years of the Two Witneſſes expired Five Years ſince, and their 1260 Year-days, and <hi>Solar</hi> Months, which are expreſly allotted to them in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> will according to the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, end with the Year 1685, after another double <hi>Quinary</hi> is paſt. And in this regard the Firſt Day begins with the Year of Chriſt 425, the Second with 785, the Third with 1145, the Fourth with 1505. So that both according to the <hi>Solar</hi> and <hi>Lunar</hi> Months, the determined time of the Two Witneſſes is come; and now that is fulfilled, <hi>The Spirit of Life from God came upon them, and they ſtood on their Feet, and a great Fear fell upon thoſe that ſaw them</hi>; this preſent <hi>Epiſtle</hi> witneſſing to the truth of it.</p>

And you'll eaſily know the reaſon why the Numbers extend themſelves as far as 1923, ſo you do not confound the time of the Sixth <hi>Vial</hi> with the Seventh: Now the end of the Sixth <hi>Vial</hi> is the total Excluſion of the curſed Pope, the Period of the Four Monarchies, and the full Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Turks; upon which ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow that interval of the Seventh <hi>Vial,</hi> in which the Univerſal Converſion of all Nations ſhall be carried on, and way made for the Thouſand Years Apocalyptical Reign.</p>
               <p n="27">27. All the Confuſion which hitherto hath been amongſt the Good as well as the Bad, hath proceeded from the Ignorance of theſe <hi>Vials</hi>; the material Object of the <hi>Prophets, Wiſe-men, and Scripture-learned</hi> of the Sixth <hi>Vial,</hi> being the 17th Chap. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> whoſe chief Contents is, <hi>Come hither, I will ſhew thee, the Judgment of the great Whore, who ſits upon many Waters:</hi> but that of the <hi>Prophets, Wiſe-men, and Scripture-learned,</hi> of the Seventh <hi>Vial,</hi> is the 21 and 22 Chap. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> whoſe main ſcope is, <hi>Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will ſhew thee the Woman, the Bride of the Lamb.</hi> This one thing is ſufficient to overthrow all erroneous Opinions, about Modern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and to ſhew the difference of the Sixth and Seventh <hi>Vials</hi>; the former of which doth chiefly Prophecy concerning the Judgment which is to paſs upon the Pope; the later con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reign of Chriſt, and the utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all other Kingdoms. Thoſe very words,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50034:40"/>
                  <hi>Come hither I will ſhew thee,</hi> do fundamentally declare, that there will be a calling of Prophets under the Sixth and Seventh <hi>Vials</hi>; neither do they underſtand the Letter, and Hiſtorical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Scripture, who do not underſtand the Emphaſis of theſe words, <hi>Come hither I will ſhew thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. It remains yet that I ſhould ſpeak <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Angel of the Seventh Vial, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Applications of the Modern Prophets, of the ſecret Deſigns of the Papacy, to deſtroy the Engliſh, Dutch, French, German, and all other Proteſtants, which are hinted at by the Prophets; and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like Matters, were I not to keep my ſelf within the limits of a</hi> Poſtſcript. And you O <hi>Paſtors, Sheep and Lambs of the Reformed</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Juda, weigh in the equal Ballance of Chriſtian Truth, what hath been here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to you, and do not kick away your Salvation, leaſt at laſt ye be wiſe too late. The Grace of Jeſus Chriſt the onely begotten Son of the Living God, be with you, and with us. <hi>Amen.</hi> This <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> was written at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> the 26th of <hi>May</hi> (5th <hi>June</hi>) in the Year 1679.</p>
