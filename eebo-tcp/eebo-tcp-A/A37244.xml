         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Why, ſince the deſire to know, did corrupt the roote of all mankind, did my parents ſend me to Schoole that my minde might be inriched therewith? for when our firſt parents cleere and ſharpe reaſons eye, could have approached the eternall light, as the Intellectuall Angells, even then the Spirit of lies ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, that becauſe they ſaw no Ill, therefore they were blind and breathed into them a curious wiſh, which did corrupt their will: for that ill they ſtraight deſired to know, which ill was nothing but a defect of good, which the Devill could not ſhew while man ſtood in his perfection; ſo that they were firſt to doe the Ill, before they could attaine the knowledge of it; as men by taſting poyſon know the power of it, by deſtroying themſelves. Thus man did ill to know good, and blinded reaſons eye to give light to paſſions eye, and then he ſaw thoſe wretched ſhapes of miſery, and woe, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhame, and poverty by experience; Reaſon grew darke and could not diſcern the fair formes of God and truth, and mans ſoul which at firſt was fair, ſpotleſſe, and good ſees her ſelfe ſpotted, hanted with ſpirits impatient to ſee her own faults; therefore turnes her ſelfe outward, and ſees the face of thoſe things pleaſing and agreable unto her ſences, ſo that ſhe can never meet with her ſelfe. The lights of Heaven, which are the fair eyes of the World, they looke down upon the World to view it, and as they run and wander in the Skies, they ſurvey all things that are on the Center, yet the lights mine eyes, which ſee all objects farre and nigh, look not into this little world of mine, nor ſee my face in which they are fixed ſince nature fails us in no needfull thing, why doe I want means to ſee my inward ſelfe, which ſight might bring me to the knowledge of my ſelfe, which is the firſt degree to true wiſdome, that power which gave me ability to ſee externals, infuſed an in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward light, to ſee my ſelf by means of which I might have a perfect knowledge of my own form. But as the eye can ſee nothing without the light of the Sun, neither can the mind ſee her ſelf without Divine light, for how can art make that cleere which is dim by nature, and the greateſt wits are Ignorant both where ſhe is, and what ſhe is, one thinkes her to be Air, and another fire, and another Blood, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed about the heart, and that ſhe is compounded of the Elements, Muſitians ſay our ſoules are Harmonies; Phyſitians, the complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions.</p>

Some ſay that ſhe is all in all, and all in every part, and that ſhe is not contained, but containes all, and thus the learned Clerkes play at hazzard, and let them ſay, it is what they will; there be ſome that will maintain it, the only wiſe God to puniſh the pride of mens wits, hath therefore wrought this confuſion, but he that did make the Soule of nothing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd it when fallen to nothing, that ſo we might be twice his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can define her ſubtle forme and knowes her nature and powers: To judge her ſelfe ſhe muſt tranſcend her ſelfe, for fetterd men cannot expreſſe their ſtrength, but now in theſe latter dayes, thoſe Divine Myſteries which were laid in darkneſs, are brought to light: and this Lampe of God which doth defuſe it ſelfe through all the Region of the braine, doth ſhew the immortall face of it.</p>

                  <p>See how man argues againſt himſelfe; Why ſhould we not have other means to know? as children in the wombe live by the navil, but being come forth are nouriſhed otherwiſe, children if they had uſe of their ſences, and could hear their mothers tell them, that in a ſhort time they ſhould come from thence, they then would fear their birth, more then we fear our death, and would cry out, that if their navill ſtrings were cut, how ſhould their lifes be preſerved? ſince no other conduit brings their food; and if a man ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unto thoſe babes, and tell them when they come into this fair world, they ſhall ſee the Sun, Moon and Stars, Sea and earth, and meet with ten thouſand dainties, which they ſhall take in with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their mouthes, which ſhall be cordiall as well as ſweet and their little limbs ſhall grow unto tall bodies they would thinke it a fable, as we doe of the Story of the Golden age, or as among us many ſenſuall ſpirits hold the world to come a feined ſtage, yet thoſe infants ſhall find it true. So when the ſoule is born, for death is nothing but the ſoules birth, ſhe ſhall ſee ten thouſand things beyond her imagination, and know them in an unknown manner, them ſhall ſhe ſee no more by ſpectacles, nor hear no more by her double Spies, her ſelfe in inſtant will all things explore, for every thing is preſent to her, and lyes before her.</p>

As for ſuch as are detruded to hell, if they would come here, yet they cannot, but ſtill there are ſome wicked ones as ſay, that politick men have ſpread this lye of heaven and hell only to make men virtuous, ſo then it ſeems morall virtues be good, but they ſpeake this for their private gain, for that is the ſtanding of Common-wealths, wherein their private benefit is interreſted, but how can that be falſe that the Chriſtian, Jew, Turke, Perſian, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Canibal hold to be true, this doctrine entred not into the ear, but is native in the breaſt, if death ſhould deſtroy man for whoſe ſake all things was made, then ſhould he be more miſerable then Dawes, Trees, and Rockes, which laſt longer then he who is taken away at an inſtant, but bleſſed be that great power that hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man with longer life then heaven and earth, and hath infuſed into man mortall powers not ſubject to the grave, for although the ſoul ſeeme to bear about it her grave, and almoſt buried alive in this world, ſhe needs not to fear the death of the body, for when this ſhell is broke, there comes forth a chicken, for as there are three eſſentiall powers of the ſoule, the quickning power, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Sence, and alſo of reaſon, there be alſo three kinds of life defined her, in her due ſeaſon to perfect them all; The firſt life which is vegitive is that nurſing power ſpent in the wombe, where when ſhe finds defects of nouriſhment, ſhe expells her body and growes too bigge for that place, and comes into the world where all his ſences are in perfection, where he finds flowers to ſmell, and fruits to taſt, ſees ſundry formes, and hears varieties of ſounds, and when he hath paſt ſomtime upon this ſtage, his reaſon begins to be awaked, which although ſhe ſpringes when ſences begin to fade by reaſon of age; yet can ſhe make here no perfect practice.</p>
                  <p>Then doth the aſpiring ſoul leave the body, which we call death, but were it known to all what life our ſoules receive by this death, they would rather call it a birth, or Gaole delivery; for in this third life reaſon will be ſo bright, as her ſparkes will be like the Sun beames, and ſhall the reall <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Falſe Goſpellers undermine the true righteouſneſſe of God, and make the Goſpel nothing elſe but a ſlight imagination; we ſhould not entertain any ſuch conceit, as if Chriſt came with any new deviſe to bring men to heaven without the hard labour of mortifying their luſts, as if the intent of his coming was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate eaſe and liberty to the fleſh, and by his being crucifyed for us upon the Croſſe, to excuſe our crucifying the old man in our hearts, as if he had found out a way to ſave his people from hell and deſtruction, without ſaving of them from their ſins and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes 1. The poſſibility of attaining that righteouſneſſe that is required of us in the Goſpel it is by the power of Chriſt attainable, or elſe none could enter into the Kingdome of Heaven. He that is born of God ſins not, for his ſeed remaines in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God, and muſt we needs ſay that he that is born of God can and may doe nothing elſe but ſin? is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeed of Gods holy ſpirit, of Gods eternall word in the hearts of true believers, is nothing elſe but the ſeed of the Serpent, and the Cockatrice Eggs, it is poſſible that the divine nature that the Scripture ſpeaks of, ſhould be nothing elſe but the nature of the Devil, that Gods holy ſpirit in us ſhou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

If ſo then, ſurely the reaſon of this is either, becauſe Chriſt is not able to overcome ſin and Satan in us, as the <hi>Manikees</hi> of old dreamed, or elſe becauſe he is not willing, and that is a greater diſparagement to him then the former, for the other robbs him only of the Glory of his power, but this ſpoyles him of the Glory of his goodneſs; as if Chriſt ſhould envy that to us, which of all other things is the moſt neceſſary to make us happy; or as if God were not as carefull to advance his Kingdome of light,

here in the world, as the Devill is to inlarge his Kingdome of darkneſſe, as if God did not love his own butifull Image, his own ſon and nature, but would willingly ſuffer it to be choaked and ſmothered here in the world by thoſe Fiends of darkneſſe, whom he hath long ſince lockt and fettered up in chains of darkneſſe, and reſerved for the judgment of the great day. Say's the Philoſopher no man ſets up a marke on purpoſe that men might miſſe it, and ſhall God ſet up this marke of righteouſneſſe in the Goſpel as a Butt for us to aime at, for this very end and purpoſe, that all the world ſhould miſſe it; Can he that is the faithfull and true God put ſuch a trick of fraud and mockery upon his creatures? No ſurely, righteouſneſſe, evangelicall righteouſneſſe is the only thing intended <hi>per,</hi> ſee in all Gods Commandements, and ſin which is nothing elſe but a miſſing of the marke, comes in by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, ſin is that which God will either deſtroy and baniſh out of the World by the clear diſcovery of his truth in the hearts of men, or elſe he will at laſt chain it in the bottomleſſe pit to all eternity, and make the blackneſſe of it to be a ſoyle to ſet off the glory of his juſtice.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſuggeſted by ſome, that Chriſt will not therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow any true righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, or ſanctification upon a Saint, on purpoſe that he might keep him humble, as if the only way to make men truly humble, were to make them wicked, and as it men would be ſo much the more proud, by how much the more holy, and made truly partakers of the image of God.

reſigning up our ſelvs to him, to be taught &amp; led by him, we ſhould certainly find that his free ſpitit would inwardly lead us into all wayes of obedience, and that it would be as naturall and as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to us, to walke on in thoſe pleaſant pathes of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, as ever it was to wander in thoſe crooked wayes of ſin and wickedneſſe; nay the true Regenerate chriſtian, is ſo far from delighting ſecretly in the wayes of ſin, as the falſe hearted hypocrite thinks he doth, that there is nothing that more hurts and wounds his ſoule, then that he hath not a more lively ſence of evill; for the divine life in him being a delicate and tender thing hath the moſt quickeſt ſence of any thing that is contrary to it, and is moſt ingenious and induſtrious for ſelfe preſervation againſt it, wiſdome is eaſie to the wiſe, ſayes <hi>Solomon,</hi> and her wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſſe to them, and all her paths are peace, and ſin is the moſt ugly and forlorn thing in the world Let not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe evill ſpyes that bring an evill report upon this Land of Promiſe, diſhearten and diſcourage us, but let us goe on in the Power of God and his ſtrength, and exerciſe our faith in this, not only that we ſhall be freed from Fire and Brimſtone here after, but that we ſhall be delivered from the power of ſin, and Satan in our own hearts, this is that faith whereby we overcome the world; and if we had more of this faith in the power of Chriſt to deſtroy our corruptions in us, and to tread down Satan under our feete, and all that fond and ungrounded confidence, that God intends to ſave us while we continue under the power of ſin, we ſhould goe on more ſucceſſefully and proſperouſly in the way to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And it is a dangerous miſtake now under the Goſpel, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that God will ſave men out of a fond affection towards them, without renuing of their natures, and begetting his own ſon the new Creature in their hearts. Meerly for beleeving this very thing, that they ſhall be ſaved, as if it were poſſible for men to be made happy, without being delivered from the power of ſin, which is all one, as if we ſhould ſay that it were poſſible for men to be ſaved without ſalvation, ſurely ſuch as theſe think heaven no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a meer place without them, a fine gliſtering place, whoſe gates are of pearl, and the walls of Jaſper, and the bottome paved with ſtarrs, a very Turkiſh Paradiſe, for had they once taſted of the true pleaſures of the ſoule purg'd from ſin, and really eſtabliſht in the life of God, they would then ſee ſo much defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44697:22"/>
in ſin, that they would not accept of heaven upon ſuch terms as thoſe that is to be placed in an outward heaven, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward change and renuing of their mindes, without the conforming of their ſoules to the Image and likeneſſe of God; I am ſure a true Saint would not take heaven on ſuch conditions as theſe are, that he might enjoy all the outward pleaſures that are poſſible, that he might have a ſhining gliſtering body, that he might tread upon Stars, and flye upon the wings of the winde, that he might converſe with Cherubims and Serafims, Angels and arke Angels, if all this while he muſt continue filthy within, full of noyſome and ſtincking luſts, voyd of divine wiſdome that purges and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſoule, having a darke and ſottiſh minde, unruly affection, continually ſtrugling and quarrelling within.</p>
                  <p>God he may indeed diſpence with the puniſhment that belongs to ſin, he may forgive and pardon in reſpect of puniſhment, but he can never account thoſe truly holy, that are truly wicked, and bond ſlaves to ſin and Satan. Now this can never make us happy to be freed only from the puniſhment of ſin; we can never be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, till we be made pertakers of the life of God himſelfe, till we have the ſame minde and life in us that is in God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>If God ſhould account us righteous, except we were truly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a righteouſneſſe within us, I may ſpeak it with reverence, this could doe us no good, no true chriſtian would be contented with it, no more then a man that is ſick, could be contented to be accounted whole, or one that is poor and naked, could be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be accounted rich and cloathed, no more then one that is frozen in a cold winter night, could be contented to be accounted hot, nothing without us can make us really happy, till we be inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made pertakers of the Image of God.</p>
                  <p>But it is very plain and eaſie to diſcover the ground of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, becauſe carnal men deſire not ſo much to enjoy heaven, as to be freed from hell, or if they deſire heaven they deſire nothing at all in it, but only their own eaſe and carnall pleaſure, it would ſerve their turn well enough, if they could but have an artifice to get their ſins pardoned, that they might be freed from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is due to them, and might be admitted into a ſenſuall heaven, though they live to all eternity under the power of ſin and wickedneſſe, and never have the leſt taſt of the true heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, nor any knowledge of the name written on the white ſtone,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44697:22"/>
which no man knowes but he that hath it, and therefore it will ſerve theſe mens turnes well enough, if they may be freed from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin, while they love ſin with all their hearts, The true hearted chriſtian is really departed out of wicked <hi>Sodom,</hi> out of this noyſome ſtate of ſin, he is not ſo much ſolicitus about his ſtate, as about his life, that he may ſtill continue that heavenly life that is begun in him, he is not ſo anxious about his juſtification in a propoſterous method, as about the ſanctification of his heart and affection; that is the beſt way to be aſſured of his juſtification, he feeles the divine life in him, and that he knowes can never ſink him to hell, he drinkes of the true ſprings of everlaſting life, and knowes he ſhall never ſee death, he is not ſo much perplext about his future ſalvation, becauſe he findes he is already ſaved, becauſe it ſelfe hath taken him upon its wings, and carries him away ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly far from the region of death and Hell. I beſeech you let us not deceive our ſelves, without ſuch an inward frame of ſpirit as this is, that is really crucifyed to the world, and planted into Chriſt, ſucking life and influence from him. God himſelfe with what he can do without us, would never make us happy.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the deſtroying of this corrupt, naturall, and fleſhly life, we muſt alſo have a new and ſpirituall life begotten in us; For as Chriſt and the divine nature did aſſume the humane nature to it ſelfe, ſo likewiſe in every chriſtian the divine life, or the life of God muſt as it were aſſume the humane and created life of man, and totally act it and inforce it, this is the eſſence of the new creature, this is the life and ſoul of chriſtianity, the marrow and quinteſſence of all religion, to have a life wrapped up in man, that is the very life of God himſelfe, and whoſoever doth not pertake of this life, whatſoever opinion he entertains in religion, whatever outward forms of diſcipline he contends for, whatever ſects he belongs to, he is either carnall or deviliſh. For nothing of mans is pleaſing unto God, but that that God workes in man, and by man, and whatſoever workes with God according to that that is in God, this is in a manner one ſpirit with God himſelfe, and whatſoever it doth, it doth it in <hi>Forma Dei,</hi> that is, God uſing this mans ſoule and life, and abilities, doth act it in him. But whatſoever perticular created life, lives otherwiſe then the eternall life of God lives, this ſets up it ſelfe againſt God, and this is the life of corrupt nature, and the life of the Devill, this is ſin and nothing elſe, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44697:23"/>
live otherwiſe then the eternal life of God lives, and this was that that Chriſt came into the world to deſtroy, and how doth he doe this? ſurely no otherwiſe then by bringing Gods own life into the humanity; Again, for he himſelfe was nothing elſe but a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of God pitched amongſt men, nothing but a humane nature acted, and diſpoſed, and guided by the life of God, ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt lives, God lives in him, now this muſt not only be done by Chriſt without us, but the ſame alſo muſt be done within us.</p>
                  <p>One groſſe miſtake among men, that yet pretend much to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is very prejudiciall to the advancement of this ſpirituall righteouſneſſe that the Goſpel requires of us, and that is a conſeite that men have whereby they think that ſalvation is a meer outward work, and therefore may be wholly effected by outward means, whereas it is nothing elſe for the ſubſtance of it, but the inward transforming of our ſelves into the likeneſſe of God, the reall tranſlating of us out of the life of nature, into the divine life, or life of God, or the begetting of a new and heavenly life in the ſoule of man, that is the very ſame that doth every way agree with the life of God himſelfe; I ſay it with reverence God himſelfe cannot make us happy by any thing without us, but only by form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own nature and likeneſſe in us, they are carnall and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded men, and no way ſuitable to the ſtate of glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, that fancy the happineſſe of heaven to conſiſt only in things without them, and look upon it only as an outward place, and not as an inward ſtate and diſpoſition of the ſoule; I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſalvation it is an inward thing, and conſiſts chiefly in being ſaved from our ſins, and being delivered from our own life, and being tranſlated out of the Kingdome of darkneſſe into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of light and righteouſneſſe, and it is not a Heaven without us, though never ſo glorious and gliſtering a place, nay, it is not God without us that can make us truly and really happy, but it is God inwardly, ſetting himſelfe in our ſoules, and ſo dwelling in us that our ſins may be ſo ruled and guided by the life of God, as the members of our bodies are acted by our ſoules, and when this is once done, we ſhall at once live both the life of God, and injoy the joy, peace, and happineſſe of God himſelfe, which will all at once flow in upon us, I would not be miſtaken, I doe not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that there be ſome other inferiour circumſtances belonging
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44697:23"/>
to the ſtate of happineſſe, as the changing of theſe vild bodies of ours, and inſtead of this earthly tabernacle that weighs down the minde, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes, when as our ſoules were as it were now buried in a heepe of fleſh, they ſhall receive an other more divine Tabernacle that <hi>Paul</hi> calls a ſpirituall body, a more fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for our ſoules, and many other ſuch things anſwerable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I ſay theſe things I doe not deny, but yet all theſe things are of an inferiour nature, and all depend upon the former, the inward frame and diſpoſition of the ſoule, in which the ſubſtance of heaven and hell conſiſt. Now this being well conſider'd and underſtood, it is very plain that to thinke we can be ſaved without inward righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, meerly by ſomething done without us, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and reall change of our ſoules; is all one as to thinke we can be ſaved without ſalvation, or we can be made happy without the poſſeſſion of happineſſe, though we muſt ſtill remember the only procuring cauſe of our ſalvation, is the death ſufferings and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, who was made a propitiation for our ſins, this is therefore the reaſon for which this inward righteouſneſſe before ſpoken of is to be urged in the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not as if we could thereby merrit any thing at all at the hands of God, for we can merrit no thing, but there is nothing that God himſelfe can beſtow upon us in heaven better, then the partiſipation of his own life and nature, this inward change of the ſoul, this new creature is ſalvation it ſelf, and if we be not poſſeſſed of it in ſome meaſure here, we have little reaſon how ever we may fondly flatter our ſelves to think it ſhall be done hereafter, that is the firſt miſtake that I ſhall take notice of, that we are apt to conceive that ſalvation is an outward worke, and may be wrought only by outward means.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is another miſtake that is very neer a kin to that in matters of religion, and that is, when we ſeek for God we looke for God wholly abroad without our ſelves, whereas the only way to finde God is to turn our ſelves inward, and to looke for him in the bottome of our own ſoules, for if we could be carried up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſpheares, and pry into every corner of the ſtarrs in heaven above, certainly we ſhould as little find God there as we did on earth, if we could find God any where abroad without us, this could not make us happy, for then God would be really at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from us, but our happineſſe conſiſts in ſuch a reall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, as our Saviour diſcribes, 17 <hi>Joh.</hi> 22. <hi>The glory
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44697:24"/>
which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one as we are one; I in them, and they in me, that all might be made perfect in one</hi>: The heaven where God dwells in, and where alone he is to be found, is in a regenerate ſoul, and he that will indeed find God and be united to him, muſt not gaze and gad abroad, and turn his eyes wholly outward, but he muſt look to find him within, <hi>Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis animis,</hi> for there he may at once both ſee him, feele him, taſte him, and be united to him, God is never diſtant by place from us, for in him we live and move and have our being, but all our diſtance from him is only in the diſperſion, multiplicity, deſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſcatterings of our hearts, and in the diſſimilitude and diſproportions of our ſoules unto him, and when theſe things are once removed, then God appears to us who was never abſent from us, but only our eyes are now unvailed to ſee and behold him, God is every where alike to him that can feele him, he is only not preſent to him that cannot receive him, as the ſun ſhines not in a houſe where the curtains are drawn, and the windowes ſtopt up. This is the reaſon why many have ſo much adoe to finde God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they look for him as a corporall thing, they ſtill imploy their fanſies and imaginations to finde him without, and ſend them a roving, gadding, and wandering abroad after God, and have ſuch naturall and groſſe conceits of heaven, as if it were nothing but a Theatre, a place of ſights and ſhows, and God himſelfe were nothing but a more pompeous ſpectacle, there to be gazed upon by theſe bodily eyes; God I ſay is to be ſought by a Chriſtian within his own ſoule, and the way to find him there is, not by knowledge; or ſtudy, or ſpeculation, but by a leaving off all things, even our own wit and knowledge, and eſpecially our lives, and by abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves from the love of the world, and of our ſelves, and dying to them, and then out of this death will ſpring the true and heavenly light in which alone God is ſeen and known.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is yet another miſtake that is very vulgar and common, and that is, that men are generally very apt to conceive that God doth not require any endeavours, any activity of ours at all in the buſineſſe of Religion, and that God deales with us in matters of grace and ſpirituall things, as meer ſtockes, and ſtones, and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal creatures, and not in a way ſuitable to us, as we are free and rationall; This I conceive to be another miſtake that damps and choakes mens endeavours of ſubduing and mortifying their luſts,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44697:24"/>
for by this means we lazily ly down under the burden of our ſins, and think we may caſt the blame of our wickedneſs upon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he hath not given us ſtrength, he hath not given us power and ability, this is a ſtrong caſtle of ſin, in which men are apt to gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon themſelves againſt all the hearty exhortations and inſtructions which the Word of God, and the meſſengers of God bring unto them, whereas the Scripture every where calls upon us, to <hi>work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling, to make our calling and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure, to gird up the loyns of our minds, to fight the good fight of faith,</hi> and Chriſt himſelfe tells us, <hi>That he with his ſpirit ſtands at the doore and knocks, if any man open, and will hear his voyce, I will come into him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſup with him, and he with me</hi>; It is true, indeed it is not in our power to make our ſelves new creatures, to be regenerate and born again when we pleaſe, but as our Saviour tells us, <hi>the winde blowes where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, and canst not tell whence it comes, nor whither it goeth, ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit,</hi> but yet let us not deceive our ſelves, though this change in us be a new birth, and we cannot make our ſelves the ſons of God, no more then we can make our ſelves the Sons of men, we can indeed but <hi>Pati Deum,</hi> lye down and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer while he prints his own Image on our hearts, while he forms himſelfe in our ſoules; yet notwithſtanding let us not deceive our ſelves, there is ſomething for us to doe, and that the Scripture e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where calls upon us for, and that is, <hi>not to make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof, to put off the old man that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, according to the deceitfull luſts, to mortifie and ſubdue this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of death, that we carry about us,</hi> for though we cannot make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the new man in us when we pleaſe, yet we may concurr to the killing and deſtroying of the old, by refuſing to ſatisfie the luſts &amp; cravings of it, &amp; then by looking up to heaven, &amp; imploring Gods aſſiſtance that he would come down upon us the ſecond time, &amp; breath into us the breath of ſupernaturall life, we have therefore many gracious promiſes made to us in the Goſpel, on purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to faith in God, that he will be always ready to prevent us with his goodneſſe, &amp; to remove the wretched infidelity of our hearts, whereby our confidence in God is choaked &amp; all heavenly endeavours are dampt in us, the whole Goſpel was written to this end &amp; purpoſe, to deſtroy this infidelity, and aſſure us that we may come to God, &amp; that he is a rewarder of thoſe that ſeek him.</p>
