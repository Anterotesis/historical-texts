         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou have offered to mee that
which I confeſs I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon, when I wrote the
diſcourſ you have Publiſhed
under the name of a <hi>Reformed
School;</hi> which is, that ſom may
think by the waie of Education, which I
propoſe all Univerſities and eminent places
of Learning might ſubtilly bee undermined
and made uſeleſs, becauſ therein a waie is
ſhew'd how to initiate youths not onely to
the Principles of all Religious and Rational
knowledg, and in the Exerciſes of all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
virtues, but in the grounds of all Civil
emploiments, ſo far, as will make them fit
for all profitable undertakings in humane
ſocieties, whence this will follow (in their
apprehenſions) that they ſhall have no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49357:4"/>
by beeing ſent to anie Univerſities,
to attein anie further perfection: becauſ the
Univerſities will not bee able to add anie
thing unto them, which by their own Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie,
they may not afterward attein anie
where elſ, as well as there. Truly it never
came into my thoughts, either directly or
indirectly to make Univerſities uſeleſs; nor
can it bee rationally infer'd from anie thing
in the matter form or end of that diſcourſ
of mine: but I will grant that ſuch as can ſee
no further then what wee now ordinarily
attein unto; and withal think that there is
no <hi>Plus ultra</hi> in nature atteinable above that
which they have conceived, ſuch as I ſaie
may frame to themſelv's this jealouſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that diſcourſ: but if they would raiſ
their thoughts with mee a little above the
ordinarie pitch, and conſider what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man is capable off: and how far it
may, by diligent inſtruction, by Method
and Communication, bee improved: they
might rather bee induced to make this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
if the natural abilities of youths in
a School (when reformed) may bee thus
far improved: how far more may they bee
improved, when they are paſt the age of
Youth, and com to Manhood in Colleges
and Univerſities, if namely Colleges and
Univerſities, could in the ſphere of their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49357:4"/>
activities bee proportionally Reformed, as
the Schools may bee in their ſphere: for it
is rational to conclude thus: if the firſt ſtep
of our Reformation will lead us thus far,
how far will the ſecond and third lead us?
and if Scholaſtical Exerciſes in Youths of
eighteen or twentie years, will advance
them to that perfection of Learning and
Virtues, which few of double their age or
none almoſt ever attein unto, what will
Collegial and Academical Exerciſes (if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and ſet upon their proper Objects)
bring them unto? I ſhall therefore to eaſ
you, or ſuch as may have this ſcruple and
jealouſie over mee, declare that my purpoſe
is ſo far from making Colleges and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
uſeleſs, that if I might have my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
in them, they ſhould becom a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times more uſeful then now they are,
that is, as far above the ordinarie State
wherein they are ſet, as this School is above
the ordinarie waie of Schooling: for if wee
look upon the true and proper ends of
School, College and Univerſitie-ſtudies
and Exerciſes; wee ſhall ſee that as in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they are in a gradual proportion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from, and ſubordinate unto each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo they ought to riſe one out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and bee built upon each other's Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49357:5"/>
The true and proper end of Schooling
is to teach and Exerciſe Children and
Youths in the Grounds of all Learning and
Virtues, ſo far as either their capacitie in
that age will ſuffer them to com, or is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to apprehend the principles of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
matters, by which they may bee made
able to exerciſe themſelvs in everie good
Employment afterwards by themſelvs, and
as the Proverb is, <hi>ſine Cortice natare.</hi> The
true and proper end of Colleges ſhould bee
to bring together into one Societie ſuch
as are able thus to Exerciſe themſelvs in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
or all kind of Studies, that by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Aſſociation, Communication, and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in Reading, Meditating and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
about profitable matters, they may
not onely perfit their own Abilities, but
advance the ſuperſtructures of all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that perfection, which by ſuch means
is attainable. And the true and proper End
of Univerſities, ſhould bee to publiſh unto
the World the Matters, which formerly
have not been publiſhed; to diſcover the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and hurtfulneſs of things miſtaken for
Truths; and to ſupplie the defects and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderata,</hi>
which may bee ſervicable to all
ſorts of Profeſſions.</p>
                  <p>Now according to thoſe aimes and ends,
I ſuppoſe it may bee inferred, that none
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49357:5"/>
ſhould bee diſmiſſed out of the Schools, till
they are able to make uſe of all ſorts of
Books, and direct themſelvs profitably in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
courſ of Studie or Action, whereunto
their <hi>Genius</hi> ſhall lead them; and that none
ſhould bee admitted into anie Colleges,
but ſuch as will join with others, to elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſom profitable Tasks, for the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and facilitating of ſuperſtructures in
things already by ſom diſcovered, but not
made common unto all; And that none
ſhould bee made Publick Profeſſors in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
but ſuch as have not onely a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
aim, but ſom approved Abilities, to
ſupply ſom defects and to Elaborate ſom
<hi>deſiderata</hi> of uſefull knowledg, or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
ſuch as are ſtudious, how to order their
thoughts in all Matters of ſearch and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
for the diſcoverie of things not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
found out by others; but which in
probabilitie may bee found out by rational
ſearching.</p>
                  <p>Thus then I conceiv, that in a well-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Common wealth, which is to bee
ſubordinate unto the Kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt, wherein the Glorie of God, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of the nature of man: and the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
libertie of the Sons of God is to bee
revealed; all the ſubjects thereof ſhould in
their Youth bee trained up in ſom Schools
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49357:6"/>
fit for their capacities, and that over theſe
Schools, ſom Overſeers ſhould bee appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to look to the courſ of their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to ſee that none ſhould bee left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of ſom benefit of virtuous breeding,
according to the ſeveral kinds of emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereunto they may bee found moſt
fit and inclinable, whether it bee to bear
ſom civil Office in the Common-wealth, or
to bee Mechanically emploied, or to bee
bred to teach others humane Sciences, or to
bee imploied in Prophetical Exerciſes.
As for this School, which at this time I have
delineated, it is proper to ſuch of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
Gentrie and better ſort of Citizens,
which are fit to bee made capable to bear
Offices in the Common-wealth: the other
Schools may bee ſpoken off in due time, ſo
far as they are diſtinct from this; but that
which now I have to ſuggeſt is chiefly this,
that as out of the Schools the choiſ, which
ought to bee made for Colleges, ought,
<hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> onely to bee of ſuch as are
moſt fit to Advance the Ends of a Collegial
Aſſociation; ſo out of Colleges a choiſ
ought to bee made of Profeſſors for the
Univerſitie onely, of ſuch as are fitteſt to
advance the Ends of Publick teaching in
Univerſities, which are not to Repeat and
Compendiate that which others have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49357:6"/>
twentie times already, over and over
again, but to add unto the Common ſtock
of humane knowledg, that which others
have not obſerved, to the end that all theſe
degrees of Studies and Exerciſes of the
minde of man, beeing ſubordinate unto the
Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, the happineſs of
Man by all Rational and Spiritual waies of
improving humane Abilities, may bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
unto it's perfection in this life ſo far
as may bee.</p>
                  <p>But how far ſhort wee com now of all
theſe deſigns, I need not to relate unto you:
the Colleges as they are now Conſtituted,
can ſcarce reach to the half of that which
the Schools might bring us unto: and the
Profeſſors of the Univerſities com not up to
that, which the Collegial Aſſociations might
elaborate, if they were rightly directed to
ſet their Talents a work; and if the publick
Spirit of Chriſtian love and ingenuitie did
poſſes thoſe, that are poſſeſſed of publick
places in the Colleges of the Univerſities.
For if this Spirit did rule their Aims and
Endevors, there would bee no ſelf-ſeeking,
no partialitie, no envie, nor anie croſs act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for private ends, to the prejudice of
the Publick; but the generous love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and of profitable Learning, would ſwaie
all their inclinations to a free conjunction;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49357:7"/>
and make all their endeavors ſubordinate
unto the publick good of the Common-wealth
of Iſraël in the Communion of
Saints. But how far this Principle of acting
is now wanting amongſt us all, I ſhall not
need to mention: you have conſidered it
long ago, and wee have together lamented
that defect, and the doleful effects thereof:
our endevor muſt bee to ſeek out the beſt
means of a Reformation therein, and to
make uſe of them as God ſhall give us op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.
And truly ſomthing of this
kinde might bee don, without anie great
alteration or ſtir, even as matters now are
formed in the Colleges; if God would bee
ſo gracious to us, as to beget in the mindes
of thoſe that underſtand thoſe things, a
heartie Aim and Reſolution to benefit the
Chriſtian Common-wealth of Learning, by
their Collegial Relations and Aſſociations
one to another. For if men that are in genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
will call to minde the end firſt, for which
God doth give them all their Talents, and
then alſo for which men of publick Spirits
have erected Colleges and Univerſities, and
endowed the ſame with long and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
maintenances; that ſuch as are fit for
Studies, and called to bee Inſtrumental in
the propagation of Truth and Virtue, might
not bee diſtracted with the care of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49357:7"/>
World, in reference to outward matters,
but might have all the conveniences which
are imaginable to improve thoſe Talents to
the utmoſt, either ſingly or conveniently
with others, if (I ſaie) ingenuous Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
would minde theſe ends, for which the
benefit of their Talents from God and of
their accommodations from men to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thoſe Talents are beſtowed upon
them: it would not bee poſſible for them;
to bee ſo unthankful towards God, and averſ
from the rule of Chriſtianitie, and from the
love of doing good to the generation
wherein they live; that they ſhould intend
to lead a Collegial life onely for their own
private eaſ and conveniencie in outward
things; that beeing accommodated with all
neceſſarie helps of the Bodie, they may
pleaſ themſelvs onely in the courſe of their
Studies, with that Reſervation and Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs,
which is proper to a Monkiſh life
in Popiſh Cloiſters; wherein the Spirit of
Mutual envie, of detraction and diviſion is
more irreconcilably entertained, then in
anie other Societies of the World. For
their Cloiſter-conſtitutions, obliging them
onely to the obſervation of ſom formal
works as an <hi>opus operatum;</hi> for which their
maintenance is allowed them; they not
knowing anie further deſign of their life,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49357:8"/>
or any greater happineſs in this World,
then to pleaſ themſelvs; beſtow all the reſt
of their time and thoughts, as their natural
inclinations lead them, which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to nothing elſ but to ſelf-love and Pride,
which became a Provocation unto others,
to diſcover mutually their corruptions,
which by reaction make them all full of
envie, of hatred, of evil ſurmiſes, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
practices one againſt another: ſo
that no where Satan doth dwel and rule
more effectually, then in thoſe Religious
Houſes, as they are falſly ſo called. How
much of this Monkiſh diſpoſition doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as yet in the formal Conſtitutions of
Colleges, or in the Spirits of thoſe that
partake of Collegial accommodations, is
not a thing which I ſhall take upon me to
Judg; but I ſhall leav it to God, and to
his daie to diſcover; onely I would bee
glad that all ſuch as are true Iſraelites, and
know the end of their calling unto Chriſt,
and are not willing to burie their Talents,
or to make them uſeleſs unto others, for
whoſe ſakes they have received them would
laie this matter to heart, that their Aim in
a Collegial life, ſhould not bee to enjoie
an eaſie careleſs waie of ſubſiſtence by and
for themſelvs, to follow private fancies in
their Studies about matters of Learning;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49357:8"/>
but that they ſhould minde the ſtewardſhip
of their gifts and places, and tbe advantages
of their Aſſociation, whereby they might
bee, (if they would make uſe of it) able
to elaborate ſom tasks, which otherwiſe
cannot bee brought to anie perfection, for
the building up of the Citie of God in our
generations. There is no want of parts and
abilities in the Spirits of our men, but the
waie to order them for publick Uſe, and to
bring them together as ſtones fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
to make up a perfect Palace, is that
which make's us all uſeleſs one to another;
wee finde that now and then, as it were by
chance, ſom exquiſite pieces of Learning,
which ſom have been hatching all their life
time drop out; wherein appear's, beſides the
uſefulneſs of the Subject, or the uſeleſneſs
thereof, ſom inclination to bee found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie;
but theſe endevors, disjoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from publick Aims, advance little or
nothing, the Happineſs, which true Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rightly ordered in all the parts thereof;
and Subordinate unto Chriſtianitie, is able
to bring unto Mankind. Such pieces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſerv onely as a witneſs, to ſhew what
waſt there is of profitable time and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for want of loving combinations for
publick Deſigns. It is the obſervation of
Forreigners concerning our Univerſities,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49357:9"/>
that they finde in them men of as great
learning as any where elſ; but that they
lie as it were dead and unknown to the
whole world of other men of Learning;
becauſ they delight to live a retired and
unſociable life: this humor therefore amongſt
other parts of our Reformation, muſt by
ſom Goſpel-principles and Rational in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
bee Reformed, not onely in
Colleges but in other Aſſociations. The

bee in caſes of ſtrife and debate, wherein
men are over-heated: for then indeed ſom
will ſtand upon the point of Honor, to
the hazard of their temporal profits: but
to ſpeak in particular of Librarie-Keepers,
in moſt Univerſities that I know; nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in all, their places are but Mercenarie,
and their emploiment of little or no uſe
further, then to look to the Books com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their cuſtodie, that they may not
bee loſt; or embezeled by thoſe that uſe
them: and this is all.</p>
                     <p>I have been informed, that in Oxford
(where the moſt famous Librarie now
exſtant amongſt the Proteſtant-Chriſtians is
kept,) the ſetled maintenance of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie-keeper
is not above fiftie or ſixtie
pound <hi>per annum;</hi> but that it is accidentally,
<hi>viis &amp; modis</hi> ſomtimes worth an hundred
pound: what the accidents are, and the
waies by which they com, I have not been
curious to ſearch after; but I have thought,
that if the proper emploiments of Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie-keepers
were taken into conſideration
as they are, or may bee made uſeful to the
advancement of Learning; and were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49357:11"/>
and mainteined proportionally to
the ends, which ought to bee intended
thereby; they would bee of exceeding
great uſe to all ſorts of Scholars, and have
an univerſal influence upon all the parts of
Learning, to produce and propagate the
ſame unto perfection. For if Librarie-keepers
did underſtand themſelvs in the
nature of their work, and would make
themſelvs, as they ought to bee, uſeful in
their places in a publick waie; they ought
to becom Agents for the advancement of
univerſal Learning: and to this effect I could
wiſh, that their places might not bee made,
as everie where they are, Mercenarie, but
rather Honorarie; and that with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
allowance of two hundred pounds a
year; ſom emploiments ſhould bee put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them further then a bare keeping of the
Books. It is true that a fair Librarie, is not
onely an ornament and credit to the place
vvhere it is; but an uſeful commoditie by
it ſelf to the publick; yet in effect it is no
more then a dead Bodie as novv it is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
in compariſon of vvhat it might bee,
if it vvere animated vvith a publick Spirit
to keep and uſe it, and ordered as it might
bee for publick ſervice. For if ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovvance
vvere ſetled upon the emploiment
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49357:12"/>
as might maintain a man of parts and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thoughts, then a condition might bee
annexed to the beſtowing of the Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that none ſhould bee called thereunto but
ſuch as had approved themſelvs zealous and
profitable in ſom publick waies of Learning
to advance the ſame, or that ſhould bee
bound to certain tasks to bee proſecuted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that end, whereof a Liſt might bee
made, and the waie to trie their Abilities in
proſecuting the ſame ſhould bee deſcribed,
leaſt in after times, unprofitable men creep
into the place, to fruſtrate the publick of
the benefit intended by the Doners towards
poſteritie. The proper charge then of the
Honorarie Librarie-Keeper in an Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſhould bee thought upon, and the end
of that Imploiment, in my conception, is to
keep the publick ſtock of Learning, which
is in Books and Manuſcripts to increaſ it,
and to propoſe it to others in the waie
which may bee moſt uſeful unto all; his
work then is to bee a Factor and Trader
for helps to Learning, and a Treaſurer to
keep them, and a diſpenſer to applie them
to uſe, or to ſee them well uſed, or at leaſt
not abuſed; And to do all this, Firſt a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,</hi>
of the Treaſurie committed unto
his charge is to bee made, that is all the
Books and Manuſcripts, according to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49357:12"/>
Titles whereunto they belong, are to bee
ranked in an order moſt eaſie and obvious
to bee found, which I think is that of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and Languages; when firſt all the
Books are divided into their <hi>ſubjectam mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi>
whereof they Treat, and then everie
kinde of matter ſubdivided into their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Languages: And as the Catalogue
ſhould bee ſo made, that it may alwaies bee
augmented as the ſtock doth increaſ; ſo
the place in the Librarie muſt bee left open
for the increaſ of the number of Books in
their proper Seats, and in the Printed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,
a Reference is to bee made to the
place where the Books are to bee found in
their Shelvs or repoſitories. When the
ſtock is thus known and fitted to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the view of the Learned World,
Then the waie of Trading with it, both at
home and abroad, is to bee laid to heart
both for the increaſ of the ſtock, and for
the improvement of it to uſe. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſ
of the ſtock both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
correſpondencie ſhould bee held
with thoſe that are eminent in everie Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to Trade with them for their profit,
that what they want and wee have, they
may receiv upon condition, that what they
have and wee want, they ſhould impart in
that facultie wherein their eminencie doth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49357:13"/>
lie; As for ſuch as are at home eminent in
anie kinde, becauſ they may com by Native
right to have uſe of the Librarie-Treaſure,
they are to bee Traded vvithal in another
vvaie, <hi>viz.</hi> that the things vvhich are gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from abroad, vvhich as yet are not made
common, and put to publick uſe ſhould bee
promiſed and imparted to them for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſ
of their private ſtock of knowledg,
to the end that what they have peculiar,
may alſo bee given in for a requital, ſo that
the particularities of gifts at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
are to meet as in a Center in the
hand of the Librarie-keeper, and hee is to
Trade with the one by the other, to cauſ
them to multiplie the publick ſtock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hee is a Treaſurer and Factor.</p>
                     <p>Thus hee ſhould Trade with thoſe that
are at home and abroad out of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
and with thoſe that are within the
Univerſitie, hee ſhould have acquaintance
to know all that are of anie parts, and how
their vein of Learning doth lie, to ſupplie
helps unto them in their faculties from
without and from within the Nation, to
put them upon the keeping of correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie
vvith men of their ovvn ſtrain, for
the beating out of matters not yet elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Sciences; ſo that they may bee as
his Aſſiſtants and ſubordinate Factors in his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49357:13"/>
Trade and in their own for gaining of
knowledg: Now becauſ in all publick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
it is fit that ſom inſpection ſhould
bee had over thoſe that are intruſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
therefore in this Factorie and Trade
for the increaſ of Learning, ſom tie ſhould
bee upon thoſe Librarie-keepers to oblige
them to carefulneſs.</p>
                     <p>I would then upon this account, have an
Order made that once in the year, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie-keeper
ſhould bee bound to give an
account of his Trading, and of his Profit in
his Trade (as in all humane Trades Factors
ought, and uſe to do to their principals at
leaſt once a year) and to this effect I would
have it ordered, that the chief Doctors of
each facultie of the Univerſitie, ſhould meet
at a Convenient time in a week of the year,
to receiv the Accounts of his Trading, that
hee may ſhew them wherein the ſtock of
Learning hath been increaſed, for that year's
ſpace; and then hee is to produce the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
which hee hath gained from abroad,
and laie them before them all, that everie
one in his own facultie m<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> declare in the
preſence of others, that which hee thinketh
fit to bee added to the publick ſtock, and
made common by the Catalogue of Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals,
which everie year within the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
is to bee publiſhed in writing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49357:14"/>
within the Librarie it ſelf, and everie three
years (or ſooner as the number of Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
may bee great, or later, if it bee ſmal)
to bee put in Print and made common to
thoſe that are abroad. And at this giving
up of the accounts, as the Doctors are to
declare what they think worthie to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the common ſtock of Learning, each
in their Facultie; ſo I would have them ſee
what the Charges and Pains are whereat the
Librarie-Keeper hath been, that for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
the extraordinarie expences
in correſpondencies and tranſcriptions for
the publick good, may bee allowed him out
of ſom Revenues, which ſhould bee ſet a
part to that effect, and diſpoſed of accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their joint-conſent and judgment in
that matter. Here then hee ſhould bee
bound to ſhew them the Liſts of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents,
the Letters from them in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to his, and the reckoning of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
expence ſhould bee allowed him
in that which hee is indebted, or hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid out to procure Rarities into the
ſtock of Learning. And becauſ I underſtand
that all the Book-Printers or Stationars of
the Common-wealth are bound of everie
Book which is Printed, to ſend a Copie into
the Univerſitie Librarie; and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for one man to read all the Books in all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49357:14"/>
Faculties, to judg of them what worth
there is in them; nor hath everie one Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
to judge of all kinde of Sciences what
everie Autor doth handle, and how ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently;
therefore I would have at this
time of giving accounts, the Librarie-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
alſo bound to produce the Catalogue of
all the Books ſent unto the Univerſitie's
Librarie by the Stationars that Printed
them; to the end that everie one of the
Doctors in their own Faculties ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
whether or no they ſhould bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and where they ſhould bee placed in
the Catalogue of Additionals; For I do not
think that all Books and Treaties which in
this age are Printed in all kindes, ſhould bee
inſerted into the Catalogue, and added to
the ſtock of the Librarie, diſcretion muſt
bee uſed and confuſion avoided, and a
courſ taken to diſtinguiſh that which is
profitable, from that which is uſeleſs; and
according to the verdict of that Societie,
the uſefulneſs of Books for the publick is to
bee determined; yet becauſ there is ſeldom
anie Books wherein there is not ſomthing
uſeful, and Books freely given are not to
bee caſt away, but may bee kept, therefore
I would have a peculiar place appointed for
ſuch Books as ſhall bee laid aſide to keep
them in, and a Catalogue of their Titles
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49357:15"/>
made Alphabetically in reference to the
Autor's name, with a note of diſtinction to
ſhew the Science to which they are to bee
referred. Theſe thoughts com thus ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
into my head, which in due time may
bee more fully deſcribed, if need bee, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if, upon the ground of this account, ſom
competencie ſhould bee found out and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to maintein ſuch charges as will bee
requiſite, towards the advancement of the
Publick good of Learning after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                     <p>IN my laſt I gave you ſom incident
thoughts, concerning the improvement
of an Honorarie Librarie-keeper's-place, to
ſhew the true end and uſe thereof, and how
the keepers thereof ſhould bee regulated
in the Trade, which hee is to drive for the
Advancement of Learning, and encouraged
by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mpetent maintenance, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in extraordinarie expences for the
ſame. Now I wiſh that ſom men of publick
Spirits and lovers of Learning, might bee
made acquainted with the Action, upon
ſuch grounds as were then briefly ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
who know's but that in time ſomthing
might bee offered to the Truſtees of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with better conceptions then theſe
I have ſuggeſted.</p>
                     <p>For, if it bee conſidered that amongſt
manie Eminencies of this Nation, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie
of Oxford is one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
for the advancement of Learning,
if rightly improved and Traded withal for
the good of Scholars at home and abroad;
If this (I ſaie) bee rightly conſidered and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49357:16"/>
repreſented to the publick Reformers of
this age, that by this means this Nation
as in other things, ſo eſpecially for Pietie
and Learning, and by the advancement of
both, may now bee made more glorious
then anie other in the world; No doubt
ſuch as in the Parlament know the worth
of Learning will not bee averſ from further
overtures, which may bee made towards
this purpoſe. What a great ſtir hath been
heretofore, about the Eminencie of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie
of Heidelberg, but what uſe was
made of it? It was ingroſſed into the hands
of a few, till it became a Prey unto the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Truth. If the Librarie-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
had been a man, that would have traded
with it for the increaſ of true Learning, it
might have been preſerved unto this daie
in all the rarities thereof, not ſo much by
the ſhuttings up of the multitude of Books,
and the rareneſs thereof for antiquitie, as
by the underſtandings of men and their
proficiencie to improv and dilate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
upon the grounds which hee might
have ſuggeſted unto others of parts,
and ſo the Librarie-rarities would not onely
have been preſerved in the ſpirits of men,
but have fructified abundantly therein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this daie, whereas they are now loſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ
they were but a Talent digged in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49357:16"/>
ground; And as they that had the keeping
of that Librarie made it an Idol, to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
and worſhipped for a raritie by an
implicite faith, without anie benefit to
thoſe who did eſteem of it a far off: ſo it
was juſt with God that it ſhould fall into
the hands of thoſe that in all things follow
an Idolatrous waie, to blinde men with
ſhewes without all realitie of ſubſtantial
virtue, which is onely eminent in this, that
it becometh profitable unto all, by dilating
the light of knowledg, and the love of grace
and goodneſs in the hearts of all men, that
are fit to receiv the one and the other;
And where this Aim is not in thoſe that
are intruſted with publick places; there
they in the end will bee found unprofitable
ſervants; for the truſt which God hath put
into their hands to profit withal, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
not for the account which everie
one is to give unto him of his Stewardſhip,
is not how careful hee hath kept things of
uſe unto himſelf, to pride himſelf in the
poſſeſſion of that which others have not,
(as the cuſtom of men is, that know not
what true glorie is) but how faithfully and
diligently hee hath diſtributed the ſame to
ſuch as were worthie thereof for their
good, that they might bee ſtirred up both
to glorifie God for his goodneſs; and to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49357:17"/>
imitate him in the Communication of all
good things unto others for his ſake freely.
This was Chriſt's Work on Earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv
us, unto the Glorie of God; this was
that vvhich hee taught by this practice, that
it is <hi>more bleſſed to give, then to receiv.</hi>
This is that which this envious World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
relliſh, and vvhat ſtop's the current of
true love in the hearts of men? Nothing
ſo much as the ſelf-ſeeking of men in the
vvaies of Learning, by vvhich they cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly
obſtruct the fountains of life and
comfort, vvhich might overflow and vvater
abundantly the barren and thirſtie Souls of
thoſe that periſh for vvant of addreſs nnto
vviſdom; vvhich in all the vvaies of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and divine Learning might bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advanced, by the induſtrie of one man in
ſuch a place, vvhoſe Trade ſhould bee ſuch
as I formerly deſcribed, to deal vvith the
ſpirits of all men of parts, to ſet them a
vvorking one by and towards another, upon
the ſubjects vvhich hee ſhould bee intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vvithal to keep in the ſtock of Learning.
It is the Glorie and Riches of Nations and
of great Cities, to make themſelvs the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Trade for all their Neighbors; and if
they can finde vvaies of politie, to oblige
their Neighbors to receiv from their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines
the Commodities whereof they ſtand
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49357:17"/>
in need, it is everie vvaie a great benefit
unto the State, ſo it may bee in matters of
Learning, and by the Trade of Sciences this
Church may oblige all the Neighbor
Churches, and that Univerſitie all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiners
that Trade in knowledge to receiv
pretious Commodities, whereof they ſtand
in need, from our Magazines and Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes;
if a painful Steward and diſpenſer
thereof, bee imploied and mainteined to
uſe induſtrie for ſo bleſſed a work, from
whence much Glorie to God in the Goſpel,
and honor will redound to the Nation. For
although the waies of humane Learning are
almoſt infinite and wonderfully various,
and have their peculiar uſes in the outward
life of man, for which moſt men affect them,
yet in one that is to minde the univerſal
good of all, the whole varietie and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of matters uſeful unto this preſent life,
as they com within the ſphere of Learning
muſt bee reduced, and may bee ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
unto the advancement of the Goſpel
of Chriſt, wherein the Glorie of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at this and all times ſhould bee thought
to ſtand: And truly that is the thing which
take's moſt with mee, for which I would
have that Librarie thus improved by a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
keeper, that when his Trade is ſet on
foot, with all thoſe that are of eminent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49357:18"/>
parts in their ſeveral faculties, wee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
who they are and wherein their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies
do lie, may have opportunities to
provoke them to the right uſe thereof, by
giving them Objects from our ſtore; and
furniſhing them with tasks and matters to
bee elaborated, which cannot bee diverted
from the ſcope of God's glorie to bee made
known unto all men in Jeſus Chriſt, for
there is nothing of knowledg in the minde
of man, which may not bee conveniently
referred to the virtues of God in Chriſt,
whereby the humane nature is to bee exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that dignitie whereunto hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, that it ſhould by him rule over
the whole Creätion. And the want of this
Aim to look upon things in order to him,
and to ſet them a working without relation
to him, is that which blaſt's all our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors,
and make's them determin in confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and diſorder; For whatſoëver is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in it's own place with ſom reference
unto him muſt bee overthrown; nor is there
anie waie left for anie to proſper in that
which hee undertaketh, but to learn to
know him and reſpect him in it, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Kingdom over the Souls
of men, which by the Sanctified uſe of all
knowledg is chiefly effected. If then the
Trade of Learning is to bee ſet a foot in a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49357:18"/>
publick waie, and regulated to deſerv the
countenance of a Religious State, this Aim,
and the waie of proſecuting of it muſt bee
intended and beaten out; For except Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
bee reformed in order to this Scope,
the increaſ of knowledg will increaſ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſtrife, pride and confuſion, from
whence our ſorrows will bee multiplied
and propagated unto poſteritie; but if hee,
who is to bee intruſted with the managing
of this Trade, bee addreſſed in the waie
which leadeth unto this Aim without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie,
his negotiation will bee a bleſſing
unto this age and to poſteritie.</p>

And this is the <hi>Idéa,</hi> vvhich I have
long framed to my ſelf, according to

for an undoubted truth, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt

<hi>in anie thing,</hi> is to propoſe
to our ſelvs the perfecteſt <hi>Idéa's</hi> that
vvee can imagine, then to ſeek the

<hi>Idéa</hi> prove too high for us, to reſt our

                  </p>
                  <p>As for this preſent <hi>Idéa,</hi> I am ſo far
from counting it <hi>meerly-impoſſible,</hi> that
I ſee not vvhy it might not bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

                  <p>The excellencie of this vvork,
make's me vviſh mine ovvn Nation
the honor of <hi>firſt</hi> undertaking and
perfecting this deſign, And I conceiv
I have ſom reaſon to hope that it
vvill bee ſo. For, though I knovv
fevv or none that are both able and
vvilling to promote deſigns of this

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49357:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perſvvaded that this Kingdom is ſo
deſtitute of learned Nobilitie and
Gentrie, that there can bee found
none to countenance and advance
<hi>this</hi> part of Learning, even in <hi>this</hi>
vvaie, if they could ſee it poſſible and
likely to bee effected.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Librarie</hi> and <hi>Catalogue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1.2</note>
there can bee no doubt but they may
eaſily bee had, if Monie bee not

of this Nation (if they be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

men able to encounter all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and to endure all the labor,
that they muſt needs meet vvith in

notvvithſtanding the vvant of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

                     <note place="margin">3.</note> I ſhould laie heavier Lavvs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49357:24"/>
upon my ſelf, than I have alreadie
mentioned; namely, <hi>Firſt</hi> to laie
dovvn ſuch an exact <hi>Method</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the proceſs of Man's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in inventions, that <hi>afterward</hi>
it ſhould bee imputed meerly to my
negligence and diſobedience to my
ovvn Lavvs, [and not to their inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie]
if, from my firſt grounds,
ſeeds, or principles, I did not, in an
orderlie vvaie, according to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
Method, deduce, not onely
all that ever is to bee found in our
Anteceſſor's vvritings, and vvhatſoë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they may ſeem to have thought
on, but alſo all the Mathematical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
Theoremes, Problems and
Precepts, that it is poſsible for the
vvorking vvits of our ſucceſſors to
light upon, and that in one certain,
unchanged order, from the firſt ſeeds
of Mathematics, to their higheſt and
nobleſt applications, as vvell as to
the meaneſt and moſt ordinarie.
Not ſetting them dovvn at random
as they com in my head, as thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us have don, ſo that they ſeem
to have light upon their Problems
and the ſolutions of them by chance,
not to have found them by one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49357:25"/>
conſtant, invariable proceſs
of Art. Yet ſuch an Art may men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
if they accuſtom themſelvs, as
I have long don, to conſider, not
onely the <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> of men's vvorks,
and the <hi>meaning</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of their
vvritings, but alſo <hi>how it came to paſs</hi>
that they fell upon ſuch thoughts,
and that they propoſed to themſelvs
ſuch ends, or found out ſuch means
for them.</p>
                  <p>Were theſe <hi>Pandects</hi> thus made
and finiſhed, I ſuppoſe it is manifeſt,
that by their orderlie, rational and
uniform compleatneſs, above all that
hath been hitherto vvritten, they
vvould ſpare after-ſtudents much <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
and time</hi> that is novv ſpent in <hi>ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

them, and <hi>ſtruggling</hi> vvith their
cloudie expreſſions, unapt repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
different Methods, confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
tautologies, impertinencies, falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
by paralogiſms and pſeudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphemes,
uncertainties becauſ of
inſufficient demonſtrations, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
much <hi>coſt</hi> alſo, novv throvvn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaie

the greater part vvhereof they had
perhaps been better never to have

                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49357:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And it may be ſom vvould like
the Method of that vvork ſo vvell,
as to extend it farther, and applie it
to other ſtudies; <hi>in ſpeculation</hi> imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this my vvarineſs, that <hi>no falſhood
