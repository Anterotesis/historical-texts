            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and <hi>Sylla</hi> (by the most cunning sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of mens minds) <hi>Salust</hi> in whom hee sayeth: there was an incredible height of spirite in concealing his courses.

As in the disaster at Cannae, (when all the worlde did ring out peales, that their fortunes were dead) they did nothing vnworthy themselues, that might bee a derogation to the auncient dignity of their name: for being driuen to that exigent, that

            <p>But little mindes hauing risen with a prosperous winde, are lifted vppe farre beyond the leuell of their owne discourse: Then they beginne to speake in a commaunding accent to condemne other mens actions, to affect singularitie, to vsurpe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due authorities, to contrauert in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument without respect, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuere with an vnflexible stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, perswaded that al things becom them, and thus drunken with vaine greatnes, founded vppon no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse

are easilie trayned into opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that their state was atchieued by their vertue, and that their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was worthy of a better state. But when they beginne to taste any disfauour, presently discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in themselues, they are eyther by seldome comfortlesse flatterers, brought to some vnreasonable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (as <hi>Claudius</hi> blinded with the false informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Pallas</hi> to adopt <hi>Nero</hi>) or else hauing no greatnes but outwarde, and standing on no true ground inwardly, are more ready to fall then calamity can depresse them, and presentlie like vile and abiect creatures, not aduenturing to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, dispaire of renuing, and reinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grating their fortunes.</p>
            <p>But as the best wine becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the egrest vinegar, and what degree of goodnesse a thing holdeth while it abideth in his nature, the same degree of euill it taketh, when it is abused: So this greatnesse of mind, if it be not accompanied with vertue, maketh men daungerouslie

            <p>A Witte too pregnant and sharpe is not good: It is like a rasor whose edge the keener it is, the sooner it is rebated, or like soft wood which is readie to receiue the impression of the Limner, but for warping is vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keepe, and therefore not fitte for any worthie portraiture..

            <p>For as euill eyes, although they they can see there is a Sunne, yet through weakenes cannot delight in the Sunne: so a mind ouerweighed with the violence of passions, hardly admitteth that freenesse of speech, which reason might warrant, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth such a Phisition, who can let blood in the right veine, and then againe binde vp the wounde.

            <p>By this obseruation of noting causes and effectes, counselles and successes, likenes betweene nature and nature, action and action, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and fortune is obtayned that wisedome, which teacheth vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate with ripenes of iudgement, to perseuere in thinges deliberated, to execute with readines, to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise

These prouoke vs to eschew their viletie and lacke of vertue, and to be rather viceles then greatly vertuous: and although they bee distasted by those who measure Historie by delight, yet they are of most vse in instructing the minde to the like accidentes.

            <p>In making vse of this Historie knowledge, we must not ascertaine to our selues the sequell of any thing to fall out iust according to the like case in the Historie, but determine of it, as a thing apte to chance other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: for an example only enformes a likelyhoode, and if we gouerne our counselles by it, there must be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance of the same reasons, not onelie in generall, but also in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities.</p>
            <p>In making iudgement of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and consideratelie applying it to our present interestes, wee must spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie regard the dispositions of the
