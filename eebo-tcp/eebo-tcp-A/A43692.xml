            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Which are known in this manner, in all Nations:</l>
               <l>And they are Feminines all, as I hear;</l>
               <l>And by that time you know it, you'll ſay 'tis clear.</l>
               <l>Firſt, by their names, as <hi>amare, amaris;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That is, one Mrs. <hi>Mary</hi> was Lady Mayoreſs.</l>
               <l>And indeed they love well three of the four,</l>
               <l>But the other they hate for evermore.</l>
               <l>And the reaſon why they love the firſt, ſecond, &amp; fourth,</l>
               <l>Is, becauſe they think 'em of very much worth;</l>
               <l>Becauſe they're pronounc'd long in the middle</l>
               <l>Syllable in the next line: and let the third go fiddle:</l>
               <l>For he in the middle is found to be but ſhort,</l>
               <l>And ſo by conſequence makes them no ſport.</l>
               <l>And being Conjugations, they are wedded</l>
               <l>To the other three, but will ne'r be bedded</l>
               <l>To the third; and I certainly know this,</l>

               <l>A very pretty, witty, and buxom Maid</l>
               <l>They'd lately got among 'em, as 'tis ſaid:</l>
               <l>And every one did think himſelf better</l>
               <l>Than the reſt; and ſo did ſtrive to get her.</l>
               <l>Says <hi>ego,</hi> I am chief of all the reſt,</l>
               <l>And therefore think I do deſerve her beſt.</l>
               <l>Says <hi>tu,</hi> Thou have her! what, 'cauſe y'are Foreman</l>
               <l>O'th' Jury? Yet ſhe knows y'are but a poor man.</l>

               <l>In's own behalf, more than any of they.</l>

               <l>Our Country is your Country all do know,</l>

               <l>And they for fear, it ſeems, did let her go.</l>
               <l>Then up the Court roſe, and did march in <hi>May</hi>

                  <l>To be the antient'ſt Street in <hi>London</hi>-Town.</l>
                  <l>The Croſs-leg'd Signe was there the firſt ſet up,</l>
                  <l>And likewiſe there was firſt a Taylors ſhop.</l>
                  <l>Their Arms are antient too, and well them fits;</l>
                  <l>Which is three Rampant Lice and a Cluſter of Nits:</l>
                  <l>Which Coat of Arms, with ſomething elſe, hath made</l>
                  <l>More Gentlemen of that, than any Trade.</l>
                  <l>And now I do believe you'd know the cauſe;</l>
                  <l>Have patience, and I'll tell you how it was:</l>
                  <l>An antient Gentleman that was decay'd,</l>
                  <l>(Who once had been a rich and ruffling Blade)</l>
                  <l>Brought's Doublet to mend to a Taylors houſe,</l>
                  <l>On which were creeping many a luſty Louſe;</l>
                  <l>But one more large and rampant than the reſt,</l>
                  <l>Which made the Taylor think he was the beſt</l>
                  <l>And chief of all that ſharp Back-biting Crew;</l>
                  <l>Which he took up, and cut him juſt in two</l>
                  <l>With his new Shears, and gave his Wife one half</l>
                  <l>To eat, and th'other half did eat himſelf.</l>
                  <l>And from that time did verily think that he</l>
                  <l>Was a Gentleman, and of antiquitie,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe that Louſe he knew had ſuckt before</l>
                  <l>Of the antient Gentlemans blood ſuch ſtore.</l>
                  <l>And's Wife likewiſe did verily think ſhe was</l>
                  <l>A Gentlewoman too for that very cauſe:</l>
                  <l>And ſo did write themſelves, do all we cou'd,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe they eat ſo much o'th' gentile bloud.</l>
                  <l>Nay, his man did ſay he was half a Gentleman,</l>
                  <l>Having lickt the Shears that cut the Louſe in twain.</l>
                  <l>Then he drank hard, which you know doth make us</l>
                  <l>Gentlemen all that are friends to <hi>Bacchus:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And when others would leave half i'th' Cup,</l>
                  <l>Yet he would always wind his Bottoms up.</l>

                  <l>He could not drink to mend his Bloud, I'm ſure;</l>

                  <l>Yet he excels them all in ſpight of their Ears;</l>
                  <l>Theirs came from one, his from a pair of Shears.</l>
                  <l>And whereas other men did call the Court</l>
                  <l>Behind their houſe, a Backſide; he, in ſport,</l>
                  <l>Commands them all to call't a Yard: for he knew</l>
                  <l>His Wife would be well-pleas'd with that name too:</l>
                  <l>And pleaſe her he muſt in all his diſcourſe,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe the <hi>grey Mare</hi> was known the <hi>better Horſe.</hi>

                  <l>Your Lawyers likewiſe much a Taylor praiſe,</l>

                  <l>Yet he muſt do't within a day or two.</l>
                  <l>A Taylor once was bid to make a Gown;</l>
                  <l>And who d'ye think 'twas for? 'twas for the Moon:</l>

                  <l>As Turky, Pig, Gooſe; and the chief</l>
                  <l>Was an excellent piece of Beef,</l>
                  <l>So large, it made the Spit to bend,</l>
                  <l>And a yard diſtance from either end;</l>
                  <l>And when't came up, there were two able</l>

                  <l>All that time o'th' year cou'd afford.</l>
                  <l>And then we did excel in Drink</l>
                  <l>Of ſeveral ſorts. Stay, let me think.</l>
                  <l>And firſt we had good humming Beer,</l>

                  <l>And yet to make up more variety,</l>
                  <l>Of Friends there was a brave ſociety,</l>
                  <l>So truly merry and ſo free,</l>
                  <l>I was ne'r in better Companie.</l>

                  <l>That ever yet was heard before,</l>
                  <l>His Buttocks being ſo vilely tore.</l>
                  <l>The Horſe whereon he then did ride,</l>
                  <l>Wore Whalebone-Bodies on either ſide:</l>
                  <l>For the Spur had made the Ribs appear,</l>
                  <l>As if you had Glaſs-windows there.</l>
                  <l>And then he had ſo ſweet a trot,</l>
                  <l>By that time I two miles had got,</l>
                  <l>As if it were for the very nonce:</l>
                  <l>For it diſlocated all my bones.</l>
                  <l>And then his trotting was ſo high,</l>
                  <l>He'd mount me up; then by and by</l>
                  <l>Wou'd let me down with ſuch a jolt,</l>
                  <l>I had much ado to keep my holt.</l>
                  <l>He once did lift me up ſo high;</l>
                  <l>(But here you'll think I tell a lye)</l>
                  <l>Far be't from me; I'm not ſo given:</l>
                  <l>For I heard the Angels ſing in Heaven.</l>
                  <l>You may think I hyperbolize,</l>
                  <l>But I hope you do not think 'em lyes:</l>
                  <l>For at that time I did beſtraddle</l>
                  <l>Such a faſhion'd uncouth Saddle:</l>
                  <l>For ſuch a one it chanc'd to be,</l>

                  <l>Saying, 'twas Wainſcot; you may believe it:</l>
                  <l>And I began to think ſo too.</l>
                  <l>It was ſo hard, I ſwear to you,</l>

                  <l>That turns all things to ſtone that's wood:</l>
                  <l>For I did find a riſing bump</l>
                  <l>O'th' top, which often hit my Rump;</l>
                  <l>And went to cut it, but on my life,</l>
                  <l>It ſoon turn'd the edge of my Knife.</l>
                  <l>I hope you think, when on't I rid,</l>
                  <l>A pleaſant Saddle I beſtrid.</l>
                  <l>In Stirrup-leathers I was bleſt,</l>
                  <l>'Cauſe they were like to all the reſt:</l>
                  <l>For they in pieces were ſo plenty,</l>
                  <l>I think in number almoſt twenty;</l>
                  <l>They were ſo patcht in knots and bumps,</l>
                  <l>And other riſings juſt like lumps,</l>
                  <l>That I proteſt I broke my knuckle</l>
                  <l>To draw the Leather through the Buckle.</l>
                  <l>The Buckles and Stirrups were with ruſt</l>
                  <l>So eat, that all that ſaw 'em, muſt</l>
                  <l>Seek for a Faith to believe that ere</l>
                  <l>They were iron, ſo unlike they were.</l>
                  <l>Yet I believe that I am able</l>
                  <l>To prove, that the ſtraps o'th' Saddle</l>
                  <l>Had once been Leather, when I had found</l>
                  <l>Two or three holes both round and ſound.</l>
                  <l>And for my Girts, I do proteſt,</l>
                  <l>I cannot tell whether 'tis beſt</l>
                  <l>To call 'em ſo: for one I found</l>
                  <l>Not ſquare, but excellently round;</l>
                  <l>Which makes me think that it was made</l>
                  <l>Juſt when the Roundheads drove their trade,</l>
                  <l>For its antiquity and make.</l>
                  <l>But for the other, if I may ſpeak</l>

                  <l>From off a Tree an Elder-ſtick,</l>

                  <l>Troth, friend, thought I, I'm o'thy mind:</l>
                  <l>For I am ſo much gaul'd behind,</l>

                  <l>How cou'd it then gaul any more?</l>

                  <l>Being ſo, to jeer me to my face.</l>
                  <l>Then I do every man adviſe</l>

                  <l>Sure I think it was good nature</l>
                  <l>Not to leave a poor dumb Creature</l>

                  <l>He ne'r did ſpeak as I did hear;</l>

                  <l>Beg relief from Country-men?</l>
                  <l>For ſome an 'um are like a Hog,</l>
                  <l>To reſpect him no more than a Dog;</l>
                  <l>Unleſs that he at <hi>Barking</hi> had bin</l>

                  <l>He was indeed a Jack in a Box: for he</l>
                  <l>Wou'd ſometimes Active and then Paſſive be.</l>

                  <l>But when Paſſive, and then did ſuffer moſt,</l>
                  <l>Yet wou'd he ſtill with <hi>glorior</hi> vaunt and boaſt.</l>
                  <l>Nay, their two Regiments did them ſo handle,</l>
                  <l>They both went out like a ſnuff of Candle.</l>

                  <l>And though that he did always end in r,</l>
                  <l>Juſt like a Paſſive, yet would he always car'</l>
                  <l>A fair outſide to <hi>amo;</hi> and ſo free,</l>

                  <l>Thus to conclude, and the truth to tell,</l>
                  <l>Had theſe three Regiments done their duty well,</l>

                  <l>And their Regiments deſcrib'd one by one,</l>

                  <l>The Indicative being the Primier Mood,</l>

               <l>And for a time to cloud the Crown,</l>
               <l>But for their lives not pull it down.</l>

               <l>Which did prognoſticate, I ſay,</l>
               <l>Their Arms ſhou'd firſt hang up; they, they.</l>
               <l>We were ſo far from putting down</l>
               <l>Their Arms, we ſet 'em up in Town.</l>
               <l>Nay, they were ſo highly grac'd,</l>
               <l>That ore the Kings Arms they were plac'd</l>
               <l>On every Gate about the City;</l>
               <l>Not ſooner done, the more's the pity.</l>
               <l>The Rump their Juglings ſo did handle,</l>
               <l>They all went out like Snuff of Candle.</l>
               <l>And thoſe who bought King or Biſhops Lands,</l>
               <l>At the happy Change, had their hands</l>
               <l>Eas'd of all that mighty trouble,</l>
               <l>After they'd brought the Rents to double.</l>
               <l>So may they all be ſerv'd, that perſiſts</l>
               <l>Not in heart and voice true Royaliſts:</l>
               <l>And alſo thoſe that do repine</l>
               <l>At this our Change; which by divine</l>
               <l>Hand was then ſo brought about,</l>
               <l>To ſcatter all that curſed Rout</l>
               <l>Who had deſerv'd it long before,</l>
               <l>For Cruelty, but Treaſon more.</l>

               <l>THough Squibs and Crackers thick did flie</l>

               <l>The Adventures theſe half ten did meet:</l>

               <l>Of Ribble-rabble met together,</l>

               <l>Cou'd ſcarcely ſave our Perriwigs:</l>

               <l>I forc'd was uſe both hat and hand,</l>

               <l>Though but through Lane or Corner turn'd,</l>
               <l>We did expect ſtill to be burn'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102357:48"/>Nay, we were forc'd to skip i'th' Gutter,</l>
               <l>But quickly we from thence muſt flutter:</l>

               <l>Hey Boys, ſays they: then look t' your face.</l>
               <l>So that we ſtill skipt up and down</l>

               <l>And beſides this Rabble-rout,</l>
               <l>We there did ſee a Rope ſtretcht out,</l>
               <l>Which was on two Balconies fixt,</l>
               <l>With Bonfires two or three betwixt;</l>
               <l>And then upon that dangling Rope</l>
               <l>We there did ſee a Rev'rend Pope,</l>
               <l>With Sword by's ſide, and Croſier too,</l>
               <l>And Trident in his hand alſo,</l>
               <l>And eke his Pontificial Gown,</l>
               <l>And Miter too, with Triple-Crown</l>
               <l>All made of Cards: And being thus,</l>
               <l>Methoughts it was prepoſterous</l>
               <l>For Cards made for the hand, not head,</l>
               <l>Or I'm like him in Faith miſled.</l>
               <l>But now I think I've found the knack,</l>
               <l>Why they of Cards his Crown did make,</l>
               <l>And on his head Card-miter wore,</l>
               <l>'Cauſe he a Cardinal was before;</l>
               <l>And his Supremacy ariſes</l>
               <l>By being the Head o'th' Cardinal Vices.</l>
               <l>But why a Trident in his hand?</l>
               <l>My troth, it puts me to a ſtand,</l>
               <l>That he ſhould <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Right aſſume,</l>

               <l>I'th' Bucentaure triumphantlie,</l>
               <l>To wed that State unto the Sea:</l>

               <l>Why did he at that time then do't?</l>
               <l>But now I think upon it well,</l>
               <l>The Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> we all can tell,</l>
               <l>Did overflow all <hi>Europe</hi> ore</l>

               <l>For this hundred and fifty year,</l>
               <l>Has put an ebb to's flowing here.</l>
               <l>Beſides all this, as ſome do ſay,</l>
               <l>He alſo had in's hand a Key,</l>
               <l>With Boots and Spurs, as in a fright,</l>
               <l>To ride away that very night:</l>
               <l>And with's Key, it ſeems, he meant</l>
               <l>To ope the City-gates as he went:</l>
               <l>For's Keys the Gates do ope, we know,</l>
               <l>Of Heaven above, and Hell below.</l>
               <l>But for all that, ſuch was his fate,</l>
               <l>To be that night unfortunate.</l>
               <l>The Squibs ſo pelted him, he ſwore</l>
               <l>He'd never come to <hi>England</hi> more,</l>
               <l>If once he got away: and ſaid,</l>
               <l>I now in my own Coyn am paid,</l>
               <l>For uſing Hereticks ſo bad,</l>
               <l>When I my Papal power had.</l>

               <l>Good riddance to your Holineſs;</l>
               <l>For we will never wholly be</l>
               <l>Addicted to your Roman Sea.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:102357:49"/>Which made him fret and fume the more,</l>
               <l>That we were forc'd to give him ore,</l>
               <l>And left him in that angry vein;</l>
               <l>Anon we'll ſpeak of him again.</l>
               <l>And ſo from thence we marcht away</l>
               <l>To <hi>Ludgate-ſtreet,</hi> there made a ſtay;</l>
               <l>Where we eſpied another Object,</l>
               <l>That to the Pope is trueſt Subject;</l>
               <l>And that's a Cardinal, who there ſate</l>

               <l>With all things fine, and all things pat,</l>
               <l>And eke had there his Cardinals Hat,</l>
               <l>Which fixed was upon his head,</l>
               <l>Whoſe Gown and that were coloured.</l>
               <l>The Rabble there made Applications</l>
               <l>To him ſtill in Squib-like faſhions;</l>
               <l>Which he did for an honour take</l>
               <l>Unto all Cardinals for his ſake:</l>
               <l>And glad he was to <hi>England</hi> come,</l>
               <l>Saying, He was ne'r ſo ſerv'd at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And when in this they grew bolder,</l>

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:102357:50"/>Unto a Cardinal heretofore,</l>

               <l>And with another Card'nal went</l>

               <l>Whoſe Noſe was very long indeed:</l>
               <l>No matter for that. But I'll proceed:</l>

               <l>And on mens ſhoulders did him toſs;</l>
               <l>Which does belong to Popes alone,</l>
               <l>But here to Cardinals 'tis ſhown.</l>
               <l>He marcht in pomp through every ſtreet;</l>
               <l>And every one that did him meet,</l>
               <l>When to adore cou'd not come nigh him,</l>
               <l>Did with their Crackers kindly ply him:</l>
               <l>Which he took kindly, and threw about</l>
               <l>His Arms, ſtill bleſſing all the Rout.</l>
               <l>At laſt he fixed was in's Station,</l>
               <l>And all's Brethren i'th' ſame faſhion,</l>
               <l>Fixed were in ſeveral places,</l>
               <l>Who boldly there did ſhew their faces.</l>
               <l>And though they Hereticks did us call,</l>
               <l>Yet coming before the Tribunal</l>
               <l>Of that great Rabble, they quickly found</l>
               <l>That they were Catholicks unſound,</l>
               <l>So Hereticks themſelves, and had</l>
               <l>Committed Treaſon, which was ſad.</l>
               <l>Nay, they the occaſion were, they ſay,</l>
               <l>That this was made a Holy-day;</l>
               <l>And ſo condemn'd them to the Flame,</l>
               <l>Though he with Long-noſe ſmelt the ſame</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:102357:50"/>Long before: and therefore did adviſe</l>
               <l>Them both to be merry and wiſe;</l>
               <l>And ſpoke to th' Pope, that he with's Key</l>
               <l>Shou'd open them the ready way</l>
               <l>To ſteal from all this Rabble-rout</l>
               <l>As faſt as ere they cou'd get out.</l>
               <l>But notwithſtanding his advice</l>
               <l>Which he had urg'd unto 'em twice,</l>
               <l>They ſo infatuated were,</l>
               <l>They thought the Pope cou'd never erre:</l>
               <l>Which makes it certain, the Popes Chair</l>
               <l>Is not infallible every where.</l>
               <l>And after they condemned were,</l>
               <l>I do proteſt I did not hear</l>
               <l>One word from either that did plead</l>
               <l>In their own defence; 'twas ſtrange indeed!</l>
               <l>Nor did they rail, nor ſcold, nor cry,</l>
               <l>But took their deaths moſt patiently.</l>
               <l>Nay, they were ſo very meek,</l>
               <l>Not one ill word I heard 'em ſpeak;</l>
               <l>But thought thoſe Flames to them a Glory,</l>
               <l>As being thoſe of Purgatory;</l>
               <l>And had no need of Pater-Noſters,</l>
               <l>Or Ave-Maries dirg'd in Cloiſters,</l>
