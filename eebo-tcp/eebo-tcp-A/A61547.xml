            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
Concerning the
Unreasonableness of a New Separation
On account of the
OATHS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>YOur former Letter gave me an Account of Your
own and others Dissatisfaction about the Oaths;
but your second carries the Point a great deal far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for therein you tell me,</hi> Those who are unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
think themselves bound to separate from the Communion
of those who have taken them; and that if Ease be not given
to the Scrupulous, new Congregations will be immediately for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
and therefore you beg my Assistance in clearing these
Points, in order to the preventing a New Separation.</p>
            <p>I was not a little surprized at the reading these Passages;
and I soon apprehended the mischievous Consequence of a
<hi>new Schism,</hi> especially among the Members of the Church
of <hi>England:</hi> But I can hardly think it possible that those who
have expressed so great a Sense of the <hi>Mischief</hi> of it in others,
should be so ready to fall into it themselves, and that
upon the meer Account of <hi>Scruples;</hi> when the Difference
is only about the Resolution of a Case of Conscience,
wherein Wise and Good Men may easily differ: But it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98150:4"/>
cannot be a Mark either of <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Goodness,</hi> to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from those who do so. Some think the Oaths lawful,
and therefore take them; others do not, and therefore
forbear: But is taking the Oaths made a Condition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with us? Is it required of all who joyn in our
Worship, at least, to declare, That they think the taking
of them to be lawful? If not, what Colour can there be
for breaking Communion on the Account of the Oaths?</p>
            <p>Suppose those who take the Oaths are to blame; If they
act according to their Consciences therein, what Ground
can there be of Separation from them for so doing, unless
it be lawful to separate from all such who follow the
Dictate of an Erroneous Conscience? And so there can be
no End of Separations, till all Men's Consciences judge
alike: for a Man's Conscience in his practical Judgment
concerning Moral Actions; and there are so many
Circumstances, which vary the Nature of such Moral
Actions, as Oaths, that I do not wonder to see Men differ
about them; but I should wonder and lament to see them
separate from each other for the sake of such a Difference.</p>
            <p>But, there is a great deal of Difference between a <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi>
and a <hi>Sowreness</hi> of Conscience. There is a natural
Tenderness in the Eye, which makes it apt to be offended
with Mores; and in that Case it is to be gently dealt with:
But when an ill Humour falls into it, there seems to be
greater Tenderness, but from a worse Cause; and then
the best way of Cure is to sweeten or remove the bad
Humor which caused it. I cannot imagine why, because
some Men's Consciences are so tender in the Point of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
that they cannot take the Oaths, that they must be
so tender too, as not to joyn in Communion with those
who do it. This seems to come from another Cause, and
not from the Original Scruple: Are they afraid of joyning
with others, not so tender as themselves? This is the
<hi>Scruple</hi> about <hi>mixt Communion,</hi> which hath been so long
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98150:4"/>
exploded among us. What then? Have we hereby changed
the Standard of our Communion, or are there in this Case im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
any new Terms of Communion with us? How then
comes a Scruple about the Oaths, to lead men to think of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration?
How come they to make so much Conscience of
one, and so little of the other? Is a Separation from our
Church become a Duty with those, who so lately looked
on it as so great a Fault in others? But, I perceive, a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conscience is like a tender Constitution, it is soon put
out of Order: So much greater Care then ought those to
have who forsake any worldly Advantages for the sake of
their Consciences, lest that which begun with a Scruple,
at last end in Humour and Faction, and the Ruine of that
Church, which they have alwaies pretended to value.</p>
            <p>But to leave these general Reflections, I shall now apply
my self to the main Point, Whether there be any Reason
for these Scruples about the Oaths? for if there be not,
it will be granted that there can be no Reason for a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the Account of them. If there be any Reason,
it must arise, either from the continuing Obligation of
the former Oaths; or from the Nature of the present
Oaths: And therefore I shall enquire into two things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Nature and Measure of the Obligation of
Political Oaths in general.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Difficulties which relate to our Oaths in
particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As to the Nature and Obligation of Political Oaths;
by which I mean such as have immediate and particular
Respect to Human Society, and the Government we live
under; as all <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> do.</p>
            <p>And herein the Difference lies between those and the
common Oaths between Man and Man; because these are
founded on an Equality of Right, but the other on the
general Security of Human Society.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98150:5"/>
In <hi>Political Oaths</hi> we must distinguish the particular
<hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> to whom they are made,
from the general <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of the <hi>Oaths themselves.</hi> I
do not deny but such Oaths at first came from the Mistrust,
which those in Power had, of such as were at present in
Subjection to them. And because the Fears of a Deity
made the strongest Impressions on People's Minds, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were not contented with bare Promises, but they
added the Solemnities of Oaths, that they might look on
God as concerned, both as a Witness and a Judge.</p>
            <p>But if we search narrowly into this Matter, the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
comes not from the bare Oath, but from something ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to it, or from the Promise contained in it, to which
the Oath adds greater Solemnity on the Account of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Less. de Iust. &amp; Iure, l. 2. c. 17 n. 52.</note>
And therefore it is generally resolved by the <hi>Civilians</hi>
as well as <hi>Casuits,</hi> That <hi>an Oath follows the Nature of the
thing about which it is conversant; for that,</hi> say they, <hi>is the
Principal, and the other is but the Accessary; and the Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
still follows the Nature of the Principal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even <hi>Molina,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Molina de Iust. &amp; Iure, tr. 3. disp. 150.</note> who is noted for singularity in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(for asserting, That an Oath added an Obligation of
Justice besides that of Religion) yet when he comes to
explain himself, he founds it on the Promise included in the
Oath, and not in the Oath it self: For after an Oath taken,
such as the Obligation was before, such is it after, and the
Promise contained in an Oath admits of the same Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which it would have had, if no Oath had been
joyned with it.</p>
            <p>If there be a Law, which makes a Contract void, on
the Account of the Publick Good, the adding an Oath to
such a Contract doth not make it valid: As for Instance, if
the Law of a Country makes void all clandestine Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
if a Man marries a Woman after such a manner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this be an Obligation of the strictest Nature: Yet
such is the Force and Power of Laws made for a Publick
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98150:5"/>
Good, that although the Intention of one Person was to tie
the other in an indissoluble Bond; yet the Law supersedes
that Obligation, or else it is made to no purpose, at least, so
far as it relates to the <hi>Civil Contract,</hi> which is as much as is
necessary to my purpose; for, even that hath an obligation
of Conscience going along with it, which however in this
Case is superseded for the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>I do not deny, that the chief Intention of those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> to themselves, is to bind men as
fast as may be to them; and there is a Personal Obligation
consequent upon it. But then, I say, that the Rule &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it, is not to be taken from such Intention of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but from the <hi>General Good,</hi> which was chiefly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in such things. For, there is a Common Good of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society, which Mankind have an obligation to, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to that obligation they are under to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
For, as Magistrates were designed for a general Good,
so the obligation to them must be understood so, as to be
still in subordination to the main end.</p>
            <p>And it is agreed on all hands, That an Antecedent and
Superiour Obligation doth void that which is subsequent
and inferiour, when they contradict each other; else an
Oath might bind a Man to sin; which no man will assert.</p>
            <p>Therefore whatsoever the Intention of the Persons was,
How strict soever the Expressions may be, if the keeping
of the Oath be really and truly inconsistent with the welfare
of a People, in subverting the Fundamental Laws, which
support it; I do not see how such an Oath continus to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige:
For, there is no Relation of Mankind one to another,
but there is some good antecedent, which is the just measure
of that Obligation they stand in to each other. Thus it is
between Parents and Children, Husbands and Wives, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Servants; and therefore it is most reasonable to
be so between Princes and their Subjects.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98150:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>A Vow to God is as solemn a thing as an Oath; but our
Saviour declares, if it hinders that Good which Children
are bound to take care of with respect to Parents, it ceaseth
to oblige. If Parents, instead of regarding the Good of
their Children, do openly design their Ruin, and contrive
ways to bring it about; none will say but that they are bound
to take care of their own welfare, although such Parents
may call it <hi>Obstinate Disobedience.</hi> For, even the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Parents, as natural as it is, is not Absolute, but is
limited by Reason and the Good of their Children. And
when they are of age, they are allow'd to judge of what
concerns their welfare, and (if it be necessary) to withdraw
from their Parents immediate care, but preserving a due
Reverence and Respect to them.</p>
            <p>The hardest Case we can suppose, is that of <hi>Slavery, i.e.</hi>
of <hi>Dominion by Force;</hi> but altho' the Law of Nations allows
it, yet it is with such limitations, as still shew, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the condition of men be, with respect to one another,
there is still a Regard to be had to the Benefit of those who
are in subjection to others.</p>
            <p>The only thing which makes a state of Slavery reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is, That when men are taken Captive by others, they
are at their Mercy; and the giving of life is so great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
as cannot be compensated by any thing less than a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Service; and in consideration of it, the Master is to
afford Protection and Maintenance. Still we see all reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
subjection is in order to some Good of those who are
under it; and without it, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>They are not used
as Men, but as Tools.</hi> And it is agreed by the best Writers
on this Subject, That if the Slave be kept in Chains, he is
under no obligation of Conscience to him that keeps him;
but he may find his own way to escape, because he is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as an Enemy, and therefore hath all the Right of War
on his side. But if he yields upon Terms, then he is under Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
but it is according to the Terms upon which he
yielded himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98150:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> indeed saith,<note place="margin">De Cive c. 8. n. 7.</note> 
               <hi>That those who submit upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
are capable of no Injury afterwards; because they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up their Wills already, and there can be no Injury to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mind.</hi> But this is very false reasoning; for himself
grants, That where there is such a Compact, there goes some
Liberty or Priviledge along with it. And it is not to be
imagined, that such who entred into compact for their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
should renounce all right to it when they have done
it; and if they have Right, they may be wronged. And in
the case of the greatest Slavery, <hi>Natural Equity</hi> was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and a <hi>Common Right</hi> was still due to Slaves,<note place="margin">Arist. Nic. l. 8. c. 13. Sen. de Clem. l. 1. c. 18.</note> as Men:
So that Nature owns no such thing, as meer <hi>Absolute Power</hi>
in some over others, meerly for their own advantage; but
all <hi>Reasonable Power</hi> supposes Consent, and a Good to be
attained by it. But when it is carried to a contrary end, it
is against the Intention of Nature, which lays an obligation
on some men towards others, with regard to a <hi>Common
Good,</hi> which cannot otherwise be attained.</p>
            <p>It is not denied by the strictest Casuists in these matters,
but that <hi>under a state of usurpation, notwithstanding their
Oaths to the Rightful Prince, men are bound to do those things
which tend to the Publick Safety as well as their own.</hi> But then
they found it upon <hi>a presumptive Consent of the absent
Prince;</hi> whereas, the true Reason is, That Men are in the
first place bound to promote the Publick Good, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially,
and with respect to it, to regard the Will of their
Princes, who are appointed by God and Nature for that end.
And if such be rendred uncapable of doing it, yet the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
on others remains. Whereas, if it depended on the
Will of the absent Prince, his <hi>presumptive Will</hi> would not
be sufficient; for that can lay no obligation.</p>
            <p>But, that the <hi>Publick Good</hi> is the true and just measure of
the Obligation in these Oaths, doth further appear, in that
the <hi>Oaths</hi> are <hi>reciprocal.</hi> Whereas, if only the Good of the
Persons to whom Oaths of Allegiance are made, were to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98150:7"/>
our Rule, then there would be no mutual Oaths. I am not
now enquiring how far in <hi>reciprocal Oaths</hi> one Party's fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
disobliges the other, but I am shewing, That it must
be a General Good that is aimed at when both Parties are
sworn to each other; so it was in the strictest <hi>Feudal Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,</hi>
the Lord was as much sworn to the Tenant to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and defend him in his Rights, as the other was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him in his Wars for the security of his Person. And
this was certainly founded on a mutual Contract, called by
the old Feudists <hi>Liga,</hi> and thence <hi>Ligeas</hi> and <hi>Ligeantia,</hi> and
so our <hi>Allegiance.</hi> The words of <hi>Glanvil</hi> and <hi>Bracton</hi> and
the <hi>Customary</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mutua qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem debet esse Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magii fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexio, ita quod quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum debet homo Domino ex homagio, tantum illi debet Dominus ex Dominio praeter solam Reverentiam. <hi>Glanvil. l. 9. c. 4. Bracton. l. 2. §. 2. Cust. Norm. c.</hi> 43.</note> are plain, to shew the <hi>Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Obligation</hi> in this Case, and the measures on both sides
were to be <hi>the Rights, and Customs, and Laws of the Land.</hi>
So that <hi>Allegiance</hi> originally implies a Compact, and is to
be measured by the <hi>Laws,</hi> which are the Standard of the
<hi>Publick Good</hi> of a Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> Having thus in general fixed these grounds to proceed
upon, I come to the particular examination of the <hi>difficulties</hi>
which relate to the present <hi>Oaths;</hi> and because we are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with <hi>Apostacy from the Principles of the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
and that is made the main ground of the designed Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
I would fain know what this Charge is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with respect to the Oaths, for that is all we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in. If any particular Persons have advanced new
<hi>Hypotheses</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Sense</hi> of our
<hi>Church,</hi> let them answer for themselves. The Case of the
Oaths is quite of another Nature.</p>
            <p>Here is no <hi>Renouncing the Doctrine of Passive Obedience,</hi> or
<hi>asserting the Lawfulness of Resistance;</hi> but the single Point is,
<q>Whether the Law of our Nation doth not bind us to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to a King and Queen in actual Possession of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98150:7"/>
Throne, by consent of the Three Estates of the Realm?
and whether such an Oath may not lawfully be taken,
notwithstanding any former Oath?</q>
            </p>
            <p>And by this very stating of the case, any one may see
how impertinent to this purpose the Book called the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> is; the truth is, there are not many
passages in it which come near the business; but those that
do, contain in them the main difficulties which relate to the
Oaths, and therefore I shall impartially consider them.
Which are these,
<list>
                  <item>I. That they are to the prejudice of a third Person.</item>
                  <item>II. That they are contradictory to a former Oath.</item>
                  <item>III. That the Person to whom they were made, hath
given no release or discharge from them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the first we have these Testimonies; Bishop</hi> Hall,
<hi>p. 46. saith,</hi> That a Promissory Oath, which is to the certain
Prejudice of another man's Right, cannot be attended with
Iustice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bishop</hi> Sanderson, <hi>p.</hi> 61. An Oath imposed by one that hath
not a just Authority, is to be declined as much as we can; if it be
forcibly imposed, it is to be taken with reluctancy, upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that the words imply nothing unlawful or prejudicial to
the Rights of a third Person; for if so, we must refuse the Oath
at the peril of our lives.</p>
            <p>I grant, it is a Rule among the <hi>Casuists,</hi> That an Oath
ought not to be taken <hi>to the Prejudice of a third Person;</hi> but
so it is likewise, <hi>That it ought not to be taken against the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zoës. in Dig. l. 12. Tit. 2. n. 66</note> and these two are often put together. <hi>It is a sin,</hi>
saith <hi>Zoesius, to make a compact to the publick prejudice and
injury of another; and an Oath that is conversant about such a
matter, is unjust, and not to be kept.</hi> So that the <hi>Right of a
Third Person</hi> is not to be taken as distinct from the <hi>Publick
Good;</hi> for, if it be inconsistent with it, there is no ground
to set up a <hi>personal Interest</hi> against a <hi>General Good.</hi> And so
far <hi>a Mischief is better than an Inconvenience;</hi> for it is a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98150:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Rule in Reason as well as Law,<note place="margin">Jus publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum pactis muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri non potest.</note> 
               <hi>The publick Right can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be changed by the Contracts of particular Persons, ff. l. 2.
tit.</hi> 14. If a Man takes an Oath to a <hi>third Person,</hi> to do
something which the Law forbids; although <hi>he suffers by
it,</hi> yet it is concluded, That such an Oath doth not bind,
because the <hi>Publick Good</hi> is to be preferred, <hi>As often as a
Compact doth depart from the Common Right, it ought not
to be kept; nor is an Oath requiring it to be observed.</hi> ff. <hi>l. 2.
tit. 14. Iuris Gentium §.</hi> 16. And again, <hi>An Oath against
the Force of Law and Authority of Right is of no moment.</hi>
What is the Reason that an Oath doth not bind against
the Law? Is not the Authority of God above that of Men?
No doubt of it; but since God hath established Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Laws for a <hi>Publick Good,</hi> their meaning is,
That Men cannot by any Act of their own be bound to
overthrow it, in what solemn manner soever it be done.</p>
            <p>It is resolved in the Text of the Canon Law, in the
<hi>King of</hi> Hungary's <hi>Case, That an Oath taken against the
good of the Kingdom, doth not oblige, de jurejur. c. 33. intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecto;</hi>
although it were to the Prejudice of others, because
it was <hi>in Praejudicium Regni sui, to the Prejudice of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
which was more to be regarded; and because it was
contrary to the Oath which he took at his Coronation, <hi>Iura
Regni sui illibata servare, That the Rights of the Kingdom
were to be preserved inviolable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sylvester in sum. 6. juram. 4. n. 16. <hi>saith roundly,</hi> That
an Oath doth not bind against the Publick Good in the first
Place; but if it be for a Private Benefit principally, and
consequentially for the Publick, then the Oath holds; <hi>because
still the publick Good is to overrule in all such Oaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Man swears to keep a Secret, and that be to the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of a third Person,</hi> the <hi>Casuists</hi> say, That Oath doth
not oblige; how much less, where the Publick Interest
and safety is concerned?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98150:8"/>
And it is generally agreed by our Divines, That an Oath
of Secrecy, where the <hi>Publick Safety</hi> is in Danger, doth
not bind; as in <hi>Garnet's Case,</hi> who pleaded his Oath for
not discovering the <hi>Gun-powder-Treason.</hi> Now if an Oath
doth oblige against the common Good, <hi>Garnet</hi> made a good
Plea; for his Discovery was to the <hi>Prejudice</hi> of others:
but if his Plea was naught, then the <hi>Publick Good</hi> doth
make the Obligation of an Oath to cease.</p>
            <p>Suppose a Man makes a Contract with another, who thereby
acquires a Right; yet if that Contract be against the common
Good, and be confirmed with an Oath; that Oath doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige,
<hi>saith</hi> Bonacina, de contract. disp. 3. q. 1. p. 1.</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of Law, <hi>saith</hi> Suarez, which respect
the Publick Good; <hi>some which concern</hi> ipsum statum Reipub.
&amp; utilitatem communitatis; <hi>the general State of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and Benefit of the Community: Others which
concern</hi> Bonum commune mediante privato; <hi>that common
Good which results from every Man's Good:</hi> against the
former, <hi>he saith,</hi> an Oath cannot oblige; <hi>but in the latter, it
may, as far as concerns his own Benefit.</hi> Suarez de juram. l.
2. c. 26. No Obligation, though sworn to, is of any Force against
those things which are owing to God and the Kingdom, <hi>saith</hi>
Zei<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lerus <hi>in his Notes on</hi> Grotius de jure B. &amp; P. l. 2. c. 13. §. 7.</p>
            <p>From all this it appears, That if the <hi>Right of a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
be inconsistent with the <hi>publick Good,</hi> such an Oath doth
not oblige. And it is to be observed, That those Persons,
whose Testimonies are alledged, never put the Case of the
Right in a third Person and a Publick Good standing in
Competition; and therefore they do not reach our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Case.</p>
            <p>II. It is alledged, That this Oath is contradictory to a
former Oath.</p>
            <p>Bishop Hall <hi>again, History of</hi> passive Obedience, <hi>p.</hi> 46.
No Oath is or can be of Force that is made against a lawful Oath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98150:9"/>
formerly taken; so that he that hath sworn Allegiance to his
Sovereign, and thereby bound himself to maintain the Right,
Power and Authority of his said Soveraign, cannot by his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Oath be tied to do ought that may tend to the infringement
thereof; and if he hath so tied himself, the Obligation is,
<hi>ipso facto,</hi> void and frustrate.</p>
            <p>No Doubt, if the first Oath continues in Force, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is void, so far as it contradicts it. But we say, The
former Oath is not in Force, as it is repugnant to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good, and so the second may be taken without any
Contradiction: And if the Doctrine there laid down holds
in our Case, I cannot see how it is consistent with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Oath, for any such Persons to continue under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the present Government, or to enjoy the Benefit
of the Laws; or to take out a <hi>Writ</hi> in their Names, any
more than to pray for them; the one being owning their
Authority as much as the other.</p>
            <p>III. Because the Person who had the Right hath given
no Release.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For this Dr.</hi> Hammond <hi>is quoted, in his</hi> Practical Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,
History of Passive Obed. <hi>p. 54. S.</hi> but was not <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
an Vsurper, and yet Christ saith, <hi>Render to Caesar
the things that are Caesar's. C. Julius Caesar</hi> wrested the
Power out of the Hand of the Senate; but before the Time of
<hi>Tiberius</hi> the Business was accorded between the Senate and the
Emperors, That the Emperors now reigned unquestion'd,
without any Competition from the Senate; which Case, <hi>he
saith,</hi> is distant from other forcible Vsurpations, where the
Legal Sovereign doth still claim his Right to his Kingdoms,
and to the Allegiance of his Subjects, no way acquitting them
from their Oaths, or laying down his Pretensions.</p>
            <p>To clear this Matter, I shall enquire into two things.</p>
            <p>1. How far a Discharge is necessary from the Person
concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98150:9"/>
2. How far <hi>our Saviour</hi>'s Rule holds in our Case?</p>
            <p>As to the former, I say, The Resolution of Conscience
in this Case doth not depend upon the Will and Pleasure
of the Person to whom the former Oath was made, but
upon the Grounds on which it was made, and from which
it had its force to oblige: And if those cease, the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Oath ceases together with them. And whether
they do or not, no particular Person is so fit to judge as
the three Estates of the Realm; as I shall now prove from
several remarkable Instances to this purpose in <hi>our Histories</hi>
and <hi>Parliament Records;</hi> whereby I shall make it appear,
That when a Dispute hath happened about the <hi>Right</hi> of
<hi>Succession,</hi> and to whom the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> were to be
made, they have looked on it as their proper Right, To
limit the Succession, and to determine the Oaths.</p>
            <p>Under the <hi>British Government,</hi> we find a considerable
Instance to our Purpose; <hi>Vortigern</hi> the British King had
entered into a <hi>Secret League,</hi> To bring over the <hi>Saxons;</hi>
upon which <hi>the Great Men of the Nation deserted him, and
chose</hi> Vortimer <hi>in his room.</hi> Here it is plain, They thought
the introducing a Foreign Power,<note place="margin">A. G. 454. Magnates Brit. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernum penitus deserentes, unanimiter filium suum in Regem sublimaverunt. Mat. West. p. 83,</note> a sufficient Discharge
of their Obligation to him, it being so directly contrary
to the <hi>publick Good</hi> of the Nation, although <hi>Vortigern</hi> gave
them no Discharge.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times, <hi>Sigebert</hi> King of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi>
was complained of for <hi>Misgovernment, and for changing
their Laws</hi> for his own Ends; but when he persisted in his
Way, there was a Convention of the Nobility and People,
<hi>(convenêrunt Proceres Regni cum Populo universo,</hi> saith
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98150:10"/>
               <hi>Matt. Westminster)</hi> and they declared themselves free from
Allegiance to him,<note place="margin">Cum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem modis omnibus male tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaret eos, legesque antecessorum suorum propter commodum suum, vel depravaret, vel mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taret.

and made her Queen, against their Laws; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
he was excluded his Kingdom: His eldest <hi>Son</hi> and
<hi>Alstan,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Shireburn</hi> being at the Top of this Act
of Exclusion; and he came back only upon the Terms of
receiving his Son into a Share of the Kingdom: Which
shews, That they looked on the Laws as the Measure of
their Allegiance; and where those were openly broken,
that it was in their Power to transfer it.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98150:10"/>
If our Allegiance cannot be transferred by the States
of the Realm, it must be because (as some think) by the
fundamental Constitution of this Kingdom we are bound
in <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the <hi>next right Heir in a Lineal Succession;</hi>
but I find no such thing in the <hi>Saxon Times:</hi> for although
generally they kept to the <hi>Royal Line,</hi> yet not so, but that
when it appeared to be much more for the <hi>Publick Good,</hi>
they did not stick upon the Point of <hi>Proximity.</hi> I shall
not meddle with the Kingdom of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> which
alone was <hi>originally Elective,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. West. p. 101.</note> as appears by <hi>Matt. Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
wherein there happened so great Disorders and
Confusions,<note place="margin">Bromton p. 862.</note> that at last <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> saith,<note place="margin">W. Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur. l. 1. c. 3. p. 14.</note> 
               <hi>None
could be perswaded to accept of the Kingdom;</hi> and so it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
thirty three Years, till at last <hi>Egbert</hi> took it into
his Hands; and so it became a Part of the <hi>English Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;</hi>
which was established in him.</p>
            <p>But if by the fundamental Constitution, <hi>Allegiance</hi> were
indispensably due to the next <hi>Rightful Heir</hi> in this
Monarchy, how came <hi>Athelstan</hi> to be crowned, <hi>magno
consensu Optimatum,</hi> saith <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> when he was not
the Rightful Heir? Some say (from an old Monk in
<hi>Malmsbury) That his Father left him the Crown by his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
(which doth not clear the Difficulty as to the
inviolable Right of <hi>Succession</hi> by the <hi>Constitution).</hi> But
this cannot be true, for his elder Brother <hi>Elwardus</hi> died
after his Father; and none pretend that his Father
disinherited him: And if <hi>Athelstan</hi> were lawful Heir,
what made him to dispatch his Brother <hi>Edwin</hi> out of
the way,<note place="margin">Mat. West.</note> and to build two Monasteries for Expiation
of that Guilt?<note place="margin">A. D. 934.</note> How came <hi>Alfred</hi> to oppose his <hi>Election,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A. D. 939.</note>
as being <hi>illegitimate,</hi> as <hi>Malmsbury</hi> confesses? But <hi>Matt.
Westminster</hi> gives the Reason, The Times were then diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
and <hi>Edward</hi>'s other Sons were too young to manage
the Government, and therefore they set up <hi>Athelstan,</hi> as one
fit for Business.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98150:11"/>

               <hi>Matt. Westminster</hi> and <hi>Bromton</hi> give
the same Reason; They were uncapable by reason of
their Age, <hi>Repugnante illegitimâ aetate, Patri succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
non valebant. Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> saith, The
<hi>Northumbers</hi> sware Allegiance to <hi>Edred;</hi> and he saith,
<hi>He was next Heir,</hi> and yet there were two Sons of
<hi>Edmond</hi> before him; for he confesses, That they were
the Sons of <hi>Edmond</hi> and <hi>Algiva</hi> his Queen.</p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Edred,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Edmond</hi>
succeeded; but being found under a <hi>Moral Incapacity,</hi>
(for in <hi>Florentius</hi> his Words,<note place="margin">A. 957.</note> and <hi>Matt. Westminster, In
commisso Regimine insipienter egit)</hi> he was set aside, as
to all the Government beyond <hi>Thames,</hi> and <hi>Edgar</hi> put
into it: And not long after into the whole Kingdom,
by general Consent.</p>
            <p>How came a Dispute to happen about the Election,
after the Death of <hi>Edgar,</hi> between his eldest Son <hi>Edward,</hi>
and <hi>Etheldred</hi> his youngest? I lay no Force on his
Mother's Endeavours to advance him; but if there
had been such an unalterable Right of Succession, there
had not been any Colour or Pretence for it; especially
since it is said, That his Father declared his Mind, That
the elder should succeed.<note place="margin">A. 975.</note> But saith <hi>Florentius Wigorn.</hi>
There was a great Contention among the great Men,
about the Choice of the King: How could there be
any Dispute, if they knew the Constitution of the
Kingdom to be, That the next Heir must inherit the
Crown; and that those are perjured who transfer their
Allegiance?</p>

               <note place="margin">Florent. Wigorn. A. D. 1016.</note> the Nobility and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>After the death of <hi>Canutus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A. 1055.</note> a new difference arose
about the Succession; some were for <hi>Harold</hi> his supposed
<hi>Son</hi> by <hi>Algiva,</hi> others for <hi>Hardecnute,</hi> his Son by <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
If the lineal Succession were a part of our <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
How come such perpetual Disputes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it? For, if it had been owned as a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Law, the Right of Succession must have been
clear beyond Dispute. But <hi>Reason of State</hi> and the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Interest</hi> still over-ruled this matter, and so <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s
Sons by <hi>Emma,</hi> who were the true Heirs by <hi>Legal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi>
were set aside, and <hi>Harold,</hi> being upon the Place,
and so best able to manage the Affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
carried it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hardecnute</hi> being dead, how came the banisht Sons of
<hi>Edmund Ironside,</hi> if he were lawful Heir, not to be sent for
to succeed? If <hi>Edmund</hi> had no good Title, how was the
Right of Succession then preserved? How could Allegiance
on these Principles be sworn to him? If he had a good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
How could the Oaths be taken to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi>
when the Heirs of <hi>Edmond Ironside</hi> were living? I perceive
some, to salve the Succession, make the Mother of <hi>Edmond</hi>
to have been <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s first Wife, and call her <hi>Elgiva Duke
Thored</hi>'s <hi>Daughter;</hi> but <hi>William Malmsbury</hi> saith, <hi>She was
so obscure a person,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wil. Malm. l. 2. p. 40.</note> 
               <hi>that she was not known; and that</hi> Edmond
Ironside <hi>made up what was wanting in the management of his
Father, and the Quality of his Mother.</hi> And the same is said
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98150:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by <hi>Matt. Westminster.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. West. A. 1015. Florent. A. 102.</note> 
               <hi>Florentius Wigorn,</hi> shews the reason
of the mistake; for he saith, That <hi>Emma, Ethelrede</hi>'s <hi>Queen,</hi>
was in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Language called <hi>Algiva;</hi> and so, out of
two Names,<note place="margin">Append. 7. ad vit. Alt. Bromton inter 10. Script. p. 877.</note> they have made two Queens. <hi>Bromton</hi> leaves
the matter in Dispute, and saith some affirm, <hi>The Mother of</hi>
Edmond <hi>was betrothed to King</hi> Ethelred, <hi>and was the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Count</hi> Egbert: Others, That she was a Stranger and
a Concubine. Now, if a Man's Conscience be strictly hid
in such Oaths of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> to the <hi>Right Heir in a lineal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi>
what satisfaction can he have as to the taking them,
since he is then bound to satisfie himself in the strict Justice
of a Title? For, if <hi>Edmond</hi>'s Mother was not married, he
had no Title, and no Oath of Allegiance could be taken to
him; and whether he was married or not, for all that we
can perceive, there was a great doubt at that time, and so
continued. And, it is not easie to determine what is to be
taken for Marriage in a Prince, unless the Law be the Rule.
And, if the Law determines the nature of Contracts in
Princes, why not as well the Obligation of Subjects? For,
if there be no Rule, it is not possible to satisfie Conscience
in the Niceties of Titles; if there be a Rule, the general
Consent of the People, joined with the Common Good,
seems to have been that which our Ancestors proceeded
by.</p>
            <p>I do not hereby go about to set up the <hi>Power of the People
over Kings,</hi> which is in effect to overthrow <hi>Monarchy;</hi> for
then the whole <hi>Soveraignty</hi> lies in the People, and <hi>Kings</hi> are
but their <hi>Servants:</hi> And so there is but one sort of Reasonable
Government, <hi>viz.</hi> that of a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> Whereas, from
the eldest times, the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Soveraignty</hi> have been placed
in <hi>single Persons,</hi> before any <hi>Popular Governments</hi> were
known; and Monarchy hath been ever esteemed a distinct
and a reasonable Government, especially where it is limited
by Laws, and those Laws made by the Consent of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98150:12"/>
People, <hi>i.e. by the Three Estates of the Realm;</hi> which
are together the true Representatives of the People.</p>
            <p>I see no necessity of going about to undermine the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi>
that I may come at a resolution of the present case;
for, I take Ours to be a true <hi>Original Monarchy,</hi> especially
after the Rights of the lesser Monarchs were swallowed up
or delivered into that of the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings. And farther,
I do not stick to affirm, That it was <hi>Hereditary,</hi> where the
<hi>Right of Succession</hi> and the <hi>Publick Good</hi> did not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere;
<hi>i.e.</hi> where there was not a <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity:</hi>
a <hi>Natural,</hi> as in the Sons of the elder <hi>Edmond,</hi> when
<hi>Edred</hi> was made King before them; a <hi>Moral,</hi> as when <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>'s
elder Brother was set aside for his <hi>ill Government,</hi> by
one half of the Nation, and the other never disputed the
matter with them; and when <hi>Ethelred</hi> was so far deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that he went into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and was recalled upon
Promise of better Government. <hi>Si ipse vel rectius guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Florentin. Wigor. A. D. 1014.</note>
               <hi>vel mitius eos tractare vellet,</hi> are the words in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius;</hi>
and to the same purpose <hi>Matt. Westminster,</hi> and
<hi>Bromton,</hi> and <hi>Malmsbury: H. Huntingdon</hi> adds, That he
promised <hi>omnia Rege &amp; Populo digna;</hi>
               <note place="margin">H. Huntin. l. 6. p 207. 2.</note> all things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the KING and People. These things I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to shew, That although this were <hi>a true &amp; successive
Monarchy</hi> in ordinary course; yet where the <hi>Publick Good</hi>
was by the <hi>Estates</hi> of the Realm judged to require it, they
thought it no <hi>Perjury,</hi> or <hi>Breach of Faith,</hi> to transferr
their Allegiance, although it were without the Consent
of the actual Governour, or the next lineal Heirs.</p>
            <p>Having thus far cleared this Point, as to the <hi>Saxon
Constitution</hi> of our Government, I come to that of the
<hi>Norman;</hi> and here I shall not go about to shew how
broken the Succession was by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> but what
the Judgment of the Nation was, as to the transferring
Allegiance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98150:13"/>
And, the first Instance I shall bring, is in the Case
of the Oath taken to <hi>Maud</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the
First, in the One and Thirtieth year of his Reign;
and there is no question,<note place="margin">Malmsb. hist. Novel. l. 1. p. 100, 105. 2.</note> but he designed her to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him; <hi>Legitimâ &amp; perenni successione,</hi> as <hi>Malmsbury</hi>'s
words are; but <hi>Stephen,</hi> (who had before sworn Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to her) watched his opportunity, and by the
help of a Party made by his Brother, (the <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Winchester)</hi> he was Crowned KING; and although
at first, <hi>Malmsbury</hi> saith, <hi>but three Bishops, and very few
Noblemen,</hi> joined with him, yet he soon after saith,
<hi>That most of them went in to him:</hi> And even <hi>Robert</hi> of
<hi>Gloucester,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the First's natural Son, took an
Oath to him, but with the condition of his preserving
his Honour and Covenants. There are several things
worthy our observation in this Affair, with respect to
Oaths of <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1) That those who excuse them from <hi>Perjury,</hi> who
had Sworn <hi>Allegiance</hi> to <hi>Maud</hi> before, do it upon this
account, Because it is said by <hi>Rad. de Diceto, That</hi> Hugh
Bigod <hi>sware, that King</hi> Henry <hi>the First, on his Deathbed,
disinherited his Daughter, and made</hi> Stephen <hi>his Heir.</hi>
Supposing the Story true, what is this to the Discharge
of the Oath as to <hi>Maud;</hi> (for the Oath was not made
to <hi>Henry</hi> the First, but to his Daughter, and her Right
was chiefly concerned in it.) If this hold, an <hi>Oath</hi> of
<hi>Allegiance</hi> may cease, without discharge from the Party
to whom it is made. And so the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
and the Bishops of <hi>Winchester</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> as
well as the Nobility, thought themselves at liberty to
take a New Oath of Allegiance, without a Release
from the Party concerned in the former Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98150:13"/>
(2.) That upon the Agreement between K. <hi>Stephen</hi>
and <hi>H. 2. Maud</hi> her self was set aside, and <hi>Stephen</hi> was
to continue King for his Life, and <hi>H.</hi> 2. to succeed him.
Now if Oaths of Allegiance must not be interpreted by
the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> here are insuperable Difficulties as to
the Obligation of these Oaths. For the Allegiance was
transferr'd from the right Heir to an Usurper, as <hi>Stephen</hi>
must be owned to have been by those who deny that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
can be transferr'd from the right Heir. And
they must continue Allegiance to the Usurper for his
Life; which is repugnant to the Nature of our Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
if it be founded in a <hi>Lineal and Legal Succession.</hi>
And again, <hi>Maud,</hi> to whom they had sworn, is set aside,
and the Reversion of the Crown is entailed on her Son,
although she was living. <hi>Fortescue,</hi> in a Manuscript-Discourse
about the <hi>Title of the House of Lancaster,</hi> saith,
this was done in Parliament, <hi>Communi Consensu Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
&amp; Communitatis Regni Angliae.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rad. de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceto, A. D. 1153.</note> 
               <hi>Rad. de Diceto,</hi>
who lived nearer the time, saith no such thing; but <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tescue</hi>
appeals not only to the <hi>Chronicles, but to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of Parliament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. Westm. A. 1153.</note> for it. And <hi>Matt. Westminster</hi>
and <hi>Paris</hi> say, The Right of <hi>H.</hi> 2. was declared by K.
<hi>Stephen in Conventu Episcoporum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. Paris. ib.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; aliorum de Regno
Optimatum;</hi> which was the Description of a Parliament
of that time; for, as yet, the <hi>Baronage</hi> represented the
Nation.<note place="margin">Gervas. A. D. 1153.</note> 
               <hi>Gervase</hi> saith, <hi>The Great Men were summoned
to perfect the Agreement, by giving their Assent to it, and
confirming it by their Oaths. Fortescue</hi> saith further, that
<hi>H. 2. was crowned King in the Life of his Mother, (who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the 13 of H. 2.) by the general Consent of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
Which shews how far the <hi>Publick Good</hi> was thought
to be the Measure of the Obligation of these Oaths. For
<hi>Gul. Neuburgensis</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Gul. Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg. l. 1. c. 30.</note> That the <hi>Bonum Publicum</hi> was
the Foundation of this Agreement. And <hi>Matt. West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98150:14"/>
That the King and the Lords did all swear to it,<note place="margin">Matt. Westm. S. 1153.</note> and
a solemn Charter was made of it, and kept in a most secure
Place.</hi> And thus the Oaths of Allegiance were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to one that had no Right for his Life; and made
to one who pretended to no Right, but after his Mother,
who was set aside in this Agreement. So that here
were three Oaths of Allegiance at once, that to <hi>Maud</hi>
the Empress, that to K. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and to <hi>H.</hi> 2. and yet
the <hi>General Good</hi> of the Nation must give an equitable
sense of these Oaths, or there must be <hi>Perjury</hi> on all sides.
For those who had first sworn to <hi>Maud,</hi> could not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their Allegiance on any other account, either to <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
or <hi>H.</hi> 2. during her Life. For we never read that
she was present at the Agreement, or resigned her Right
to the Crown.</p>
            <p>The next Instance I shall produce, is in the Oaths
that were taken during the Controversies between the
Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster.</hi> Which was not so plain
a Case as Men commonly imagin; and in Truth, if the
just legal Title be the only Rule of Conscience in this
Case, it was hard to take the Oaths on either side. For,
as on the one side, a lineal Descent was pleaded from
the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was elder
Brother to <hi>Iohn Duke of Lancaster,</hi> from whom by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
the Duke of <hi>York</hi> claimed his Title; so, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, it was objected, that there was no sufficient
Evidence of the Legitimacy of <hi>Philippa</hi> Daughter to
the Duke of <hi>Clarence;</hi> because, as <hi>Fortescue</hi> observes,
the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> was abroad from before the time of
her Conception till after her Birth, and that he never
owned her Mother after; that she never assumed the
Arms of the Duke as her Father, nor those descended
from her, till the Duke of <hi>York</hi> pretended to the Crown;
that <hi>E.</hi> 3. made an Entail of the Crown upon his Heirs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98150:14"/>
Male; (of which I have seen a written Account as old
as the time of <hi>H.</hi> 6. which not only affirms the Absence
and Divorce of the Duke of <hi>Clarence;</hi> but that <hi>E.</hi> 3. sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
all his Lands into his Hands, and in Parliament soon
after entailed the Crown on his Heirs Male, and that his
Daughters there present agreed to the same.) But besides
they pleaded, that so long a Prescription as the House of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> had of above threescore years, was allowed by
the <hi>Ius Gentium,</hi> to purge the Defects of the first Title:
These are things which deserved Consideration against
such a meer lineal Descent as the House of <hi>York</hi> insisted
upon. And against the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>H.</hi> 4. upon the Deposition of <hi>R.</hi> 2. is an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Objection to such as found Allegiance on the Right
of Succession.</p>
            <p>But that which I lay the greatest weight upon, is the
Way of ending this Difference in <hi>Parliament,</hi> which hath
several remarkable things in it:</p>
            <p>(1.) That the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> notwithstanding his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
takes an <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> in Parliament to <hi>H.</hi> 6.
during his Life;<note place="margin">Rot. Pa l. 39. <hi>H.</hi> 6. n. 21.</note> reserving to himself the <hi>Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi>
after him. For he swears <hi>to do nothing to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of his Reign or Dignity-Royal, nor against his Life
or Liberty; and that he would to the utmost of his Power,
withstand all Attempts to the contrary.</hi> The same <hi>Oath</hi>
was taken by his Sons <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>E. 4.)</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Rutland.</hi> Was this a
lawful Oath or not? To say it was unlawful, is to reflect
on the Wisdom of the <hi>Three Estates,</hi> who looked on
this as the best Expedient for the Publick Good, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the way to prevent the Effusion of Christian Blood.
And it is not easy to prove such an Oath unlawful; as
containing nothing unlawful, nor to the Prejudice of a
third Person, when he who was chiefly concerned vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily

took it. If it were a lawful Oath, then an
Oath of Allegiance on the account of <hi>Possession,</hi> is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Oath. For the matter of Right is not mentioned
in it, and <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> did not renounce the
opinion of his own Right hereby, (whether true or
false) but did bind up himself to do nothing to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Royal Dignity of <hi>H.</hi> 6. and yet he look'd
on him as meer Possessor of it; therefore in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Parliament's, an Oath of Allegiance may
lawfully be taken, on the account of the <hi>Possession</hi> of the
<hi>Crown,</hi> although Persons be not satisfied of the Right of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Words of his Agreement are remarkable to this
Purpose,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 20.</note> 
               <hi>as they are to be found in the</hi> Parliament-Rolls.
The said Title notwithstanding, and without Prejudice of
the same, the said <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> tenderly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
the Weal, Rest and Prosperity of this Land, and to
set apart all that might be trouble to the same; and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Possession of the said King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, and
that he hath for his time be named, taken, and reputed King
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is content,
agreeth and consenteth, that he be had, reputed and taken
King of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi> with the Royal Estate,
Dignity and Preeminence belonging thereto, and Lord of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> during his Life natural; and for that time the said
Duke, without hurt or prejudice of his said Right and Title,
shall take, worship and honour him for his Sovereign Lord.
<hi>Here was certainly an Oath taken to a King, whom the
Person taking it looked on only as a King</hi> de facto, <hi>and
not</hi> de jure; <hi>and yet this Oath was taken and allowed,
nay contrived in Parliament; and that for no less an end,
than for the</hi> Weal, Rest, and Prosperity of the Land, <hi>i.e.
for the Publick Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may be said,</hi> That the Case is different; for <hi>Richard</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98150:15"/>
Duke of <hi>York</hi> parted with his own Right; but we cannot
with anothers, which we have sworn to preserve.</p>
            <p>I answer, That he did not look on such an Oath as
parting with his Right, but as a thing fitting to be done
on the account of <hi>Possession</hi> for the Publick Good. And
so many others taken such another Oath of Allegiance,
wherein there is no Declaration as to Right, but the same
things required, which the Duke of <hi>York</hi> promised in
his Oath to <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>But Allegiance is not due but where there is a Right to
claim it; and that cannot be, where there is no Right to
the Crown.</p>
            <p>I answer, That an Oath of Allegiance may be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:
1. <hi>Declarative of Right;</hi> and in that case none can
be owned to have Right, but he that hath it.</p>
            <p>2. Submissive Allegiance; <hi>where no more is required
than is contained in the Duke of</hi> York'<hi>s Oath, and
yet he declared</hi> this was no Prejudice to his Right.
But it may be said, He declared so much before he took the
Oath, and so gave the Sense in which he took it.</p>
            <p>I answer, That</p>
            <p>His putting in his Claim, and his Title being allow'd
after the King in being, had been sufficient; but in our
case there is no need of a <hi>Declaration,</hi> since the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
part is left out; which is a fuller Declaration of
the sense of the Oath, than our Words can make.</p>
            <p>But to proceed;</p>
            <p>(2.) The first Objection the <hi>Parliament</hi> made to the
Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Claim was, from <hi>the Oaths they had taken
to H.</hi> 6. To which the Duke of <hi>York</hi> gave a large An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that <hi>Oaths must not bind against Truth and Iustice.</hi>
But this was to take it for granted, that he had the
Truth and Justice of his side, whereas there was a long
Possession of threescore Years against him; surely Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98150:16"/>
of Fact which were necessary to the disproving his
Title, were then so far out of Memory, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to make clear Evidence about them; and others
were not examin'd, as whether the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> were
absent so long from his Wife abroad, when <hi>Philippa</hi>
was born? Whether one Sir <hi>Iames Awdely</hi> suffer'd about
it? Whether he was divorced from her upon it? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>E.</hi> 3. after the Death of the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi>
did entail the Crown on his Heirs male? Whether
upon the Deposition of <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Claim of Right on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi>'s Heir, ought not to have
been made? How far <hi>Edmond Mortimer</hi>'s owning the
Title of <hi>H.</hi> 5. and the Duke of <hi>Cambridge</hi>'s Attainder
did affect him? Whether he had not renounced his own
Pretentions, by owning <hi>H.</hi> 6. to be <hi>his Supream</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Lord,</hi> as he had often done in a most solemn
manner, particularly in his Oaths at the Altar at St.
<hi>Pauls,</hi> which is to be seen in the <hi>Book of Oaths,</hi> p. 146.
and elsewhere. But at that time, <hi>H.</hi> 6. was under the
Power of the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and that was a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
time to clear a sinking Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But however the Lords in Parliament were concerned
for their</hi> Oaths <hi>to</hi> H. 6. <hi>and proposed the former</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
<hi>not only for the publick Welfare, but in regard to
their</hi> Oaths, <hi>notwithstanding that they allow'd the</hi>
Duke's <hi>Title to be good. Their Words are,</hi> It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
and agreed by all the said Lords, that since it was so,
that the Title of the said Duke of <hi>York</hi> cannot be defeated,
and in eschewing the great Inconvenience that might ensue,
to take the Mein above rehearsed, the Oaths that the said
Lords had made unto the King's Highness at <hi>Coventry</hi>
and other places saved.</p>
            <p>From whence it is plain that they look'd on their
<hi>Oaths to Hen.</hi> 6. as consistent with owning the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98150:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Right to be in the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and that <hi>Possession</hi>
was a sufficient Ground for continuing their Oaths.</p>
            <p>(3.) In 1 <hi>E.</hi> 4. where the Right and Title of the
D. of <hi>York</hi> is most amply set forth, yet there this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. is recited, and the Proceedings against
<hi>H.</hi> 6. are grounded upon his Breach of it. Which
shews farther that those <hi>Parliaments</hi> which did assert
the <hi>Right of Succession</hi> highest, (among which, this of
<hi>E.</hi> 4. ought to be reckon'd) yet it was never disputed,
whether those who had taken the Oaths to <hi>H.</hi> 6. were
<hi>perjured;</hi> for they look on the <hi>Possession</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi>
as a sufficient Ground for the <hi>Allegiance</hi> required.</p>
            <p>But it may be said, <hi>That from hence we see that he was
look'd on as having the best Title, who had the best Right by
lineal Succession.</hi> I answer, that we are not enquiring
into <hi>Titles,</hi> but searching into the Reasons and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance;</hi> and whether those do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
full Satisfaction about the best Title? Or suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
one unsatisfied about that, he may not yet be
satisfied in taking such an Oath as the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>York</hi> and
his Sons did?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But such Precedents prove nothing, unless they be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to our Laws and Constitution.</hi> Yes, a great deal,
while we are enquiring into our <hi>Legal Constitution;</hi> and
we find such things allowed in <hi>Parliaments;</hi> and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so, but in such <hi>Parliaments</hi> which allow'd not the Title
of the King to whom those Oaths were made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Law owns no King meerly as in Possession, but the
Right Heir is the legal King, whether in Possession or not.</hi>
Our Law does own a King in Possession, if <hi>Treason may
be committed against Him;</hi> and for this we have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Authority of Sir</hi> E. C. but of the <hi>Year-Books,
9 E.</hi> 4. Where it is deliver'd for Law at that time;
and with a particular Respect to <hi>H. 6. Et home sera
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98150:17"/>
arraigne de Treason fait a dit Roy. H.</hi> and therefore Sir
<hi>E. C.</hi> had good Authority for what he said; and that
not in the Reign of a King <hi>de facto,</hi> but when a King
thrust out another for want of Right, and derived his
whole Right from a <hi>lineal Succession. Bagot</hi>'s <hi>Case</hi> goes
farther than <hi>Grants and judicial Proceedings of a King de
facto;</hi> for therein it is declared Treason to compass the
Death of a King <hi>de facto;</hi> and it is very absurd to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
Treason against one whom the Law doth not
own: for Treason is a high Violation of the Law, and
how can the Law be violated against one whom the
Law doth not own? Besides, in <hi>Bagot</hi>'s <hi>Case</hi> there is
a distinction made between <hi>a meer Vsurper, and one on
whom the Crown is setled by Parliament;</hi> and so <hi>H.</hi> 6. is
denied to be a meer Usurper. <hi>Et six le dit Roy H. de
fait Merement, come Vsurper, Car le Corone fuit taille a
luy per Parliament.</hi> So that by our Constitution a great
Deference is to be shew'd to the Judgment of <hi>the three
Estates</hi> in matters that concern the <hi>Right of the Crown;</hi>
Or else, an Entail made by them could make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
but the whole Resolution must be into the
<hi>lineal Desent.</hi> And thus I look on the Statute, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7.
as <hi>agreeable to our Constitution;</hi> for if it be <hi>Treason</hi> to
compass the Death of a King <hi>de facto,</hi> there is great
Reason there should be Indemnity for those who act
for Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what doth this signify to the Consciences of Men?</hi>
Very much, if they are to be satisfied by our Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I grant meer <hi>Indemnity</hi> doth not clear a Man's
Mind; but its agreeableness to former Proceedings and
Judgments shews how far our Constitution allows us
to go, and that there is no Argument from thence
which can hinder the Satisfaction of Conscience so far.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98150:17"/>
But suppose a King <hi>de jure</hi> be in Possession of this Act,
and another comes and dispossesses Him, and so is King <hi>de
facto,</hi> Doth this Law indemnify those who Fight against the
King <hi>de jure</hi> for the King <hi>de facto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whosoever is in actual and quiet Possession of the
Crown, by <hi>Consent of Parliament,</hi> hath the Right to
challenge the Benefits of this Act for those who serve
Him. But I do not say, that this Act gives any
Man Right to oppose a <hi>Rightful King;</hi> but it only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
for the Indemnity of those who assist the present
Possessor, although another had the Right by Descent.
For, after the D. of <hi>York</hi>'s challenging the Crown by
Right of Succession against the Possessor, there were
two Parties in the Nation, the one was for the <hi>Right</hi>
of <hi>Succession,</hi> and the other for the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Possession</hi> by
a <hi>National Consent.</hi> And the Disputes between these
two continued as long as the Differences between the
Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> lasted. When <hi>H.</hi> 7. was
setled in the Throne, without regard to the <hi>Right</hi> of
<hi>Succession,</hi> although there was a general Submission, yet
there was still a great Dissatisfaction in the <hi>York Party;</hi>
which occasion'd all the Disturbances of <hi>H. 7th</hi>'s Reign,
from setting up an Heir of the House of <hi>York.</hi> (And
Sir <hi>William Stanly</hi> was gained to that Party, which
cost him his Life.) And they went so far as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it <hi>Treason</hi> to stand by the Possessor against the
<hi>next lineal Heir.</hi> Which I take to have been the
true Occasion of the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Indemnify those who adhere to the Possessor,
although another may claim a better Right; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
declares a <hi>Possessory Right</hi> to be a sufficient Ground of
Allegiance, as far as that Act goes.</p>
            <p>There are three sorts of Persons may be said to have
Possession of the Crown, an <hi>Vsurper,</hi> a King <hi>de jure,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98150:18"/>
a King <hi>de facto;</hi> and because the distinction between
these doth not seem to be well understood, I shall briefly
explain it.</p>
            <p>An Usurper is one, who comes in by <hi>Force,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
by <hi>Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A King <hi>de jure</hi> is one, who comes in by <hi>lineal Descent,</hi>
as next Heir, and whose Right is owned and Recogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Estates of the Realm.</p>
            <p>A King <hi>de facto</hi> is one, who comes in by Consent of
the Nation, but not by Virtue of an <hi>immediate Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Right;</hi> but to such a one being owned and receiv'd
by the Estates of the Realm, the Law of <hi>England,</hi> as far
as I can see, requires an <hi>Allegiance.</hi> Or else the whole
Nation was perjur'd in most of the Reigns from the
Conquest to <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the two <hi>Williams,</hi> six at least of
the seven <hi>Henries,</hi> King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and King <hi>Iohn</hi> were
all Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> for some time at least, for they came
not in as next <hi>Heirs</hi> in a <hi>lineal Descent.</hi> But still Oaths
of <hi>Allegiance</hi> were taken to them; and no such <hi>Scruples</hi>
appear to have been made all that time; nor any charge
of <hi>Perjury,</hi> on those who did what our Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
required. Was the Nation <hi>perjured</hi> in the
Time of <hi>H.</hi> 7. who, as all know, had no Pretence of an
<hi>Hereditary Right?</hi> Yet being received and Crowned,
the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> were taken to Him, before he
was Married to the Daughter of <hi>E.</hi> 4. For, he was
Crowned 30 <hi>Octob.</hi> 1485. Had the Crown entailed in
Parliament <hi>Nov.</hi> 7. and was Married <hi>Ian.</hi> 18. But
the first Parliament of <hi>R.</hi> 3. endeavoured to make
void the Title of the Children of <hi>E.</hi> 4. upon pretence
of a <hi>Precontract</hi> with the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Shrewsburies</hi> Daughter;
and of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> by his Attainder, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to make <hi>R. 3. Right Heir to the Crown;</hi> but lest
these things should fail, <hi>to his Claim of Inheritance, they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98150:18"/>
join their own Election, and desire him to accept the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as to him of Right belonging, as well by Inheritance as by
lawful Election.</hi> It seems, they would have made him
a King <hi>de jure</hi> as well as <hi>de facto;</hi> but the excluding the
Children of <hi>E.</hi> 4. never gave Satisfaction since the
Lady <hi>Lucy</hi> her self disowned it to the Mother of <hi>E.</hi> 4.
And if such an Allegation would hold, the whole
Succession both of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> might be question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for both derive from <hi>H.</hi> 3. whose Mother was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
at that Time to have been precontracted at least
to <hi>Hugh le Brun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. West. A. 1200.</note> before She was married to K. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
and was married to Him, whilst his former Wife was
living. And if Q. <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Divorce from the K. of
<hi>France</hi> were not Good (as it is hard to prove it so)
what becomes of all the Line of <hi>H.</hi> 2. who married Her,
after She had two Children by her former Husband?
But if Mens Consciences are tied to a strict legal and
<hi>lineal Descent,</hi> they must be satisfied in all these Points.</p>
            <p>But supposing the Right of the Children of <hi>E.</hi> 4. to
have been never so Good; what doth this make towards
the justifying the Oaths of Allegiance, which were
made to <hi>H.</hi> 7. whom some will not allow to have any
Claim by the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> since they say, the
same Act which legitimated <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>'s Children
by <hi>Kath. Swinford,</hi> did exclude them from any Title to
the Crown? Yet the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> were taken by
the whole Nation in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 7. and no Dispute
was then made about it; because it was then believed,
that quiet Possession was a sufficient Ground for Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is objected,</hi> That it cannot be agreeable to the Law of
<hi>England</hi> to swear Allegiance to a King <hi>de facto,</hi> when the
Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> suffered by the Law for adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to a Queen <hi>de facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:98150:19"/>
A King <hi>de facto</hi> according to our Law (as I said) is one
in quiet Possession of the Crown, by Consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without Hereditary Right; such as <hi>H.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7.
were all thought to be, by those who made this Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For, as far as I can find, the Distinction of a King
<hi>de facto</hi> and <hi>de jure</hi> was then started, when the House of
<hi>York</hi> so much insisted on their Hereditary Right; and so
many of our Kings had governed the Kingdom by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
without it. Therefore the Lawyers, to find a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Salvo</hi> for the Kings of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
framed this Distinction of Kings <hi>de facto</hi> and <hi>de jure;</hi>
but still they meant <hi>Kings Regnant,</hi> as they called them,
or in full Possession of the Royal Dignity by a National
Consent. (The Distinction had been better of a two-fold
Right, <hi>viz. Possessory</hi> and <hi>Hereditary.)</hi> But this
was far from being the Case of <hi>Queen Iane,</hi> who was
set up by a particular Party against the General Sense of
the Nation, as soon appeared; for the main Point her
Title stood upon was this, Whether the King by his
Grant could dispose of the Crown against an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
which setled the Succession? and that this was
the true Point, appears evidently by Judge <hi>Mountague</hi>'s
Papers, who was imployed against his Will, in drawing
up the Grant. So that the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s
Case doth by no Means reach the Point of a King <hi>de
facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is further urged from our</hi> Homilies,<note place="margin">Sixth Part of the Homily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> That our
Church therein condemns those English who did swear Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to the Dauphin of <hi>France,</hi> breaking their Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to their Natural Lord the King of <hi>England. To which
I answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) That King <hi>Iohn</hi> was only a King <hi>de facto</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if a Legal Succession makes a King <hi>de jure.</hi> For,
(1.) His eldest Brother's Son <hi>Arthur</hi> was then living, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98150:19"/>
all confess. (2.) He was convicted of Treason against
his Brother <hi>R.</hi> 1. and the Sentence pronounced against
him by <hi>Hugo de Pudsey</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. Paris. f. 280.</note> as the King
of <hi>France</hi> pleaded to the Pope's Legat who came to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit
for him.<note place="margin">Matt. Westm. A. 1216.</note> (3.) <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
at his Coronation, that he came not in by <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Right,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. Paris. A. 1199.</note> but by <hi>Election;</hi> and he accepted of it so.
(4.) What Right he had after the Death of his Nephew,
he gave up by the Resignation of his Crown to the Pope.
He could have no <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> while <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Sister
lived, who survived him, and was kept in the Castle
at <hi>Bristol.</hi> But supposing it, I do not understand how
he that gave up his Right of Dominion to the Pope,
could still retain it? And if he was Feudatary to the
same, he could not challenge Allegiance as due to him,
but to the Pope as Lord Paramount. And it was plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against him,<note place="margin">Mat. Paris. A. 1216. l. 281.</note> 
               <hi>That although he could not dispose of his
Crown without Consent of his Barons, yet he might demise
it. And upon his Resignation he ceased to be King; and
so the Throne was vacant. And by that means there was a
devolution of Right to the BARONS to fill up the Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
who made choice of</hi> LEWIS <hi>by the Right of his Wife,
who was Heir to King</hi> John. If after all this, an <hi>Oath</hi>
of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him was lawful, then, I say, an Oath to
a King <hi>de facto</hi> is so, for King <hi>Iohn</hi> was no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(2.) As to the</hi> Barons <hi>calling in</hi> Lewis, <hi>and forsaking
K.</hi> Iohn, <hi>it is necessary to observe on what Reason it is
that our</hi> Homilies <hi>condemn it. For the whole design of
that</hi> Homily <hi>is, to shew</hi> the Popes Vsurpations over Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and their stirring up Subjects to Rebellion against them,
by discharging them from their Oaths; and for those the
Instance of King <hi>John</hi> is produced. <hi>As appears by the
words just before;</hi> Now had English-men at that time
known their Duty to their Prince set forth in God's Word,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98150:20"/>
would a great many Nobles, and other English-men natural
Subjects, for this foreign and unnatural Vsurper his vain
Curse of the King, and for his feigned discharging them of
their Oath and Fidelity to their Natural Lord, upon so slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or no Ground at all, have rebelled against their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Lord the King? Would English Subjects have taken
part against the King of <hi>England,</hi> and against English
Men, with the French King, and French Men, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
against this Realm by the Bishop of <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) This doth not concern the present Case. For
Men may condemn those English Men who sent for <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi>
and yet may lawfully take the present Oaths. By
which Men are not bound to justify such Proceedings,
but to promise Faith and Allegiance to such as are in
actual Possession of the Throne. Which the Oaths ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to K. <hi>Iohn</hi> will justify.</p>
            <p>Thus I have considered the greatest Difficulties I have
yet met with about taking the Oaths, and have not
dissembled the strength of any of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is only one thing remains, and that is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
given to the Case of</hi> Tiberius, who was an Vsurper,
and yet our Saviour said, Give unto <hi>Cesar</hi> the things that
are <hi>Cesar</hi>'s. <hi>The Answer is,</hi> That although it were a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Vsurpation in <hi>Julius Cesar,</hi> yet before that time the
Matter was accorded between the Senate and the Emperors,
and they reigned unquestioned without any competition from
the Senate.</p>
            <p>So that it was not lawful to swear Allegiance to <hi>Iulius
Cesar,</hi> who had the full Possession of the Power, but it
was to <hi>Tiberius:</hi> And why so? Where was the Right
of Government in the time of <hi>Iulius Cesar? In the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and People.</hi> And so it continued all <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi>'s
time. But how came the <hi>Senate and People</hi> to lose their
Right in the time of <hi>Tiberius?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98150:20"/>
(1.) Had they given it up by any solemn Act of theirs,
as many say they did by the <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> which <hi>Iustinian</hi>
confidently affirms? Then all the Right which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
had, was by <hi>Devolution</hi> from the People; and so they
acted by virtue of that Power which the <hi>People</hi> gave
them; <hi>(Populus</hi> comprehends both <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.)</hi>
And then the Emperors had their Rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
from the People, and not from God. For here
was no other Act but that of the People giving up their
Right. And then the Case of Obedience to the Roman
Emperors will be found very different from that of the
Northern Kingdoms, where the People never gave up
their Rights in such a manner; but in Cases of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
concerning Succession, the <hi>three Estates</hi> did look on
themselves as particularly concerned; as might be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved, if it were needful, in all the Northern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>(2.) But suppose they did not formally give up their
Right, but were partly wheedled and partly forced out
of it; Doth this give a good Title? Suppose <hi>Augustus</hi>
had by his Acts procured the Consent of the People,
as to his own Government; What was this to <hi>Tiberius?</hi>
Did they give him a Power to make whom he pleased
his Successor? Something may be said from <hi>Dion</hi> and
<hi>Strabo</hi> as to the former; but there is no Pretence as to
the latter: For it was a meer Arbitrary Act in <hi>Augustus</hi>
to nominate <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and all the Title he had at first
was from the Praetorian Band and Legions: Afterwards
<hi>the Consuls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tacit. l. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and Senate, and Souldiers, and People did
swear Allegiance to him,</hi> as the Historians tell us. Now
here I desire to know, whether <hi>Tiberius</hi> were any more
than Emperor <hi>de facto,</hi> when they did thus swear to
him? For all the Right he had was from their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Submission to him at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98150:21"/>
As to the Roman Provinces, <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith, <hi>They were
content with the present change of Government,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tacit. ib.</note> 
               <hi>because
they suffered by the Factions and Avarice of the great
Men; which made them weary of the Government by the
Senate and People.</hi> But this only shews they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to change their Masters, hoping they might mend
their Condition, but signifies little to the matter of
Right. Since after they were made <hi>Provinces,</hi> they
owned their Subjection to the Roman Government, by
<hi>paying Tribute, and receiving Magistrates</hi> from it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that Government was managed, whether by Senate
or People, or by one who had the Imperial Power,
whatever Name he were called by. But as to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Iudea</hi> in particular, there are several Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it to be considered.</p>
            <p>(1.) While it was tributary to the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi>
and <hi>Syria.</hi> Jaddus <hi>the High Priest told</hi> Alexander <hi>that
they had taken an Oath of Fidelity to</hi> Darius,<note place="margin">Joseph. l. 11. c. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not bear Arms against him while he lived.</hi> But
was <hi>Darius</hi> King <hi>de jure</hi> or <hi>de facto</hi> over the <hi>Iews?</hi> He
was not King over them by a lineal Succession from
their own Princes; nor by the Fundamental Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Government,<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 15.</note> which owned no <hi>legal King</hi>
that was not of their Brethren: I do not say they were
not to submit to, but not to chuse any other. But what
Right had <hi>Darius</hi> over the <hi>Iews,</hi> any more than suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy gave a Right to the
<hi>Chaldean</hi> Conquests? I grant, the <hi>Iews</hi> did act under
the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs,<note place="margin">Neh. 8. 9.</note> as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was Governour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and that they did swear to them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by <hi>Iaddus;</hi> but the Question is, On what Right
that Oath was founded? and whether upon <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
Conquest, they could not as well take a new Oath to
him? For why should not present actual Dominion give
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98150:21"/>
as much Right, as succeeding into anothers Right of
Dominion, which was at first gained by Conquest?
If Possession gives Right in one case, why not in the
other; since there is more Reason for Allegiance, where
there is a Power of Protection, than where there is none.
And so we find <hi>Iaddus</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi> did submit to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
afterwards, and some of them went into his Army, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Darius</hi> was still living; which shews, that as
they were not forward to break their Allegiance sworn
to <hi>Darius;</hi> so they were not obstinate in opposing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
but yielded to the over-ruling Hand of Providence.</p>
            <p>(2.) When the <hi>Iews</hi> had their Liberty granted them
by the Kings of <hi>Syria.</hi> For <hi>Antiochus Eupator</hi> made
<hi>Peace with them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joseph. 12. c. 13.</note> 
               <hi>by which they were to have the Liberty of
their own Laws;</hi> and although he soon brake his Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them; yet the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>
owned them as a <hi>Free-People,</hi> and treated with them as
such. And <hi>Simon</hi> pleaded to <hi>Athenobius</hi> in this War;
<hi>We have neither taken other Mens Land, nor holden that
which appertaineth to others;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Maccab. 14. 16. 40.</note> 
               <hi>but the Inheritance of our
Fathers, which our Enemies had wrongfully in Possession a
certain time. Wherefore we having Opportunity, hold the
Inheritance of our Fathers.</hi> Which plainly shews, that
they look'd on those who ruled over them as unjust Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors;<note place="margin">15. 33. 34.</note>
at that time when they were so far under them,
as to swear Allegiance to them. After this <hi>Antiochus
Pius</hi> did grant them their Liberty upon Composition;
which they enjoyed as their Neighbours did, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
not as Slaves to the Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> but as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
oppressed by them.</p>
            <p>(3.) When they were reduced into the form of a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Province;</hi> which was done by <hi>Pompey.</hi> And from
that time they were in Subjection to the Roman State;

having secured the <hi>Italian</hi> Forces to himself; <hi>but
he declined the Name, till he understood the Design of</hi>
Germanicus.</p>
            <p>So that here we have a plain <hi>Original</hi> Usurpation in
<hi>Tiberius;</hi> there being no consent of Senate and People to
his assuming the Soveraign Power. And yet <hi>Tacitus</hi>
saith, <hi>First the Consulls and great Officers, then the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and People did swear Allegiance to him.</hi> Which was
before he had their Consent. For he used his own Art
afterwards, that he might seem to be chosen by them;
and not to come to his Power by the force of Arms, or
the Intrigues of his Mother. But what Appearance of
consent soever afterwards he gained from the <hi>Senate,</hi> it
was extorted from them by Force or Fraud; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the same Historians. But what Right can
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98150:22"/>
such a Consent give? And he took away the Remainder
of the Peoples Liberties in their <hi>Comitia,</hi> and never
asked their Consent.</p>
            <p>What then was the Right of <hi>Tiberius</hi> to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
founded upon? <hi>Augustus</hi> had several repeated
Acts, whereby they continued his Government from
time to time, and thereby shewed their Consent, as
<hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> affirm, <hi>that the whole Government was
committed to him from the Senate and People;</hi> But what
is there like this in the Case of <hi>Tiberius? He was</hi>
Augustus <hi>his Wife's Son, and he made him his Heir by
his Testament:</hi> And what was that to the Roman
State? Was not <hi>Agrippa Posthumus,</hi> then living, much
nearer to <hi>Augustus,</hi> who was his own Grand-child?
And by, the Story in <hi>Tacitus</hi> of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> seemed
designed by him to succeed him; but upon the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of it, first <hi>Augustus,</hi> and then <hi>Agrippa</hi> was sent
out of the World to make way for <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who
had before-hand engaged the Italian Legions. So
that he trusted to no Testamentary Right, as appears
by all his Collusions with the Senate, which there had
been no place for, if he had assumed the Government
by virtue of <hi>Augustus</hi> his <hi>Testament</hi> or <hi>Adoption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have then a plain Instance of one who
was in the Possession of Power without Colour of
Right, and yet <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> were taken to him,
both by the Senate and People. And when these
Oaths were taken, there was no adjusting the matter
between him and the Senate; for he had newly assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Government by Force when they took these
Oaths. Here was no unquestion'd Authority from the
Senate (whatever <hi>Vell. Paterculus</hi> pretends) but when
he had gotten the Power into his Hands, he required
them to own it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:98150:23"/>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> was so wise, as when they offer'd him their
Oaths, he refused them for this Reason; <hi>He considered
well,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dio <hi>l.</hi> 54.</note> saith <hi>Dio, that if they gave their free Consent, they
would do what they promised without swearing; and if
they did not, all the Oaths in the World would not make
them.</hi> But <hi>Tiberius</hi> was of another Mind, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
their Oaths in the first place; and it is not
improbable that the same were required in several
Provinces.</p>
            <p>When our Saviour appeared in <hi>Iudea, Tiberius</hi> was
in Possession of this Power, over the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
and because the Jews were more scrupulous than
other People, on account of their Fundamental Laws,
as to the owning any usurped Jurisdiction over them;
some among them put the Question to him about paying
Tribute to <hi>Caesar, i. e.</hi> about owning any Act of
Subjection to an Usurped Power. For there were
plausible Arguments on both sides; one was from
the Strictness of their Laws; the other was from
the Benefit they received from the Roman Protection.
The former seemed to have more of Conscience, and
the latter of Human Prudence. Our Saviour takes a
wise Method to answer the Doubt; he asks for the
Currant Tribute-Mony, and finding it had <hi>Cesar</hi>'s
Superscription, saith, <hi>Give to</hi> Cesar <hi>the things that
are</hi> Cesar's. They might have replied, they are his
<hi>de facto,</hi> but not <hi>de Iure.</hi> Why did not our Saviour
answer this Difficulty, but leave them to collect their
Duty from the use of <hi>Cesar</hi>'s Coin among them?
Might not one that had no Right, have the Power
of coining Mony, and dispersing it, so that it should
be in common use? And was not <hi>Tiberius</hi> such an one?
What then doth he mean by this Answer? Either
we must say, that he declines the main Question, or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98150:23"/>
that he resolved it to be lawful, upon general Reasons,
to shew Acts of Subjection to such a Power, which
we may not be satisfied, is according to our Laws.
For so it is plain the Roman Power was not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Jewish Constitution; and although that
were from God, yet our Saviour, who gives the
best Directions for Conscience, would by no means
have Men to be peevish or obstinate in such Matters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But paying of Tribute is quite another thing from
Oaths of Allegiance.</hi> It is so, as to the manner of
testifying our Subjection; but the main Question is,
Whether any Act of Subjection be lawful or not?
If it be lawful to testify it one way, why not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
If in paying Tribute, why not in solemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to pay it? If in promising, why not in swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>i. e.</hi> in calling God to witness that I do it?
Thus far then we may go; <hi>we may swear to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute;</hi>
But on what account? Is it not as a Token of
Allegiance, <hi>i. e.</hi> of a Duty owing on the account
of Protection? Then we have gained one step far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>viz.</hi> that we may swear to perform some parts
of Allegiance. But why then may we not do so
as to all that such an Oath implies? If it respects no
more than the Duty which we owe, with respect to
the Publick. And that is certainly the meaning of an
Oath, when all Declarations of Right are left out,
and only those of Duty expressed, as it is in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Case.</p>
            <p>As to the dreadful Charge of <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
which some, of much greater Heat than Judgment,
have made use of against those who hold it lawful to
take the Oaths; If what I have said be true, it is little
less than ridiculous: And it would have had more
appearance of Reason, if the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had urged
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98150:24"/>
it against our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Resolution of the Case about
<hi>Tribute-Mony.</hi> For, had not God by his own Law
settled the Government among them? And was it not
a Fundamental Article of that Law, that none should
rule over them, but one of their Brethren? Was the
Roman Emperor, or <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> such? Have not all
the ancient Zealots of the Law opposed any such Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power? What can it be then less than <hi>Perjury
and Apostacy</hi> to give any Countenance to such an open
Violation of this Law, and to incourage Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it; when they find such Liberties allowed by
such a Teacher? But I forbear.</p>
            <p>To conclude then; I have, at your earnest Desire,
taken this Matter into serious Consideration, and have
impartially weighed the most pressing Difficulties I
have met with; I cannot promise to give you Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
but I have satisfied my self, and have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to do the same for you. I am heartily sorry
for any Breaches among us at this time, and it is easy
to foresee who will be the Gainers by them. But I am
glad to understand that the chiefest of those who scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Oaths, have declared themselves against the
Attempts of such an <hi>unseasonable Separation,</hi> and I hope
others will be so wise as to follow their Example.</p>
