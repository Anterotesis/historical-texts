         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Lievtenant Colonell JOHN BOOKER being ſent out of the Province of Munſter by the
Right Honourable the Lord of Inchiquine Lord Preſident, and the Councell of Warre there,
and having delivered Letters from his Lordſhip to the Honourable the Speaker of the Houſe of
Commons, to the Right Honourable the Committee of Lords and Commons for the Iriſh affaires,
and alſo to the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Councell of the City
of London, earneſtly deſiring to promote the good of that Province and Kingdome, ſo that his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
here might not be fruitleſſe, nor the expectations of the Army there fruſtrate, in this
their great neceſsity, doth humbly preſent the ſtate and condition of the Army in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat at his arrivall there in <hi>September</hi> laſt, he found them in great wants both of cloathes and money,
being then lately returned from the taking of <hi>Piltown</hi> Caſtle; and preſently after the Lord Preſident
called a Councell of Warre adviſing with them to march forth upon another Deſigne, and how to
procure money, that the Souldiers and Officers might be enabled in ſome meaſure for that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and finding no way but by making uſe of friends to borrow, did then take up ſome money, (which
yet remains unſatisfied) Whereupon his Lordſhip drew forth all the forces of horſe and foote (leaving ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
guards to ſecure our Gariſons) into the County of <hi>Lymbricke,</hi> which is above fourty miles from our
Winter quarters, and a rich countrey, where we intended to have laine ſome time, the better to relieve our
men, and to annoy the enemy, which during our ſtay there, we did, by driving away their cattle, and fireing
all the Corn which we could not ſecure to our Gariſons; but the violence of raine and ſtormes were ſuch, the
waters encreaſing, and our men by continuing in the field, where they had little or no ſhelter, many of them
alſo wanting Cloaths, and being bare footed, and moſt of them wanting ſhirts, fell dangerouſly ſick of the
<hi>Flux,</hi> and ammunition waxing ſcarce, and that we had, having taken wett, we were enforced (for thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
to march back to <hi>Mallowe,</hi> where we ſtayed to refreſh our men whileſt we ſent to <hi>Cork</hi> for a ſupply
of Ammunition, determining to march into the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> but the weather continuing with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſtormes, thunder, lightning and raine, (ſuch as I have not ſeene the like before) we were enforced into
our gariſons not without the great hazzard of our Army, being conſtrained to wade to the Arme-pitts, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
being ſo difficult to pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, (the enemy having deſtroyed all the Bridges) and ſo being returned, we ſtill
expected a faire opportunity to draw forth our men, the better to preſerve our ſtores, yet the raine ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
the Army could not be drawne forth againe at my comming away, when there was not 14. dayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
left at a ſmall allowance, that the wants of that Army were very great, inſomuch as the Officers had not
received one penny pay for many weeks together, before my comming from thence; and that many of them
were forced to pawne their cloathes to buy them bread, and that many of the Officers at this day goe upon
ticket for what they have: That the countrey within our reach is generally waſted, and yeelds neither free
quarter, nor other accommodations, but the Souldiers are forced to content themſelves with what they carry
on their backs.</p>
            <p>That wants in the Army were ſuch, that the common ſouldiers were for ſome weeks before I came away
ſtinted to 6. pence a week in money, and a loafe of 6. pence a peece, which was ſo ſmall an allowance as that the
ſouldiers, (eſpecially thoſe that were ſent hence from better means) could hardly be contained, and many of
them grew much diſcontented thereat, which they profeſſed by often ſaying, that they would rather goe to
the Rebells, where they ſhould be provided for, then ſtay and ſtarve with us: of all which, I was an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſe.</p>
            <p>That the horſe there are generally very much impaired by a ſtrange mortality, and ſcarcely the one halfe
of the former number are left, and thoſe much weakened by their late ill marches and conſtant duty, and
that no horſe have arrived there, ſince Collonell <hi>Iepſons,</hi> who were deſigned in <hi>September</hi> 1645. and landed
the beginning of the next Summer.</p>
            <p>That if the horſe upon the place were recruited, and the 500. horſe deſigned for the ſervice of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
at the Lord Preſidents being here were ſent over, and the Regiment of foote already ſent thither made
full, horſes and carriages with a ſufficient traine of Artillery, and all things thereunto belonging ſent, the want
whereof is none of the leaſt defects, there is no doubt but by the bleſſing of God we ſhould ſoon be Maſters
of that Province.</p>
            <p>That the Countrey is generally wett in winter, full of Rivers and Paſſages, and void of houſing for horſe
or men upon their marches, ſo as it is not to be expected that they ſhould keepe the Army abroad for any
long time in the winter without too great prejudice to the Souldiers in their health, Cloaths and Armes,
and therefore it is humbly offered as more expedient for the ſervice: That money and proviſions were ſent
to them that are there upon the place, to enable them to ſubſiſt untill a convenient ſeaſon of doing ſervice,
then that more men ſhould be ſent over to encreaſe the charge, as of late hath bin, without meanes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
the ſame: but if any forces be thither deſigned, it is humbly deſired, that they may be haſtened over to
make our incurſions more frequent and effectuall, yet ſo as they bring ſome fit means of ſubſiſtance with
them whereby the Rebels will be the more diſabled to raiſe an Army to withſtand us this next Spring.</p>
            <p>That whatſoever meanes is intended by the Piety and Wiſdome of the Parliament, to be ſent over, is of
double advantage to the Army and to the ſervice, to be ſent in money, <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> rather then in Corn,
<pb facs="tcp:40676:2"/>
or victualls, except Corn, Biskets, and ſome Cheeſe, to continue as a ſtore in caſe of ſcarcity, the Corn ſent
hence ſtanding there in 50 s. <hi>per</hi> Quarter, or thereabouts; whereas it may be bought there for halfe the price,
and ſo will be had as long as the Markets may be kept open.</p>
            <p>That the Charge of that Army amounts to 1210 l. <hi>per</hi> week, or thereabouts, allowing each Common
Souldier 2 s. each Trooper 5 s. a Colonell of Foot 4 l. a Lievtenant Colonell 3 l. and a Major 2 l. 10 s.
a Captain 1 l. 7 s. a Lievtenant 12 s. an Enſign 9 s. a Colonell of Horſe 5 l. a Major 3 l. a Captain of Horſe
2 l. a Lievtenant 1 l. 4 s. a Corner 16 s. with a proportionable allowance to inferiour Officers, Officers of
the Staffe, Gunners, and ſuch as muſt neceſſarily be maintained about the Train of Artillery, which is
not halfe pay for the Common Souldiers, nor a third of the pay for the Officers; and that upon the
place there cannot be raiſed above 120 l. <hi>per</hi> Week, which alſo is anticipated for ſome Moneths to come,
to ſatisfie thoſe whoſe goods they have contracted for their neceſſary reliefe in their extremity, upon that
Accompt: and that it is to be remembred, that the greateſt part of the meanes hitherto deſigned for that
Province hath been expended in raiſing of Forces, in Armes, Ammunition, and other neceſſary things.</p>
            <p>That the Cities, walled Towns, and Harbours in the Parliaments power of that Province, are of mighty
importance for the Parliaments ſervice, in relation to the Religion, to the Safety and Welfare of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and generally of Trade and Traffique, inſomuch that it hath been certified by thoſe truſted in the
Navie, that the Harbours of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Kinſale</hi> onely are of as much conſequence to this Kingdome as <hi>Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the ſaid Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter</hi> is one well known to be moſt reall in the Cauſe, of much
gallantry and reſolution, of much induſtry and action, who moſt ſeaſonably ſecured thoſe Parts for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
againſt the common Enemy. That he doth with extraordinary fidelity, conſtancy, care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
in his owne perſon, ſee that the Officers and Souldiers doe their duties, in the ſervice of God and
the Parliament.</p>
            <p>That the Officers and Souldiers there are not onely good guides in the Countrey, but are generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Souldiers, and valiant men, that have endured much hardſhip, faithfully, freely, and cheerfully
ſerved, to the hazzard of their lives in the Parliaments ſervice, and deſirous ſtill to continue the ſame.</p>
            <p>That but a bare ſubſiſtance is deſired for the preſent.</p>
            <p>That if a ſettlement and ſupply be not ſpeedy, the ruine, the loſſe of thoſe important places to the Iriſh,
or ſome forraign State or Potentate, and conſequently the loſſe of the Parliaments intereſt there muſt be;
and that it will be no great charge or difficulty for the Parliament, by the bleſſing of God, ſpeedily to become
Maſters of that Province.</p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly deſired, That ſome effectuall courſe be ſpeedily taken for the ſubſiſtance of
the Army, by the recruiting the old Regiments of Horſe and Foot, and ſupplying them with money to
be paid in a ſetled way, and a ſufficient Train of Artillery, with Carriages, Waggons, Pickaxes, Spades, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
Mortar-peeces, Granadoes, and other neceſſaries thereunto belonging, for the carrying on the Warre
there, and I doubt not but by the bleſſing and aſſiſtance of God they will render your Honours a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
