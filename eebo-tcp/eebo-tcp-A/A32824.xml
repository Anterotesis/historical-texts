            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Practical Treatiſe
Concerning
Evil Thoughts.</head>

               <q>For out of the heart proceed evil
thoughts—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Am now entred upon a
ſubject which demands
more than ordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Reader.
The Government of the
Thoughts is what I intend to
diſcourſe on from theſe words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60705:5"/>
Which, as it is a matter of the
greateſt importance, ſo it is
a thing of no ſmall difficulty.
Few Medicines can reach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
wounds, and he is an
Artiſt indeed that can cure
them. But notwithſtanding
the difficulty, I have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; and ſhall lay before you
the beſt method that I can, in
order to the well-governing of
the thoughts. Which when
attained, is an Atchievement
above thoſe of the Greateſt
Conquerors, and deſerves Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
beyond rhe moſt famous
Exploits of Victory that ever
were made. The wiſeſt of men
telling us,<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 32.</note> 
               <hi>that he that ruleth
his Spirit, is better than he that
taketh a City.</hi> And our own
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60705:5"/>
experience confirms this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the wiſe man. For
there is nothing a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Obſervation than that
Great Generals and Captains,
who have carried their Arms
through diſtant Nations, and
have done wonders, and even
brought the world into ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
have yet been ſlaves to
their own ſelves; tamely yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to their own corrupt and
wicked hearts, and have not
obtained a Conqueſt over their
own thoughts. They have not
avoided ſoiling their Triumphs
with their Vices, and aſperſing
their glorious Actions with a
wicked life. As if the Reward
of their beſt Actions were to
be their worſt, and as if it were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60705:6"/>
a Crown to their Arms to be
diſſolved in Luſt, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Impieties: As if the
bleſſing of ſucceſs were Riot
and Intemperance, and the
greateſt of ſins to be their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds.
What can be a greater
and truer Reflection than this?
which as it takes off from the
Credit and Applauſe of the
Nobleſt Actions, ſo it ſerves
to ſhew us, that 'tis a more
difficult task to conquer our
own thoughts than the moſt
potent Adverſaries; to ſubdue
our Hearts and Souls than
whole Battalions; and that
man is the greateſt enemy to
himſelf: <hi>For out of the Heart
proceed evil thoughts</hi>—He that
ſearcheth the heart, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60705:6"/>
the thoughts, ſpake theſe
words.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion on which he
ſpake them ſhall be the <hi>First
thing</hi> which I ſhall conſider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the
vaſt advantage of well-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our thoughts, in order to
the purpoſes of Religion in
general.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That evil thoughts
ariſe out of the heart, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from thence; which lays
an Obligation on us of reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, and how far we
are able ſo to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I ſhall lay down
ſome General Rules and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for our eaſier and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
performing of this great,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60705:7"/>

neceſſary work, of well-gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erning
the thoughts. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I ſhall ſelect ſome

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>THE Occaſion on which
our bleſſed Lord and
Saviour ſpake theſe words:
<hi>For out of the heart proceed evil
thoughts</hi>—was this:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
who were the Teachers and
Expounders of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law,
and whoſe buſineſs it was to
give the true meaning of it:
Inſtead of that did groſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the real deſign, ſenſe and
meaning of it; put erroneous
and falſe Gloſſes upon it, and
many times impoſed their
own Traditions upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the place of it. And yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60705:8"/>
none pretended a more ſtrict
Obſervance of the Law than
they. Inſomuch that we find
them in the beginning of this
Chapter with an uſual arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
demanding of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,<note place="margin">V. 2.</note>
                  <hi>Why do thy Diſciples
tranſgreſs the tradition of the
Elders? For they waſh not their
hands when they eat bread.</hi> To
which our Saviour gives this
anſwer; <hi>(viz.)</hi> That they of
all men had the leaſt reaſon to
tax his Diſciples with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of ſuch a Ceremony as
waſhing before meat; as if
that were ſuch an Invaſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Tradition, and a crying
ſin; when they themſelves
were guilty of a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
in endeavouring to vacate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60705:8"/>
the Obligation of the fifth
Commandment by falſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
a caſe which would
diſcharge them from honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and relieving their Parents;
and ſo making void the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God by their
own Tradition, with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<note place="margin">Mark 7. 11, 12.</note>
Their <hi>Corban</hi> was an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
way to cover their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice,
and they could not have
invented a more colourable
pretence to varniſh over their
moſt ſordid and unnatural
Temper than that was.</p>
               <p>And indeed this was their
common Method, when they
had any Wicked deſign in
hand, then to ſeem moſt
Religious: And when they
<hi>made long Prayers</hi> 'twas but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60705:9"/>
too ſure a ſign of their <hi>devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Widows Houſes.</hi> And
for this reaſon our Bleſſed
Lord doth ſo often and ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
rebuke them; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
here, where after he had
given them ſuch an Anſwer as
he did; he expoſeth and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them open to the People,
and Cenſures the Vanity and
Hypocriſie of all their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pretentions. And direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
His Diſcourſe to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
He aſſures them that true
Religion Conſiſteth not in
ſuch outward Waſhings and
Cleanſings and Ceremonious
Purgations; but in the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and inward purification of
the Mind and Soul, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all our Thoughts and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60705:9"/>
Imaginations, and of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Product of them. That
if the Heart be pure and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Thoughts and then the
Actions will be ſo too: But if
the Heart be foul and wicked,
the iſſues of it will be Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent.
When the Spirit of
a Man is truely ſeaſoned with
Religion, it will ſhew it ſelf
in all the Beautious and Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fruits of Righteouſneſs.
But when the Principle is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and Debauch'd, the
effects muſt and will be filthy
and abominable. That a
Man is not defiled by any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
thing that he either Eats
or Drinks, but by his own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
deſires and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>the things which come out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60705:10"/>
of him. For out of the Heart
proceed evil Thoughts, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Adulteries, Fornications,
Thefts, Falſe-witneſſes, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
theſe are the things which
defile a Man: But to eat with
unwaſhen Hands defileth not
a Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Ceremonious part
of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law aim'd at,
and terminated in this. Their
Ceremonies were Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Types of matters
under the Goſpel. And
their frequent Waſhings and
Cleanſings, were to denote
the Spiritual Purifying of the
Heart and Soul.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, God injoyned
them to be obſerved for a
time, the Ignorance and Non-age
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60705:10"/>

were all Aboliſhed and done
away, at the coming of the
Meſſiah. When the Son of
God himſelf became our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inſtructor and Teacher,
and informed Mankind of
the Nature of that Rational
and Spiritual Worſhip, which
God did expect from us, and
would be acceptable to him.
That it was the Devotion of
the Soul, the Purity of the
Heart, the Spirituality of the
Thoughts, that Living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
alone, that would pleaſe
God who is an Infinite Spirit,
and prepare us for the Refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
joys of Heaven, and the

Exalted pleaſures of Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims:
And Conſequently,
that the greateſt and moſt
Important Duty incumbent
on Mankind, was to Govern
the Heart and ſubdue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Thoughts. This then, in
ſhort, was the occaſion of
our Saviours ſpeaking theſe
Words; which did effectually
humble theſe proud <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
whoſe whole Religion was
mere Pomp and outward
Shew; and Conſiſted meerly
in broad Phylacteries, an
affected Garb, and demure
Looks; while theſe <hi>Gaudy and
Painted Sepulchres, were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
full of all manner of rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and uncleaneſs:</hi> And at
the ſame time lets us ſee a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60705:11"/>
of true Religion,
and how excellent and noble
an Inſtitution that is, which
extends to the inmoſt receſſes
of the Soul, and ſo tends to
Refine the very thoughts of
the Heart, and to fit Men for
the pure State of Angels. And
therefore, is far above all
other Inſtitutions that ever
were in the World before.</p>

               <p>THE next thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

the vaſt advantage of well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
of our Thoughts, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the purpoſes of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in General. Now this advantage
is very great and obvious: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Perſon muſt be Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that the moſt proper and
only way for a Man to live
well, is to begin at his Heart;
to put his thoughts into a true
order and government. For
otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there can be no
Uniformity in his Piety. The
good Actions that he doth are
broken and imperfect; and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60705:12"/>
he is apt every now and then
to make freſh Work for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
by returning to
his old ſins. But this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the well governing our
Thoughts will be the better
ſeen by ſome Particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> then, a care of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
Thoughts is the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative
againſt actual ſins.
'Tis a moſt certain truth, that
the greateſt ſin that ever was
committed was at firſt but a
Thought. The fouleſt Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and moſt Monſtrous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
aroſe from ſo ſmall a
ſpeck as a firſt Thought may
be reſembled to. The moſt
horrid thing that ever was
done, as well as the moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Vertuous action that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60705:13"/>
ever was accompliſhed, had
no greater a beginning. Of ſuch
a quick growth, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nature is ſin, that it Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
even the Kingdome of
Heaven, which our Lord tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>is like to a Graine of
Muſtard-ſeed, which a Man
took and Sowed in his Field.
Which indeed, is the least of
all ſeeds; but when it is grown
up</hi> [in theſe Countries] <hi>it is
the greateſt among Herbs, and
becometh a Tree, ſo that tbe
Birds of the Air come and Lodge
in the Branches of it.</hi> But
the Apoſtle St. <hi>James,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 13, 14, 15.</note> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
it by a Simile of another
Nature, comparing the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and growth of it to
the Formation of an Embryo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60705:13"/>
in the Womb. <hi>Let no Man
ſay when he is tempted, I am
tempted of God: For God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be tempted with evil, neither
tempteth he any Man. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man is tempted when he
is drawn away of his own Luſt
and inticed. Then when his
Luſt hath Conceived, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth ſin, and ſin when it is
finiſhed bringeth forth Death.</hi>
It is Conceived, Bred, Lives,
and Grows in a Man, till at
laſt it domineers in him, and
<hi>Reigns in his Mortal Body.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note>
And therefore it is abſolutely
neceſſary, that we govern and
manage our Thoughts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that we ſhould avoid fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into actual ſins, even the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60705:14"/>
greateſt. That we reſiſt the
beginings, the very firſt Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of Evil, if we hope
to avoid the laſt Degrees of
it.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt folly to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that we can indulge evil
Thoughts, without being in
danger of commtting actual
ſins, or that ſpeculation and
practiſe are things ſo vaſtly
diſtant from each other.
This is ſo far from being true,
that there can be nothing more
certain than the contrary. If
we would preſerve our ſelves
from falling into actual ſins,
we muft govern and ſuppreſs
our Thoughts. And if we
would have our Life pure and
unſpotted, the Heart muſt be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60705:14"/>
kept in intire ſubjection. If
we would not be plunged into
the guilt of preſumptuous ſins,
we muſt be ſure to reſiſt the
firſt motions of evil, all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Thoughts. For no
man is always in the ſame
temper, his Reſolution is not
ever the ſame as it may be now,
or at another time. His Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are Fluctuating; ſometimes
there is (as it may be called) a
Spring-Tide of them. And
a Man at ſome ſeaſons is more
receptive of evil impreſſions,
more yielding and eaſy to be
tempted, than at others.
And though an evil Thought
may not ſo ſtrongly move
him at one time, yet it may
at another. And every encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60705:15"/>
of it, adds to the
falſeneſs and treachery of his
own deceitful and wicked
heart, which will betray him
whenever an opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.
And therefore he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to be nicely careful
over his thoughts, if he would
not fall into actual ſins.</p>
               <p>Let us think as boldly and
confidently of our ſelves as we
pleaſe; let us reſt never ſo
much upon our own ſtrength;
it is our weakneſs. 'Tis not
our preſuming thoughts of our
ſelves that will make us invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.
Nay, there are none
ſooner overcome and thrown
down than ſuch as conceit
great and mighty things of
themſelves. The ſhameful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60705:15"/>
of the warm and boaſting
Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 70, 72, 74.</note> ſhould be ſufficient
to convince us that the beſt of
men are not above that advice,
<hi>(1 Cor. 10. 12.) Wherefore let
him that thinketh he ſtandeth,
take heed lest he fall.</hi> If we do
not keep a ſtrict watch, and a
careful hand over our thoughts,
they will inevitably betray us
when an opportunity ſerves,
and make moſt furious aſſaults
upon us, when we are leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of it. We can no more
reſtrain them when we pleaſe
(whatever we think) we can
no more ſtop them from brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out, than we can ſmother
a raging Flame, or chain a
foaming Billow. And therefore
whoſoever he be that allows
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60705:16"/>
his thoughts an extravagant li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
he is much miſtaken if
he thinks that he is ſure to ſtop
there.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> But admit that he could:
Can it be thought by any Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creature that God doth
not take any notice of his
thoughts themſelves? Suppoſe
it were in the power of any
perſon to act contrary to his
habit of thinking, and to avoid
the practice of theſe ſins which
he indulges himſelf in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of: Hath an Omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and an holy God, think
you, no regard to the thoughts
and the inward temper and
diſpoſition of the Soul? If we
think ſo, then we have mean
thoughts of him indeed; and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60705:16"/>
make Religion degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſervice of brute beaſts.
For wherein doth man differ
from them but in his <hi>Reaſon</hi>
and <hi>Thought?</hi> and that he is
capable of knowing God; of
being raviſh'd with his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
and Perfections, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by his ſuitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and taking delight in
the glorious Communications
of himſelf to his Soul, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him with his whole heart,
and being united to him by a
life of thought? Upon which
conſideration it muſt needs
follow, that the Great God is
ſo far from diſregarding our
thoughts, that he hath a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
reſpect to them. And tho
it ſhould chance that they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60705:17"/>
ſhould never break out into
Actions, and Groſs Practices,
yet God looks to the <hi>inward
parts;</hi> is a narrow obſerver,
and ſearcher of the thoughts:
is pleaſed when his Throne is
eſtabliſhed in the Soul, and his
Dominion and Empire over
all its Thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
and abhors and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
an unclean, wicked, or
Rebellious Heart. To him
all the Pomp of Religion and
ſplendor of outward Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
is without it deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 11.</note>
The Soul is the Seat of
Religion; As for the Parts
and Members of our Bodies,
they are intirely at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Mind. The
Underſtanding and Will are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60705:17"/>
their Deſpotick Rulers. And
as the Heart and the Thoughts
are diſpoſed, ſo is the Practice
and Converſation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
them the Almighty prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
regards. As a Man
can never teſtifie the truth of
his Love to God, or evidence
the Sincerity of his Soul,
without having a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the well Governing of
his Thoughts: So without it,
Damnation may juſtly be his
Portion, tho the Plague break
not out in the Botches and
Ulcers of a profligate Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
tho the Pollution be
concealed and hidden. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if we are ſo prophane as
to think of God as a Man,
and eſteem Him to be ſuch an
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60705:18"/>
one as our ſelves: If His Eye
could not penetrate any deeper
than ours, but were fallible
and weak; If he could not ſee
into our Breaſts, and diſcover
the Secrets of our Hearts:
Then there might be ſome
reaſon for us to imagine that
He did not regard our
Thoughts, ſo our viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
were ſmooth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted.
But ſince He is an
All-ſeeing and an All-knowing
God, and profeſſedly declares
himſelf ſuch in the Sacred
Scriptures:<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.</note> The reaſon of
Man cannot ſubmit to ſuch an
idle fancy as this, <hi>viz.</hi> that
He hath no reſpect to a Mans
Thoughts; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
muſt believe, that He
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60705:18"/>
hath an eſpecial Eye to them,
and will aſſuredly call us to an
Account for them at the Day
of Judgment.</p>
               <p>For tho our Saviour's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<hi>(Mat. 12. 36.)</hi> extends
only to <hi>every idle word,</hi> yet in
the very Verſe before he ſhews
that the <hi>Heart</hi> is principally
regarded, and therefore to be
obſerved by our ſelves. And
more fully and clearly in his
divine Sermon on the Mount,
(Mat. 5. 20.) <hi>For I ſay unto you,
that except your Righteouſneſs
ſhall exceed the Righteouſneſs
of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye
ſhall in no caſe enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven. Ye have
heard that it was ſaid by them
of old time, thou ſhalt not kill;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60705:19"/>
and whoſoever ſhall kill ſhall be
in danger of the Judgment: But
I ſay unto you, that whoſoever
is angry with his brother with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of
the Judgment.</hi> And v. 27. <hi>Ye
have heard that it was ſaid by
them of old time, thou ſhalt not
commit Adultery; but I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, that whoſoever looketh on
a woman to luſt after her, hath
committed Adultery already with
her in his heart.</hi> From all which
it plainly appears, that if a man
could indulge himſelf in all
manner of Licentious <hi>thoughts</hi>
without any further danger,
yet that (God knows) is evil
ſufficient, becauſe the <hi>thoughts
of the Heart</hi> are principally
regarded by Almighty God.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60705:19"/>
But indeed it is hardly poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to imagine how any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that is <hi>careleſs of his heart,</hi>
ſhould be otherwiſe of <hi>his Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
or how he that is vain, filthy,
or any way Vicious in his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
can be pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſober and Religious in his
Converſation and Practice.
Upon both which accounts we
ſee the <hi>vaſt Advantage</hi> that we
ſhall <hi>iufallibly reap</hi> by being
diligent and careful in the
<hi>well-governing of our thoughts.</hi>
But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That which will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
ſerve to make us further ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the <hi>great advantage of
well-governing our thoughts,</hi> is
this, Viz. <hi>That we ſhall ever
be in a preparation for the beſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60705:20"/>
and moſt weighty Duties by this
means.</hi> We ſhall not only be
able to reſiſt and repel the fury
of temptations, but be ready
for the performance of every
Duty. Theſe men that have
not inur'd themſelves to an
habit of Thought, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
exerciſed a ſtrict regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
over the motions of their
own Hearts, will require a
great deal of time to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and order their Thoughts,
and reduce them into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Frame and Poſture. Theſe
that careleſly give their Minds
a looſe, as ſoon as any ſolemn
and weighty Duty is over, and
ſuffer their Thoughts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the old Subject of the
World, or any other of their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60705:20"/>
Vanities. The ſame difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will attend them to bring
their Thoughts into a due
Frame again which did at firſt.
So that they will thereby be
mightily hindered in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
in Religion. Their
progreſs in Holineſs will be
much retarded. They la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in a Circle. Or at beſt
they will move but ſlowly on,
in the way to Heaven, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of theſe that keep a
conſtant and ſtrict Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over their Thoughts.
Theſe latter will be able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to ſay with the Pſalmiſt
<hi>O God my Heart is ready,</hi>

                  <hi>my

happy and deſirable temper of
Soul is this? What Spiritual
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60705:21"/>
comforts and benefits do theſe
enjoy, which others for want
of a due care, and watchfulneſs
deprive themſelves of? Theſe
only want an opportunity of

Holy Duties: Others
want a due Temper and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
when they have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.
While the Thoughts
of others are juſt fluttering
above the Ground, theirs are
in the Third Heaven. While
they are tuning their Souls
and putting them in Frame,
theſe are joyning in Hallelujahs
with the Angels. In a Word,
theſe who have attain'd to this
happy Government of their
Thoughts may be reſembled
to the <hi>Wiſe Virgins who had</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The advantage of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
this great Duty of well Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Thoughts is great upon
this account alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe
nothing ſo much conduceth to
<hi>quiet</hi> the Thoughts, and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
the Mind, as this doth.
The greateſt part of our
trouble and perturbation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from want of a due
care of, and Watchfulneſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our Thoughts. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times our troubles are ſo
great that they convince us of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60705:22"/>
the abſolute neceſſity of this
Duty; becauſe then we find
that nothing elſe can give us
eaſe under them, or quiet our
Spirits. Now Peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
of mind is a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
help to Religion.
When a man's <hi>Soul</hi> &amp; <hi>Thoughts</hi>
are quiet, he goes ſmoothly
on,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 21.</note> ſeems to enjoy <hi>that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
liberty of the Sons of God,</hi>
which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of.
He hath a true reliſh of the
Sweets of Religion; his Soul
is dilated and enlarged, and he
is able <hi>to run the ways of God's
Commandments.</hi> Whereas there
is but a ſlender furtherance in
<hi>good,</hi> but ſmall improvements,
when the thoughts are hurried,
the imaginations tumultuary,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60705:22"/>
and the Soul in an unhappy
diſorder, by any domineering
and contrary Luſts, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſe. The Soul of any
Wicked Man is meer <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,

And could we but behold it

never ſuch a confuſed Scene as
that is repreſented it ſelf to

of a good Man, and one that

quiet, peaceable, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
All his Thoughts and
Faculties are in good order,
and then he is fit for any thing,

more eaſe than others can.
The preſent Harmony and
Peace of his Mind, renders
him capable of effectually
minding <hi>the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to his everlasting Peace.</hi> In a
Word, the Advantage of this
happy governing our Thoughts
is ſo great, that we can hardly
perform any thing that is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God without it; in
ſome meaſures. We cannot be
eaſie to our ſelves, or ſerviceable

attain'd a Command and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over his Thoughts, does
and ſuffers every thing well.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60705:24"/>
He Acts with Conſcience,
ſuffers with Patience. He
Acts with Vigour, ſuffers with
Courage. He does his Duty
with half that difficulty, and
endures Afflictions with leſs

               <p>I Come now in the next
place to ſhew, <hi>That evil
thoughts ariſe out of the heart,
and proceed from thence; which
lays an Obligation on us of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
and governing them;
and how far we are able ſo to do.</hi>
Our Saviour here aſſures us,
that <hi>Out of the heart proceed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
thoughts.</hi> The heart <hi>(i. e.</hi> the
Soul, of man is a ſink of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and Uncleanneſs.
'Tis deſperately wicked. 'Tis
<hi>Pandora</hi>'s box, which lets fly
innumerable Plagues and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.
'Tis <hi>naturally</hi> the <hi>Source</hi>
of wickedneſs. And let a Man
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60705:26"/>
but look into himſelf, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
his own Heart, he will ſee
the greateſt cauſe to bewail
his corruptions and find that
there is nothing more deſerves
his complaints, and tears, than
his own heart. What a peſt?
what an Enemy doth he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
carry about with him?
<hi>'Tis not an open enemy, but a
familiar friend that doth him
the greatest hurt, and diſhonour.</hi>
The ſnake is lurking in his own
breaſt; and while he is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and gazing abroad; this
moſt perfidious and deadly
foe is a domeſtick one. His
own heart is the worſt of tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to him, and the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
enemy that he hath,
cannot do him half that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60705:26"/>
which he receives from
himſelf. 'Tis upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exclaims,
<hi>O wretched man that I am!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note>

alone who made the Worlds,
and raiſed all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
can renew the heart, and

can reſtore health and vigour
to the corrupt, depraved, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous

that will never be wanting to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60705:27"/>
our ſincere endeavours. It will
operate <hi>with</hi> our Endeavours,
but not <hi>without</hi> them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is in our power, in order
to it; and let us do that, and
the reſt the Grace of God will
ſupply. And one of the greateſt
incentives to make us uſe our
utmoſt endeavours, is, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conſideration of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and corruption of our
own heart. 'Tis neceſſary
therefore that we do not take
a <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>tranſient</hi> view on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but be engaged in a deep
and <hi>accurate</hi> inveſtigation of
our ſelves. Search every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of that cell, every receſs of
that Labyrinth, with as much
earneſtneſs as the <hi>Jews</hi> did for
leven.<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> And upon an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60705:27"/>
view, we ſhall find our
Lord's words verified; <hi>Out of
the heart proceed all evil thoughts.</hi>
No good, properly ſo called,
proceeds from thence, but
what is the Effect of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Bleſſed Spirit
of God. 'Tis not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
iſſue of the Soul, but
the Product of His Heavenly
Inſpirations, who is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſtriving with Man, and
endeavouring to Conſecrate
and Hallow all his Thoughts
and Affections, that ſo he may
be acceptable to God. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good Thought, every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Flight or Sacred De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
is ſtirred up by Him; is
His immediate Suggeſtion,
who is Wreſtling with the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60705:28"/>
ſtubborn and rebellious Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of our ſouls, and with our
impure imaginations, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into their proper
order and condition. Or elſe
'tis the whiſper of ſome good
Angel commiſſioned by him,
who is willing to perform a
Godlike act of charity to us,
that we may raiſe up our minds
to their proper object; and
lends us wings to mount up
to the higheſt Heaven withall.
For the heart of Man <hi>naturally</hi>
is full of evil, and out of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
all kind of wicked
thoughts, and vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It diſembogues ſuch
impure ſteams and contagious
exhalations, as blaſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the whole World. 'Tis an
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60705:28"/>
                  <hi>Aſphalites,</hi> a dead ſea, which
ſends up moſt noxious vapours.
'Tis from the <hi>heart</hi> that all
the evil in the world originally
proceeds: and therefore 'tis a
moſt natural piece of Advice,
that whenever we behold any
evil in any part, or inſtance of
the whole Creation, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
lay our hand upon our
breaſt, look into our ſelves,
and examine our own heart.
'Tis folly to lay the blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this and that, and t'other
thing, when we ſhould trace
the evil to its Fountain-head.
'Tis moſt true that all the
vile and ſinful thoughts; the
baſeſt, and moſt abominable
luſts proceed from the heart:
But when they are bred out
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60705:29"/>
of the corruption, and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the heart it ſelf, and
when caſt into it by the <hi>Devil,</hi>
'tis not ſo eaſy to determine.
The accurſed Enemy of our
ſouls doth (no doubt) lay hold
on all opportunities to caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our minds wicked thoughts;
and is very watchful of the
times and ſeaſons, when to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and debauch our ſouls,
and make them yet more vile
than <hi>naturally</hi> they are. And
therefore theſe wicked thoughts
which many timerous ſouls
imagine to be their own, may
be rationally preſumed to be
his. There are indeed ſome
marks which probably may
ſerve to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Devil</hi>'s
injections, from our own co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60705:29"/>
As when they are
monſtrouſly prophane and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous:
when they aſſault
us all of a ſudden with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
vehemence, filling us
with terrour and amazement.
Or elſe when they are ſuch
thoughts as contradict all the
intereſts of Humane Nature;
as when a Man thinks of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and deſtroying himſelf.
Such a thought cannot well
be ſuppoſed to be the iſſue of
the heart it ſelf, tho very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
but rather thrown in by
the <hi>Devil, Who was a murderer
from the beginning.</hi> But (I ſay)
as to the greater part of evil
thoughts, it is no eaſy matter
to know which are our own,
or which are the <hi>Devil</hi>'s. As
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60705:30"/>
for thoſe that are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
reſult of the heart, the
<hi>Devil</hi> is very quick and ready
to improve them. And for
theſe, which are the <hi>Devil</hi>'s
injections, our corrupt hearts
are too willing to comply
with them: ſo that we muſt
think our ſelves equally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to guard our ſelves againſt
the one, and the other. And
there is <hi>ſomething</hi> unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in our power in order to it.
We can do <hi>ſomething</hi> towards
it; unleſs we will look upon
our ſelves as Machines, and
ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſtroy both Reaſon and
Religion at once. I will agree
that by an hypochondriack,
or ſome other diſeaſe; or by
a long ſeries and habit of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60705:30"/>
which is a diſeaſe more
inveterate, and harder to be
cured, that the Oeconomy of
the Soul and Spirits may be ſo
broken and ſhattered, that the
power of thinking, is become
very weak and impaired; and
that the laſſitudes of the Soul
are as great almoſt as thoſe of
the Body. But yet I think
there are few caſes, but a man
can do ſomething in order to
a regular thinking. Few men
are arrived to ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of either, as to be able to
do nothing towards it: tho
it muſt be granted ſome can
do much more than others.
Our bleſſed Lord, when he
was upon Earth, did not give
uſeleſs Deſcriptions of things,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60705:31"/>
and deal with Men otherwiſe
than rational Creatures. And
therefore I cannot but ſuppoſe
that when he ſhews them that
out of <hi>the heart proceed evil
thoughts,</hi> 'twas to this end that
they ſhould endeavour to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
and ſubdue them.</p>
               <p>Now we may lay down
this as a certain Truth, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
that evil Thoughts whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they be, do not endanger
our Eternal Salvation further
than we comply with them.
They are not our Sins further
than we indulge them. But
totally to hinder them I think
is a thing Impracticable. It
is impoſſible <hi>but that ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will come.</hi> And I believe
the Holieſt Men find it ſo, ſo
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60705:31"/>
long as they are in a World
where there are ſo many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and in a State where
there are ſo many Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But yet when wicked
Thoughts ariſe in our Minds,
we may certainly chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we will harbour and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
them or not. This we
may do, as long as we have
any Liberty of Will left: ſo
much is unqueſtionably in our
power. Though 'tis confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
they will make frequent
returns upon us, and every
now and then with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
preſent themſelves
to us, tho but the laſt Moment
we thruſt them out. Like
an importunate Creditor, or
an Impertinent Gueſt, they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60705:32"/>
will obtrude themſelves upon
us, do what we can, and if
we tell them we have never
ſo great and weighty buſineſs,
they will ſtill be troubleſome
and haunt us, while we are
actually ingaged in it. Nay,
will purſue us even to the
Sanctuary; and aſſault us at
the Altar of God. Yet if we
as often truſt them out as they
return, they will never be
charged upon us. For 'tis a
giving them encouragement,
and a compliance with them,
that makes us Criminal. Then
alone Thoughts will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us as our Sins, when
we are pleaſed with them, or
when we do not <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ominate
and caſt them out as ſoon as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60705:32"/>
they come into our Minds; as
ſoon as we have Power to
diſcover that they are ſinful.
'Tis true the Devil may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to diſquiet and diſturb
the Peace and Tranquility of
our Conſciences, by his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
injections, and putting into
our Minds evil Thoughts:
But tho they are our grief and
moleſtation, yet they (being
reſiſted) are his Sins; and God
will judge him for them, and
ſpare and pitty us. <hi>God knows
whereof we are made, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth
that we are but dust.</hi>
The Bleſſed Jeſus Aſſum'd
our Nature, and therefore,
well knows how to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
us in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
He was Himſelf Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60705:33"/>
by the accurſed Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter;<note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note>
but he did not yield to
him, but reſiſted him; and
if we follow our Lord's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and do ſo too; if he
doth not preſently flee from
us, yet 'tis not our ſin, but
unhappineſs to be infeſted
with him. And this certainly
we are able to do: We may
undoubtedly chooſe whether
we will conſent to wicked
thoughts, and aprove them, or
not. If they do indeed meet
with a kind entertainment at
our hands, no wonder that
they grow bold, and familiar:
but if we deny them admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and ſhut them out, we
ſhall at length be rid of them,
or at leaſt they will not be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60705:33"/>
charged upon us. Even the
<hi>Devil</hi> is put to flight by reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,<note place="margin">James 4. 7.</note>
St. <hi>James</hi> tells us. He
remembers his Apoſtacy; he
trembles at the Name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi>
and when a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves
himſelf bravely againſt
him, he doth not care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the combat. If we give
the ſame reply to all his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
as our Bleſſed Lord
did: our trouble is greater
than our danger. If we would
but be watchful over our
ſelves, and have as much care
as we can of our thoughts, I
am apt to think, we ſhould
not complain ſo much of
them, as we often do. 'Tis
much for want of a due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of our ſelves, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60705:34"/>
keeping our hearts with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
that ſo many evil
thoughts proceed from thence.
The malignity, or folly of our
Imaginations is much owing
to our ſelves; to our own
ſloth, and careleſsneſs; to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or to an habit of ſin, or
ſome ſuch cauſe; and when
it is ſo, we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of them, and look on
them as our ſins. Tho the
corruption of our Nature, and
the malice of the <hi>Devil,</hi>
be many times the cauſe of
them, yet we our ſelves are
often more chargeable with
them, than either of theſe;
and if we narrowly and truly
examine our ſelves, we ſhall
find it ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60705:34"/>
Upon the whole, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
plain, that out of the
heart proceed evil thoughts;
the Soul is the Soil where this
<hi>Hemlock</hi> is ſown. There wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
thoughts are conceived;
they owe their original either
to the corruption of the Soul
it ſelf, or are thrown in by the
inſtigations of the <hi>Devil.</hi> From
thence they proceed; and
therefore it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
that there doth lie an
obligation on us of well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
them. That we are
not altogether unable to do
any thing in order to it, but
ſomething is in our power. We
can chuſe whether we will
cheriſh them or not; we can
either bid them welcome, or
bid them be gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60705:35"/>
And beſides we can uſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
helps and aſſiſtances, and
follow theſe Rules and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which are neceſſary
to the well-governing our
thoughts. And what they are,

from the violence of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and a defence againſt all
kinds of evil thoughts. Prayer,
as it engageth the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and the Protection of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60705:36"/>
Almighty God in all caſes: ſo
it naturally cleanſeth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth
the heart; keeps it in a
due frame, and religious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
The Soul is thereby prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
and diſpoſed to that
which is good, and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
towards God. It gives
a reliſh of Divine and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things, and makes the
Soul more and more averſe
to all evil, vain, or ſilly thoughts
and imaginations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we deſire to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from wicked thoughts, to
keep our hearts in due temper,
and government; we ſhould
be conſtant and earneſt in our
approaches to the Throne of
Grace daily; and fervent in
our Prayers to God for his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60705:36"/>
Grace, to aſſiſt us in conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſtubbornneſs, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity
of our thoughts and

be pleas'd to take poſſeſſion
of our Souls by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and by him to govern,
ſubdue, and ſanctify all the
motions, powers, and faculties
of our Souls. That no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Spirit may inhabit there;
but that they may be <hi>ſwept
and garniſhed</hi> in the beſt ſence,
and ever prepar'd to receive
the viſits of Heaven, and the
benign influences of the holy
Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Be ſure then that you omit
not the obſervance of this firſt
<hi>Rule,</hi> in order to the well-governing
your thoughts; for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60705:37"/>
without this, all the reſt will
ſignify nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, the next Rule is
that you avoid idleneſs: That
hateful vice, which makes the
Soul of a Man like <hi>the field of
the ſluggard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 30, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>all overgrown with
thorns and briars:</hi> full of all
manner of wanton deſires, evil
motions, and impure thoughts.
When a Man is idle and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
a thouſand ill things
come into his mind, which an
honeſt induſtry would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
And the moſt deſirable
opportunity the <hi>Devil</hi> hath for
injecting wicked thoughts, or
temptations ſucceſsfully, is
when a Man hath nothing to
do. It is abſolutely neceſſary
therefore that we avoid being
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60705:37"/>
idle; and ſo practice both
parts of our Bleſſed Saviour's
Advice:<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Watch and pray, that
ye enter not into temptation.</hi>
Idleneſs is the nurſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Sin's procurer; a vice
moſt odious in its ſelf, and
leading into all others. It
lays a Man open to all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults,
and temptations; and
expoſeth him to the dangerous
ſollicitations of a legion of
the Infernal Spirits at once.
Whereas an induſtrious Man
puts Satan to the toil of a long
ſiege, as it were: the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and idle Perſon makes a
preſent, and voluntary ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of himſelf to him. Thus
much is ſignify'd by that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of our Bleſſed Lord's
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60705:38"/>
                  <hi>(Mat. 12. 43.) When the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
ſpirit is gone out of a man,
he walketh through dry places,
ſeeking rest; and finding none,
he ſaith, I will return into my
houſe, from whence I came out:
and when he is come, he findeth
it empty, ſwept and garniſhed.
Then goeth he, and taketh with
himſelf ſeven other ſpirits more
wicked than himſelf, and they
enter in, and dwell there; and
the last ſtate of that man is worſe
than the first.</hi> 'Tis not ſo eaſy
to root up filthy weeds that
have once taken root in any
ground, as it is to prevent their
being ſown. Neither is it
ſo eaſy to eradicate wicked
thoughts, as it is to prevent
them. Upon which account
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60705:38"/>
it is very neceſſary that we
avoid this ſin of Idleneſs,
which is a ſoil barren in every
thing, but the noiſom weeds
of evil thoughts, and unclean
imaginations. 'Twas for want
of better imploymenr that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
heart was polluted with
impure thoughts, and wanton
deſires of <hi>Bathſheba;</hi> which
coſt him ſo much woe, ſuch
ſorrowful cries, and bitter
lamentations; and cauſed that
remarkable tragedy of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi>
which we find <hi>(2 Sam. 12. 9,

but God, and Angels look on
him, as an uſeleſs and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable

if he were <hi>heterogenous</hi> to the

whole Creation; every part
of which (that ought) is active
and in motion: The <hi>Sun,

are all uſeful, and anſwer the

that are immoveable. But the
idle and ſlothful Perſon, doth
not anſwer the end of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

by them. And while
almoſt every Being is buſy,

When I ſee the Picture of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>

forbear to think upon an idle

as they pleaſe. 'Tis certain
that there is no Man ſafe that

to every evil thought, but to

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, That which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters
to evil thoughts as
much as any thing, is bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
As 'tis the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of good Converſation
to prompt Men to Vertue, to
enoble their Minds, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
in them a pious and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
emulation: So 'tis the
great miſchief of bad Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and wicked Society, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and debauch the Mind,
and pollute the Thoughts. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
infallibly teacheth us,
that when we hear any lewd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60705:40"/>
or profane Diſcourſe, or ſee
any baſe or indecent Actions,
we are too apt to repeat the
evil in our Thoughts; and it
is well if it proceed no further.
The holy Apoſtle tells us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>That
evil communications corrupt good
manners:</hi> Vice is ſtrangely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended,
and inſenſibly
inſinuates it ſelf, in wicked
Converſation. And the ſame
Apoſtle exhorts,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Let no corrupt
communication proceed out of
your mouth, but that which is
good to the uſe of edifying, that
it may miniſter Grace unto the
hearers.</hi> Religious Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
good Diſcourſe, greatly
enlivens the Soul, raiſes the
Thoughts, and animates a Man
againſt the force, and influence
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60705:41"/>
of bad Examples. But ill
Company is a dangerous and
bewitching thing, and ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leſſens our Idea's of <hi>God,</hi>
and Notions of Vertue; and
tends to pollute and harden
the Heart. Who can uſe to be
in ſuch company, where the
holy Name of <hi>God</hi> is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
his Being queſtioned, and
diſputed againſt: His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
his Word, his Law, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
and abuſed? Who
can accuſtom himſelf to the
ſociety of theſe Men, whoſe
ungovern'd Tongues talk of
nothing but lewdneſs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenity;
whoſe words, actions,
and whole behaviour is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
and immoral; or vain,
frothy, and fooliſh; without
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60705:41"/>
being tainted therewith, and
retaining the ungrateful ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their ungodly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?
Humane Nature is
too corrupt, and prone to ill
to come off unhurt. Nothing
indeed ſo much conduceth to
make the thoughts looſe and
wicked, as bad Company,
which muſt therefore be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
avoided, if we would
preſerve our Minds pure, and
govern our Thoughts aright.
Always therefore endeavour to
keep ſuch Company, as you
may riſe <hi>by,</hi> and not fall <hi>with.</hi>
Such as may advance you in
Holineſs, enrich your Soul
with Vertue; and not ſuch as
will debauch your Thoughts,
and inſtill naughty cogitations
into your Minds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60705:42"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, As we muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
vicious Converſation, ſo
we muſt avoid the reading any
lewd or wicked Books; which
treat of any vile and baſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or are any way apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill
evil Thoughts, or Notions
into us. There is hardly any
thing more tends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
the Mind, than the
Reading wicked Books; which
is a ſort of converſing, and as
bad (or worſe) as the former.
If our Inclination, or buſineſs
lie principally that way; there
are abundant gratifications of
that kind, beſides Plays and
Romances, which are leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and more improving.
And theſe that underſtand the
Rules of <hi>Education,</hi> will tell
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60705:42"/>
you, that few Perſons are com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petent
readers of them, or
ought to be allowed the liberty
of meddling with them. The
Advocates of the Theatre
plead, that abundance of good
Morality, and Vertuous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
may be got by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or reading a Play, or a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
But our own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
doth evidently confute
that Plea; and demonſtrate,
That the Minds of many have
been debauched by them; and
no doubt many Souls ruined;
but few or none the better for
them, in any particular. They
are moſt contrary to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
Profeſſion, and the main
ſcope and deſign of them, is
viſibly ſuch, as moſt tends to

Vice to the utmoſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
and improving all kinds
of evil Thoughts, as much as
any thing that can be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>No Man can be at a loſs
in this Learned Age, for ſelect
<hi>Entertainments</hi> of his mind in
reading. The nauſeous ſtrains
of a lewd, or <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Poet,
are not forc'd upon us by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
or a ſcarcity of Wit: But
upon inquiry, I believe it will

that the moſt lovely, and

we ſhould more and
more be ſenſible, that there is
no Book like this: and that
an excellent Expedient to keep
wicked Thoughts out of our

Scriptures much, and often,
with meekneſs, Prayer, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
inſtead of theſe vain,

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60705:45"/>
Writings of ſuch as call
themſelves the <hi>Wits</hi> of the Age.</p>
               <p>The Mind of Man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible;
the Thoughts of his
Heart are meer tinder to the
ſparks of an obſcene Saying, a
lewd fancy, or but ſo much as
an impure hint. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am apt to think that few
Men in the World (how ſtrong
ſoever their prejudices may be,
or how much ſoever they may
preſume upon their own
ſtrength) are able to govern their
Thoughts well, without they
have a ſpecial regard to this
Rule, and Admonition alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Another Rule, which is
proper for the well-governing
of our Thoughts in general,
is, Frequent <hi>Self-examination.</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60705:45"/>
Without often looking into
our ſelves, and examining our
own propenſions, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and what is that <hi>Sin
which doth ſo eaſily beſet us;</hi> it
is hardly to be imagined how
we ſhould be able to govern
our Thoughts aright. There
is nothing which a man is
more a ſtranger to, than <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
tho' there is nothing in
which he ought to be more
skill'd: and that is one great
reaſon of the irregularity of his
Thoughts. For without we
well conſult our own temper
and conſtitution, and what
the <hi>laedentia</hi> and <hi>juvantia</hi> are;
and narrowly obſerve the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of our Paſſions, and
the frame and diſpoſition of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60705:46"/>
our Souls, we cannot conquer
our Thoughts. 'Tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
unleſs we <hi>know</hi> our ſelves,
that we ſhould <hi>govern</hi> our
ſelves. Sometimes a man's
evil Thoughts may run chiefly
upon luſt, and uncleanneſs;
and ſometimes covetouſneſs
may be his darling ſin. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ambition may be his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
and at other other times
revenge his favourite. Now
how can it be imagined that
a perſon can govern, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
his Thoughts, as to any
of theſe, without a frequent
inquiring into his own Soul,
and accurate knowledge of
himſelf? Nay, which way
can a man be convinc'd, and
perſwaded of the great evil and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60705:46"/>
ſinfulneſs of wicked Thoughts,
without <hi>Self-examination?</hi>
How can he be made truly
ſenſible of their pernicious and
polluting nature, and that they
are ſo highly diſpleaſing to
<hi>God,</hi> as they are, without a
diligent ſearch into himſelf?
or how can he be poſſeſſed that
it is his duty to reſtrain, and
exerciſe a government over his
Thoughts; and that much is in
his own power, in order to it?
I ſay, how can a perſon be
rightly ſenſible of any of theſe
<hi>neceſſary</hi> things, without he
frequenly, and skilfully pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
this duty of <hi>Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi>
which as it is of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
uſe, in order to Religion
in general, ſo it is to this part
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60705:47"/>
of it, eſpecially <hi>(viz.)</hi> the well-governing
our Thoughts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</p>
               <p>How many men are too
apt to imagine, that as for
Thoughts, they ſhall never be
laid to our charge, ſo long as
they don't break out into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
That the <hi>Theory</hi> of ſin
ſhall paſs, without the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Almighty Judge;
and that only the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of
it ſhall be obſerv'd, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd.
That as for Thoughts,
they are either in the Nature
of theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Impoſſibilities,
which cannot be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any good Order, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in regard of their
infiniteneſs, and variety; and
ſo they claim a privilege of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60705:47"/>
invincible <hi>Liberty,</hi> becauſe they
can't be ſubdu'd: or elſe that
they are ſuch ſlight and ſmall
eſcapes, as that they carry
their paſport, and pardon with
them; that they ſhall never
be puniſh'd, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are no ſins. And that
alſo becauſe the Law of man
takes no hold of them; and
becauſe <hi>likewiſe</hi> it is impoſſible
altogether to avoid theſe
thoughts, as was ſaid before.
Certainly (ſay they) we ſhall
never be call'd to account for
our thoughts, becauſe they
come oftentimes ſo ſuddenly,
and unexpectedly, that no
reaſon can be given of them:
And they do no body any hurt;
what evil therefore ſhould
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60705:48"/>
there be in them? why ſhould
we be accountable for them?
This is indeed the common
ſtrain of the civil, honeſt, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Man; (as he calls himſelf)
and the formal Hypocrite, to
draw <hi>near unto God with his
lips, when his heart is far from
him;</hi> to be under no concern
for his Thoughts, but only to
take care with the <hi>Harlot,</hi> to
wipe his mouth clean: And
with <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> to waſh
his hands; and with the Scribes
and Phariſees to cleanſe only
<hi>the outſide of the cup, or the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
This is all the Religion
of too many, who make it to
conſiſt in <hi>Sence,</hi> and not in the
<hi>Heart,</hi> as if the deſign of it were
to be not the <hi>Reformation</hi> of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60705:48"/>
the inward, but an <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment</hi>
of the outward Man.
As if indeed <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were
no more than a meer <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And now what is the
true cauſe of this? what is the
reaſon of ſuch dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and miſtakes about our
Thoughts; as that they are
free, ſinleſs, and unpuniſhable?
I ſay, what is the cauſe of all
this, but ignorance of our own
ſelves; ignorance of the ſad
and prevailing <hi>Corruptions</hi> of
our Nature, and their greedy
propenſities, and inclinations
to evil? and ignorance of the
Law of <hi>God</hi> too; which if we
would look into, it would
plainly ſhew us the deteſtable
ſinfulneſs of Thoughts: and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60705:49"/>
that the main end of <hi>Religion</hi>
is an internal change, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification
of the Heart and Soul;
of all the Thoughts and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
And now an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
means to diſpel this Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
is this Rule which I am
preſſing you to the obſervance
of <hi>(viz.) Self-examination.</hi>
Without which it will be an
impoſſible thing to attain
a right government of our
Thoughts in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> This Rules muſt alſo be
followed with another, if we
would govern our Thoughts
aright. And that is that you
make a covenant with your
Eyes, and other Sences; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them from carnal or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
objects; or not letting
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60705:49"/>
them dwell upon them. This
will be a very proper means
in order to that great end,
which is the ſcope of this
Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>There is no preſerving a
Caſtle or Fortreſs from being
taken by the enemy, but by
having a ſpecial care of the
Avenues, and Breaches. Now
the Sences are, as it were, the
<hi>Avenues</hi> of the Soul, the Inlets
of all evil into the Mind: and
therefore there is a neceſſity
that we keep a ſtrict watch
over our Sences, if we would
have our Thoughts pure and
unpolluted. For there is not
a Sence that we have, but may
betray and ruin us. An Eye,
an Hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may prove our
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60705:50"/>
utter deſtruction. As that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of our Bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 8.</note>
                  <hi>Wherefore if thy hand or
thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
and cast them from thee:
It is better for thee to enter into
Life, halt and maimed, rather
than having two hands, or two
feet, to be cast into everlaſting
fire. And if thine eye offend
thee, pluck it out, and cast it
from thee; it is better for thee
to enter into Life with one Eye,
rather than having two Eyes to be
cast into hell fire.</hi> Our own Eyes
may ruin us, as ſure as theſe of
a <hi>Baſilisk;</hi> and 'tis <hi>Our own
Eye,</hi> which puts witchcraft
into that of others, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
back certain hurt, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
into our Thoughts and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60705:50"/>
Souls. There are a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of enſnaring objects in
the World, that preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to us. The <hi>World,</hi> the
<hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> conſpire
how to entrap us. Which way
ſoever we turn, we find ſome
object or other to entice us.
As the <hi>Hermite</hi> ſaw in his
Viſion, the whole World is
hung all over with Nets. The
<hi>Devil</hi> well knows that the beſt
way to ſubdue the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is by
the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> and that there is no
ſuch effectual way of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Soul, as by firſt making
his attacks upon the outworks,
the <hi>Sences.</hi> And therefore he firſt
endeavours to take <hi>them.</hi> 'Tis
of abſolute neceſſity therefore
that we keep a cloſe guard
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60705:51"/>
upon every one of our <hi>ſences,</hi>
if we would not be invaded
by wicked thoughts. For any
one of them left unguarded,
may prove our ruine. And
we muſt acknowledge that 'tis
giving too great a liberty to
our <hi>ſences,</hi> which is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſo many vile and wicked
Thoughts filling our Minds.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Again: In the next place, we
are to take care, that if any
evil Thoughts (of what kind
ſoever they be) ariſe up in our
Hearts, not to let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in us; but preſently to
make reſiſtance againſt them;
turning the Heart immediately
to a contrary ſubject; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
our Souls by ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for the ſame. Let
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60705:51"/>
not <hi>vain thoughts lodge in us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 14.</note>
tho' they may <hi>glance</hi> upon us.
'Tis dwelling upon a wicked
Thought, that makes it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing,
and domineering over
us. If we habitually indulge
it, it will get ground of us; and
at length grow obſtinate, and
unruly; and much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be conquered. Whereas
an immediate reſiſtance of it,
would by degrees ſo weaken
it, as 'tis probable we ſhould
at length be quite rid of it.
Tho' this may be thought a
very <hi>troubleſom,</hi> yet it is as <hi>likely</hi>
a way as any, of avoiding
evil thoughts. When any
wicked imagination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
preſents it ſelf, the beſt
way to repel it, would not be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60705:52"/>
to argue, and diſpute long
with it; but to catch away our
Minds from it preſently: and
like a Man that accidentally
treads upon an <hi>Adder,</hi> ſtarts
back immediately, and ſtrives
to make no more approaches
to it again. It is poſſible, nay
likely, that it will return upon
you often in a little time; but do
you labour as often as it doth
ſo, to thruſt it out, and be not
weary of ſo doing. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this is not ſo eaſy a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
neither, (tho this or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
muſt be granted to be in
our power) it would be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
in order to the divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Minds effectually, that
we propoſe to our Minds ſome
one or other of the moſt awful
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60705:52"/>
ſubjects; and ſuch as is apt
more than ordinarily to take
up, and fix our Thoughts.
As for Inſtance: The <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion</hi>

exultation of that dreadful day:
<hi>Wherein the heavens being on

                  <hi>the powers of heaven be

their orbs:</hi> all this viſible World
be conſum'd and ingulph'd, in
an inconceivable eternity of
<hi>happineſs</hi> to the righteous, but
of <hi>torment</hi> to the wicked. Any
one of ſuch ſubjects as theſe
would be very proper to fix
our Minds upon, in order to
keep them from returning to
ill things. There is nothing
can more <hi>awe</hi> the Soul, <hi>collect</hi>
the Thoughts, and <hi>compoſe</hi> the
Spirits, than thinking on ſuch
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60705:53"/>
ſubjects. They are things ſo
very <hi>conſiderable,</hi> that while we
are imploying our Minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, it is an hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to think of any thing elſe,
or ſoon to be drawn aſide, to
any other object. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is very adviſable, that
we make uſe of this expedient,
in order to the well-governing
our Thoughts. To which
end alſo,</p>
               <p>Let us be careful to watch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
over our Thoughts on the
<hi>Lords-day;</hi> then more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
than at other times.
The <hi>Lords-day</hi> is (I know not
by what means) extremely
ſlighted, and diſregarded. And
under a pretence of <hi>Chriſtian
Liberty,</hi> profaneneſs hath very
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60705:54"/>
greatly advanced it ſelf. So
that <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>own Day,</hi> is become
almoſt as one of ours, and
but a very ſmall difference ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
betwixt them. Men are
generally ſo far from being
moſt careful of their thoughts
on that Holy-day, that they
ſuffer them to be moſt <hi>profuſe</hi>
and <hi>extravagant</hi> then; and
not only their <hi>Thoughts,</hi> but
their <hi>Actions</hi> too are for a great
part <hi>worſe</hi> than at other times.
Which, as it is a very great ſin
in it ſelf, and ſuch as ſhall be
ſeverely accounted for; ſo it
is a great means of making
our Thoughts looſe, ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and wicked at other
times. For <hi>that,</hi> as it is a day
peculiarly to be dedicated to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60705:54"/>
                  <hi>God,</hi> ſo it is a day wherein <hi>God</hi>
deſigns in a more eminent
manner to <hi>communicate himſelf,</hi>
and his <hi>Grace</hi> to our Souls.
And therefore if we do ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it as we ought, by having a
ſtrict watch over our thoughts,
and by the <hi>delightful</hi> exerciſes
of Prayer, Praiſes, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
and a devout Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Hearing the Word of
<hi>God, &amp;c.</hi> It will (by <hi>God</hi>'s
Bleſſing) leave ſuch an happy
tincture on us, and ſo piouſly,
and laſtingly incline the Mind
to good, that it will be an
excellent means to order our
thoughts the better, when we
have more liberty for the
World. How inconſiderable
ſoever this Rule may ſeem to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60705:55"/>
any; yet I doubt not but a
great part of the vanity, and
evil of our Thoughts and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
is owing to a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
and remiſs obſervation of
the <hi>Lords-day.</hi> Neither can
I think, that that glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
(any more than the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
is ſtinted to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
oeconomy alone, tho' it may
primarily concern that <hi>(Iſa. 58.
13, 14.) If thou turn away thy
foot from the ſabbath, from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy pleaſure on my holy day,
and call the ſabbath a delight, the
holy of the Lord honourable, and
ſhalt honour him, not doing thine
owne ways, nor finding thine own
pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine
own words: Then ſhalt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

I will cauſe thee to ride upon
the high places of the earth, and

of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being watchful over our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
ſelves when we are <hi>alone,</hi> is
another Rule, which we are
to obſerve in order to the well
governing of our Thoughts in
general. <hi>Solitude</hi> is a ſeaſon
when our Thoughts are very
apt to rove, and then to light
upon ill objects. When a
Man is by himſelf, he is not
ſecure from his ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and with reſpect to the
multitude of vain, and evil
Thoughts, that Then are apt
to come into his Mind, it may
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60705:56"/>
be truly ſaid of him, <hi>Nunquam
minus ſolus quam cum ſolus.</hi>
Upon which account it was
that the <hi>Devil</hi> choſe <hi>that</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note>
to tempt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
when he was in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
alone. Becauſe he
well knew that at ſuch a time
as that, the Mind of Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>leiſure,</hi> his Thoughts
will be more <hi>relaxed</hi> and <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,</hi>
and ſo more eaſy to be
won by his ſuggeſtions; and
to comply with his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
A <hi>Monaſtick</hi> Life doth
not ſecure a Man from evil
Thoughts; but in ſome ſort
makes him the more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to them. The <hi>Devil</hi>
will pay his unwelcome viſits
to us in our <hi>Privacy,</hi> as well
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60705:56"/>
as in <hi>Converſation.</hi> And the
<hi>Hermite</hi> in his Cell, hath as
much reaſon to look well to
his thoughts, as he that is in
the Croud of this World. And
Therefore I take it to be very
adviſable, that at any time,
when we are <hi>alone,</hi> we ſuffer
not our thoughts to ſcatter and
flie at random: for unhappy
conjunctions oftentimes prove
the conſequence of ſuch erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
motions; but to confine
them to ſome <hi>certain</hi> bounds,
and <hi>determinate</hi> ſubjects. Such
as the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of
Almighty God, or the like;
which will ſweetly imploy
our thoughts, and refreſh our
minds. And the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
to think on any ſuch
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60705:57"/>
ſubject, we may when we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
likewiſe think on our own
<hi>ſinfulneſs;</hi> be <hi>judging</hi> our ſelves,
<hi>confeſſing</hi> our ſins, and laying
open our hearts before God,
which will make the goodneſs
of God more <hi>illuſtrious,</hi> and
<hi>admirable;</hi> and alſo keep us
from being aſſaulted with
any dreadful, and terrifying
thoughts, with any filthy and
profligate thoughts; and our
hearts from being deadn'd and
ſtupify'd with <hi>Mopiſhneſs,</hi> and
<hi>drowſineſs, &amp;c.</hi> which at ſuch
a time we are more eſpecially
prone to.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Again: In the next place,
let us be very careful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the good motions of
God's <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to obey
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60705:57"/>
his Heavenly Inſpirations; to
bowe to his ſacred ſuggeſtions,
when at any time we are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
therewith. Every good
thought ſhould be <hi>made well-come,</hi>
and <hi>cheriſh'd,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd</hi>
by us; and by that
means we ſhall not only avoid
evil thoughts; but in time
arrive at an happy temper and
habit of <hi>good thoughts,</hi> which
is one of the moſt deſirable
things in the world; and moſt
of all prepares the Soul for the
purity, and raviſhment of the
Contemplation, of God, and
the Joys of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Let us
therefore always <hi>improve</hi> every
good thought or motion that
comes into our Minds; and
entertain it as an <hi>Embaſſy</hi> from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60705:58"/>
God, as a ſpark of the <hi>Celeſtial
fire.</hi> And let us diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
and liſten to the counſels
and monitions of our own
Conſciences; by no means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
their checks, or ſtifle their
Advertiſments. To draw to
a Concluſion of this Chapter;
If we would attain to this
great Thing, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the due
government of our Thoughts,
let us be careful to preſerve
our ſelves <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;</hi>
to do no hurt, or evil at
any time, <hi>willingly.</hi> Let us
make <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Fear
of God our <hi>Buſineſs.</hi> Let us
make uſe of God's wonderful
Works, both of <hi>Mercy</hi> and
<hi>Judgment,</hi> which at any time
occur in the World, ſeaſoning
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60705:58"/>
our Hearts with an Holy <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi>
of them.</p>
               <p>There are a great many
more excellent <hi>Rules,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the <hi>Well-governing</hi> our
Thoughts: As applying our
ſelves to our proper <hi>Teachers,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual Guides,</hi> for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and Aſſiſtance, when our
Hearts are oppreſſed with
wicked Thoughts, or prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
corruptions.</p>
               <p>Avoiding unwarrantable <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities,</hi>
and prying into hidden
<hi>Myſteries,</hi> and unneceſſary
Speculations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contentment, Temperance,
Humility; Trust</hi> and <hi>Affiance</hi>
in God: and abundance more,
which are in that large field of
Diſcourſe, which ſuch a ſubject
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60705:59"/>
as this affords: and which if I
ſhould enlarge upon, as I have
done on the former Heads,
would ſwell this Treatiſe into
a much bigger Book than I
deſign'd it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore content my
ſelf and the <hi>Reader</hi> with theſe
<hi>Principal Rules</hi> and Directions,
for the well-governing of the
Thoughts in <hi>general,</hi> which
have been treated of in the
fore-going Pages. Which well
put in practice, will, I doubt
not (by the bleſſing of Almighty
God) prove in a great meaſure
effectual to the end deſign'd.
And that, if we (not ſlightly
and indifferently but) cloſely,
and in earneſt apply our ſelves
to them, we ſhall thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60705:59"/>
Evil Thoughts; and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that happy and deſirable
Government over our ſelves,
which either ſloth, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
makes ſome Men think
to be <hi>Eutopian</hi> and impoſſible:
Only adding this <hi>one</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
more, which muſt by no
means be paſs'd over, and that
is,</p>
               <p>The deep and ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/>
of the laſt <hi>Dreadful
Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider ſeriouſly with your
ſelves then, That there is a day
a coming, when not only all
the Actions, and more known
paſſages of our Lives; but even
our moſt <hi>Private</hi> and <hi>Retired</hi>
Thoughts ſhall be accounted
for. When God ſhall judge
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60705:60"/>
the <hi>Secrets</hi> of Men by <hi>Christ
Jeſus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note> Tho' Men cannot ſee
our Thoughts; yet an All-knowing
God can, and doth;
and will aſſuredly judge us for
them. In that day, when theſe
that have labour'd to approve
themſelves unto God, by an
<hi>Internal</hi> purity, and ſincere
Obedience; not regarding the
eye of the World, or the ſilly
applauſes of mortal Men; but
the favour of God, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
of their duty; ſhall be
crown'd with eternal honours;
and all their <hi>ſecret</hi> Piety be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<hi>openly:</hi> And theſe that
have hypocritically carried a
fair outſide, and paſs'd for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
honeſt, moral Men, whilſt
<hi>their inward parts were very
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60705:60"/>
wickedneſs,</hi> and their Hearts full
of all uncleanneſs ſhall be laid
open, and expos'd to the ſhame
of all the World, and they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
from the preſence of
God, into the flames of Hell
for ever.</p>
               <p>Man indeed judgeth of the
Heart by the Works; but God
judgeth of the Works by the
Heart. Since therefore we
muſt be call'd to an account
for our Thoughts hereafter,
let us carefully remember it:
and ſo reckon with our ſelves
for them in this, that we may
not be judg'd for them in the
World to come.</p>

in ſuggeſting ill things to us,
and caſting into our minds
wicked thoughts. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
purſuing us into all
places and companys, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting

and ſo can ſuit his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,

His name is Legion too:</hi>
For there are a multitude of
them to carry on their <hi>helliſh</hi>
deſigns, in ruining Souls, and
corrupting Minds. Like the

fill the <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi> Their
numbers are like theſe of the

<hi>Frogs,</hi> croaking even in Kings
Chambers. And could we but
ſee theſe <hi>Swarms</hi> of <hi>Devils</hi> that
aſſault us, and are darting their

injecting evil Thoughts
into our Hearts; we ſhould be

and yet, alas! we are as ſecure
as if we were embrac'd, and

as if we had no Enemy at all

Hiſtorical accounts of Perſons
that have been ſuch exquiſite

that they could convey the

and kill in a moment; or elſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60705:62"/>

ſuch might be produc'd, were it
not foreign to the preſent deſign.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Devil</hi> is an Artiſt
more ſubtil even than theſe;
he can convey a Spiritual Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
and Contagion to the
Soul, and poyſon all the
Thoughts and Powers of it.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60705:63"/>
His injections are as quick, and
as keen as Lightning. And he
hath <hi>undiſcernable</hi> ways of
defiling and corrupting our
Minds. That <hi>Satan</hi> can throw
wicked Thoughts into our
Minds, is (I ſuppoſe) a matter
not queſtioned: But whether
he doth this by working on
the humours of the Body, or
ſtirring up the animal Spirits;
or by an <hi>immediate</hi> applying
his Suggeſtions to the Soul, is
not ſo eaſy to be determin'd.
There being a neceſſary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
of the Operations of
the Soul, upon the Texture
of the Body and Spirits; it
is not improbable that he
frequently injects wicked
Thoughts <hi>that</hi> way. But why
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60705:63"/>
may he not alſo caſt in wicked
Thoughts into our Hearts, by
an <hi>immediate</hi> communication?
The <hi>truth</hi> is, we cannot well
find out which Method he
takes in his Temptations. We
are not able to tell how h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſts
in wicked Thoughts. We
know little or nothing of the
intercourſe between Beings
purely <hi>Spiritual:</hi> But too plain
and true it is, that we are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
with a multitude of evil
Thoughts, and that they do

therefore it will be a more <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi>
enquiry how we ſhall be

them. And this cannot be
fully done neither in a Treatiſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60705:64"/>
of this nature; becauſe their
kinds are infinite, and their
numbers endleſs. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
according to my propos'd
Method.</p>
               <p>Conſider in this Chapter,
ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> kinds of evil
Thoughts, and endeavour to
apply remedies againſt them,
to the ſatisfaction and benefit
(I hope) of the ſerious <hi>Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, Then the <hi>first</hi> kind of
them which I ſhall conſider
is, <hi>Profane</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous</hi>
Thoughts. And of this ſort
there is a diſmal variety. I
have known ſome (and theſe
I'm perſwaded very religious)
People, who have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
diſturb'd with ſuch
Thoughts concerning <hi>GOD,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:60705:64"/>
as have been moſt unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and as abſurd, as they are
profane.</p>
               <p>If I thought fit, I could
mention ſome of them, which
have been ſo <hi>extravagant,</hi> that
I ſhould think to be rid of
them, it were better to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn</hi>
and <hi>deſpiſe</hi> them, than
anxiouſly to be concern'd about
them. Tho' with others of
them, we ought to deal after
a different manner. To think
<hi>aright</hi> of Almighty God, and
to have ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> of him in
our Minds as are <hi>worthy,</hi> and
<hi>becoming</hi> ſo great and ſo pure
a Majeſty; is not only a very
conſiderable part of <hi>Religion,</hi>
but a very <hi>comfortable</hi> thing.
And I cannot but pity ſuch
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60705:65"/>
                  <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as are much afflicted
with profane thoughts. Of this
kind of Evil thoughts there
are ſome more <hi>hideous</hi> than
others; but yet every thought
of him, which is contrary or
unſuitable to that repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which by ſuch and ſuch
glorious Attributes he hath
made to us of Himſelf in his
holy Word, <hi>that</hi> I call a <hi>profane
Thought:</hi> or when we conceive
of Almighty God under ſome
groſs form, or material ſhape;
or entertain any vile, mean,
or indeed any but the <hi>Highest</hi>
conceptions, that we are able
of him. <hi>God</hi> is in himſelf an
Infinite, Almighty, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
Spirit. And
tho' he hath ſometimes in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60705:65"/>
Scriptures deſcrib'd, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
himſelf to us by material
figures, or ſenſible objects; yet
we are not to think that he is
really ſuch as he is deſcrib'd,
but that he condeſcends to our
capacity by ſuch a Style and
Language. And any other
Method of inſtructing us in the
nature of himſelf, would not be
ſo <hi>Intelligible</hi> to us. God uſeth
this, as an eaſy and familiar
way of teaching us to know
him: without which our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of him would be very
obſcure, and we could know
but little of him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I cannot but wonder at
the imprudence and <hi>Luciferian</hi>
pride of ſuch Men, who deny
all Myſteries, and pretend to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60705:66"/>
know <hi>GOD</hi> ſo, as <hi>perfectly</hi>
to comprehend him, by the
dim light of Natural Reaſon,
alone.</p>
               <p>Thus is <hi>GOD</hi> repreſented
to us ſometimes as having
Hands, Feet, Eyes, and ſuch
like organical parts. Not that
he hath truly ſuch; (as the old
Hereticks, the <hi>Anthropomorphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
held, and the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now
depict him) but we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them in a figurative ſence.
His <hi>Hands</hi> and his <hi>Feet,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token
his <hi>Power;</hi> his <hi>Eyes</hi> his
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Favour, &amp;c.</hi>
And therefore to think of him
under any material figure, is a
profane thought, and muſt by
no means be encourag'd. So
alſo to think that <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>Liar,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60705:66"/>
or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmerciful,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>unjust, &amp;c.</hi>
is a blaſphemous thought.
And indeed, (as I ſaid) every
thought that is formed in our
Minds, which is unſuitable to
his Eternity, Authority, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Holineſs, or any
other of his glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
is reducible to this firſt
kind of evil thoughts. Now
tho' theſe are very <hi>dreadful</hi>
thoughts; yet they may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
come into our Minds
thro' the <hi>Devil</hi>'s ſubtilty, and
our own <hi>careleſsneſs.</hi> Nay, 'tis
poſſible that they may infeſt
the Minds of <hi>good</hi> Men, and
that too, when they are about
the <hi>Highest</hi> Imployments;
which may for the preſent ſerve
to ſatisfy theſe poor Souls, who
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60705:67"/>
are at any time terrify'd, and
affrighted with a Sence of
them, and take off from that
<hi>horrour</hi> that they are apt to
conceive in their Minds upon
the account of them.</p>
               <p>Now the Directions which
I would recommend in order
to our avoiding any profane
and blaſpemous thoughts, are
theſe following.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, That we be ſure to
avoid an <hi>habit of any known ſin,</hi>
than which there is nothing
more miniſters to profane and
blaſphemous thoughts. For
an habit of any known ſin,
will ſtrangely degrade our
thoughts, and leſſen our <hi>Ideas</hi>
of GOD. It being an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
thing for any Man to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60705:67"/>
arrive at an habit of wilful and
deliberate ſinning, without fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
grapplings with his own
Conſcience, and iterated reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of its checks, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions;
without thinking
falſly or meanly of GOD; or
elſe putting him quite out of
his thoughts, <hi>And his judgments
far above out of his ſight:</hi> No
wonder that by continuing ſo
to do, he comes at laſt to have
<hi>profane</hi> or <hi>blaſphemous</hi> thoughts
of him.</p>
               <p>GOD is an infinite and
eternal Spirit, and the moſt <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute</hi>
Being, and <hi>tranſcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
above the <hi>highest</hi> of our
thoughts. And if ever we
would think rightly and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
of him, we muſt habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60705:68"/>
our ſelves to think much
upon him, and let our thoughts
of him be according to theſe
repreſentations and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which he hath been pleas'd
to make of himſelf in the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi>
Our Natural Reaſon,
tho' it will yield us ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of a God, yet it is not
a <hi>ſufficient</hi> guide to direct our
thoughts concerning him; for
it will many times lead us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
falſe notions of him; as
appears beyond all diſpute
from the Worſhip of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
World, and alſo the <hi>Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox</hi>
opinions of theſe who
rely thereon. And how is it
poſſible for any habitual ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who muſt, and doth, thruſt
God out of his thoughts on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60705:68"/>
purpoſe, that he may ſin with
the greater liberty and delight,
ever do this? He cannot grow
to an <hi>Habitual</hi> Sinner, without
he quite baniſheth the thoughts
of a God from his Heart; and
that ſuch an one ſhould be
able to think of him after a
due manner, what is it leſs than
a contradiction? And then
no wonder if by ſo frequently
ſlighting God in his own mind,
he comes at length to think
<hi>prophanely</hi> and <hi>blaſphemouſly</hi> of
him. Irreverent Thoughts of
God grow ſtill more and more
wicked; and a continual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect
of him, ends at length
in <hi>Atheiſm</hi> it ſelf. He then that
is haunted, and peſtered with
ſuch Thoughts as theſe, we
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60705:69"/>
are ſpeaking of, may perhaps
upon a deep enquiry, find
cauſe to condemn himſelf, of
ſome <hi>Habit of ſin;</hi> and if ſo,
he muſt labour to mortify it,
and become a New Man, if
ever he would avoid this kind
of evil Thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Too curious and
bold Speculations,</hi> into matters
Myſterious, prove frequently
an occaſion of profane and
blaſphemous Thoughts; and
therefore they muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
declin'd. He that hath
an honeſt and conſcientious
regard to his Duty, as it is
plainly ſet down, and humbly
deſires to know, and ſerve
God above all, is ſeldom ſo
much troubled with this kind
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60705:69"/>
of Thoughts, as thoſe are, who
aſpire to things vaſtly above
them; and place more of their
Duty in <hi>Speculation,</hi> than in
<hi>Practiſe.</hi> When Men will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the plain way, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into unbeaten Paths; no
wonder that they fall into miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
When Men will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of endeavouring to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<hi>GOD</hi>'s Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and do his Will, aſpire
to comprehend his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> his
<hi>Decrees, &amp;c.</hi> and find out the
Almighty to perfection. When
they will not be contented to
know the <hi>Saving Truths</hi> of the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> and practice their plain
and legible Duty; but nicely
pry into the <hi>Secret things, which
belong neither to us, nor our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60705:70"/>
When they will graſp
at all, and think to underſtand
<hi>all Myſteries, and all Knowledge,</hi>
and <hi>remove Mountains.</hi> Then
they <hi>naturally,</hi> as well as <hi>juſtly,</hi>
fall into profane imaginations,
and blaſphemous Thoughts;
and ſometimes into <hi>Errours,</hi>
and <hi>damnable Hereſies.</hi> This
is the true caſe of the preſent
Age; and the main occaſion
of theſe blaſphemous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
concerning the Bleſſed
<hi>Trinity,</hi> which are now ſo da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
broach'd amongſt us:
and indeed 'tis that to which
moſt of Men's <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous</hi>
Thoughts of God are
owing. And ſince it is ſo,
truly if they would avoid them,
they muſt learn to be more
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60705:70"/>
modeſt and humble, and to
have a more conſcientious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to their duty.</p>
               <p>They muſt content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with theſe plain Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
which God hath made
of his Mind and Will; and
labour to follow them: and
adore his <hi>unſearchable</hi> Wiſdom
in the reſt. An humble <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
will much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the eternal Salvation of
our Souls, than ſuch bold <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations:</hi>
and the <hi>Love</hi> of God
is far better than all ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and fruitleſs Attempts to
<hi>comprehend</hi> him. For all ſuch
<hi>Attempts</hi> will in the end <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,</hi>
but never <hi>advantage</hi> the
Minds of Men. Theſe <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyers,</hi>
when they are in their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60705:71"/>
                  <hi>altitudes,</hi> ſuddenly their waxen
wings melt, and down they
fall headlong, like <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
from Heaven. When we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently</hi>
ſubmit our Reaſon to
Divine Revelation, and the
conduct and guidance of the
Word of God; when we make
that (with the <hi>Pſalmist) A lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
unto our feet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 105.</note> 
                  <hi>and a light
unto our paths:</hi> then we are
ſafe, as well as free from theſe
<hi>horrid</hi> Thoughts we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of; at leaſt they are not
occaſion'd by our ſelves, if
they ſhould chance to come
into our Minds. But (I ſay)
when <hi>Reaſon</hi> will be its own
Guide, and Men will <hi>walk in
the light of their own fire, and
the ſparks which themſelves have
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60705:71"/>

they muſt needs ſtumble, as in
the dark. Or like a Ship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ballaſt, be toſs'd up and
down, and made the ſport of
<hi>every wind of Doctrine.</hi> They
will hereby be lyable to the
<hi>worst</hi> Cogitations concerning
the infinite Being.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A <hi>Cuſtomary, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
and <hi>Indevout</hi> Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of <hi>GOD,</hi> is that which
at length uſually grows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>profane</hi> and <hi>blaſphemous</hi>
Thoughts of him: Which
therefore muſt diligently be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
if we deſire to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuch Thoughts. For if
in our moſt <hi>Solemn</hi> Addreſs to
Almighty God, we be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that our thoughts of him be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60705:72"/>
                  <hi>reverent</hi> and <hi>compos'd;</hi> our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<hi>high</hi> and <hi>holy:</hi> it is eaſy
to imagine, that at other times
we ſhall be apt to have mean
and low, or <hi>profane</hi> Thoughts
of him. And why may we
not think that this is a too
common occaſion of <hi>profane</hi>
and <hi>blaſphemous</hi> Thoughts?
If I am not ſollicitous to form
my heart aright, and bring my
Thoughts of the Great <hi>GOD</hi>
into a due frame and temper
of Devotion, while I am <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping</hi>
him, and in his more
<hi>ſolemn</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> preſence:
It naturally <hi>leads</hi> me (as well
provokes <hi>GOD</hi> to <hi>leave</hi> me)
to <hi>groſs, profane</hi> and <hi>impious</hi>
Thought of him. When a
Man therefore is about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60705:72"/>
his Duty of Devotion to
<hi>God,</hi> either in publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
let him endeavour to fix
in his Heart ſuch Thoughts of
him, as may exceedingly awe
and compoſe him, and not be
<hi>indevout</hi> and <hi>formal</hi> in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to Heaven: and I verily
think this may be a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
means to preſerve him
from profane or blaſphemous
Thoughts; which, otherwiſe,
'tis reaſonable to expect will
grow upon him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
worldly <hi>anxiety,</hi> is that which
(how far ſoever it may at firſt
ſeem from it) very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
to <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
Thoughts of <hi>God.</hi> And
there is a great deal in that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60705:73"/>
expreſſion of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>If
any man love the world, the love of
the Father is not in him.</hi> There
are no perſons more apt to <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi>
the Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>God,</hi> in the diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his <hi>Providence,</hi> than ſuch;
to conceive not only <hi>indecent,
angry,</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> but <hi>profane</hi>
and <hi>blaſphemous</hi> Notions of
him. None more apt to follow
the <hi>deſperate</hi> advice of <hi>Job</hi>'s
Wife;<note place="margin">Job 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Curſe God, and die,</hi> than
ſuch <hi>wordly, repining, diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
wretches, as place all their
<hi>Heaven</hi> here. And that this
is true, I think is a matter ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
plain by our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
and 'tis eaſy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
inſtances not a few. And
therefore to be <hi>humble, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:60705:73"/>
and <hi>bleſſing</hi> God; not
<hi>charging him fooliſhly,</hi> or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him <hi>unworthily</hi> in every
ſtate and condition, I look
upon to be part of the means
in order to the avoiding <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi>
and <hi>blaſphemous</hi> thoughts.</p>
               <p>Another Rule which may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
be obſerv'd to this end, is, That
when at any time we are
aſſaulted with ſuch profane
Thoughts, we <hi>immediately</hi> with
a Sacred fear, <hi>cast them out</hi> of
our Minds. For profane or
blaſphemous Thoughts are
<hi>eſpecially</hi> ſuch as we ſhould not
ſtay to argue, or diſpute with.
And therefore we find that
tho' our Bleſſed Lord thought
fit to <hi>argue</hi> with the <hi>Devil</hi> in
other Temptations; yet when
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60705:74"/>
he ſuggeſteth <hi>profane</hi> Thoughts
of God to him;<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 10.</note> our Saviour
ſeems to <hi>vary</hi> in his defence,
and immediately bids him be
gone;<note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Get thee
hence, Satan, &amp;c.</hi> And then
('tis ſaid) <hi>The Devil left him,
and behold Angels came and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whenever therefore this
happens to be your caſe; that
you are troubled with ſuch
<hi>horrid, profane,</hi> or <hi>blaſphemous</hi>
Thoughts of God, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caſt them out; do not let
your Mind <hi>dwell</hi> upon them
one moment. But do with this
kind of evil Thoughts in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
as you were taught to
do in the VII. Direction for the
<hi>Well-governing</hi> our Thoughts
in <hi>general.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:60705:74"/>
In the next place, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
that at that time when
we are aſſaulted with them, we
ſend up an <hi>Ejaculation</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and lift up our Hearts to
God in a ſhort Prayer, that he
would be pleas'd to <hi>cleanſe</hi> our
Hearts of them, and preſerve
us from them. When any ſuch
abominable Thought preſents
it ſelf to thee; cry out, <hi>O Lord,
keep me! O Lord, ſave me! O
Lord, let not the Devil have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
over me!</hi> Lord, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to love, and adore thee
<hi>with all my heart, with all my
ſoul, and with all my might.</hi> O
Lord, thou knoweſt that I am
<hi>grieved</hi> at ſuch Thoughts as
theſe; and earneſtly deſire to
have my Thoughts of thee to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60705:75"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:60705:75"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:60705:76"/>
be ſuch, as theſe Bleſſed Spirits
entertain, who are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in thy bliſsful preſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And not only in <hi>ejaculatory;</hi> but
in our ſet Prayers, and conſtant
Devotions ſhould we offer
them up to God; purge and
acquit our ſelves of them in
his ſight, and lay open the
<hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>vehement</hi> deſires of
our Souls, to be rid of them.
And by this means it is hop'd
that we ſhall at length be free'd
from them. Tho' they may
not <hi>preſently</hi> depart from us,
but continue to moleſt us, even
in our very <hi>Prayers,</hi> and moſt
<hi>Solemn</hi> Duties, as they often
will: Tho' Almighty God may
ſuffer them to be injected into
our Mind, for <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:60705:76"/>
ends, which are unſeen, as
(no doubt) he frequently doth;
yet I think this is what very
well becomes one that is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with profane or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Thoughts, and a <hi>proper</hi>
way to eaſe his Mind of them.</p>
               <p>Again: In order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
profane and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Thoughts, have a
ſpecial reverence of the <hi>Name</hi>
of GOD. Never hear it
mentioned without a Sacred
<hi>Veneration,</hi> and Awe upon thy
Soul: Let thy Heart <hi>bow down</hi>
at the mention of him. Never
let his Name be in thy mouth
but with Devotion; nor ever
hear others pronounce it <hi>raſhly</hi>
or <hi>profanely,</hi> in common ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or curſing, without an
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60705:77"/>
holy dread; and (if it may be
done effectually) a ſober Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.
A <hi>cuſtomary</hi> and <hi>heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>
naming the Name of
GOD, leads to profaneneſs,
and encourageth blaſphemous
Thoughts of him.</p>
               <p>And therefore 'tis a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
evil to have the Name of
GOD, or CHRIST in our
mouths <hi>ſlightly,</hi> or <hi>jeſtingly;</hi> or
upon any <hi>frivolous</hi> occaſion, or
in the repetition of a Story, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That at the
name of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S every knee
ſhould bowe, of things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and things in earth, and
things under the earth.</hi> All the
Heavenly Hoſt pay a moſt
profound Reverence to that
<hi>Name,</hi> which Men proſtitute,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60705:77"/>
and make ſo vile. And until
we endeavour to imitate their
adorations, we ſhall not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be preſerved from ſuch
Thoughts as are <hi>horridly</hi>
profane. It is hard to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how that Perſon can be
kept from thinking unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of God, who makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of uſing his Name in his
common Diſcourſe, or upon
the moſt <hi>petty</hi> occaſions.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Rule</hi> more which I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
would recommend to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in hand, is this: Labour
to <hi>know GOD,</hi> if thou wouldſt
think highly, and worthily of
him. The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>God</hi>
is a proper Remedy againſt
profane Thoughts. Now there
is a Knowledge of <hi>God</hi> which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60705:78"/>
we may <hi>not</hi> ſeek after, as to
know his Eſſence, his Decrees,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> To endeavour ſo to
know him, is a vain, as well as
a preſumptuous thing; as was
hinted before in this Chapter.
But there is a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of
God, which we may and ought
to make our <hi>Search</hi> and <hi>Study;
viz.</hi> The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Attributes,</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> and
<hi>Commandments;</hi> and theſe things
that in his Word he hath <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
on purpoſe to be known,
in order to Man's preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and future perfection.
Such a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of him as this
every good Man will earneſtly
endeavour after, and uſe all
means of attaining; and the
rather becauſe it is indeed an
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60705:78"/>
expedient of avoiding ſuch <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi>
Thoughts of God as many
are grievouſly troubled with.
<hi>Ignorance</hi> is here ſo far from
being the mother of <hi>Devotion,</hi>
that nothing more tends to
make our Thoughts of God
vile, and blaſphemous. The
truth of this abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the various and
monſtrous <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the
<hi>Gentile</hi> World, and the groſs
and horrid Conceptions <hi>they</hi>
had of their Deities. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
from the <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that groſs
and <hi>Carnal</hi> way of Worſhip
amongſt them uſed; eſpecially
in the darkeſt Ages of <hi>Popery.</hi>
When 'tis almoſt <hi>incredible</hi> to
tell what abſurdities and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neneſſes,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60705:79"/>
were the conſequences
of their Ignorance. Nay, it
muſt be acknowledg'd that
even amongſt our ſelves, <hi>ſome
have not the knowledge of</hi> God. <hi>I
ſpeak this to your ſhame.</hi> And
until they have, until they do
attain to <hi>know</hi> him in ſome
meaſure. It cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that their Thoughts of
him ſhould be rectify'd. The
more we <hi>know</hi> God, the more
we come to <hi>love</hi> him; to be
<hi>tranſported</hi> with him; and to
have the moſt <hi>high</hi> and <hi>noble</hi>
Thoughts of him.</p>
               <p>Now this excellent and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and deſirable knowledge
of God, is to be obtain'd theſe
two ways,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60705:79"/>
By his Works,<lb/>
and<lb/>
By his Word.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From our own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of the ſtupendous frame
of the <hi>Creation,</hi> and the mighty

are a great means to make us

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60705:80"/>
us from all profane, or
blaſphemous, or unworthy
Thoughts of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as we may come to

obſervation of the
great Works of his Creation,
and Providence; ſo we may
by his moſt <hi>Holy Word.</hi> And
indeed thence alone we can
fetch our trueſt <hi>Ideas,</hi> and moſt
proper Thoughts of God. The
Scriptures are the beſt helps to
our attaining the knowledge
of him; wherein in a <hi>Majeſtick
ſtyle,</hi> his glorious Attributes
are repreſented to us. His
<hi>Goodneſs, Purity, Power,
Juſtice, Truth,</hi> are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
diſplay'd in a various
manner; by deſcriptions, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60705:80"/>

and ſurprizing <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
which no Man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

<hi>awful</hi> Thoughts of the Great
God; and admirably preſerv'd
from all vain, wicked, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Thoughts, which prove a
great terrour and affliction to
many.</p>
               <p>To draw to a <hi>Concluſion</hi> of
this Chapter: A careful and
humble Reading, and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the holy Word of God,
together, with a <hi>Conſcientious</hi>
attendance upon his <hi>Sacraments</hi>
and other Ordinances, is a very
excellent way to be rid of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60705:81"/>
all profane, or blaſphemous
thoughts. For our Hearts by
this means are happily <hi>ſeaſoned</hi>
with good things; and God's
holy Spirit convey'd to our
Souls, and laſting inclinations
to Holineſs, are apt to remain
in us.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I would not
leave theſe poor Souls, who
are apt to be diſquieted, and
<hi>terrify'd</hi> with ſuch thoughts as
theſe, without ſome further
<hi>ſecurity,</hi> comfort and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
in this matter.</p>
               <p>Be pleas'd further to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that tho' it be our Duty
to hate and abhor, and <hi>tremble</hi>
at the very firſt motion of
ſuch profane, impious, or
blaſphemous Thoughts; yet we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60705:81"/>
have no reaſon to be ſo <hi>terribly
affrighted</hi> at them, or <hi>confounded</hi>
with them, as many (and theſe
good <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> are. For the
All-wiſe <hi>God</hi> doth frequently
<hi>ſuffer</hi> us to be tempted with
ſuch profane Thoughts for
ends <hi>excellent,</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> to
our own immortal Souls. As
to humble us, and make us
more <hi>ſtrict</hi> in the <hi>Examination</hi>
of our own Hearts; more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the <hi>Deceitfulneſs</hi> of
them, which is in nothing
more diſcernable, than in
an extravagant Liberty of
Thoughts.</p>
               <p>Or elſe it may be to make
us more <hi>ſober</hi> in our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
to avoid <hi>nice</hi> inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
into caſes <hi>Myſterious;</hi> and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60705:82"/>
ſhun all <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
or to rouſe up the <hi>dull</hi>
and decay'd Powers of our
Souls. Or it may be to try
our <hi>Faith,</hi> and other <hi>Graces;</hi>
and to ſee whether we will love
him, when he thinks fit to
<hi>with-hold</hi> his Divine, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Comforts from our
Souls, as well as when he <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows</hi>
them upon us. Or elſe
to cauſe us perhaps to make
the Glory of God our <hi>highest</hi>
end in all our Performances,
that our hearts run not upon
any mean and low deſigns;
but the <hi>Pleaſing</hi> the Almighty
be, as it is, the end of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Or elſe it may be to ſtir
us up to the greater <hi>Diligence</hi>
in <hi>making our calling and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60705:82"/>
ſure;</hi> and not to let our
eternal happineſs reſt upon
ſuch uncertainties, as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Men do theirs. But
ſtrive to get as much <hi>aſſurance</hi>
of our endleſs welfare as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
we are able, <hi>and</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with Faith, Hope, and
other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Vertues. Theſe
then being, doubtleſs, ſome of
the <hi>gracious</hi> ends for which
God is pleas'd to ſuffer us to
labour under ſuch Thoughts
as I have been ſpeaking of;
and it being oftentimes the
caſe of <hi>good Chriſtians</hi> to be
afflicted with them. Theſe
poor Souls, who happen at any

them, have great reaſon to take

               <p>THe next kind of evil

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The firſt of which is <hi>Prayer:</hi>
Which tho' it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi>
Remedy, and muſt in no
caſe of trial be pretermitted;
for if any Man lack <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or
<hi>Grace</hi> (of any particular kind
whatſoever) <hi>Let him ask it of
God</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>James) who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <hi>and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth

be more <hi>eſpecially</hi> needful here.
And therefore we muſt be
much in <hi>Prayer.</hi> If we find our
ſelves to be aſſaulted with this
kind of Thoughts; we muſt
make it a part of our conſtant
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60705:84"/>
Petitions, that God would be
pleas'd to cleanſe, and purify
<hi>the thoughts of our hearts by the
inſpiration of his holy Spirit:</hi>
That he would <hi>mortify</hi> our
luſtful deſires, and quench the
<hi>fire</hi> of concupiſcence in us, that
our Souls and Bodies may be
the <hi>Temple</hi> of God. We muſt
imitate the poor <hi>Leper</hi> in the
Goſpel,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Who fell down at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus's

ſaying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou
canst make me clean!</hi> 'Tis no
<hi>eaſy</hi> matter to ſubdue this kind
of evil thoughts in <hi>ſome</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions:
But the difficulty
of ſo doing, is greateſt to ſuch
as have liv'd in an <hi>habit</hi> of luſt,
and uncleanneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt call in the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Temperance,</hi> and
<hi>Faſting,</hi> is a proper Remedy
for the ſuppreſſing of this kind
of <hi>Evil Thoughts.</hi> While the
Soul and the Body are ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and make up one <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum;</hi>
the operations of the

and Conſtitution of the
<hi>Body;</hi> and therefore <hi>that</hi> muſt
be kept in due order, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>A <hi>pampering</hi> and <hi>indulging</hi>
the Fleſh, is a great promoter
of Luſt; and when the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits are intoxicated, the
<hi>Soul</hi> can but feebly exert it
ſelf. A Man can hardly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60705:85"/>
himſelf <hi>then</hi> from
the <hi>groſſest</hi> acts of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
much leſs from impure
<hi>Thoughts.</hi> And therefore <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi>
and <hi>Self-denial,</hi> are
<hi>always</hi> neceſſary, in order to
avoiding unclean Thoughts:
which, as our Saviour ſaid of
the unclean <hi>Devil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 17. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Go not out
but by Faſting, and Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mind is <hi>calm,</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi>
when the Body is in a
regular temper. A Man is fit
to meditate, and think on God
and Heaven, and holy things,
when he is <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>moderate.</hi>
And the reaſon of <hi>Faſting</hi>'s
being made a Duty, is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to tame the inſolencies of
the Fleſh; to keep the Thoughts
pure, the Reaſon clear; and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60705:86"/>
to make us more fit for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Duties. Upon which
account the Duties of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial,
and Mortification, are
not ſo <hi>ſevere,</hi> as they may
ſometimes ſeem to us, but
highly <hi>reaſonable.</hi> Since the
denial of the gratifications
of our ſenſual and <hi>low</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
doth bring ſatisfaction
to the <hi>higher</hi> appetites of the
Soul; ſince while the <hi>Body</hi>
is kept in due ſubjection,
the <hi>Soul</hi>'s liberty, and activity
is much the greater. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<hi>Heaven</hi> is worth ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and denying our ſelves
for; if it were a work <hi>much
more</hi> harſh and unpleaſant than
it is. If this will denominate
us of the number of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60705:86"/>
true Diſciples, certainly we
ſhould not ſtick at it: And
that it will do ſo, our Bleſſed
Lord hath aſſur'd us.<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>If any
man will come after me, let him
deny himſelf, and take up his
croſs, and follow me.</hi> Men will
reſtrain their appetites, and
deny themſelves in a great
meaſure for ſome <hi>temporal</hi> and
<hi>worldly</hi> ends; why ſhould they
not do it then to gain <hi>eternal</hi>
Happineſs?</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that in the
ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> Games, call'd
the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, theſe that
were the Strivers, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants
for the Prize, would
be ſure to mortify themſelves,
and keep to a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>ſparing</hi>
Diet, thereby to bring down
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60705:87"/>
their Fleſh, and make their
Bodies <hi>pliant</hi> and <hi>Athletick.</hi>
And all that they could hope
to get by it, was only a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of flowers, and a little
<hi>frivolous</hi> honour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if <hi>they</hi> would be at the
pains to do ſo much for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
not worth a naming;
how much <hi>more</hi> ſhould we do
it in order to the avoiding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
thoughts, and impure
deſires; which will not only
<hi>hinder</hi> us in our Striving for
Heaven, but <hi>unqualify</hi> us for
it. Thus the Apoſtle argues,
<hi>Every one that ſtriveth for the
Maſtery is temperate in all
things.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>Now they do it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a corruptible Crown, but we

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60705:87"/>
run not as uncertainly, ſo fight
I not as one that beateth the
air: But I keep under my Body,
and bring it into ſubjection, least
that by any means when I have
preached to others, I may not
my ſelf be a cast-away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Remedy againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
unclean thoughts is, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
that they are of
a <hi>defiling</hi> nature. They leave
a ſtrange <hi>pollution,</hi> and <hi>filth</hi>
behind them; and (if indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'd)
very <hi>ſtrongly</hi> incline to
<hi>actual</hi> uncleanneſs. It is a <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi>
thing to cheriſh thoughts
of this kind, to delight in them,
and dwell upon them.</p>
               <p>For there are <hi>none</hi> more apt
to grow uſurping and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable
by entertainment,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60705:88"/>
than <hi>theſe.</hi> They do more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
mightily unfit us for holy
Duties. They weaken the
Powers of the Soul to a <hi>great</hi>
degree; and therefore as we
value our Souls, as we eſteem
Heaven, into which no <hi>unclean
thing ſhall enter;</hi> let us labour
to avoid them: and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
is proper in order
thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, Keeping a <hi>ſtrict</hi>
guard over all our <hi>Sences,</hi> is
here <hi>particularly</hi> neceſſary. For
'tis by the <hi>Sences</hi> that luſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades
the Soul. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unleſs we have a ſpecial
regard to them, we cannot
preſerve our Souls from being
polluted.</p>
               <p>Our Eyes therefore ſhould
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60705:88"/>
be turn'd away from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
objects; our Ears be
deaf to all obſcene diſcourſes,
and the <hi>rest</hi> of our Sences ſhun
every thing that may have the
<hi>least</hi> tendency to this kind of
evil Thoughts. A vain cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
to be a <hi>ſpectator,</hi> hath
ſometimes proved fatal, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>two</hi> Inſtances in the
Scriptures.<note place="margin">Gen. 34. 1, 2.</note> And one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
Sence hath e're now
proved a Man's deſtruction.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 11. 2.</note>
Therefore if we will approve
our ſelves to God in <hi>ſincerity,</hi>
and are deſirous to attain
a right Government of our
Thoughts, and avoid this kind
of them eſpecially, we muſt
be ſure to keep a ſtrict watch
over all our Sences.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, An having recourſe

a great preſervative againſt, and

Thoughts, to have <hi>this</hi>
Conſideration frequently in
our Minds; <hi>(viz.)</hi> That God
is infinitely pure and holy, and
hates all kinds and degrees of

               <p>REvengeful <hi>and</hi> malicious,

are another kind of</hi> Evil
Thoughts, <hi>which deſerve our</hi>

do many times domineer and
tyranize in the Souls of Men, to
the effectual hindrance of their
Duty. Whatever favourable

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60705:92"/>
or whatever excuſes they may

But <hi>(ſpeaks our Lord)</hi>
I ſay unto you, love your enemies;
bleſs them that curſe you, do good
to them that hate you, and pray
for them that deſpitefully uſe
you, and perſecute you. <hi>And</hi>
(Math. 5. 21.) Ye have heard
that it was ſaid by them of old
time, Thou ſhalt not kill; and
whoſoever ſhall kill, ſhall be in
danger of the judgment: But I
ſay unto you, that whoſoever is
angry with his Brother, without
a cauſe, ſhall be in danger
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60705:93"/>
of the judgment; and whoſoever
ſhall ſay to his Brother <hi>Racha,
(i.e. Thou empty, or deſpicable
fellow, or the like)</hi> ſhall be in
danger of the council: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall ſay, thou fool, ſhall
be in danger of Hell-fire. <hi>From
which it is plain, That the</hi>
Chriſtian <hi>Law doth forbid all</hi>
Malice <hi>and</hi> Revenge: <hi>not only
actually doing hurt to any;
but all contumelious language,
and cheriſhing even the leaſt
Revengeful Thought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet how apt is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature to retain the
memory of a <hi>ſuppos'd</hi> Injury?
How prone is a Man to have
a <hi>Grudge</hi> in his Heart againſt
his Brother? Perhaps he will
carry a fair ſhew of charity:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60705:93"/>
But yet his Conſcience tells
him there lurks Rancour, or
at leaſt a <hi>Grudging</hi> in his Heart:
And 'tis a difficult matter to
bring him into a better mind.
But he muſt be of a better
mind, if he will be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>

<hi>forgive</hi> an Enemy, but <hi>forget</hi>
him too.</p>
               <p>This (as is very probable)
hath been the <hi>true</hi> cauſe of

And they are <hi>briefly</hi> theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, The Conſideration of
what <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Maſter,
(who hath forbidden all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
thoughts) hath done
for us.</p>
               <p>How can any one think of
Revenge, who hath received
ſuch favours, and immunities
(as every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hath) at the
hands of his Redeemer?
How unlike a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is it to
cheriſh ſo much as an envious
<hi>Deſire?</hi> How different from
the mind of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60705:94"/>

who hath done and ſuffered
more for Us <hi>(his Enemies)</hi> than
'tis poſſible to expreſs. Truly
therefore, to conſider this <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,</hi>
is a ſufficient check to
all ſuch Thoughts as theſe;
and a proper means to eject
them. 'Tis an hard matter
for a Man to be ſo profligate,
as to take pleaſure in the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
or lapſes of others,
who conſiders how much he
himſelf is indebted to the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of <hi>GOD.</hi> To <hi>deviſe</hi> a
Revenge, or Calumny upon
his Bed againſt any Perſon;

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60705:95"/>
his miſtakes to be his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
To ſlander, back-bite,

and to ſupport his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
or Eſtate on the ruine
of another's: When any of
theſe things are the <hi>Buiſineſs</hi> of

ſo far from being a true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple
of our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> that
he is <hi>in the very gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and in the bond of iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the great uneaſineſs
that ſuch Thoughts are to the
Mind that harbours them, and
the effectual hindrance that
they are to holy Duties; they
carry in them a very great

the meek, the kind, and the
charitable <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſhewn to <hi>our
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60705:95"/>
ſelves.</hi> Which to one that
makes <hi>conſcience</hi> of his Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
is a very hainous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
thing. Behold thy
Saviour hanging upon his
Croſs, and praying for thee,
and the reſt of his murderers;
and I ſhould think, that <hi>Sight</hi>
would quickly baniſh all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful,
Grudging, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Thoughts out of
thy Mind; and make thee
more eaſy and pleaſant to thy

               <p>Secondly, The Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
of what our own <hi>Demerit</hi>
is; and what indignities, and
affronts our ſins have been to
<hi>God,</hi> is another Expedient for
the avoiding this kind of Evil

               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:60705:96"/>
Fear. or ſome Temporal
conſideration, may keep a Man
from executing his revenge:
but in order to the preſerving
himſelf from wicked, uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Thoughts, which are
hateful in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> and
highly puniſhable, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of our own Demerit,
is a proper expedient.</p>
               <p>And here we cannot but
fall down in adoration of the
forbearance, and longanimity
of a provoked <hi>God,</hi> towards us
miſerable offenders. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but with the deepeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
acknowledge that we
have offended GOD infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more, than any have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

'Tis a piece of great preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60705:97"/>
                  <hi>God is love,</hi>

And as it is the cement of <hi>this</hi>

<hi>this</hi> kind of evil thoughts is
ſuch, as we muſt by no means

very ſad effects, when encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged:

idle, and fooliſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe Wandring
Thoughts when we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
about Holy things, are
in a great meaſure owing to
our ſelves, and there is much
in our power, in order to their
cure. We will conſider what
are the principal occaſions of
them, and that will direct us
to the Remedies againſt them.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, <hi>Wandring thoughts</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
are oftentimes occaſion'd by a
want of <hi>Preparation</hi> to Holy
duties. We careleſly and teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rariouſly
ruſh on to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of them. We think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60705:100"/>
that they <hi>must</hi> be done;
but yet conſider not (as we
ought) the <hi>manner</hi> of doing
them. We go to our Prayers

make but little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the moſt <hi>ſolemn</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
actions of our Life.
Which is oftentimes the cauſe
why our Thoughts wander,
and ſcatter: and ſo we reap
but little comfort, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from our beſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
               <p>'Tis expedient then, and
our duty before ever we
engage in any ſet performance
of the Worſhip of God,
that we prepare our ſelves by
ſome previous Thoughts, and
pious Diſpoſitions, that ſo we
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60705:100"/>
may come to our duty in a
right manner: That our Souls
may be prepoſſeſs'd, and fitted
for the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>We think it too bold
and preſuming, to thruſt our
ſelves into the preſence of an
Earthly Prince, without due
conſideration. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſurely it cannot be thought
leſs to approach the face of the
<hi>Infinite GOD,</hi> without a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
compoſure of Spirit, and
a preparation of Thought.
But beſides the <hi>evil</hi> of ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the <hi>Natural</hi> conſequence
of it, is to make our Thoughts
looſe and wandring. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60705:101"/>
how it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
When therefore we draw

Aſſemblies of the Church,

and thou upon earth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let thy words be few.</hi> This
Rule, in order to the avoiding
wandring Thoughts, may be
but little minded, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
uſeful.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Want of <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
and <hi>ſettling</hi> the Mind on
God in the <hi>actual</hi> performance
of holy Duties, is another great
occaſion of the <hi>wandring</hi> of our
Thoughts therein. What is the
reaſon of our complaints, that
we do not hear the Word of
God to our Spiritual comfort
and advantage; pray with that
fervour of Devotion; praiſe
him with that enlargement of
Soul; and have that <hi>reliſh</hi> of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60705:102"/>
Divine things, which we would
or ought? Why 'tis for want
of a due <hi>care</hi> of our Thoughts,
in the <hi>actual</hi> performance of
holy Duties; which naturally
follows from the former, <hi>viz.</hi>
the want of a due Preparation
before-hand. Why are our
Minds in the ends of the Earth
going a Pilgrimage to ſtrange
Countries, and travelling
after Foreign Objects? Why
'tis for want of a due <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Soul upon God?
'Tis becauſe we do not <hi>poſſeſs</hi>
our Souls with an awe and fear
of that God we worſhip; and
conſider not the <hi>importance</hi> of
that duty we are imploy'd in.
When we come into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, or into his Courts
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60705:102"/>
to pay our homage to him;
we ſhould ſeriouſly conſider
into what an Infinite Preſence
we come: what, who, that
glorious God is we worſhip:
meditate on his wonderful
Attributes; and form ſuch an
<hi>Idea</hi> of him, as conduceth to
our <hi>utmost</hi> Devotion. We
ſhould conſider not only the
dignity and infiniteneſs of that
God, whom we worſhip; but
alſo that it is our <hi>highest,</hi> our
<hi>eternal Interest</hi> to ſerve, and
worſhip, and obey him. That
it is our <hi>truest</hi> advantage and
high honour to approach to
him: And that we conſult the
everlaſting good of our own
Souls,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> in <hi>honouring Him:</hi> That
he will be ador'd and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60705:103"/>
in ſincerity, and <hi>true</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion:
That he will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence
with an hypocritical and
formal Devotion, and a <hi>ſhew</hi>
of Godlineſs: But as <hi>He is a
rewarder of them that diligently
ſeek him;</hi> ſo he is an avenger
of all Hypocriſy and inſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>If we come to Church only
as a common and ordinary
place, and ſet about holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without the moſt <hi>ſerious</hi>
application of Mind, and an
entire ſurrender of our Souls;
it will be impoſſible to avoid
wandring Thoughts.</p>
               <p>When thou art therefore
imploy'd in any part of thy
Devotions, labour to fix thy
Thoughts <hi>ſteadily</hi> on God.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60705:103"/>
Beware of an <hi>unattentive, heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
or <hi>indifferent</hi> temper. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtre
thy ſelf from every
thing that may withdraw thy
Thoughts: As <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the
Almighty's command,<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Pull'd
off the ſhoes from his feet</hi> when

<hi>Myſtery</hi> of that Action: And

God; and this is the gate of

Eye of thy Soul intent upon
God; and thou wilt ſee ſuch
<hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>wonderful</hi> things

to look off, and thy <hi>fooliſh</hi>
Thoughts to be vain, and
<hi>wandring,</hi> as they will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably

               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, A <hi>Diſſolute,</hi> and
<hi>Vnconſtant</hi> Practiſe of holy
Duties, mightily conduceth to
<hi>weaken</hi> and <hi>ſcatter</hi> our thoughts
in them. When we do not
obſerve <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> and <hi>Aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in our Devotions, we loſe
much of that holy Fervour,
and ſacred Temper, which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60705:104"/>
otherwiſe we ſhould be happy
in.</p>
               <p>To omit our Prayers, or
other holy Duties twice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
for having perform'd
them once; or to be devout,
and worſhip God by ſtarts and
fits, and not in a regular and
conſtant courſe, hath a very
ill influence upon our thoughts.
'Tis true we <hi>may</hi> have Avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
ſo that ſometimes we
ſhall not be able to obſerve
our uſual hours of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But alaſs! we often make
that an hindrance, which
ſhould be none: and by not
being <hi>conſtant</hi> in keeping our
Times and Seaſons for holy
Duties; but being drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
by every vanity, viſit, or
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60705:105"/>
trifle, our Thoughts become
vain, idle, and <hi>wandring, when</hi>
we <hi>come</hi> to do our Duty. The
Sacred temper is worn off; the
Mind is out of that <hi>Frame</hi> of
Devotion in which it was left
by the <hi>last</hi> performance; and
God is provoked to withdraw
his aids from ſuch inconſtant
<hi>Devoto's.</hi> This is a matter
very well worth our Notice,
and Obſervation; and lets us
ſee the inconvenience and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of miſſing Prayers, or other
holy Duties but <hi>once,</hi> without
a reaſonable cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> In this caſe alſo, too much
<hi>Liberty</hi> given our <hi>Sences</hi> is of
very evil influence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
over them, if we would
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60705:105"/>
prevent the aberrations of our
Minds, when we are imploy'd
about holy Duties.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon that our
Devotion, is no more than Lip-ſervice?
That our Hearts are
ſo <hi>far</hi> from God, when we are
in his more immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
That inſtead of being
influenced with the Love of
God, humbled to the duſt with
a ſence of his <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> rais'd
up with admiration of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
and Perfections; our
Thoughts are engag'd either
in fooliſh and ſilly, or wanton
and impure ſpeculations? why
'tis becauſe we do not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
guard our ſences; but
give them an offenſive Liberty,
by which means the <hi>Church</hi> of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60705:106"/>
God is many times made a
<hi>Theatre,</hi> or <hi>Exchange.</hi> What
is it that Men come into the
preſence of God for? Is it not
the greateſt Honour, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of a <hi>Poor</hi> Creature, to
come into the <hi>Preſence</hi> of his
Creator? Is it not for moſt
weighty and important ends
that he comes <hi>there?</hi> Is it not
in order to reconciliation with
God, pardon of his ſins; the
Divine Aſſiſtance; and in the
end the eternal Salvation of
his <hi>Precious</hi> Soul? Are theſe
<hi>little,</hi> and <hi>trifling</hi> things? Are
they not the greateſt concerns
that can be? Surely they are.
And therefore thoſe who walk,
whiſper, talk, gaze, laugh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
when they are imploy'd about
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60705:106"/>
                  <hi>Holy</hi> things, do much betray
their ſtupidity and folly, and
their mean and irreligious
ſence of the <hi>greatest</hi> things in
the World.</p>
               <p>And beſides, they can never
think to pleaſe God by ſuch
a <hi>Sacrifice of fools;</hi> but do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
greatly provoke him
thereby. There cannot be a
clearer argument of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>profaneneſs</hi> of a Man's
Mind, than an unſerious and
looſe deportment in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God; to which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
adminiſters more than a
careleſs Liberty given our
ſences. For 'tis certain if we
would have our Thoughts kept
ſteady and intent, we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
keep our <hi>Sences.</hi> And
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60705:107"/>
he that would preſerve his Soul
from <hi>Wandring,</hi> muſt never
be ſo oddly at leiſure in his
Devotions, as to gaze on this
or t'other thing, or Perſon that
hath fine Clothes, or a ſtrange
Face, or ſuffer any of his Sences
to be triflingly imploy'd.</p>
               <p>This then is alſo a Rule
neceſſary to be obſerv'd, in
order to the avoiding <hi>this</hi> kind
of evil Thoughts, <hi>(viz.) Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring</hi>
Thoughts in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of <hi>God;</hi> which are often
very troubleſom, and uneaſy
to our Souls; and many times
render our Sacred performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>fruitleſs</hi> too.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> In the next place, it may be
obſerv'd, That to wandring
and vain Thoughts in the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60705:107"/>
Worſhip of God, doth very
much conduce a pompous
multitude of Ceremonies,
ſuch as there is in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is quite beyond
the bounds of Gravity, and
Decency.</p>
               <p>But, thanks be to God, we
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are
in no danger of having our
Thoughts <hi>thus</hi> drawn aſide.
Becauſe theſe <hi>few</hi> Ceremonies
which are obſerv'd in it, are
appointed in great Wiſdom
and Diſcretion: And there is
not the <hi>least</hi> thing in all our
Liturgy, that is apt to excite
<hi>one</hi> vain, or wandring Thought
in any Man's Mind: but <hi>all</hi>
is ſo uniformly ordered and
diſpoſed, as greatly tends to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60705:108"/>
the increaſe of Piety, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of true Devotion.
This <hi>must</hi> be acknowledg'd
by all ſober and impartial Men,
ſo that I need only <hi>mention</hi> this
particular.</p>
               <p>But yet there is one thing,
which I think to be here worth
our Notice, and which very
much conduceth to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of wandring Thoughts
in the Worſhip of God. And
that is an <hi>Vniformity</hi> of Action
in the Divine Service. My
meaning is, that we ſhould
<hi>kneel,</hi> when others kneel, and
<hi>ſtand,</hi> when they ſtand, (as the
Church in the Rubricks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points)
and obſerve an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in our <hi>outward</hi> deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as well as <hi>inward</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions:
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60705:108"/>
and this will be a
means of preſerving our
Thoughts from flying off.
Whereas when <hi>this</hi> Perſon
kneels, and <hi>another</hi> ſtands up,
a <hi>third</hi> ſits down, a <hi>fourth</hi>
leans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is apt to beget
in us an improper variety of
Thoughts, and to make our
Minds wandring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Worldly-mindedneſs</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
neceſſarily makes
our Thoughts vain and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
while we are about holy
things. In this caſe eſpecially
it's true, that <hi>No man can ſerve
God and Mammon.</hi> We can
no more have our Thoughts
<hi>Heavenly</hi> and <hi>Earthly, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
and <hi>Carnal</hi> at the ſame
time, than we can look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60705:109"/>
and downward at once.
<hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> therefore, and
worldly-mindedneſs muſt
needs be avoideed, if we would
eſcape <hi>Wandring Thoughts.</hi>
For <hi>how</hi> can ſuch a Man pray,
or ſerve God in any tolerable
manner, who hath all the
while his Heart and affections
ſet upon the <hi>World?</hi> How
can he attend upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of <hi>GOD,</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
whoſe Mind is at
home, about his Riches, Farms,
or his Merchandiſe? Theſe
things <hi>ſteal</hi> away his Thoughts,
and for that reaſon <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi>
is (by St. <hi>Paul)</hi> termed <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note>
                  <hi>Here</hi> therefore eſpecially
muſt we practiſe that Advice
of our Bleſſed Saviour:<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Take no

thought, ſaying, What ſhall we
eat, or what ſhall we drink, or
wherewithal ſhall we be clothed:
(For after all theſe things do the
Gentiles ſeek; for your heavenly
Father knoweth that ye have
need of all theſe things:) But
ſeek ye first the Kingdom of God,
&amp; his righteouſneſs, and all theſe
things ſhall be added unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When-ever therefore thou
ſetteſt about the duty of <hi>Prayer,
Meditation,</hi> or any other holy
Duty, either in private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
be ſure to ſhut out all
<hi>covetous, ſenſual,</hi> and <hi>worldly</hi>
Thoughts. Let not thy Mind
hanker after thoſe <hi>Fleſh-pots,</hi>
when thou art going into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
and to have ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
tho' not to take <hi>poſſeſſion</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:60705:110"/>
of the promis'd Land. This
is the way to have thy Mind
fix'd and intent, and by that
means better'd and edified.
This is the Myſtical meaning
of that Action of our Saviour:
<hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 21. 12, 13 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>His whipping the buyers
and ſellers out of the Temple,
ſaying, My houſe ſhall be called
the houſe of prayer, but ye have
made it a den of thieves.</hi> 'Twas
to <hi>ſhew</hi> that when we come
into the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> to
worſhip the Eternal Majeſty,
and in all other holy Duties;
we ſhould abhor all ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
mixtures, as <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi>
and <hi>Worldly-mindedneſs,</hi> which
are the <hi>Tables of the Money-changers,</hi>
and <hi>the Seats of them
that ſold Doves:</hi> and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60705:110"/>
unſuitable to theſe holy
Performances we are about.
We muſt therefore take our
leave of all worldly, covetous
or anxious Thoughts: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
our Minds muſt unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
wander, when like that

the cares of the world muſt
be baniſhed from our Hearts.
Even <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>honest</hi> care
is unſeaſonable here, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but this <hi>one thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>
muſt be minded. As for
all worldly Thoughts, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
Imaginations, we muſt
<hi>ſhake off the very dust of them
from our feet.</hi> We muſt in our
Devotions ſoar ſo high, as to
be out of reach of the <hi>fatal</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:60705:111"/>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Again: In the next place
there muſt not be the leaſt

in any of our Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances;
for that will carry away

the only reaſon of our being
pleas'd with our <hi>best,</hi> and moſt
excelling Performances, (if
ſuch ſinful ones can any of
them be called ſo) ſhould be
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60705:111"/>
that they the <hi>more</hi> tend to the

               </p>
               <p>To theſe Rules and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
in order to the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wandring Thoughts, may
be added. A careful obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of all the Duties of the

things of this World (when
they ought to be minded) with
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60705:112"/>
                  <hi>indifference</hi> and a truſt in the

That we be more and more

               <p>A devout and earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be delivered from them,
that ſo we may ſerve <hi>GOD</hi>

of the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> in Heaven,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>Principal</hi>
Rules that I could diſcover,
in order to the avoiding vain
and wandring Thoughts in the
worſhip of God: Which are
oftentimes an unſpeakable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
to <hi>Good Chriſtians,</hi> and
which 'tis no ſmall difficulty to

               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:60705:112"/>
But if after the uſe of theſe
Directions, which I have laid
down, and all that we can do,
we <hi>cannot</hi> be rid of them; but
they will ſtill haunt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
us; yet we muſt perſiſt
in our Duty. Tho' they ſhould
come very thick upon us, yet
we muſt not be diſcouraged
from our Duty: For leaving
that undone is (I am ſure) far
from being a Remedy againſt
them; and gives the <hi>Devil</hi>
a greater advantages over us,
than we are aware. We muſt
therefore continue in our duty,
tho' it be with an heavy heart:
And then we ſhall retain the
<hi>Vertue,</hi> tho' we loſe the <hi>preſent
ſatisfaction</hi> of our Obedience.
<hi>GOD</hi> ſees the ſincerity of our
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60705:113"/>
hearts, and will <hi>aſſuredly</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
us at the laſt. Altho
the <hi>Devil</hi> (who hath a great
hand in theſe Thoughts alſo,
as we find in the Parable of
the <hi>Sower)</hi> doth continually
vex,<note place="margin">Matt. 13.</note> and trouble us with them;
yet let us wait upon <hi>GOD</hi>
with patience, and an humble
obſervance of theſe Rules laid
down, as far as we are able:
and then we ſhall be in no
danger by reaſon of ſuch
Thoughts, tho' we ſhould be
grappling, and fighting with
them, as long as we live. 'Tis
impoſſible (I think) that we
ſhould be <hi>totally</hi> free'd from
them in this <hi>fluid Medium;</hi> in
this ſtate of frailty and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
that the Mind ſhould
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60705:113"/>
be <hi>quite</hi> cleanſed of theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyances.
But yet we are to
conſider that our Life is a
continual warfare; and our
condition here a ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection:
and that therefore
we are not to deſpair, as if we
had done no good, becauſe we
have not attain'd to what this
Life cannot afford.</p>
               <p>But to comfort our ſelves
with <hi>this viz.</hi> that if in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God's Commands, we

               <p>WE are now come to
the laſt kind of evil
Thoughts, which I ſhall more
particularly handle in this
Treatiſe: <hi>viz.</hi> Sad, melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or deſpairing Thoughts.
And in order to our taking a
true obſervation of theſe, and
applying proper Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: we are to take
notice, That the occaſion of
<hi>theſe</hi> Thoughts is partly in the
habit and conſtitution of the
Body. This is undeniable to
any Perſon that hath made but
the <hi>least</hi> Obſervation in things
of this nature.: For theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60705:115"/>
who are moſt of all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with this kind of Evil
Thoughts (for ſuch they are to
be reckon'd) are <hi>hypochondriacal</hi>
and <hi>hyſterical</hi> People, and
whoſe Conſtitution is impaired
by ſome bodily Diſeaſe: and
therefore the Remedies againſt
them, muſt be partly <hi>Natural,</hi>
and partly <hi>Spiritual.</hi> But yet
I hope I ſhall not be thought
to treſpaſs, if I happen to ſpeak
a word or two of the <hi>former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dea bona valetudo</hi>—Health,
is the greateſt of <hi>Temporal</hi>
Mercies; and that without
which we can but weakly
proſecute our <hi>Spiritual</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.
'Tis the Soul of Life;
and as we can never be too
thankful to God for it; ſo
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60705:115"/>
every act of Exceſs, whereby
it is impair'd, is a greater ſin,
than Men are aware. Becauſe
'tis the great advantage of
Health and Vigour of Body,
that it renders us capable of
ſerving God, and of duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
our ſelves for the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
enjoyment of him. Every
Diſeaſe hath an influence upon
the Soul; and the indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Body, do and will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Mind, notwithſtanding
all the Dreams of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi>
But of all the diſeaſes incident to
Humane Bodies, that of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi>
deſerves moſt to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied.
It ſhould not be ſlighted
with the reproachful names of
<hi>Whimſey,</hi> and mere <hi>Fancy.</hi> 'Tis
a great injury done to Perſons
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60705:116"/>
who are affected with it, to
diſregard their complaints, and
laugh at their Miferies. Tho'
they ſhould not indulge them,
yet ſome pity is due to them.
Did they but know the woe
and anguiſh; the terrour and
amazement, that they endure,
could they but be ſenſible of
half their miſery; they could
not chuſe but pity them. An
<hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> or <hi>Hyſterical</hi>
Perſon, that is <hi>deeply</hi> affected
with the diſeaſe, is an Object
that as well deſerves compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
as any other whatſoever.
And if I ſhould endeavour to
give you an adequate deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of that Malady, 'twould
fill a Volume. What an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
variety of evil Thoughts
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60705:116"/>
of all kinds, are the effects of
it? which being in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
owing to the Diſeaſe, the
hurry of the Imaginations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
that of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
There are ſome <hi>Natural</hi>
Remedies to be made uſe of:
For which I muſt leave you
to the Learned in Nature, who
will tell you, that <hi>very much</hi>
depends upon <hi>Obſervation</hi> and
<hi>Exerciſe.</hi> That to be mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and moderate in eating
and drinking; and to be much
in bodily exerciſe, but not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
is moſt proper advice.
If a Perſon hath but the vertue
to be regular in his way of
Living, and the patience to
<hi>continue</hi> bodily exerciſe, he
doth a great deal towards
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60705:117"/>
making his Life more eaſy,
and his thoughts more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.
For every thing
that tends to make the Blood
and Spirits lively, regular, and
vigorous, tends to diſpel the
blackneſs and heavineſs of the
Thoughts. Which therefore
whoever is ſo unhappy as to be
afflicted with <hi>Melancholy,</hi> muſt
ſtudy; he muſt (I ſay) apply
himſelf to the uſe of ſuch
things as tend to cheriſh his
Blood, and exalt his Spirits.
To which all vicious extremes
are directly contrary. The
Learned <hi>Phyſicians</hi> will alſo
tell you, That none are more
voracious of <hi>Medicines,</hi> than
melancholy Perſons; but that
their deſire in <hi>that</hi> is no more
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60705:117"/>
to be indulg'd, than in many
other things; and that there
may be too much, as well as
too little—But I am gone too
far this way. I would only
have it obſerv'd, That ſad,
melancholy, and even <hi>deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Thoughts, are ſometimes
the conſequences of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe:
for <hi>ſuch</hi> it is, as much as
a Fever, or any other. And
therefore the <hi>Pyſician</hi> muſt be
conſulted.</p>
               <p>But altho' the Infirmities
of the Body do very much
conduce to ſuch Thoughts as
theſe; yet we ſhould be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that there is the hand of
<hi>GOD</hi> in them too. And not
ſo to lay the blame upon
Natural Indiſpoſition, as to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60705:118"/>
have no other Thoughts about
it. We may not think that
this caſe is purely <hi>Phyſical,</hi> and
that therefore there is no need
of any <hi>Spiritual</hi> Remedies: For
there is.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The firſt of which that I
conceive to be proper, is a
ſtrict and faithful <hi>Ezamination</hi>
of our own ſelves. We muſt
call Our-ſelves to an account,
ſearch into our own Hearts and
Lives; and-ſee what we have
been, and done. And perhaps
we may find ſome <hi>great</hi> and
<hi>wilful</hi> Sin, that we have been
guilty of; or ſome <hi>wrong,</hi> or
<hi>injuſtice,</hi> that we continue in:
which happens to be the cauſe
of all our blackneſs, and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And theſe diſmall
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60705:118"/>
Thoughts which ſo affright
us, are no other than the checks
of our own Conſcience, which
is a faithful Monitor, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer,
and impartially cenſures
and judges all our Actions.
The Good that we do it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
of, commends and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds
in us: But no wilful
ſin can eſcape its laſhes, and
bitter reproaches. Its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is an Emblem of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>'s
Power, and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
and its Sentence <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicium
ultimi judicii.</hi> It will
in ſpight of the Sinner, <hi>ſet his
ſins in order before him:</hi> and
fill him with horrour and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and fearful Thoughts:
which if they ariſe from <hi>hence,</hi>
there is no remedy but <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:60705:119"/>
Nothing but the
Tears of a Godly Sorrow can
eaſe his heavy Heart: And
renewed reſolutions of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
and a more diligent
Obedience for the time to
come, are the beſt expedient
to remove the blackneſs and
ſadneſs that is upon his Soul.
And when the Sinner hath
<hi>truly</hi> repented, and there is
an entire change wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; then he may hope
for the light of <hi>GOD</hi>'s coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to ſhine upon him:
and <hi>that he will comfort him
now after the time that he hath
plagued him, and for the years
wherein he hath ſuffered adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</hi>
But if upon a ſerious and
deep <hi>Examination</hi> of himſelf,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60705:119"/>
he cannot find that theſe ſad
and frightful Thoughts, which
infeſt him, proceed from any
ſuch cauſe, as ſome wilful and
notorious ſin; but that the
ſincere and earneſt deſire of
his Soul is <hi>always</hi> to pleaſe
God, and to keep a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to all his Laws, and
Commands: Then</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
againſt theſe black and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
Thoughts, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the <hi>tranſcendent
goodneſs</hi> of <hi>GOD.</hi> This is a
proper means to fortify our
Minds againſt them. Why
ſhall I think that I am caſt
off of <hi>GOD,</hi> and forſaken of
him? what argument can
there be for deſperation? why
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60705:120"/>
is my Heart ſo diſmal? my
Thoughts ſo troubled? my
Fears ſo tempeſtuous? Is it
becauſe I am a great Sinner?
Truly <hi>that</hi> is a ſufficient cauſe
for me to be ſorrowful, and
humbled to the very duſt; and
floods of tears are not enough
to bewail the guilt of my ſin.
But yet, O conſider the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of <hi>GOD!</hi> He is the moſt
loving and merciful <hi>Being;</hi> a

Almighty God hath therefore
engag'd his Veracity; that if
we fear him, and keep his
Commandments; live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the plain Rules of the

Goſpel, and believe; we ſhall

In order to which, he hath alſo
<hi>liberally</hi> promiſed all ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of Grace and Aſſiſtance
as we ſhall at any time need.
Theſe Promiſes therefore we

               <p>Ah! but ſays the <hi>Diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>

ſatisfy'd of the Goodneſs of

                  <hi>Ineſtimable</hi> Oblation for Sin,
and a Sacrifice of tranſcendent
value: but oh! I <hi>fear</hi> that the
vertue of that great Sacrifice
belongs not to me. But hear
what comfortable words our
Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> saith, unto all
them that truly turn to him:
<hi>Come unto me all ye that are
weary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and heavy laden with the

                  <note place="margin">John 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>So God loved the

               </p>
               <p>I believe alſo (ſaith the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding</hi>

I am fully perſuaded that <hi>in

Christ all the promiſes of</hi> God
<hi>are Yea, and Amen. And that

me beſeech thee (whoever
thou art, that art depreſs'd
with ſuch Thoughts as theſe)
to beware, and conſider, That
this is a <hi>bold</hi> and a <hi>peremptory</hi>
Sentence, which thou paſſeſt
on thy ſelf. Such a Sentence
as none of all the created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
can affirm. 'Tis the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
of the moſt deſperate
Being, the Enemy of our Souls;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60705:128"/>
and what finite Being, can
without the height of Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
paſs ſuch a Sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Perſon? which (too) is ſo
far from being true, that it is
<hi>utterly</hi> falſe.</p>
               <p>For the gracious Promiſes of
the Goſpel are offered to <hi>all</hi>
whatſoever; none are except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And every one that will
lay hold of them, hath a title
to them: provided he comes
up to the conditions on which
they are eſtabliſh'd. And
therefore, in God's Name,
hearken no longer to ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying

ſtill the boiſtrous and troubled

that we may not caſt away our

overſpread our Souls with the

which the World cannot give,

That he would no

Thoughts we are ſpeaking of:
we muſt be careful that we

For how remote ſoever
<hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> may ſeem from
<hi>Deſpair,</hi> the <hi>former</hi> doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
conduce to the <hi>latter.</hi>
He that ſets too great a value
upon the things of this World,
and a <hi>Temporal</hi> Proſperity,
will not only be greatly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from doing his <hi>Spiritual</hi>

diſquieted, and repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60705:131"/>
and ſometimes to look
upon himſelf as utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe he is
ſtrip'd of theſe <hi>outward</hi> things.
He miſtakenly looks upon
Temporal good things to be
certain marks of God's favour:
whereas in truth they are not,
but he ſometimes deals them
<hi>promiſcuouſly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>as the rain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends

               </p>
               <p>And what is the likely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of ſuch an enormous
love of the World? [if I ſay, it
ſhould pleaſe God to bring
ſuch an one into adverſity] but
that he ſhould have <hi>diſmal,</hi> and
even <hi>deſpairing</hi> Thoughts of
his own condition. There
have been frequent examples
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60705:131"/>
of this nature in the World:
And <hi>thus far</hi> have theſe words
of the Apoſtle been verify'd:
<hi>But they that will be rich fall
into temptation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and a ſnare,
and into many fooliſh and hurt-ſinful
luſts, which drown men
in perdition. For the love of
money is the root of all evil;
which while ſome have cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after, they have erred
from the Faith, and pierced
themſelves through with many
ſorrows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us not therefore ſet our
affections too much upon theſe
<hi>fleeting</hi> things: Let us enjoy
every good thing with <hi>ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
to, and <hi>dependance</hi> upon,
God's Providence. Let us
beware that we do not fix our
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60705:132"/>
Hearts on any thing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
neither <hi>Riches, Poſſeſſions,
Friends, Children,</hi> nor any of
theſe ſublunary things. For
ſo doing hath oftentimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
very fatal to many; and
at laſt hath thrown them into
Melancholy; nay, even into
<hi>Deſperation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> The laſt Remedy againſt
black, dreadful, or deſpairing
Thoughts, is, <hi>Religiuus</hi> and
<hi>Cheerful</hi> Converſation. 'Tis
not <hi>jolly, vain</hi> Company; that
will be of no uſe, but hurt: but
<hi>godly</hi> and cheerful Society, will
very much contribute to their
cure. To be always poreing,
<hi>aggravates</hi> the Malady, and
<hi>rivets</hi> the Deſpair, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
proves fatal indeed:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60705:132"/>
And therefore a little good
Converſation is very neceſſary.
Religious Diſcourſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
will keep out worſe
Thoughts; and conduce very
much to make us <hi>rejoyce with
them that do rejoyce.</hi> There is
a kind of Melody in them
which (like that of <hi>David</hi>'s
Harp,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 23.</note> when he play'd to <hi>Saul)</hi>
will <hi>drive away the evil Spirit.</hi>
'Tis a common thing for ſuch
perſons as are troubled with
this kind of thoughts, to affect
ſolitude, and deſire to be always
alone, and immur'd in their
own ſad contemplations. But
notwithſtanding the ſtrongeſt
averſions to Company, which
they may have; 'tis adviſable
that againſt their Inclinations,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60705:133"/>
they be brought in to good and
cheerful Converſation; and
that not once, or twice; but
with Continuance. And this
is a proper way (in time) to
be rid of ſuch evil Thoughts.
For, the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Temptations
and Injections, eſpecially of
this kind, are uſually more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
and come with greater
force, when people are alone,
than when they are in Society.
And then too, they are apt to
dote upon their own Notions
of things, hug their miſtakes,
and think them true, however
falſe and erroneous they may
be.</p>
               <p>A Religious and Cheerful
Friend therefore I take in this
caſe, to be of great advantage,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60705:133"/>
to comfort, adviſe, divert, and
improve them in better things.
And <hi>more eſpecially</hi> do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of their Spiritual
Guide. For it is not to be
imagined what efficacy a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<hi>Word</hi> hath ſometimes:
and what a ſweet alteration it
cauſes in diſconſolate People.
<hi>It goeth like oyl into their bones:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 11.</note>
or elſe (to uſe the Preacher's
compariſon) <hi>The words of the
wiſe are as goads, and as nails
faſtned by the Maſters of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</hi>
Good converſation,
ſtrengthens and <hi>exhilarates</hi> the
Spirits to a great degree; and
is a very proper means againſt
all <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>melancholy,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing</hi>
Thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:60705:134"/>
And indeed, I think, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is that which goes a great
way towards the cure of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.
And without it, 'tis
hardly ever to be cur'd. 'Tis
Religion muſt give a Man a
rational, and a well-grounded
hope of the ſecurity of his
eternal condition hereafter;
without which 'tis difficult to
imagine how his heart ſhould
ever be eaſy, and his Thoughts
ſerene, quiet, and compos'd.
And therefore he that would
avoid this kind of evil
Thoughts; I exhort and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
him firſt to fix the grand
Point of Religion in himſelf;
and then to cheriſh, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it by cheerful and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Converſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:60705:134"/>
But in doing this, we muſt
not think that we can be <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi>
imploy'd in Religion;
that we can have our Thoughts
ſtretch'd up always to ſuch a
pitch; to be <hi>continually</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in the duties of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and be thinking that
we cannot pleaſe God without
it. For we have <hi>Bodies</hi> as well
as <hi>Souls:</hi> We are <hi>Men,</hi> and
not <hi>Angels.</hi> And therefore
tho' we ſhould do our utmoſt,
and with all imaginable ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity;
yet we ſhould not lay
too great a load upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
for that may be the way
inſtead of <hi>preventing,</hi> to <hi>bring
on ſad</hi> and <hi>melancholy</hi> Thoughts.
And 'tis what Almighty God
no where requires of us,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 6.</note>

               <p>But as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to this

to explain to you, what is the
<hi>ſin against the Holy-Ghost.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60705:135"/>
the fear that they have
committed this <hi>Vnpardonable</hi>
Sin, hath horribly perplex'd
and terrify'd the Thoughts of
many dejected <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> even
almoſt to <hi>Deſperation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> every <hi>Sin is indeed a
Sin againſt the Holy-Ghoſt;
and ſome are</hi> grievances <hi>of him.
And therefore we are exhorted
not to</hi> Grieve the holy Spirit of
God.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>But THE SIN againſt
the Holy-Ghoſt, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by our Lord</hi> Jeſus
<hi>himſelf to be</hi> unpardonable <hi>in</hi>
this <hi>World, and in the World</hi>
to come; <hi>is called alſo</hi> Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<hi>againſt the</hi> Holy-Ghost <hi>by
the Evangeliſts. In</hi> Matth. 12.
31, 32. <hi>the words are theſe:</hi>
Wherefore I ſay unto you, that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60705:136"/>
all manner of ſin and blaſphemy
ſhall be forgiven; <hi>i. e.</hi> is capable
of being forgiven: but the Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy
against the Holy-Ghost
ſhall not be forgiven unto men.
And whoſoever ſpeaketh a word
against the ſon of Man, it ſhall
be forgiven him; but whoſoever
ſpeaketh against the Holy-Ghost,
it ſhall not be forgiven; neither
in this world, nor in the world to
come. <hi>In</hi> Mark 3. 28. &amp;c. <hi>it is
thus expreſs'd:</hi> Verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
you, All fins ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
unto the ſons of men, and
blaſphemies wherewith ſoever
they ſhall blaſpheme; but he that
blaſphemeth against the Holy-Ghost,
hath never forgiveneſs,
but is in danger of eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<hi>And in</hi> Luke 12. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:60705:136"/>
                  <hi>there is but little variation:</hi>
Whoſoever ſhall ſpeak a word
against the ſon of man, it ſhall
be forgiven him; but unto him
that blaſphemeth against the
Holy-Ghost, it ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
               <p>Now for the clearer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of theſe places which
ſpeak of the <hi>GREAT SIN,</hi>
You are to obſerve, That the
two former of theſe Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
in the Context, give us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our Saviour's having
heal'd a Demoniak; and when
he had expell'd the <hi>Devil</hi> by the
power of the Holy-Ghoſt,
(which he had without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure)
to the great amazement
of all the People: The Scribes
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60705:137"/>
and Phariſees, whoſe hearts
were ſowr'd with the leven of
Pride and Envy; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their own Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and in <hi>ſpight</hi> of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable
Evidence of that and
other Miracles, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
did; they blaſphemouſly
aſcribed the doing of them to
the <hi>Devil;</hi> repreſenting our
Lord as a Wizard, or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer.
And as abſurdly, as
impiouſly ſaid, <hi>He caſteth out
devils by</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>the
Prince of the devils.</hi> The <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy</hi>
and <hi>Malice</hi> of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
our Saviour ſeverely
reflects upon, and publickly
declares, That theſe that out
of an invenomed Spirit, and
<hi>wilful</hi> ſpight, and againſt the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60705:137"/>
ſtrongeſt Convictions thus bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme
the Holy and Eternal
Spirit, by the oeconomy of
whoſe Almighty Power theſe
things were done; and thus
endeavour to ſubvert the <hi>whole</hi>
ſtructure of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and wilfully diſown
<hi>Christ</hi> the Saviour. Theſe have
no other means of ſalvation
left them: no other Name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heaven, by which they can
be ſaved. There is no other
<hi>Christ,</hi> no other Goſpel: And
therefore nothing ſhall be the
portion of ſuch Men, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

               <p>From all which it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:60705:138"/>
And not every Blaſphemy
againſt the Holy-Ghoſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Not every one that
ſpeaketh againſt the Holy-Ghoſt
(as ſome Hereticks have
done, and now do) is guilty of
this unpardonable ſin: which
is a Blaſphemy againſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
glorious operations; the
immediate effects and office
of the Holy-Ghoſt; and ſuch
too as is utter'd not out of
<hi>Fear, Infirmity,</hi> or <hi>Cowardize;</hi>
but out of an <hi>hateful</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious</hi>
Heart; not of <hi>raſhneſs,</hi>
but of <hi>ſet-purpoſe,</hi> to do <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight</hi>
unto <hi>Christ</hi> his known
Doctrine and Works: being
accompany'd with an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<hi>defection,</hi> or falling away
from the whole truth of <hi>God.</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:60705:138"/>
So that (if this ſin in its forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
could be committed now)
from this ſhort explanation of
the nature of it, I hope it doth
appear, that none of theſe who
are ſcar'd, and terrify'd with
the apprehenſions of it, <hi>can</hi>
have committed it. And that
therefore their fears, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Thoughts about it, are
<hi>groundleſs</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable;</hi>
and ſtirred up by the common
Enemy of our peace, in order
to diſquiet and hinder them
from doing their Duty, or to
bring them into <hi>Melancholy,</hi> or
<hi>Deſpair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis moſt certain, that all
Perſons that wilfully run on
in ſin, and <hi>perſist</hi> in impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
ſhall finally periſh for
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60705:139"/>
ever, as ſurely as if they had
committed the <hi>the great Sin</hi>
we are ſpeaking of. But 'tis
alſo certain that thouſands do
out of ignorance, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
miſtake the nature of
this unpardonable Sin, and are
horribly afraid that they have
committed it, tho' they know
not what it is. The <hi>vilest</hi>
action, the <hi>greatest</hi> ſin of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
that can be committed,
doth not extend to the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Holy-Ghoſt. And
therefore ſuch a ſin calls indeed
for the deepeſt ſorrow, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
and moſt unfeign'd
repentance: But the ſin againſt
the Holy-Ghoſt, and <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
are things very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistent.
And this ariſeth not
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60705:139"/>
from any defect of Mercy in
God, or want of Merit in the
Blood of <hi>Christ;</hi> but from
an incapacity in the Offender.
Upon the whole then you ſee
what this <hi>Concluding</hi> ſin is; and
conſequently how little reaſon
many poor dejected Souls
have to be affrighted, with the
thoughts of having committed
it; and to ſink, and deſpond
upon mere <hi>Doubts, Conjectures</hi>
and <hi>Suſpicions.</hi>

               <p>NO Man can be a good

The which I have in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding

to lay before you. And we may

There is unqueſtionably

By which the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency

all other Arts and Sciences,

                  <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſoars above all the

It is not its buſineſs to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

'Tis not be ſeen of Men, or
to inherit this <hi>Bubble.</hi> 'Tis
not only to appear <hi>outwardly</hi>

it's only Deſign and Intention

FOR A
Melancholy Perſon.</head>
            <p>O Eternal, moſt gracious,
&amp; moſt holy Lord God!
Thou Father of Lights, and
Fountain of Good! Thou art
infinitely and eſſentially happy
and bleſſed in thy ſelf, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeſt
the beams of thy Favour
and Goodneſs throughout the
whole World. I am a <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of thy Mercy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance:
and when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what I have been, and
done, I cannot but <hi>wonder</hi> at
<pb facs="tcp:60705:144"/>
thy loving Kindneſs! O Lord,
I lye proſtrate at the Throne
of Grace in an humble ſence
and acknowledgment of my
own vileneſs, and in a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
confeſſion of my Sins,
which have been <hi>exceeding</hi>
many, and grievouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking.
I have deſerved <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
puniſhment and <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi>
and therefore do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
at my preſent Affliction.
<hi>Why ſhould a living man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
a Man for the puniſhment
of his ſin?</hi> But, O Lord!
thou art our <hi>FATHER,</hi>
and to whom ſhould we lay
open our wants, but to a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Look therefore upon my
affliction and miſery, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
me all my ſins.—Thy
<pb facs="tcp:60705:144"/>
hand is heavy upon me day and
night, and my moiſture is like
the drought in ſummer.—My
heart alſo in the midst of my
Body is even like melting wax.</hi>
I am caſt down, O Lord! I
am beſet with fears and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours;
encompaſſed about
with thick clouds of ſadneſs!
—<hi>But yet I hope to ſee the
goodneſs of the Lord in the land
of the living.</hi>—Lord, ſanctify
this great affliction to me!
And let not any of the <hi>Devil</hi>'s
temptations prevail with me,
to let go my hope in <hi>Christ.</hi>
Grant me, I beſeech thee, truſt
and affiance in thy Mercy;
and let me not make <hi>Sin</hi> my
refuge, or ſeek comfort and
redreſs from any <hi>indirect</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60705:145"/>
means: But patiently wait on
thee, O <hi>GOD,</hi> who alone
<hi>bringest down, and raiſest up,
who killest, and makest alive.</hi> O
Lord, be pleas'd to pardon,
and forgive me all my ſins;
and to heal all my <hi>Bodily</hi>
weakneſſes and infirmities, and
to quiet and compoſe my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
O Lord, ſpeak peace unto
me thy ſervant; give thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
the Bleſſing of peace.
—<hi>Thou ſearchest me out, and
knowest me: Thou underſtandest
my thoughts long before. Thou art
about my path, and about my bed;</hi>
and ſeeſt in what ſadneſs I paſs
the day and the night. O Lord,
ſend down the Holy-ghoſt the
<hi>Comforter,</hi> to enlighten and
comfort my poor Soul, and
<pb facs="tcp:60705:145"/>
to ſanctify and hallow all the
faculties and powers thereof.
Cleanſe it of all <hi>prophane, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
revengeful, wandring</hi> or
<hi>deſponding</hi> Thoughts, and all
<hi>other</hi> evil Imaginations; and
let not my Heart be inclined
to any evil thine. Vouchſafe,
I beſeech thee, O Lord, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
ſanctify and govern both
my Heart and Body in the
ways of thy Laws, and in the
Works of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that among all the
changes and chances of this
mortal Life, I may ever be
defended by thy moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and ready help. And,
O Lord God Almighty, unto
whom all Hearts be open, all
deſires known, and from
<pb facs="tcp:60705:146"/>
whom no ſecrets are hid,
cleanſe the Thoughts of my
Heart, by the Inſpiration of
the Holy Spirit, that I may
perfectly love thee, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
magnify thy holy Name.
Thou ſeeſt, O Lord, that I
have no power of my ſelf to
help my ſelf keep me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both outwardly in my
body, and inwardly in my
Soul; that I may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
from all adverſities,
which may happen to the
Body, and from all <hi>Evil
Thoughts,</hi> which may aſſault
and hurt the Soul: And at
laſt bring me to that bleſſed
ſtate, where I ſhall ſerve, love,
and worſhip thee without
fear or diſtraction; and be
<pb facs="tcp:60705:146"/>
out of the reach of all my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Enemies, and enjoy
