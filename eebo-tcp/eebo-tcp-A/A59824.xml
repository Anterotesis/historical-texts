            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN your last you seem much concern'd about the <hi>French</hi> Invasion, and desirous to know what I think may probably be expected from the Late King, should he prove so successful, as to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Throne; and what <hi>English</hi> Subjects are bound in Conscience to do, should he Land in <hi>England</hi> and demand his Right.</p>
            <p>The last is a material Question, but I wonder how you came to ask the First, as if it could be any Question what the Late King will do, if he were restor'd by Power to his Crown; For I think it past all doubt, that he will do as he did before, only in all probability a great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105558:3"/>
deal worse: And you remember how that was; for <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> are of too great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have left too frightful an impression behind them, to be so soon forgot; and this will go a great way towards an answer to your <hi>second</hi> Question, unless you think we are bound to take King <hi>James,</hi> and a <hi>French Government,</hi> and a <hi>French Popery</hi> with him; which I shall not easily be perswaded to; and, I believe, there are not many <hi>English Protestants</hi> will.</p>
            <p>But to Answer your Questio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s distinctly. As to the <hi>First,</hi> When we see what the late King <hi>Iames</hi> has done, what reason have we to expect, that should he return with Power, he would ever do otherwise? Is he more oblig'd now by his Protestant Subjects, than he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Can he make fairer Promises, than he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Is he less Zealous for Popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or grown more out of Conceit with Arbitra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he be less able to make himself Arbitrary, and set up Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery when he returns a Conquerour? For I take it for granted he must conquer first, because King <hi>William</hi> won't abdicate nor steal away, and the Power that Conquers, will give Laws and Religion to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd.</p>
            <p>I know there are two Things pretended, as a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for better hopes. <hi>First,</hi> That the late King is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow sensible that the <hi>English</hi> Nation will never bear <hi>Popery,</hi> nor <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and that he has suffered so much by these Attempts already, that he will never venture the like again. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The great Merits of the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing</hi> Clergy and Gentry, which will atone for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and make him their sure and fast Friend, Patron and Defender, especially if those who have been too forward in complying with the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105558:3"/>
shall expiate that Crime by an early Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a vigorous Assistance to restore him to his Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As for the <hi>first,</hi> there are too many Answers to be given to it, to hinder it from being the least probable ground of Hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though Hope it self is, <hi>Res incertae nomen,</hi> so very uncertain, especially when we guess only at the Inclinations of Princes, that <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> are not to be ventured on it, against former Experience.</p>
            <p>But to let that pass, pray consider what the true Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Argument is; for it amounts to this, that all Men will learn by Experience; that Men will not venture on those things a second time, which have proved fatal to them once; that Princes will certainly for ever after dislike such Counsels and Measures, as have already shaken their Thrones, and made their Crowns fall from their Heads.</p>
            <p>Now we may Flatter our selves with such Hopes as these, which may upon some account be called reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Hopes, because there is great Reason it should be so; but yet they so often fail, that there is no Reason to rely upon them. The Repentance of dying Sinners and of undone Prodigals, who return to their old Sins again, if they recover their Health, or find new Treasures to waste, confutes such Expectations. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings rarely cure a vehement Love and fond Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for any thing, which is the Case of old habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sinners; and no Man can be fonder of any Vice, than some Princes are of Unlimited and Arbitrary Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105558:4"/>And wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n this is join'd with a resolved and inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Temper, which scorns to yield, and had rather be undone a Thousand Times, than own, retract, or amend a Fault: Such M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sfortunes do but whet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and make them swell as a River does when its Current is stopp'd, which flows with a more rapid and foaming Stream, when it has once forced its way.</p>
            <p>Especially when Superstition is the prevailing Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, which fires the Spirits, and raises imaginary Scenes of Glory out of the Loss of Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: And what will such a Prince, if he ever recover his Throne and Power, forfei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Glory of losing his Kingdoms again, by deserting t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Cause for which he lost them before? No Man can certainly tell, how Superstition will Act, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> how it will Reason: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Consciences of Princes are under such Directors, as will venture their Crowns for them over and over, to carry on their own Designs, and know how to Expound Providence to Flatter Superstition. And then the Recovery of his Thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e may be made a better Argument, and a stronger Obligation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and prosecute his old Designs, than the fear of losing it again can be to make him desist.</p>
            <p>And to make this yet more demonstrative, with reference to the Late King, we ought to consider, That this is not the first Tryal he has had, and that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration has done him no good.</p>
            <p>He saw before what his Father King <hi>Charles</hi> the First suffered, only for some Attempts towards Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, and for meer Jealousies and Suspicions of his favouring Popery: He lost his Kngdoms and his Life, and his Sons suffered a long and hard Exile.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105558:4"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Second indeed took warning by this, and though possibly he might be big with the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, yet would he not venture too far, nor disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himself too openly, for fear of <hi>Travelling</hi> again, as he used to speak: But King <hi>James</hi> had not Patience to conceal his Inclinations, till he came to the Crown; and that had like to have cost him his Crown, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had it; and yet this was not sufficient to caution him against those violent Methods he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards used to advance Popery, which were so seasonably defeated by the happy arrival of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Sovereign,</hi> whom God long preserve: And those who are so desirous to try him again in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> as they have lately done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to their full Satisfaction, if they could try only for themselves, should have my free Consent to make the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Have not the poor <hi>Irish</hi> Protestants made it to their Cost, even since this very Revolution, from whence, and from the Wisdom he must needs have Learned by it, this miraculous Change in Him is now expected? And did they find any such Change in him, unless for the worse? And yet, if ever, then he was upon his good Behaviour, when he wanted their Assistance to secure his Possession of that Kingdom, and to Recover his other Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. And when, in Reason, it might have been expected, that, whatever Resentments he had, he would have thought it his Interest to have treated <hi>Protestants</hi> with greater Tenderness and Respects. But if the Necessity of his own Affairs could not obtain this from him, what must <hi>Protestants</hi> expect,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105558:5"/>
if he return with Power? And though some <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> seem not to be at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this Experiment, yet it hath made such an impression upon the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that they are for ever cured of their Fondness, and have not the least Curiosity left to make any further Tryals.</p>
            <p>It is pretended indeed, in Excuse of this, that he was then under the Government of <hi>French</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Counsels, and under the Power of <hi>Irish</hi> Priests and Papists, and so was not at Liberty to follow his own Inclinations: I should be very glad of a good Argument to prove, that he had better Inclinations. But however, what Comfort is this to <hi>Protestants,</hi> that he has better Inclinations, but is not his own Master? For if he must never shew any Kindness to <hi>Protestants,</hi> it is no matter what his Inclinations are: And can any Man imagine, That if the <hi>French</hi> King by Force and Power place him on the Throne, he will be less under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he was in <hi>Ireland</hi>? The <hi>French</hi> King, among many other wise <hi>Maxims,</hi> has this, I am sure, for one, Never to make a King, without making him his own Vassal; and the Power that can make a King, can make him his Slave: So that it is to no purpose to enquire what King <hi>James</hi> will do, but what King <hi>Lewis</hi> will do, if King <hi>James</hi> returns?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the great Merits of the <hi>Nonswear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> I greatly suspect, that neither the Late King <hi>James</hi> nor King <hi>Lewis</hi> will think them so great as they themselves do. Their Merit must
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105558:5"/>
consist either in their Principles, or in their Practices. And we will briefly consider both.</p>
            <p>Their meritorious Principle is this, That the Rights of Princes, especially of Hereditary Princes, to their Thrones, are so Sacred and Inviolable, that as they cannot forfeit them to their own Subjects by any Male-administration, so neither can they by any Provocations, or by any success of War, forfeit them to any other Princes: That while such a Prince, or any Legal Heir is living, no other Prince can have any Right to his Throne, nor must his Subjects own and submit to any other Prince, as their Soveraign Lord.</p>
            <p>Now as much as this Principle seems to Flatter Princes, and to make their Thrones Eternal, I am apt to suspect, that no Prince, who considers the just Consequence of Things, can think it so very meritorious; for it is a very dangerous Principle to Weak and Unfortunate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rinces, and an intolerable Restraint upon the Aspiring and Ambitious. It is Dangerous to the Unfortunate, because it lays a Necessity upon the Conquerour to take away his Life, if he can, as well as his Throne, since he cannot lose his Throne, without losing his Life, though most Princes would rather chuse to have them parted, than lose both together; And how do they think King <hi>Lewis</hi> will like this Principle, which stands in the way of his Glory, and preaches Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to him of all those Dominions, whose legal Heirs are living; which teaches the Subjects of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes to deny him Fealty and Obedience, and to Conspire with their Legal Princes against him.

I doubt not but he likes the Principle as little as he would like the Practice, and that our <hi>Nonswearers</hi> would quickly understand, were they the Subjects of his New Conquests, which God grant <hi>England</hi> may never be.</p>
            <p>Indeed, how great a Complement soever this Principle may be thought to Princes, it can have no Merit, because, though it may in some junctures do them hurt, it never did, and never can do them any service. It never yet hindred a Revolution, and never can make one; and the Reason is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no Princes, and very few Subjects, do believe it, and practice upon it. If a Prince have a just Cause of War against another Prince, he makes no Scruple, if he Conquers, to take his Crown; and the Subjects of such a conquered Prince make no Scruple of Conscience to submit to the Conquerour; though sometimes a personal Kindness for a Just and Indulgent Prince, and a Concernment for their own Liberties and Fortunes, may make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie under it, and glad of the first Opportunity to do themselves and their Prince Right.</p>
            <p>The Truth, is Princes have no Reason to like this Principle; for, were it true, they could have no Remedies against the Injuries of Neighbour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; they might indeed Fight and Conquer, but they had better let it alone, if they must not take the Throne, which their Sword has won; for it is only the Fear of Conquest, and losing their Crowns, when they are Conquered, that can keep Princes in Awe, and bring them to Just and Equal Terms; and if no Prince must lose his Crown, because no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105558:6"/>
Prince must take it, it will be impossible to beat an Injurious and Obstinate Prince into good Terms; and, I believe, Princes will as soon be perswaded, That it is Unlawful to make War, as that it is Unlawful to seize a conquered Crown, and will think one as meritorious a Principle as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And it is certain, Subjects have less Reason to like this Principle, because it makes them Slaves and Sacrifices even to the Misfortunes of their Prince. A Prince, when he is Conquer'd, or sees that he must be Conquer'd, may escape by Flight, but a whole Nation cannot run away; and if they could, have no Reason to leave their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and their Fortunes behind them: And yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Principle, they must not submit nor swear Allegiance to the Conquerour, while the Prince who has forsaken them lives, though they cannot Secure their Lives and Fortunes without it. But Nature and Common Sense is too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Sophistry of such Principles, and those who cannot Reason, can feel what they are to do in such Cases. The Loyalest Subjects, when no personal Obligations, or secret Interests determine them otherwise, will save themselves by Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, when they cannot defend their Prince by their Arms; and do not think they do ill in it: And I suppose Princes do not think so neither, because they expect the same from the Subjects of other Princes in the like Circumstances; and such an Universal Consent both of Princes and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105558:7"/>
when there is no Law of God or Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, makes it a standing Law in all Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which both Princes and Subjects must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to. So that this Principle, were it never so true, can do no Service, and therefore can have no Merit in this World, because there are so few that believe it; that they are not hands enough either to keep a Prince on his Throne, or to restore him to it. All our <hi>Nonswearers</hi> could not hinder the late Revolution, nor can they make another: They are enow to make a noise, especially if the Loud and Zealous Ladies of that Side be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; but other Hands and other Pretences must do their Work, if ever they hope to see it done; and then no thanks to their Principles for it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Reward their future Services may deserve, Princes themselves will not think that their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples deserve any.</p>
            <p>Let us then now consider the Merit of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and what Opinion the <hi>Late King</hi> is like to have of that, if he should return.</p>
            <p>I suppose, they will be contented he should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their Merits towards him, while he was on the Throne; especially about reading his Declaration; as likewise their <hi>Tower</hi> and their <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall Merits; which were indeed very great, and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and would have had a better Reward from a better Hand, had they not rendered themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of it. But sure they don't expect the <hi>Late King</hi> should Reward them for such Services. He knew that this raised that general discontent, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105558:7"/>
occasioned that General Revolt, which cost him Three Crowns. And if all their Merits can Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate this Guilt, they come off well; and those had need be very Extraordinary Merits, which have first so great a Guilt to Expiate, before they can pretend to Merit. Could their Nonswearing restore him to his Throne again, it would but just undo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> what they had done, which is no more than their Duty, and therefore cannot merit, no, not so much as a Pardon, though it may make them capable of it, if they fall into merciful Hands. But still there are Four Years Exile, and the loss of Three Crowns, and the Expence of so much Blood and Treasure; the Dishonour of so many Defeats, and the Ruine of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be accounted for; and how can they make Restitution for all this? Which yet they must do before they can lay Claim to Merit.</p>
            <p>Let all this then be forgot, for it is their Interest it should; but they are very sanguine Men, if they hope it will. Whence then will they date their Merits?</p>
            <p>When it was certainly known, that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> now our Gracious Soveraign, was ready to Land, they seemed as well pleased with it as other Men; and refused, when they were pressed to it by the <hi>Late King,</hi> to declare their Abhorrence of it; but, instead of that, took upon them to give him Advice, and to publish it when they had done: In which Advice they recommended almost every Particular of the Prince's <hi>Declaration,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105558:8"/>
of the same Abuses, and advised the Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Parliament to redress them; as if the Prince's Declaration, and their Advise had been drawn by the same Pen, and the <hi>Advice</hi> had been published on purpose to second the <hi>Declaration.</hi> This, I suppose, they will not reckon among their Merits neither: And if they can excuse what was so hastily done at <hi>Guildhall,</hi> before the <hi>Late King</hi> was gone out of the Land, they may very well be contented no more should be said of that.</p>
            <p>The only Merit then they have to pretend, is their Refusing the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> and forfeiting their <hi>Ecclesiastical, Civil,</hi> or <hi>Military</hi> Preferments for it: But what is this to the <hi>Late King?</hi> Is this done out of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him or his Government? Would they not have been contented to have lived Peaceably and Quietly, as they themselves professed, could they have kept their Preferments, and have been excu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed from the <hi>New Oaths?</hi> And how do they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of him, by refusing the Oaths with the Loss of their Preferments, if they did it not for his sake, but for another and better Reason, for fear of being Damned? God may Reward this, but <hi>King James</hi> is not beholden to them. Will they be better Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects hereafter? Will they read his <hi>Declaration,</hi> when he Returns? Will they make his Will their Law? Will they submit to his next <hi>Ecclesiastical Commission,</hi> and give up their Colledges and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuits?</hi> Will they be content to take him the very same Man that he went away,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105558:8"/>
and to <hi>serve him in his own way</hi>? Will they no more fill the Nation with the noise and fears of Popery and Arbitrary Power? Will they turn <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> themselves, or stand by patiently, and give leave to his Priests to pervert <hi>Protestants</hi> as fast as they can? Will they promise to demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with more respect towards the King's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to leave off their old fawciness of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Preaching against Popery? This indeed would bid fair for Merit, but if they oppose his Methods of Government, and his Glorious Designs, as much as they do King <hi>William</hi>'s Right; if it be only a Title they boggle at, if this be all that makes them uneasie at the Change, their not Swearing does him no Service; He could have kept his Kingdoms upon these terms before, but he scorned it, and so he will those, who to salve their Consciences or their Honours, and to recover their Preferments, would have him upon these terms again.</p>
            <p>As much as some Men glory in their steddiness to Principles, which is certainly a very Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, and an excellent degree of Virtue, when the Principles are plain and certain, yet few Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (to be sure, not the late King) like such a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to Principles, as opposes their Designs; a stubborn, inflexible Conscience, is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly thing, and Kings do not like such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as dare oppose a King upon the Throne, whatever the Cause be. So that I suspect, their very Boldness and Resolution in opposing their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105558:9"/>
present <hi>Majesties</hi> upon a meer point of Law, will be thought no Virtue fit to be rewarded by a Prince; who would make his Will Superiour to all Laws.</p>
            <p>And if the Merit of the <hi>Non-Swearers</hi> is likely to vanish into nothing, especially when there is no occasion any longer to court and flatter them, and <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi> have free liberty to comment on their Merits; what Merit will those Men have to plead, who were forward and zealous in the Revolution, have Sworn Allegiance to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesties, have served them in their Armies and Navies, at home and abroad? There is no doubt, but they shall have fair Promises and good words at present, and shall be remembred hereafter, when there is occasion.</p>
            <p>But suppose the Merits of the <hi>Non Swearing</hi> or <hi>For-Swearing</hi> Clergy and Laiety, who will help forwards another Revolution, should be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be very great; what probability is there, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> should fare ever the better for it, when Popery and Arbitrary Power stand in the way? past Experience gives no great Encouragement to hope this. King <hi>Lewis</hi> was as much obliged to his Protestant Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> as it is possible for any King to be; for they set the Crown upon his Head; and how he has reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, all the world rings of it. The <hi>late King</hi> was not much less beholden to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when they so vigorously opposed the <hi>Bill</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:105558:9"/>
of <hi>Exclusion</hi>; and how he also rewarded them, we all lately saw and felt. And shall <hi>Protestants</hi> after this, think of obliging such <hi>Princes</hi> by their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? They understand better, that Merit is no <hi>Protestant</hi> Doctrine, and that there can be none out of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And why should any body expect that which cannot be. Nay, should the <hi>late King</hi> return again, and be as much at the Devotion of his <hi>Nonswearing</hi> Friends, as they promise themselves he will be; I very much doubt what the Church of <hi>England</hi> will gain by this. If we may guess at the Spirit of the Party by the bitter Zeal, which inspires all their <hi>Writings,</hi> I can expect nothing from them, but as fierce a Persecution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as ever it suffered from <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> excepting <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> Fires, which possibly may be exchanged for <hi>Tyburn.</hi> All who live in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as now Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, are in their account and constant Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, no better than <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and <hi>Perjured Apostates,</hi> much greater Crimes than the <hi>Traditores</hi> were guilty of, which was the only pretence for the <hi>Donatist</hi> Schism and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. They seem to comfort themselves under their present Sufferings, more with the sweet hopes of Revenge, than any great expectations of future Rewards; that they shall live to see the <hi>Swearing Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests, the contempt of Princes and People</hi>;<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Apol. for the new Seperat.</hi>
               </note> for if the A. B. of <hi>York,</hi> who is particularly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105558:10"/>
cannot escape them, I doubt they will make but very few exceptions. And is not this a great encouragement to any who have complyed with the present Government, to help these Men to Power again? Must not the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> expect their share of Vengeance, as well as the <hi>Clergie?</hi> And is not the Church of <hi>England</hi> then in a hopeful state, which must be purged and reformed into <hi>Jacobite Principles,</hi> and by a <hi>Jacobite</hi> Spirit?</p>
            <p>These are all very sensible Proofs (as far as we can reason about such matters) how little good is to be expected from the return of the <hi>late King</hi> with a <hi>French Power</hi>: He must return the same Man he went, and then <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> must return with him; nay, he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn much worse than he went, because he must return more a <hi>Vassal</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> which I suppose will not mend the Condition of <hi>English</hi> Subjects, during his Reign.</p>
            <p>These things ought to be well considered; for if his Government was so uneasie before, and gave us such a frightful prospect, as made the Nation very willing to part with him, when he thought fit to leave them; it would seem very strange to by-standers, should they now grow fond of his return, when it is certain if he does return, and returns by the Methods now intended, <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> must be more Triumphant then ever.</p>

            <p>But how heavy soever Taxes are, are they like a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War? Like the dread and terrors of an Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or of our own? Are they like having our Houses filled with Soldiers; or which is worse, burnt or plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? Are they like losing our Friends, our Fathers, Husbands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Children; by whose kindness or labours we subsisted? In a word, Are they like the Spoyls of Harvest, or the Desolation of a whole Countrey?</p>
            <p>And can we be contented to see <hi>England</hi> again the Seat of War? It is certain in our present circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it cannot be made so, unless we our selves please: <hi>France</hi> has too many Enemies, to think of Conquering <hi>England</hi> without factions at home; and were it not for them, we need not fear its united Force; and I hope considering men, of what <hi>Perswasion</hi> soever they be,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105558:13"/>
will not think it worth the while to ruin their Countrey by a Civil War, to purchase a <hi>French Slavery</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>; two very dear things, could we purchase them never so cheap.</p>
            <p>What I have said hitherto, only concerns <hi>England</hi>; but it becomes us to look a little abroad, and consider, what a fatal Influence a <hi>French</hi> Conquest of <hi>England</hi> will have upon the Affairs of all <hi>Europe.</hi> That it is not mere Justice and Honour that makes the <hi>French King</hi> espouse the Cause of the late King <hi>James,</hi> his Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Usurpations on his Neighbours, will witness. He has no scruples of Conscience about the Rights of other Princes; all he can get is his own. But <hi>England</hi> was formerly a Friend and Confederate, at least, not an Enemy; and now the Power of <hi>England,</hi> (which the <hi>French</hi> have never had reason to despise) is in the hands of a King who owes the <hi>French King</hi> a good turn, and will not, I hope, dye in his debt. This checks his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous designs; gives life and spirit to the Confederacy; threatens to make him restore what he has taken, and what he keeps by meer force and violence, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him within his Ancient Bounds, and to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Consti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This makes the <hi>French King</hi> so concerned to restore the late King <hi>James</hi> to the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> to get rid of a Formidable Enemy, and to strengthen himself with the Alliance of a Powerful Friend; for <hi>England</hi> will probably turn the scales, on which side soever it happens to be: And there is no doubt, but the Arms of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105558:13"/>
               <hi>England</hi> must be devoted to the service of <hi>France,</hi> if a <hi>French</hi> Power should place the <hi>late King</hi> in his Throne again; and let any <hi>English Protestant</hi> who can think coolly of things, consider what a malignant aspect this would h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs,</hi> but endeavours to find some new work for them at home. And if he can but send them home again, and embroil us in a Civil War, that is one great point gained; but if he proves successful in his Attempt, he makes <hi>England</hi> his own, and will turn their Arms upon the Confederates; and what can then stand in his way? What should hinder him from being the sole and absolute <hi>Monarch</hi> of the <hi>West</hi>? And then it is easie to read the Fate of <hi>Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have freely told you, what I apprehend will be the necessary and unavoidable effects of a <hi>French</hi> Conquest. I pretend not to prophesie, nor to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration in such cases; but what I have said, has all the appearances of probabi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity, all the degrees of moral certainty th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t any thing of this nature can have; and that is the only Rule in these matters by which wise men are to judge and act.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:105558:14"/>And this has prepared a plain and easie Answer to your <hi>Second</hi> Question, What <hi>English</hi> Subjects are bound in Conscience to do, in case the <hi>late</hi> King should land in <hi>England</hi> with <hi>French</hi> Forces to demand his Crown.</p>
            <p>Now there are two sorts of persons concerned in this question: 1. Those who have not sworn Allegiance to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> but account the late King <hi>James</hi> as much their King, as he was when he sat upon the Throne; and that their obligations to him are the same now that ever they were. 2. Those who have sworn Allegiance to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> And there are two parts of this Question; 1. Whether they are bound in conscience to assist the late King if he return? 2. Whether it be lawful for them to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him, and fight against him?</p>
            <p>As for the first part of this Question, and as far as it concerns the <hi>Non-swearers,</hi> I shall ask them two or three Questions, and leave them to answer them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>first</hi> question is, Whether they can think themselves bound in conscience, upon any pretence whatever, to fight for <hi>Popery</hi> against the <hi>Protestant</hi> Faith and Worship; that is, (as they must confess, if they are Protestants) to fight for Heresie and Idolatry against the true Faith and Worship of Christ; or to fight for <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and against Christ? Can any consideration make this lawful? If nothing can (as I will venture to take it for granted, that nothing can) then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever duty they may fancy they still owe to their <hi>Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prince,</hi> it cannot be their Duty to fight for him, when they cannot fight for him, without fighting against Christ and his Religion; though they must not fight against their Prince for <hi>Christ,</hi> because <hi>Christ</hi> in such
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105558:14"/>
cases requires his Disciples to suffer, not to fight for him; yet it does not follow, that they must fight for their Prince against <hi>Christ,</hi> to bring a Persecution upon his faithful Disciples, and to contribute what they can to extirpate the Name and the Religion of <hi>Protestan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Do they think themselves bound in Conscience to fight for their Prince, against the Laws and Libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Have the Free born Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> no Natural, no Legal Rights?

               <hi>England,</hi> than the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> has to be <hi>England</hi>?</p>
            <p>Is it not an unaccountable tenderness and scrupulosity of Conscience, to be so concerned for any one Prince's Right, as to sacrifice the Rights and Liberties of all the Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> to his? To set him upon the Throne, to drive all other Princes from theirs? We are Citizens of the World, as well as Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and have our Obligations to Mankind, and to other Princes, as well as to our own; and though our obligation to no one other Prince is so great, as to our own, yet the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck good of mankind, or of a great part of the world, is a more sacred obligation, than the particular Interest of our own Prince or Countrey; much less then can the Right of any particular Prince, be it what it will, stand in competition with the Rights and Liberties of our own <hi>Countrey,</hi> and of all <hi>Europe</hi> besides.</p>
            <p>It is to no more purpose to dispute with men who do not feel the Force of this Argument at the first hearing, than to reason with blind men about Colours; they have no sense left, nothing but a stupid and slavish Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; all things, tho never so sacred, must give place to this; the care of Religion, the love of their Countrey, their Justice and Charity to all mankind, must vail to their senseless mistake of the true meaning of this word <hi>Loyalty</hi>; by which they will needs understand an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Obedience, without Limitation or Rese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ve; when most certainly, it signifies no more than Obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would ask them, What they would think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound to do in such cases, were the <hi>late King</hi> upon the Throne again? Unless they have chang'd their minds (and then they are not so steady to Principles, as they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105558:15"/>
pretend to be) we may very reasonably guess, what they would do, by what they did while he was upon the Throne. It is certain they so much dislik'd his open designs of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power, that they opposed him as far as they dur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, and would not Fight for him to keep him on the Throne; nay, by their Examples and Counsels, they had so influenced the Army, that they would not Fight for him neither; and so possess'd the Country, that the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> took Arms, and declared for the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> which they thought they might very well do, when the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> would not declare against him. This was then thought consistent enough with the <hi>High-Tory-Loyalty</hi>; and yet if they were not then bound to Fight for him to keep him on his Throne, I am at a great loss to know, how it comes to be their duty now to Fight for him to restore him to it: He was certainly their King then, and yet they would not Fight for him, no not to defend his Person, Crown and Dignity. And tho they call him <hi>their King</hi> still, it is certain he is not <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whatever right they may think he has to be so; and therefore to fight for him now, is not to fight for the King, but to fight to make him King again. But to let that pass, suppose him to be their King, since they will have him so, How do they come to be more obliged to fight for him now he is out of the Throne, than they were to fight for him while he was in it? If they think it their duty to fight for their King against the Religion the Laws, and the Liberties of their Countrey, it was their duty to have fought for him then; if they do not think this, it cannot be their duty to fight for him now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:105558:16"/>But they did not expect what followed; they desired to have their Laws and Liberties secured, but not that he should lose his Crown: I believe very few did then expect what followed, no more than they do now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what will follow: But since he would leave his Crown, Who could help it? For no body took it from him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let me then ask them another question; Whether they would think themselves bound in Conscience to fight for him, did they verily believe, that if he recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Throne, he would as zealously promote <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power, as he did before? If they say they would not, they have been at their <hi>non putaram</hi> once already; a second oversight in the same kind, would be worse than the first. If they say they would, I give them over, as profess'd Enemies to the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Liberties of Mankind.</p>
            <p>This I hope may satisfie the <hi>non-swearers,</hi> if they will coolly and seriously consider it, that they are not bound in Conscience to fight for the <hi>late King</hi>; nay, that they are as much bound in Conscience not to fight for him, as they are bound not to fight against the <hi>Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and Civil Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. As for those who have Sworn Allegiance to <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary</hi>; besides all the former consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, they are under the obligations of an Oath, not to fight against their present <hi>Majesties,</hi> whose Sworn Subjects and <hi>Leigemen</hi> they are. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or let them expound <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>True Allegiance,</hi> to as low a sense as possibly they can, the least that they ever could make of it, s to live <hi>quietly and peaceably</hi> under their Government; not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing against their Persons, or Crowns, not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105558:16"/>
to hold any Correspondence with, nor to give any Assistance to their Enemies; and therefore to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a <hi>French Invasion,</hi> or to assist the <hi>late King</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Throne, which Their Majesties so well fill, and which they have Sworn not to dispossess them of, must be downright Perjury. If they be sure that their Oaths to the <hi>late King</hi> still oblige them, that indeed would make void the obligation of this Second Oath; but then they must be guilty of Perjury in taking it, and by the breaking of it will declare to all the world, that they deliberately, and wilfully Perjured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when they took it; and let them remember this, when they take Arms against Their Majesties, and let them expect that recompence which they deserve.</p>
            <p>Those who took this, only as a Temporary Oath, which obliged them no longer than till the <hi>late King</hi> should return into <hi>England</hi> again to demand his Crown, are guilty of Perjury, if they keep it no longer than till they have a promising opportunity to break it: For this is to mock God, and to deceive the Government by their Oaths: For no man can think that the meaning of the Oath was no more but this, <hi>I do Promise and Swear to bear Faith and true Allegiance to King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>till I have Power and Opportunity by the return of King</hi> James <hi>with a</hi> French <hi>Army, to join his Forces, and to Assist him to recover his Throne.</hi> Those who will take and keep Oaths at this rate, we must leave to God: But nothing is more plain and certain, than that the New Oath of Allegiance obliges all, who have taken it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of Perjury, at least not to fight for the <hi>late King</hi> against <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I may very fairly conclude, without entring into a longer dispute about the lawfulness of fighting
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105558:17"/>
against a <hi>Foreign</hi> Army, though the <hi>late King</hi> were at the Head of it; for were those, who scruple this, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that they ought not to fight for him, their present <hi>Majesties</hi> have <hi>Friends</hi> enow, who are very well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to fight against him; especially bringing along with him the greatest Enemies both to the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and to the <hi>Civil Liberties,</hi> not only of the <hi>English</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Europe, France</hi> it self not excepted.</p>
            <p>However, this Letter is large enough already, and if I find you desire farther satisfaction in this matter, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration, which is lately come to my hands, you may expect a speedy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it in a Second Letter from</p>
