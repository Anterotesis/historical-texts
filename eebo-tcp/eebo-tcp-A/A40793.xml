            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It may be treason to ask their wisdoms that;
But the huge Mountebank, the vulgar Rout

               <p>Good King: I could wish something, and

Nothing in his great Fathers Memory, to hold

to feel the merits of so brave a Father, and his own

that men may Court my patience, and discourse,
As now they shun it. And when black night
has stretcht her Gloomy limbs, and laid her head
upon some Mountain Top (bound up in foggy Mists)
then keep my haunts by some dull groaning stream
with screeching Owles, and Batts, there pay

You must not be angry my Power came short—
of my desires to serve you; We'l try some other way:
You see by what Engins the Times move;
The King refers all to his Council; and though
they do not tie his hands, they hold 'em by a strange
Courtesie: I'm but a single Looker on: Perhaps
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100668:6"/>
they may take notice of me for his Brother;
that's when they please too: But this
came neerest to me, upon the engagement of my honour
to deny my friend, and one whose single Faith
had been enough for all the Kingdomes safety,
the holding of such a Trifle as the Cittadel.</p>

I shall now collect my self against it, and know
My Lord, where my poor life and powers are
to be prostrate: Could I enlarge them to my wish

My greatest thirst of Fame is my expression

A friend whilst I have power to be one:
But I am scanted and weakned in my desires,

Loves knot to her <hi>De Flames:</hi> Though the
great distance of your shining Attributes both
of Blood and Virtue, consider'd in the poverty of mine,
would draw squint eyes, and Envie to my stars;
but speak your Name Creat as the example of your

of all Noble minds that shall but read your Love

Condescended unto me, who else had

Such strength brought your Deserts: But now
I hope, nay can be Confident (best Sir) they are
treasur'd in a Breast, whose Virtues will
preserve them with themselves.</p>

               <p>Tears are but shallow murmurs of our Grief.
I envy not his Grave a Tear, but owe all
Noble mention to't; yet Madam, I did hope
You had discharged the smart and Cruelty of Grief
from your soft breast: And would call your beauties
to their Natural springs:—
Look on your self (rare Lady) in this change
With what high Flame and Rapture it becomes you:
So breaks the Morning forth of a christal Cloud;
And so the Sun ascends his glittering Chair,
And from his burnisht Locks shakes day about;
The Summer puts not on more delights and various
Glory, than shines in bright <hi>Claudilla;</hi>
And shall the Grave exhaust their pride
and Youth?—</p>

Cast your thoughts upon the Man it Treats on,
the Circumstances, and progresse of my Love:
Nay, it may raise your Anger bigher than your wonder,
and work the modest pantings of your breast into a
Hectique Rage: I saw this tempest gather'd
in a Cloud dismal and black, ready to break
its wombe in stormes upon me: And I have cast
my Soul on every Frown and horror you can arm
your passion with: I have held conflict with the wilder
Guilt and tremblings of my blood to rescue it: But
Heaven, and my angry Fate, has thrown me groveling
at your feet: And I want soul to break the Charm.</p>

I look'd his temper wou'd a flam'd about my ears:
Not a sparkle in his brow, nor the least change of blood.

must expect that morn to rise upon your wishes,
When you lead her to the Altars; where the
faint Lights with blew and Gastly Flames, will
receive ye; And all the things of Holy Ceremony
Present pale Glim'rings to your eyes, to fright your Bride
back unto her first vows: And then, me thinks,
each Tear and Groan the Fair <hi>Cleara</hi> lends

If she held flatering glasses to her thoughts

a scruple from his demands, and yours, expect it,

to be a stranger to his worth: Sir I honour it:
Nor am I so proud and dark in my opinion,
to think I stand upon my self, but stoop in
honour to one of his deserts and blood: This is

his Titles down but for Cyphers.</p>

them in value to you: For, Madam, look on him
in the Spring of his deserts, and you'l say, Titles
are but narrow Spheres: And if honoured actions
be the soul and breath, he's then above them

I am in Flames, and Torment: And there's not so much
mercy under heaven, but your own, would let him use that
Tongue a minute longer. Thou hast seen this
Sword reeking from Hilt to Point, and sweating
showres of Blood o're thy head, whil'st I bestrid thy
life and Rescu'd it 'gainst many gallant Foes,
And durst thou tempt it to thine own throat now?
Prethee begone; And let's meet no more
There's something in thy youth I still can love;
and will forget to call thee to accompt for this;
be wise unto thy self; And ask this Lady
Pardon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sampayo.</speaker>
               <p>She has no blood: From her first, an honest
Trades-mans wife, who left her very rich and
handsome: The Duke (as he still keeps a
kennell for that purpose) had her presented
to him for his Game: Remov'd her from the
Cucko'os nest into another Sphere, but with all
Caution, and private slight: And you must
Imagine, now she spreads a larger wing
stirs not abroad, but studded like the Night,
with Flames: And at length becomes the Courts
discourse and wonder; but still kept the
Country her retiring place.</p>

other giddy hopes) that wou'd have seduc'd my Brother to that Act

Lady, and the Lady <hi>Cleara</hi> cold in their clodded gore: This
Collonel, so spent in expence of blood, as we co'd not say alive:
For that half spark of heat left in his veins, was then e'en going
out: our care having preserv'd and kindled it to life again after his
shatter'd Faculties could pant and breath, he cal'd for Pen and Ink,
and caus'd us write what there contain'd.</p>

               <p>I am betray'd and Lost—
Couldst be in love with that faint Life, for one
poor minutes smile, to betray it to ignominy and Law?
I cu'd trample on thy skull, untill thy reeking
brain sparkled about the dust: See how busily
they contract their Dusky brows? Consult things
safely, and let some reverend Statute be ordained, in
honour of all Cowards: <hi>De Castro?</hi> For this good
service know, 'twas I that laid thy fathers head
upon the block: Complotted with the <hi>Portuguez</hi>
to make him guilty to the King: And envying that
he spread with so much shadow in the state, by a Close
Faction rendred him odious to the people: An Engine
I knew cu'd not fail: I hurried thee to the Dutchesse
wanton bed, <hi>Dessandro;</hi> knowing <hi>De Flames</hi> high
blood, would quit the debt I owed thee—</p>
