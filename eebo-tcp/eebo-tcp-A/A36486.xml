            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is the deſign of this Treatiſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all the Arguments in Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s Caſe of Allegiance, that are drawn from Scripture and Reaſon; and that the ſtate of the Controverſie may be clearly underſtood, I begin with</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi>SECT. 1.</hi> The Caſe plainly and briefly ſtated.</head>
               <p>HEre he complains, firſt of <hi>the perplox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Controverſie by intermixing the diſpute of Right with the Duty of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> but is it not as much <hi>perplexed</hi> by Separating them? Is not this the great <hi>Controverſie</hi> between us, whether Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be due to thoſe who have no legal Right to it? And thus the Controverſie is perplexed becauſe it is a Controverſie.</p>
               <p>Then he tells us, it <hi>ſeems unfit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Right of Princes, a thing which no Government can permit to be a Queſtion;</hi> but it ſeems to me unfit that Religious Oaths ſhould be broken, and if Allegiance be due only to thoſe who have a Right, the diſpute of Right is unavoidable; and if no Government can permit it, that is no Obligation upon me to be Perjur'd.</p>
               <p>But ſuch diſputes will carry Men into <hi>the dark Labyrinths of Law and Hiſtory;</hi> and therefore the Doctor leads them into the inextricable <hi>Labyrinths</hi> of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Now I think that Law and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory are not ſuch dark, unintelligible, and uncertain <hi>Riddles</hi> as he makes them; they were not deſigned to maze and blunder our Underſtandings, but to rectifie and inform us about Fact and Right. If <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> cannot enlighten us in Matters of Fact, then the Ages that are paſt are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Darkneſs and Oblivion, and all Hiſtory, Sacred and Profane, is no better than Romance. If Law <hi>be a clear and ſafe Rule of Conſcience</hi> only to a <hi>very few,</hi> why is it publiſh'd, and enjoyn'd, and enforc'd by Penalties upon the many? It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the very nature of Law, to ſay it cannot <hi>be a clear and ſafe Rule</hi> of Obedience; and if Law and Hiſtory are clear in any thing, it is very probable they are clear in things Fundamental, and in Matters of greateſt Importance and moſt univerſal Concernment. I know there are great and intricate diſputes about our Conſtitution, and ſo there are about the moſt evident concluſions of Faith, Senſe, and Reaſon; but Doubts and Errors do not overthrow Truth and Certainty; and if ſome Men ſhut their Eyes at Noon-day, it is no good Conſequence that there is no

               <p>He gives a ſummary Account<note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> of the Difficulties, which they who refuſe the Oaths do labour under. <hi>They think, that a rightful Prince only has a Right to our Allegiance; that though he be diſpoſſeſſed of his Throne, he has Right ſtill, and therefore our Duty is ſtill owing to him, and to no other, and our Oaths of Allegiance to him ſtill bind us; and that no other Prince who aſcends the Throne without a legal Right, has Right to our Allegiance; and that to ſwear Allegiance to him while we are under Obligation of a former Oath to our rightful Prince, is Perjury.</hi> This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Principle we proceed on, though it is not <hi>the ſum of all that can be ſaid in this Cauſe;</hi> our Principles, I think, may be more clearly and fully expreſſed, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> propoſe them thus:</p>
               <p>We maintain that a lawful Sovereign cannot lawfully be Reſiſted on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoever; and therefore cannot lawfully be Depoſed, nor conſequently be lawfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diſpoſſeſſed; that ſuch unlawful Acts are null in themſelves, and can effect nothing; that a rightful Prince does not ceaſe to be ſo, becauſe he is wrongfully Depoſed, that his Right does remain after he is Depoſed, unleſs he renounce it by Reſignation, or loſe it by De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eliction; that when this ancient Right is extinguiſhed, the Uſurper of the Throne becomes a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sovereign, and has a Right to Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and not before; that the Diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Prince, as long as his Right to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment continues, has a Right to Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; that Allegiance includes all thoſe Duties, which are contained in the relation of a Subject, not only Submiſſion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in things lawful, but moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally actual Defence and Aſſiſtance againſt all his Enemies: That therefore Allegiance cannot be Sworn to an Uſurper, becauſe it is an Obligation to aſſiſt him againſt the true and rightful Sovereign, that ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance is manifeſt Injuſtice, and in them that are bound by Oath to aſſiſt the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sovereign inexcuſable Perjury: And laſtly, That God's Authority is Delegated only to rightful Princes, and that Uſurpers, while they continue ſuch, have no better Title to it than even Pyrates and Robbers; and theſe I take to be the Principles of them who refuſe the Oath.</p>
               <p>But the Propoſitions which the Doctor oppoſes to their Principles, are fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with them; for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. <hi>We may acknowledge that Allegiance is due not for the ſake of legal Right, but Government;</hi> and, 2. <hi>That it is due not to bare legal Right, but to the Authority of God.</hi> We may admit that Allegiance is due to God's Authority, and for the ſake of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet a legal Right to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be ſtill an evident Proof both of the Authority of God, and of a Right to Allegiance.</p>
               <p>3. We may allow alſo, <hi>That God, when he ſees fit, ſets up Kings without any regard to legal Right, or humane Laws:</hi> He may do it by expreſs Revelation, and he may do it by his Providence extinguiſhing the legal Right, and ſo making the Poſſeſſor a rightful Prince, though his Right be grounded on no humane poſitive Law, but upon the Law of Nature. And, 4. It may be granted that a Prince ſo eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, <hi>Is inveſted with God's Authority, which muſt be obeyed not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake;</hi> and thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting theſe Principles to be true in ſome Senſe, it will neither follow, <hi>That our old Allegiance nor our old Oaths are at an end,</hi> nor that Allegiance is always due to the Powers in poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>But, here in ſhort, lies the Controverſie between us, whether an Uſurper who has wrongfully Diſpoſſeſſed a rightful Prince, whoſe legal Right to the Throne does ſtill continue in force, has nevertheleſs the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God on his ſide, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence a divine Right to our Allegiance. The Doctor is for the affirmative, and his Adverſaries againſt it.</p>
               <p>But firſt he endeavours to byaſs the Reader to his Opinion by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>How much it makes for the eaſe and ſafety of Subjects in all Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and therefore, <hi>they have reaſon,</hi> he ſays, <hi>to wiſh it to be true, and to be glad to

ſee it well proved.</hi> Whether this Principle be in reality for the eaſe and ſafety of Subjects may be debated hereafter; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it here to obſerve, That eaſe and ſafety are uſually ſtrong Arguments, but only to Fleſh and Blood; Trouble and Danger do generally purſue Truth and Virtue; and if Principles may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by this <hi>Criterion,</hi> the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> have much the better on't, and are wiſer, in their Generation at leaſt, than the <hi>Religionary</hi> and the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Salus Populi</hi> has been ever the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Rebellion and Regicide; we know it is <hi>Milton</hi>'s Fundamental Principle; and in all Revolutions, it is as much for the eaſe and ſafety of Subjects certainly to execute the Depoſed Prince, as it is to abjure him. The ſame renowned <hi>Author</hi> wrote a Book for the Lawfulneſs of <hi>Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> in the caſe of a troubleſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable Marriage; and the great Reaſon that runs through his Book, is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Remedy of Divorce is much for the eaſe and happineſs of Mankind, and the making the Bond indiſſoluble is, ſays he, the <hi>Changing the Bleſſing of Matrimony into a familiar and coinhabiting Miſchief, at leaſt into a drooping and diſconſolate Houſhold-captivity, without Refuge or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath taught his Followers, that Subjects when commanded by their Sovereign to deny <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may lawfully obey him; <hi>they have the Licence,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that</hi> Naaman <hi>had,</hi> and need not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into danger for it: A Principle much, no doubt, for our Worldly eaſe and ſafety; and upon the ſame account he advanced another Principle, the ſame, for ought that I can ſee, which is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Doctor, <hi>That the Obligation of the Subject to the</hi>

                  <hi>Sovereign does laſt no longer than the Power laſteth, by which he is able to protect them.</hi> In ſhort, the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (for it is nothing elſe) with which the Doctor would corrupt his Reader, may equally ſerve as a perſuaſive to the denial of Chriſt, the Exiſtence of Spirits, Hell Torments, and to divers other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Hobbian</hi>

               <p>And now we come to Argument, and the Doctor undertakes to prove his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from Scripture and Reaſon, and from the Principles of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> He begins with the laſt, but that comes not within the compaſs of my underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and therefore I proceed to conſider</p>

               <p>But the 3d. Propoſition is that on which the whole Controverſie turns, and the ſum of it is this, <hi>That every one who is in Poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power, has the Authority of God.</hi> If this can be prov'd, the diſpute is at an end, and ſo it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if it cannot be prov'd. It will be evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to any one that throughly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Doctor's Book, and all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Arguments in it, that moſt of them muſt ſtand and fall together with this Propoſition. The Doctor has not only aſſerted it, but has endeavoured alſo to eſtabliſh and deduce it by a train of Conſequences; here he has laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Diſcourſe, and therefore no doubt it has all the Strength, and Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that ſo wiſe a Builder could give it: This is his Fundamental Propoſition, and let us impartially examine the Deduction he has made to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are but Three ways,</hi> ſays<note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> he, <hi>whereby God gives this Power and Authority to any Perſons, either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Nature, or expreſs Nomination, or by the Diſpoſals of Providence.</hi> Now theſe Three ways are really no more than One, for the ways of Nature and expreſs Nomination are only ſome of thoſe various ways, whereby the Providence of God has diſpoſed of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and they are not therefore contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct to Providence, but comprehended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> can be, any Power or Authority, which was not derived from it. But the various Methods by which Providence has conveyed Authority, may indeed be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſome general Heads, and then, according to the Doctor's Scheme of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, there will be Three ways of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying Authority, by Nature, by Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by giving Power and Poſſeſſion; but we think that a legal Right is one of the ways of Providence alſo; we are ſure that whoſoever has it, it is a Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and ſince a Right to a Sovereign Power implies a Right to the Poſſeſſion of it, we cannot poſſibly conceive how one Prince can have a legal Right to Poſſeſſion by virtue of God's Donation, and another, at the ſame time, have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right to be the Poſſeſſor by God's Donation alſo. But let us follow the Doctor through his own ways of Providence.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>By Nature; Parents,</hi> ſays<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he, <hi>have a Natural Superiority over their Children, and are their Lords and Governours too; this was the firſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the World, and is the only Natural Authority; for in Propriety of ſpeaking there is no Natural Prince but a Father.</hi> Thus he plainly acknowledges that a Parent is a Natural Prince, and that in the beginning of the World the Fathers of Families had Civil Power and Authority over their Children. And now for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſake, let us revive the Patriarchal Government, and ſuppoſe a Paternal Prince, as <hi>Noah</hi> for inſtance, inveſted with Civil Authority over his Children; ſuppoſe again, that one of his Natural Sons, let it be <hi>Cham</hi> for example, does by force de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Noah,</hi> and uſurp his Power, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire plenary Poſſeſſion of it; and ſuppoſe once more, that the Unnatural <hi>

Do, ſays the Doctor, they muſt Swear, and Pray, and Fight for the Uſurper, againſt their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Father, for though <hi>Noah</hi> has a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Right, <hi>Cham</hi> has a divine Right, he Reigns by God's Authority, and that may certainly be defended againſt all Perſons whatſoever. Thus this Principle in its Conſequences, is much worſe than the <hi>Corban,</hi> for it teaches Children not only to deny Maintenance, but actually to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96186:4"/>
their natural King and Father, and it gloſſes away the Precept of Honouring Parents into a Licenſe to deſtroy them; but, I think, that God did never authorize either Parricide or Uſurpation.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, If in the Caſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it can never be lawful for Children to forſwear, oppoſe, and to deſtroy their Parents, when they ſeek only to recover their Rights of which they are wrongfully Diſpoſſeſſed; if natural Fathers can never ceaſe to be ſuch, and their Authority is Inalienable without their own Conſent, and if the mere Poſſeſſion of it by an Uſurper does not entitle him to the full Allegiance of the Children; what reaſon can then be given why Civil Authority in a legal Father, which is the ſame with that of a Natural, ſhould not be equally Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and Inalienable alſo? Why ſhould Diſpoſſeſſion extinguiſh this Authority in one Father, when it does not in the other? If Providence does ſuperinduce a divine Right over a legal Right, upon the ſame Grounds it will deſtroy a natural Right, and if it be lawful for Subjects to bind themſelves by Oath to act for an Uſurper againſt their political Father, than may Children in the ſame Caſe oppoſe their natural Father in the Proſecution of his natural Rights: But I appeal to the Senſe and Reaſon of Mankind, whether ſuch an oppoſition would not be highly Wicked and Unreaſonable, and yet the Doctor's Principle will ſerve to juſtifie it.</p>
               <p>2. His next way is, <hi>By particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and thus God made Kings in</hi> Jewry. But this nominated King I leave in better Hands, with all the Arguments and Evaſions that belong to him.</p>

In the mean time, we deny not that God governs in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, and that he removeth and ſetteth up Kings as he pleaſeth; we maintain that all rightful Kings do rule by God's Authority, as much as if they were expreſly Nominated, and we believe farther, that God cannot be the Author of Wickedneſs, and that he gives not his Authority to Uſurpation and Injuſtice.</p>

                     </gap>ito his Hands; then he removes a King, when by his Providence he thruſts him from the Throne, and takes the Government out of his Hands.</hi> The Propoſition then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Author's Senſe, is to be underſtood in its utmoſt latitude, That whoſoever is by Providence advanced to the Poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power, is made a King by God, and whoſoever is deprived of it by Providence, is depoſed by God. But this is ambiguouſly propoſed, and is true in one Senſe, falſe in another; and this ambiguity will be evidently expoſed by this parallel Propoſition; That God does then give a Man an Eſtate, when his Providence puts him in Poſſeſſion of it, and he deprives a Man of an Eſtate, when by Providence he is Diſpoſſeſſed of it: It is certain that God governs every thing in the World, as well as Kingdoms by his Providence, and if <hi>all Events,</hi> then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Diſpoſſeſſion and Poſſeſſion of an Eſtate muſt be aſcribed to it. And therefore the Propoſition is true in this ſenſe, that as far as God's Providence is concerned in the diſpoſal of an Eſtate, he may be ſaid to take away or give it. But it is manifeſtly falſe in this ſenſe; that whoſoever has by Providence the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an Eſtate, has a divine Right to it by God's Donation. A Thief has by God's Providence Poſſeſſion of honeſt Mens Properties, and in ſome ſenſe it is God that gives it him, but it was never yet thought that he had a <hi>jus Divinum</hi> to them. The <hi>Sabaeans</hi> drove away <hi>Job</hi>'s Oxen, and yet he acknowledged that the Lord had taken them away; but it would be a ſtrange Commentary upon the Paſſage to ſay, That the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> had God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to keep them.</p>
               <p>And by Analogy to this parallel Caſe, the ambiguity of the former Propoſition may be eaſily unfolded. It is true that God removes and ſets up Kings in the ſame ſenſe as his Providence does advance or dethrone them; but it is falſe, that whoſoever is in any ſenſe advanced to a Throne by Providence, is ſet up by God, ſo as that he has God's Authority to keep it: For it is undeniably evident that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Poſſeſſion is no Argument of divine Authority; and therefore though it be granted, That <hi>God now governs the World, and ſetteth up Kings only by his Providence;</hi> yet it will by no means fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that every one who is ſet up in any ſenſe by Providence, has Authority from God; for then it would follow, that Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and Robbers have his Authority alſo.</p>
               <p>But here the Doctor leads me into a Digreſſion about Providence, and becauſe the whole Controverſie depends upon the right underſtanding of God's Providential Concurrence in all Events and Actions; it is neceſſary to attend him through it.</p>
               <p>Providence he defines to be, <hi>God's Government of the World</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>by an inviſible Power, whereby he directs, determines, over-rules all Events to the accompliſhment of his own Will and Counſels;</hi> and to avoid Cavil we admit the Definition. There is a known Diſtinction between the <hi>permiſſive</hi> and the <hi>effective ordering and authorizing</hi> Providence of God, and there is evident Reaſon and Neceſſity for it; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt fooliſhly charge God with being the efficient Cauſe and poſitive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all the Wickedneſs in the World. But the Doctor will not allow the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Caſe before us, and his Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe it does not relate to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>the Events of Things, but to the wickedneſs of Men, and though God cannot be the Author of any Wickedneſs, yet he is the Author of all Events which happen to private Perſons or Societies;</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence which he draws from this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, That the Uſurpations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not only permitted, but are effected and authorized by it. To lay open the falſhood of this Doctrine, it is neceſſary to obſerve how the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is converſant about Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Before it is accompliſhed, Providence is concerned only in prohibiting and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Commiſſion of it; this is to be underſtood only of moral Impediments, ſuch as are conſiſtent with our natural Liberty, and are not irreſiſtible. And here
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96186:5"/>
a Diſtinction is made between the internal and external acts of Sin, between an act of Wickedneſs as it lies in the Mind, and the outward Execution of it; the former is never hindred by irreſiſtible Power, for that would deſtroy the very nature of the Will; but Providence does often lay ſuch effectual Reſtraints upon the execution of Sin, that it is impoſſible to effect it, and when God does not by the interpoſition of his Power hinder a wicked event, or the external act of Wickedneſs, than his Providence does give it a negative Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, becauſe it does not poſitively prevent it.</p>
               <p>The acts of Providence which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about Sin, in the very act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, are the conſervation of our Being and Powers, whereby we are capable of committing it; <hi>The direction and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling of it to the accompliſhment of his own Will and Counſel;</hi> and the determining or reſtraining of it within certain bounds and limits; and laſtly, after the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is committed, the acts of Providence about it are the Puniſhment or Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. Theſe are the acts of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence in relation to Sin, and from this account it is manifeſt, that the Providence of God which prohibits, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, over-rules, reſtrains and puniſhes Sin, does neither effect nor authorize it.</p>
               <p>But though God be not the Author of Sin, yet the Doctor aſſerts him to be the <hi>Author of all Events;</hi> then ſay I, it una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably follows, that he is the Author of all the Wickedneſs that ever was, or can be committed in the World; for it is evident that all wicked Actions, when accompliſhed, are Events; and if God be the poſitive doer of all Events, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly the doer of all wicked Actions. Was not <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Inceſt an Event, as well as his Uſurpation? Was not <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Murther of King <hi>Charles</hi> an Event, as well as the Poſſeſſion of his Power? Are not all Murthers, Inceſts, Robberies, and all other Villanies that have been ever acted under the Sun <hi>Events?</hi> And that we may be convinced of the lawfulneſs of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt we now blaſphemouſly conclude, that God is the Author of them? Two Evaſions may be made uſe of to elude this Conſequence.</p>
               <p>1. The old Diſtinction between an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it ſelf, and the Obliquity and Vitioſity of it. But it is evident that in theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are evil in themſelves, as Blaſphemy, Adultery, Oppreſſion, and Uſurpation, the act and the obliquity, though they may be conſidered ſeparately, are yet really, and in the nature of the thing inſeparable; (for who can commit Adultery, and be free from all Wickedneſs in it;) and therefore ſeeing they are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably united, he who cauſes the act is the cauſe of the obliquity, as he that kindles a fire is the cauſe of burning.</p>
               <p>2. It may be replied, That by <hi>Events</hi> the Doctor underſtands the direction, or the ſucceſs of Deſigns and Actions, as it makes for the good or evil or private Men, or publick Societies. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <hi>That God cannot be the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Author of any Wickedneſs, and therefore we ſay he only permits it; but then when it comes to action he over-rules it, and he either diſappoints Mens wicked Deſigns, or gives ſucceſs to them, when he can ſerve the Ends of his Providence.</hi> But ſtill the ſame Conſequence will return upon him; for if God does not only permit, (for a Permiſſive giving of Succeſs will here ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing,) but does poſitively <hi>give Succeſs</hi> to Wickedneſs, then he is unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably the Author of the wicked Event, or Action; for the ſucceſs of a wicked Deſign, is nothing elſe but the actual accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and if God be the poſitive accompliſher of all Wickedneſs that is actually committed, he is evidently the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Author of the actual Commiſſion of it: As for inſtance, whoever accompliſhes, or gives ſucceſs to a Plot of Murther or Adultery, is undeniably guilty of the actual Commiſſion of them. It is true, that God's Providence over-rules all the Deſigns and Succeſſes of wicked Men to good ends and purpoſes, to the good and evil of private Perſons and Societies; Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and Bleſſings do proceed from his Will, and there cannot be <hi>an Evil in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96186:6"/>
City, and the Lord hath not done it;</hi> he hath <hi>done it,</hi> by not hindering wicked Men from accompliſhing their Deſigns, and he hath <hi>done it,</hi> by directing their Wickedneſs to the puniſhment of the wicked.</p>
               <p>But if this be all the Doctor's Meaning, that Providence does onely direct the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of ſome Men to the good or evil of others, then it will follow, 1. That this cannot be ſufficient to make God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of all Events, and conſequently that can be no Argument to authorize an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation: And, 2. It is evident that the providential Direction of any wicked Event to the good or evil of Mankind, can be no proof of the conveyance of God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The uſing of an evil Inſtrument to a good End, and a divine Commiſſion, are things eaſily diſtinguiſhed, and it is eaſie to ſhew the inconcluſiveneſs of this arguing by many Inſtances. God makes uſe of Perſecutors to chaſtize his People, Have they therefore God's Commiſſion to doe the Work of the Devil? Even the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is his Inſtrument to good Ends and Purpoſes, and God orders and over-rules his Wickedneſs to accompliſh them, Has he therefore God's Authority to govern us, and when God gives him Power, are we bound to pay Obedience? The Doctor argues, <hi>That all Events are ordered by God to the good or evil of private Perſons, as well as Societies.</hi> Thus the Events of Robbery and Murther are often directed by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the good and evil of private Men, and ſometimes of Societies, but is this a Proof that Murtherers and Robbers have God's Authority? The Inceſt and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of <hi>Abſalom</hi> were equally from God's permiſſive Providence, and were alike or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by God as a puniſhment to <hi>David,</hi> had he therefore a divine Commiſſion to lie with his Father's Wives, and to uſurp his Throne? For the one undoubtedly as much as the other, and much the ſame as have all other rebellious Sons and unnatural Uſurpers. The ſumm is this; if God be the Authour of all Events, then he is the Authour of all wicked Actions; and if he is not, the over-ruling them to good Ends is no Commiſſion of Government; and therefore the Doctor's Argument thus far does either border upon Blaſphemy, or is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>However the Doctor thus purſties it, <hi>If there were any ſuch diſtinction as this, that ſome Events God only</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>permits, and ſome he orders and appoints, we ought in reaſon to aſſcribe the Advancement of Kings to God's Decree and Counſel, becauſe it is the principal Act of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which has ſo great an Influence upon the Government of the World; and if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and order any Events, certainly he pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly orders ſuch Events as will doe moſt good, or moſt hurt to the World; he muſt with his own hand immediately direct the Motions of the great Wheels of Providence, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to move as they pleaſe themſelves.</hi> The Doctrine here delivered is this: That all great Events, ſuch as have an Influence upon the Government of the World, are God's Order and Appointment, his Decree, his Counſel, and his Poſitive Doing. Strange and prodigious Doctrine from a Divine of the Church of <hi>England!</hi> for are not all the great Villanies of the World great Events? Are not all Inſurrections and Rebellions, the Murthering of Kings, the Deſolation of Kingdoms, the Deſtruction of Millions of innocent Perſons, and the infinite Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are committed in unjuſt and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wars, are not all theſe Events, and ſuch Events <hi>as doe moſt hurt to the World, and have a great Influence upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it?</hi> And muſt it not then be ſaid, that leſſer Wickedneſſes are fit to be acted by miſerable Men, but the great and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Villanies are the peculiar Works of the Almighty. How <hi>the Hand of God does direct the great Wheels of Providence,</hi> is to us incomprehenſible, but this we can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend, that God is no more the Authour of greater than of leſſer Villanies; he did not move <hi>Abſalom</hi> to uſurp upon <hi>David,</hi> nor <hi>Athaliah</hi> upon <hi>Joaſh,</hi> he direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neither the Hearts nor Hands of <hi>Jacques Clemens</hi> and <hi>Ravillia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96186:6"/>It is a falſe Notion of Providence to think it is more concerned about greater than about leſſer Affairs: Providence has as much to doe with Beggars as with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with Families as with Kingdoms; and it numbers up all the Hairs of our Head, as well as the Deſtiny of Empires. All Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are before God as the ſmall Duſt of the Balance, and are counted leſs than nothing; neither is there any difference of great and little, as to Omnipotency and Immenſity. Events therefore are not peculiarly to be aſſcribed to God, becauſe they appear great to us; and the Reaſon why ſome Events are ſaid to be permitted, and others to be cauſed by God, is not becauſe they are great or little, but becauſe they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good or evil. If Uſurpation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Right be a thing evil in itſelf, God muſt be equally diſcharged from being the Authour of it, in the caſe of a Cottage and a Kindgom, God may permit, and may decree the Depoſition of a King, as a juſt Puniſhment from him, who is righteous in all his Judgments, and he knows how to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it without wicked Inſtruments but if he makes uſe of ſuch Inſtruments for the execution of his Judgments, if he puniſheth a lawfull King by the Rebellion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or the Uſurpation of his Throne, Have the wicked Inſtruments therefore the Decree and Appointment of God to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize them? Or, is the Uſurpation any more from God than the Rebellion?</p>
               <p>Nay farther, he may decree to advance a private Perſon to the Throne, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to advance <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and God can certainly effect ſuch a Decree by lawfull ways, as by the Extinction of all former Titles; but if the Perſon whoſe Advancement is decreed expects not till Providence opens a lawfull way to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of the Throne, but aſcends it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the way of Uſurpation, can the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Decree of God either juſtifie his Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, or give him Authority to continue it? Shall we ſay that God mov'd him to this Wickedneſs? or not rather, that his Wickedneſs and his Advancement are only from himſelf? God decreed to make <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> King, yet after the <hi>Decree</hi> was revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, he accounted <hi>Saul</hi> as God's King, and he patiently waited till God made him a lawfull Sovereign, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the former Title. But <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> anticipated God's Covenant, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf to the Throne by Rebellion and Uſurpation; and therefore he is generally branded as an Uſurper, and of him among others, it is thought that God himſelf hath ſaid by the Prophet, <hi>They have ſet up Kings, but not by me.</hi> God<note place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 4.</note> decreed to raiſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> to great Dignity in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but if <hi>Joſeph</hi> had wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly uſurped that Power or Wealth which was the Right of another, Could it then be ſaid, that God's Decree did give him Authority to keep it, any more than it did to his Brethren to ſell him to the <hi>Midi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites?</hi> Thus would it be, if the Decrees of God were made known to Men; and much more is it ſo, when his Decrees are ſecret and unſearchable, and cannot poſſibly be known before they are accompliſhed. A Diſtinction there muſt be, between God's decreeing the Poſſeſſion of a Throne to a Perſon, and giving him Authority to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it while it is the Right of another; for otherwiſe the Decree of God muſt give Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Injuſtice. However nothing is effected by the Providence of God, but as it was decreed by him; and therefore when any wicked Event does happen, ſince it happens onely by the permiſſive Providence of God, the antecedent Decree about it muſt be permiſſive alſo. We can never know whether God's Decrees be permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or authoritative, but from the nature of the Events decreed; we are certain he onely permits Wickedneſs, and he decrees onely to permit it; and therefore if the Poſſeſſion of a Power which is the Right of another be Wickedneſs, we are ſure that God's Decree and Providence about it are merely permiſſive, and are conſequently far from being Arguments of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But to return to the Doctor:</p>
               <p>He endeavours to ſupport his Argument by Providence, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring,<note place="margin">pag. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>That Kings are God's Miniſters and Lieutenants, and are inveſted with his Authority; now to give Authority to

any Perſon, does not ſignifie to permit him to take it, and we cannot but think that God will exerciſe a particular Providence in appointing his great Miniſters.</hi> Under the word <hi>Kings</hi> he comprehends <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers;</hi> and here the Doctor would conjure us into a Circle. He undertook to prove that all Uſurpers do rule by God's Authority, becauſe they are advanced by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and now he remembers that they are inveſted with his Authority, and from thence he argues that they are advanced by his Providence. But the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members what he has not proved, that all Kings (comprehending Uſurpers) are inveſted with God's Authority. This we poſitively deny, as being here precariouſly aſſerted, and therefore the Aſſumptions and Inferences that follow ought to paſs for nothing. But behold his<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Subtilty! <hi>No Man can have God's Authority but he to whom it is given; and if the advancement to a Throne inveſts a Prince with God's Authority, then God gives him the Throne, and does not merely permit him to take it.</hi> If the Suppoſition were well proved, the Conſequence would be never doubted; but the Reaſon on which he grounds it, is either not true, or not pertinent, <hi>For no Man can take God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but it muſt be given by him.</hi> The gift of God does generally imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Right by divine Donation, and in this ſenſe his Aſſertion is manifeſtly falſe; for <hi>all Authority is God's,</hi> and whenever Men do aſſume Power and Authority, which they have no Right to exerciſe, (as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance all Uſurpers, Rebels, Pyrates, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and Schiſmatical Preachers,) it is evident they uſurp that Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which God never gave them. But ſometimes God is ſaid to give a thing, when Providence ſo orders it, that Men have Power to take it. Thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But in this ſenſe his Propoſition here is inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; for a Permiſſive gift is as good a Charter for Thieves and Cut-throats, as it is for Tyrants and Uſurpers.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſays the Doctor, <hi>Since</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>God makes Kings now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not by an expreſs Nomination, but only by the Events of Providence, we muſt not allow that God at any time permits Men to make themſelves Kings, whom he does not make Kings; for then we can never diſtinguiſh between Kings by the Permiſſion, and by the Appointment of God, between God's Kings and Kings of their own making.</hi> Then in other words he repeats the ſame Aſſertion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, That <hi>there is no direction how to diſtinguiſh them, and the Events of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in placing them in the Throne, are the ſame in both.</hi> Here the Doctor will not diſtinguiſh againſt his own Hypotheſis; but why may not the Permiſſion and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God be as eaſily diſtinguiſhed in the advancement of Kings, as in the ſucceſs of Pyrates and Robbers, or in any other Event whatever? Since the only way whereby God does now give Riches and Eſtates, is the diſpoſal of Providence, can we therefore never diſtinguiſh between the Poſſeſſing them by the Permiſſion and by the Appointment of God? Does the forge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of a Will hold his Eſtate by divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, or the Thief the purchaſe of Robbery? If we cannot diſtinguiſh in ſuch Caſes between God's Permiſſion and Appointment, Juſtice muſt leave the Earth again, and a divine Right may be pleaded for all the Injuſtice in the World. But if that diſtinction be allowed in private Property, why ſhould it not be admitted in the right of Sovereignty alſo; the Reaſon is the ſame in both, for God can never be the Author of any Wickedneſs, and as long as the Poſſeſſion of any thing is unjuſt or wicked, we may be ſure that Providence only permits it.</p>
               <p>But, ſaith the Doctor, <hi>There is no direction how to diſtinguiſh</hi> between Kings by Permiſſion and by divine Appointment, <hi>and the Events of Providence are the ſame in both.</hi> If he means direction in Scripture, he knows we are directed there to <hi>render
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96186:7"/>
every Man his due;</hi> and not only Scripture, but the Laws of Nature and Nations do direct it alſo. But though Scripture is no Code of Political Laws and Rights, yet we want not ſufficient direction to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us in paying every one his due. Political Laws and Conſtitutions are the Rule of Civil Rights, and they direct us how to diſtinguiſh between unjuſt and juſt Poſſeſſors, and the light of Reaſon and Scripture does aſſure us, That an unjuſt Poſſeſſion is only permitted by God, and not appointed and authorized by him. We have as plain a direction how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh about the Poſſeſſion of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty as of private Property, or as we have to diſtinguiſh between the Uſurpers of God's vindictive Juſtice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd the lawful Adminiſtrators of it. Vengeance is God's, and his Vicegerents, but it is often uſurp'd by Murtherers and Rebels, they invade it by God's Permiſſion only; but the Laws of Nations teach us how to diſtinguiſh them from God's Vicegerents; and if we have directions to diſtinguiſh when one branch of Sovereignty is permitted to be Invaded, when the whole is Invaded will not the ſame directions ſerve? Or is it eaſie to diſtinguiſh in leſſer Uſurpations, impoſſible in greater.</p>
               <p>But when a legal Prince and an Uſurper are advanced to a Throne, <hi>The Event is the ſame in both.</hi> The Events conſidered, as Natural actions, may be the ſame, but as Moral, they may be as eaſily diſtinguiſh'd as any Moral good and evil. Adultery and Conjugal Copulation, juſt and unjuſt Poſſeſſions, the executions of Magiſtrates and Cut-throats, the Beheading of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and the Beheading of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> in all theſe actions the Event, conſidered Phyſically, is the ſame; but, I hope, it is eaſie to diſtinguiſh in theſe Caſes between Lawful and Unlawful, Permiſſion and Appointment. So it is in the advancement to Sovereignty, when King <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> were advanced, the Event, to wit, the Poſſeſſion of the Sovereignty was the ſame; but every Church of <hi>England</hi> Man, in thoſe Days, could eaſily diſtinguiſh between God's Sovereign and the Devil's. In ſhort, we can never diſtinguiſh Permiſſion and Appointment by bare Events, but only by the moral Circumſtances which denominate them good or evil.</p>
               <p>Conſequently ſince Providence it ſelf muſt be diſtinguiſhed by the rules of good and evil, it neceſſarily follows that Providence of it ſelf can never be a rule to us. The only rule of our Actions is Law, either Poſitive, Divine, Natural, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; but it is impoſſible that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, abſtracted from the Conſideration of the moral Nature of Events, ſhould be a Law to us, becauſe it declares not the preceptive Will, or that Will of God which muſt be a rule to our Actions: Whatever Providence works, or is the Will of his good Pleaſure, we muſt follow that Will which God has ſignified to us, either in written or unwritten Laws. God has never preſcribed the Diſpenſations of Providence as a rule to us; they are often Unſearchable and above our Comprehenſion, but in no Caſe can we underſtand what God permits, and what he effects and authorizeth, but by the Moral nature of Events. Providence it ſelf muſt be meaſured by the rules of good and evil, and therefore thoſe muſt be the ultimate rules of our Practice. To conclude, Though Succeſs (which is but another word for providential Events) be a good Argument of God's Approbation and Authority among the Diſciples of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> I think, it can be none among the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> I am ſure it cannot be found in the Volumes of his Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus I have conſidered what the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has advanced about Providence; now, ſays he, <hi>The neceſſary Conſequence is this; that by what means ſoever any Prince aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nds the Throne, he is placed there by God, and receives Authority from him.</hi> And let the Reader judge, whether the Premiſes to this Conſequence be ſufficiently proved or confuted. The ſumm of his Proof is this, That God now governs the World only by his Providence, (which is falſe if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Government by Laws, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is no Proof that every Uſurper does Reign by God's Authority,) that all Events are from God, and eſpecially great Events,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96186:8"/>
(which is to charge God with all the Wickedneſs in the World,) that no one can uſurp God's Authority, unleſs God does give it him, (which is confuted by all Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Rebellions;) and, laſtly, that we cannot diſtinguiſh between Kings by Permiſſion and Appointment, unleſs all Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſours of Sovereignty have God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, (which may as well be ſaid of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poſſeſſours; and contains no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all, it being as eaſie to diſtinguiſh Permiſſion and Appointment, as lawfull Princes and unlawfull.) This is the ſumm of his Diſcourſe upon the third Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and let the Reader judge how well he has demonſtrated it. I need not here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on his ſeveral ways of conveying God's Authority to Princes, Election, Succeſsion, and Conqueſt or Uſurpation. Theſe will be conſidered hereafter; ſuffice it here to obſerve that there are in general but two ways whereby Princes are advanced by God, Permiſsion and Appointment, this the way of Rightfull Princes, and that of Uſurpers.</p>
               <p>We are come now to his 4th Propoſition, <hi>viz. That all Kings</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>are equally rightfull, with reſpect to God;</hi> which is juſt as true as this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, That all Men are equally righteous with reſpect to God, or that with God there is no difference between good and evil; or, that with reſpect to God, the Thief and the lawfull Proprietor are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rightfull Poſſeſſors. But let us conſider how he proves it: <hi>It is impoſſible there ſhould be a wrong King, unleſs a Man could make himſelf King whether God will or no.</hi> The ſame Aſſertion with that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed allready, <hi>That no one can take God's Authority, but it muſt be given him:</hi> And may it not be ſaid with equal Reaſon, that all Men muſt be made wicked by God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Men can make themſelves wicked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will or no? Or is it impoſſible there ſhould be a wrong Poſſeſſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of any thing, unleſs a Man could make himſelf a Poſſeſſour whether God will or no. He proceeds thus, <hi>The whole Authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is Gods, and whoever has God's Authority is a true and rightfull King, for he has the true and rightfull Authority of a King.</hi> But is not every Branch of Sovereign Authority God's, if the whole Authority of Government is his? Does not every Murtherer uſurp the Power of the Sword, the principal Branch of that Authority? And is the Exerciſe of that Power right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with reſpect to God, or is the Murther committed by God's Authority? Having God's Authority is an equivocal Expreſſion; it may be had by Commiſſion, as rightfull Princes have it, and it may be had by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as Aſſaſſines, Rebels, and Uſurpers have it; and ſuch a manner of having will never make the Poſſeſſion rightfull, either before God or Men. To ſpeak properly, the Uſurper has not God's Authority, he has Power or Force, and ſo has the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, but that is not Authority; and yet becauſe they exerciſe a Power which it is not lawfull to exerciſe without God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, abuſively and improperly they may be ſaid to have his Authority.</p>
               <p>Prop. 5. <hi>The Diſtinction then</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>between a King</hi> de Jure, <hi>and a King</hi> de Facto <hi>relates onely to humane Laws which bind Subjects, but are not the neceſſary Rules and Meaſures of the Divine Providence.</hi> This Diſtinction relates to humane Laws, juſt as does the Diſtinction in all other Caſes between Right and Wrong. Humane Laws do declare and determine what is right, and the Law of God does eſtabliſh and confirm the Law of man about it. Thus he who has a Right to an Eſtate by the Law of the Land, has a Right to it by the Law of God, and is the rightfull Proprietor, with reſpect both to God and Man. If it were not ſo, the Invaſion of another's Property could be no Sin; it could not make a man guilty before God, nor obnoxious to his Vengeance, if it were no Tranſgreſsion of his Laws. In private Dominion therefore the Diſtinction of a Poſſeſſour <hi>de Jure</hi> and <hi>de Facto,</hi> relates to divine as well as humane Law; and why ſhould it not then in the eaſe of politick Dominion and the Poſſeſſours of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Shall private Injury be a Breach of Divine and Humane Laws, and an Injury to God's Vicegerents be an Offence only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws of Men? Does not the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96186:8"/>
Sanction of God eſtabliſh the Rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns? Or does his Law take care of Oxen, and not of Men, of private Men, and not of Princes? What can be the Reaſon of this Prerogative of private Rights above the Rights of Princes? Is it becauſe <hi>Humane Laws are not the neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y Rules and Meaſures of Providence?</hi> Does not Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence diſpoſe of them? And is it bound to humane Laws in reſpect to Property, and free in reſpect to Sovereignty? Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws are not the adequate Rule of Providence, for many things come to paſs in God's Government of the World, which cannot be regulated by them; and yet God's Providence does govern political So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties by political Laws, ſometimes it makes a Law void by extinguiſhing the matter of it, but it never directly abrogates it; for as long as humane Laws are Laws, they do continue to bind Subjects, they are the neceſſary Rules and Meaſures of their Actions, and have the Sanction of divine Authority to enforce them.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider how the Doctour illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates and confirms his Propoſition: <hi>In hereditary Kingdoms,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>rightfull King is he who has by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion a legal Right to the Crown, and he who has Poſſeſſion of it without a legal right, is a King</hi> de Facto, <hi>a King, but not by Law:</hi> That is, he is an unlawfull King, or an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper. Now if this Law which creates a Right to the Crown be truly and properly a Law, then it is certain the Authority of God confirms it; and conſequently the King <hi>de Jure,</hi> having his Right eſtabliſhed by the Law of God, the Uſurper cannot claim by virtue of it; if the legal and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right be in another, it is manifeſt he has neither, and muſt be a wrongfull Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour with reſpect to God and Man; but if the Law of Succeſſion be no Law, the talk of a King <hi>de Jure</hi> is Banter, and there is no ſuch thing as Right or Law in the World.</p>
               <p>The Dr. acknowledges, that<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Subjects are ſo tied up by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Kingdom, that they muſt not pull down or ſet up Kings contrary to the Laws of the Land; but</hi> (he adds) <hi>God is not bound by humane Laws, but can make whom he pleaſes King, without Regard to legal Rights.</hi> This is liable to many Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>1. He grants that Subjects muſt not <hi>ſee up</hi> illegal Kings, therefore they muſt not ſet them up, by giving their Conſent to the Advancement of them; and yet he affirms afterwards, that Kings <hi>de Facto</hi> are not ſet up by God till they are ſettled, and that they are not ſettled till they have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Subjects. Thus the Reſult is, That God can never ſet up Kings againſt Law, for Subjects muſt not ſet them up by their Conſent, and there is no other way to doe it.</p>
               <p>2. If Subjects muſt not, is it lawfull for others to advance them? May Foreigners lawfully ſet up Kings over others? Who made them Judges or King-makers in other Kingdoms? Or how can they prove any Commiſſion from God to doe it? Thus it can be lawfull for no ſort of Men to be Inſtruments in ſetting up illegal Kings, and therefore they muſt be ſet up by God's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion onely; for when wicked Actions are done by wicked Inſtruments, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he onely permits them.</p>
               <p>3. If neither Subjects nor Foreigners can lawfully ſet up Kings againſt Law, how ſhall Providence doe it? God muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet them up without Inſtruments, which he never did nor will doe, or he muſt allways ſet them up by wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and then it muſt be ſaid, that God can lawfully ſet up Kings, but never by lawfull means; and whether this be not derogatory to the Goodneſs and Juſtice of his Government, let every one conſider.</p>
               <p>4. Whereas he affirms, that God can make Kings without regard to legal Rights, why may it not be as well ſaid, that he can make Marriages, or legitimate Baſtards, or create Judges, Conſtables, and Freeholders againſt Law? No doubt he can doe all this by an expreſs Revelation of his Will, and ſo he can make Kings againſt Law, by expreſs Nomination. But providential E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents are by no means equivalent to it; the unjuſt Poſſeſſor of another's Freehold, is in ſome ſenſe a Freeholder by Providence;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96186:9"/>
but that can be no barr to an Ejectment by Law; and ſo it is in the unlawful Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Sovereignty; God's Providence does not Abrogate the legal Right, nor make an Ejectment unlawful. As I ſaid before, the Matter of humane Laws is often Subſtracted by Providence, and ſo is the Matter of divine and natural Laws; but Providence does no more act againſt thoſe than theſe. The bond of Law is the Authority of God, and God is the Author of Political Society, and the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſher of Law, which is the Soul and Cement of it; and therefore to ſay he deſtroys it by his Providence, is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his Providence as Subverting his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to make him not the God of Order, but the God of Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Prop. 6. The ſumm of it is<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> this, <hi>We can have but one King at a time, and therefore our Allegiance can be due only to one King.</hi> By King he means the Poſſeſſor of the Throne; ſo that this Propoſition is a very wonderful Diſcovery, that two oppoſite Kings cannot at the ſame time poſſeſs the ſame Throne, which is as clear as that they can't be in the ſame place together, or that two M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>ſetled in the actual Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sovereign Power;</hi> this we deny to be true, in our ſenſe of King, and his ſenſe of Settlement. But <hi>King,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is the Name of Power and Authority not of mere Right.</hi> Then the ſenſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is this, He has Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over us, who has the Adminiſtration of Power and Authority over us; but if the Doctor will aſſume an Authority over Words, it is not for me to contradict it. We know the World did generally give the name of King to <hi>Charles</hi> I. and II. when they had only <hi>a legal Right to the Crown, but did not Poſſeſs it,</hi> and ſo they do to ſuch a Prince, <hi>who ought by the Laws of the Land to be King, but is not,</hi> as the Doctor underſtands the name of King. But ſince he is reſolved that <hi>King</hi> ſhall ſignifie Poſſeſſion of Power only, let him have his Humour, but let him draw no Arguments from his Arbitrary interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Names. His King can have no Title to <hi>God's Authority</hi> againſt <hi>legal Right,</hi> which always carries God's Authority with it.</p>
               <p>Here the Doctor propoſes an Objection, <hi>That it is Hobbiſin that Dominion is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally annexed to Power;</hi> and in Anſwer to it, he makes ſhew of a diſtinction between <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Opinion and his own. <hi>Hobbs makes Power and nothing elſe to give Right to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and aſſerts that God himſelf is the natural Governour of the World, not becauſe he made it, but becauſe he is Omnipotent: But I ſay that Government is founded in Right, and that God is the natural Lord of the World, becauſe he made it, and that no Creature has any Right to govern, but as he receives Authority from God.</hi> He might as well have Anſwered, That <hi>Hobbs</hi> makes Civil Laws the Rules of good and evil, and denies the exiſtence of Spirits; but I do not. Is there any diſpute here about the Grounds of God's Dominion? Is it not wholly about humane Government? And was <hi>Hobbiſm</hi> ever laid to his charge, for aſſerting that God's Dominion is founded only in his Omnipotency? The Queſtion is whether Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and the Doctor teach not the ſame Doctrine about the legal Right and Poſſeſſion of Sovereignty, and the transferring of Allegiance to Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers? And whether he can clear himſelf from <hi>Hobbiſm</hi> in the Points we are now debating? And this charge is ſo evident, that he had no other way but to decline it, by anſwering what was never obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>Does not the Doctor teach, that our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance is extinguiſhed when the King has not the Adminiſtration of Government in his Hands, and that Allegiance and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Government are eſſential Relatives. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> had taught the ſame before him, <hi>That the Obligation of Subjects to</hi>

But what ſaith the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>That Power does not give Right and Authority to govern; but is a certain ſign to us, that where God hath placed the Power, he has given the Authority.</hi> And is not this a manifeſt Confeſſion of Hobbiſm, <hi>That Dominion is naturally annexed to Power?</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> does often call his Sovereign <hi>God's Lieutenant,</hi> and his <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> and <hi>Sovereign under God;</hi> he affirms that he governs <hi>in God's ſtead,</hi> and that <hi>from him,</hi> and <hi>under him</hi> he hath <hi>Authority to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.</hi> He agrees with the Doctor then, that the Right of Government does flow from God's Authority; ſo that ſtill it ſeems impoſſible to diſtinguiſh their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>

But here he pretends to give a very plain Reaſon for it, the ſuram of it is this, <hi>That Allegiance is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>due only to God's Authority, and no one has it but the actual King.</hi> And if this be not a very plain Reaſon, let every one be judge, that can diſtinguiſh Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning from Affirming. But Propoſition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making was by this time grown cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the Doctor; he was forced to make up a round number by Tautologies and Repetitions, and now having exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſtock of Poſtulates, he endeavours next to fortifie them againſt two Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he imagined might be raiſed againſt them.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>does a legal Right ſignifie, if it do not command the Allegiance of Subjects?</hi> Why according to the Doctor, certainly it ſignifies nothing; for the legal Right of the Diſpoſſeſſed Prince can give him no Right to the Crown, againſt the Right of divine Authority; the divine Right to all intents and purpoſes muſt null the legal; therefore if this continue ſtill to be a Right, it is a Right to nothing. But a <hi>great Writer</hi> is worth nothing, that cannot defend Abſurdities and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and thus the Doctor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours it.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>He anſwers, that ele legal Right bari all other humane Claims, no other Prince can challenge the Throne of Right.</hi> The plain meaning of this is, That if the legal Right can be in one Prince, it is not in another; which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> an admirable Proof, that the legal Right does ſignifie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. When <hi>Oliver</hi> uſurped, <hi>Charles</hi> II. had a legal Right to the Throne, but <hi>no Allegiance was due to his bare legal Title without God's Authority,</hi> and yet this legal Right did ſignifie ſomething; for if <hi>Charles</hi> had a legal Right to the Throne, than neither the <hi>French King,</hi> nor the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> nor the <hi>Great Mogull,</hi> could have a legal Title to it; and though <hi>Oliver</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſetled in the actual Adminiſtration of Sovereign Power had a divine Right, yet the legal Right did ſignifie ſomething to King <hi>Charles,</hi> though it was null'd by the Divine; and though it made him not a King, (<hi>for that is the name of Power,</hi>) and left him no Subjects, (becauſe no Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was due to him.) Thus the legal Right of a Diſpoſſeſſed Prince is only a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96186:10"/>
Feather in his Cap, it conſtitutes him only an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> King, yet without ſo much as imaginary Subjects. But he tells us.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That Subjects are bound to maintain the Rights of ſuch a Prince, as far as they can, that is, againſt all Mankind, but not againſt God's diſpoſal of Crowns.</hi> But who is this <hi>ſuch a Prince?</hi> Is he a Prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned and diſpoſſeſſed of his legal Right? Of <hi>ſuch a Prince</hi> the Doctor is Diſcourſing, and if ſuch a one he means, How can the Subjects he bound to maintain his Right as far as they can, when they are bound as far as they are able to oppoſe it; their whole Allegiance being due to the Poſſeſſor? And thus the Obligation to maintain the diſpoſſeſſed Prince muſt be expounded as a Duty to deſtroy him. But if his legal Prince be ſuch an one as is not diſpoſſeſſed, but has either a Right to the Throne upon the Demiſe of the Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, or is actually in Poſſeſſion; then I ſay he ſpeaks not to the Objection; for the Objection relates to the Caſe of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Prince, excluded from his Right, by the Intruſion of another, the Caſe which he propoſes in the preceding Paragraph, <hi>When he who has the legal Right is not our King.</hi> (i. e. <hi>has not Poſſeſſion,) and he who has not i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Well! but ſuppoſe a Prince with a legal Title to a vacant Throne, How can the Subjects he bound to maintain his Right, ſince they are not his Subjects, and owe him no Allegiance? For, according to the Doctor, Subjection and Allegiance are due only to Poſſeſſors, and not to a bare legal Title without it. Maintenance therefore. In ſuch a Caſe, can be only a Debt of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, becauſe it is due by Law and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ſame Debt will continue, when the rightful Prince is wrongfully Diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; for the legal Right is the ſame, and the ſame Law and Equity for reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a due, as giving it at firſt. But far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuppoſe that he means a rightful Prince in actual Poſſeſſion; ſuch a one hath both legal Right and God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and, yet the Doctor denies after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that Subjects in ſome Caſes are bound to maintain them; and thus as a legal Right does ſignifie nothing with him here, ſo neither does God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hereafter. He eludes and trims, and diſtinguiſhes them away as often as he has occaſion; he grants Allegiance to Power without Right, and denies it to lawful Right and God's Authority together.</p>
               <p>The other Objection he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds is this, <hi>If we have Sworn</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Allegiance to a lawful Prince, and his Heirs and lawful Succeſſors, How can we pay Allegiance to any Prince, while He, or any of his Heirs and legal Succeſſors are living, and claim our Allegiance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating our Oaths?</hi> And the ſumm of his Anſwer is, <hi>That an Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made to any King, can oblige no longer than he continues to be King, (i. e.</hi> in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion;) <hi>for if it did, it would oblige us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Duty, and ſo become a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> unlawful Oath.</hi> I acknowledge this Anſwer would be good, if he had ſufficiently proved, that Allegiance is always, and only due to the Poſſeſſor; and whether that be done, let every one judge as he ſees Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Were it here pertinent, it would be eaſie to prove, That our Oaths were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bind us to the lawful King and his Heirs, even in the Caſe of Diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo all honeſt Men did underſtand them in the Age of Uſurpations, and till of late they were never otherwiſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, but by a few wretched Slaves of the Uſurpers. All the faithful Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> thought them Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory, when their Princes were Diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; they thought it no breach of Duty to ſtick ſo a righteous Cauſe, when it proved Improſperous; and as long as the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96186:10"/>
                  <hi>Man was in bring,</hi> they never looked upon <hi>the King as gone.</hi> The truth is, they were not wiſe in their Generation, and they underſtood not that Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal<note place="margin">Leſſius <hi>de Jure &amp; Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. p.</hi> 79.</note> Evaſion, which would have been worth more than the whole World unto them, That when the King is depoſed, <hi>tum definit eſſe Princeps;</hi> which, if it be true Doctrine, the Conſequence of <hi>Leſſius</hi> the Jeſuite is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, <hi>quod quidquam licet in eum at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentare,</hi> he becomes a private Perſon, and may be lawfully murthered.</p>
               <p>In the next Paragraph he obſerves, that <hi>we do not ſwear to keep the King and his Heirs in the Throne, which may be impoſſible for us to do againſt a proſperous Rebellion.</hi> And who was ever ſo ſenſeleſs as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we ſwore to keep them in the Throne, when 'tis impoſſible to keep them; but I preſume we ſwore, that in caſe our King ſhould be thrown out by a proſperous Rebellion, we would not bind our ſelves to oppoſe his Reſtitution, by transferring our Allegiance to his Rebel; yet he argues that we did not, becauſe <hi>ſuch an Oath would be unlawfull, as contrary to that Duty we owe so the divine Providence,</hi> which conveys God's Authority to the Uſurper. Thus the ſame precarious Aſſertions are everlaſtingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated, but a Million of Repetitions will never amount to one Argument for them. And now having routed the Objections, he concludes thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe ſeem to be very plain Propoſitions, and to carry their own Evidence with them.</hi> Very plain and ſelf-evident Propoſitions! And why then could not the Doctor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them before the publiſhing of Biſhop <hi>Overall,</hi> and the Battel on the <hi>Boyne?</hi> Is it poſſible ſo great, ſo quick-ſighted a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be above a year in finding out ſelf-evident Propoſitions? Alas! poor, miſerable Swearers and Non-ſwearers, that cannot ſee that which is as clear as the Noonday, and carries its own Evidence with it? How unhappy are they that have not the Doctor's Spectacles, by which he is able to ſee clearly through Mountains, and to diſcern things dark and inviſible to others! But after all, 'tis well theſe bright Propoſitions do carry their own Evidence and are known by Intuition; for it ſeems to me that the Doctor hath given them no additional Luſtre, he has hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them without Proof, and if they are not innate Ideas, they ſeem to be altogether as indemonſtrable.</p>
               <p>But if theſe Propoſitions are true, they are <hi>a very plain Direction to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>in all Revolutions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And the Direction in ſhort is this: <hi>They muſt have no hand in the Revolution, and oppoſe it as far as they can, and not be haſly in complying; but when ſuch a Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, they muſt pay Allegiance to the new Prince, as inveſted with God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Now his Direction is every whit as plain as his Propoſitions; in the days of the Unlawfulneſs of Reſiſtence the contrary Direction was then very plain and evident with him, but it is the ſingular Prerogative of great Writers to alter the nature of Things with the Alteration of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in all their Changes to carry Evidence, Perſpicuity, and Demonſtration with them. But yet the Direction is not ſo very plain neither; for even the Doctor himſelf was ſenſible there remained ſtill a very conſiderable Difficulty, which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours next to remove, and to give us <hi>more plain Directions</hi> about it.</p>
               <p>The Difficulty is to know when a Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is ſo perfectly completed, or when a new Prince is ſo fully inveſted with God's Authority, as to have a Right to our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; but the Doctor, according to his way, does very eaſily reſolve it: <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is due to God's Authority, and when we can reaſonably conclude, that God's Providence has ſettled the new King in the Throne, we muſt pay our Obedience to him.</hi> But how comes Settlement here to be the onely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of God's Conveyance of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Does not all his Reaſoning conclude as ſtrongly for all Poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power, without reſpect to Eſtabliſhment? <hi>God removeth and ſetteth up Kings onely by his Providence, and he ſets up a King when by his Providence be puts Sovereign Authority in his hands; every advancement to a Throne, whether ſetled or unſetled, is an Event, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96186:11"/>
therefore ordered by God's Will and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and peculiarly ordered by him, at ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo great an Influence upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World; and this will be farther confirmed, when we remember that Kings are God's Miniſters, and are inveſted with his Authority; all Authority is God's, and no Man can have God's Authority, but he to whom it is given; and yet 'tis very plain, that Princes that are not fully ſettled, are in Authority. We muſt not allow that God at any time permits Men to make themſelves Kings, whom he does not make Kings; for then we can never diſtinguiſh between God's Kings, and Kings of their own making; and it is impoſſible there ſhould be a wrong King, unleſs a Man could make himſelf King whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will or no: And therefore a King whoſe Poſſeſſion is not firmly eſtabliſhed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a wrong King, becauſe he is a King of God's making; he has the Authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his hands, and whoever has God's Authority is a true and rightfull King, and therefore our onely King; for we cannot have two oppoſite Kings at once, and conſequently our Allegiance is due onely to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, there is not an Argument in his Book which is not equally applicable to all Poſſeſſion whatſoever; either they prove Allegiance to all Poſſeſſors, or to none at all; but if they infer Abſurdities, rejected even by the Doctor, they muſt needs be falſe and fallacious; and <hi>if we cannot reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> when a Prince has the Adminiſtration of Sovereign Power, that <hi>God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let him ſhew the difference, if he can, let him demonſtrate to us the Reaſon, why a Prince when he is firſt advanced has no Right to Allegiance, and has when he is ſettled, though the ſame Providence does advance and ſettle him; why the ſame actual Adminiſtration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is a Sign of God's Authority when it is ſecure, and none when it is in danger; and let him reſolve us whether an unſettled Poſſeſſour be not a <hi>Power in being,</hi> and advanced by God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inveſted with his Authority; whether God's Advancement and Authority do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a Right to Allegiance; and whether the publick Good, the Preſervation of our ſelves, and of political Society, are but frivoldu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Arguments when an Uſurpation is doubtfull, and demonſtrative when eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. If he can unriddle theſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſhew all his Arguments to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive for a ſettled, and not for an unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Poſſeſſour, I will acknowledge him then to be the <hi>greateſt Writer</hi> under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But it is too much for any one to write precarious Propoſitions, and apply them by arbitrary Diſtinctions, and to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue as if all Mankind were Idiots, and as if there were no Logick nor Reaſon in the World.</p>
               <p>But as the Doctor diſtinguiſhes between ſettled and unſettled, ſo alſo between Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement and Settlement. <hi>In new Governments,</hi> he ſays, <hi>there muſt</hi>

But if he means the not attempting any thing againſt this Government while we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its Power, and are certain to be cruſh'd in the attempt, and the exerting our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance cannot be effectually ſerviceable to reſtore our Sovereign; a Subject indeed may lawfully promiſe thus to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and he might lawfully ſwear it, but that it ſeems to be taking God's Name in vain; for it would be a vain and trifling Oath, ſuch as would give no Security to the Impoſers, and ſhould be impos'd upon none but Mad-men.</p>

No doubt they may do ſo, as long as they are in the Enemies Power, but as ſoon as that Power or Force is removed, and the Subjects are in a capacity of exerting their Allegiance, then the reaſon of living peaceably ceaſes, and the paying actual Allegiance to their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96186:12"/>

               <p>2. <hi>We muſt pay Taxes to them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>for theſe are due to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Government, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves; for this Cauſe pay ye Tribute alſo, for they are the Miniſters of God attending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually on this very thing.</hi> The Powers to whom Tribute is to be paid, are there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid to be the Miniſters of God, and to be ordained by him; they are therefore ſuch Powers as have a right to Allegiance, and the Doctor in the next Section does argue upon that ſuppoſition. And yet here he argues from this Text, That Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is due to ſuch Powers as have no right to Allegiance, and therefore are not God's Miniſters, nor Ordained by him. If Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance be always, and only due to God's Authority, (as he affirms in his ſelf evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Propoſitions,) and if they who have not God's Authority are not his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, nor his Ordinance, and Tribute is due only to God's Miniſters, becauſe it is enjoyned to be paid for that Reaſon only, than the Conſequence is, That ſuch Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as are not throughly Setled have no right to Tribute, becauſe they have no right to Allegiance. The Apoſtle requires Taxes to be paid to God's Miniſters; and if they who adminiſter the Government are not God's Miniſters, they cannot claim them from the Apoſtle. Taxes are due to the Miniſters of God, as <hi>attending conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually</hi> on the Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but if they are hindred from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, by the Rebellion or Revolt of their Subjects, Are the Subjects then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from paying them, becauſe they have wickedly Rebelled or Revolted from him? In a time of Rebellion, Is nothing due to the Sovereign, becauſe he can't ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Government? And if a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign forfeits all his Rights, when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to adminiſter it, May it not equally be argued from the Apoſtle, that he forfeits his Crown, if he is not a <hi>t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

               <p>To the Text of the Apoſtle he adds this Reaſon, <hi>If we owe the ſecure</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Poſſeſſion of our Eſtates to the Protection of the Government, let the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be what it will, we ought to pay for it.</hi> No doubt we may pay Taxes to an Uſurper, as we may deliver our Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to a Robber; in both Caſes it is lawful to give that which we cannot keep: But to pay Taxes voluntarily when we can avoid it, is no more our Duty than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a Robber with our Purſes, when we can eaſily ſave them. If it is our Duty, it muſt be either on the ſcore of Gratitude or Juſtice; but ſince the payment of Taxes muſt neceſſarily ſtrengthen the Uſurper, and enable him to reſiſt and to deſtroy the rightful Sovereign, it muſt neceſſarily be Injuſtice to pay them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is unjuſt to ſupport Injuſtice, and to contribute voluntarily to the overthrow of a juſt and righteous Cauſe. And if the Contribution be unjuſt, it cannot be a Debt of Gratitude, for that does never oblige us to Injuſtice; and conſequently though the Uſurpers Protection be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, (as receiving Quarter from the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti</hi> is a Benefit,) yet this cannot oblige me to ſupport him in his Uſurpations, nor pay ſuch Taxes as are raiſed to eſtabliſh the unjuſt Power, and reſiſt the Rightful: I ought not to receive his Protection on that condition, nor purchaſe a Benefit to my ſelf by Perjury and Injuſtice. If it be a Duty to pay Taxes to ſupport an Uſurper that is not throughly ſettled, Why ſhould it not be a Duty to pay Allegiance to him? If we aſiſt him with Money, we may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him with Counſel, Prayers, and Arms; we may fight for him with our Perſons as well as with our Purſes; and if we do all this, we pay him plenary Allegiance. But ſince the Doctor does not require Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to an Uſurper doubtfully ſettled, the Subjects cannot be obliged to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their Aſſiſtance to ſupport him; for that is the principal Duty of Allegiance, nor conſequently to pay him Taxes for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96186:12"/>
that purpoſe, for that is the principal and moſt powerful Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>We muſt give the Title of King</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſuch a Prince,</hi> and this he requires for two Reaſons; 1. <hi>Becauſe it is a piece of good Manners. 2. Becauſe he is indeed King while he adminiſters the Regal Power, tho we may not think him ſo well ſetled, as to all Intents and Purpoſes to own him for our King.</hi> What Title we are obliged to give him in good Manners. I leave to the <hi>Hera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lds</hi> and the <hi>Maſter of the Ceremonies</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but till I am better inform'd, if the Title does not belong to him, I cannot think it good Manners to call him that which he is not. But if he be King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, then a very little Senſe, without Skill in Heraldry, or Caſuiſtical Divinity, will ſerve to inform us that we muſt give him the Title of King; and this is one of the plaineſt Directions in his Book, that if he be King indeed, he has a Right to be called ſo. <hi>But he is indeed King while he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the Regal Power;</hi> and this is evident from what he affirms in <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. That King is the Name of Power: But <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. This King is one to whom Allegiance is due, and yet here he is indeed King to whom Allegiance is not due, as being not well ſetled in his Government, and who is not to all Intents and Purpoſes to be owned for our King. Thus we muſt give him the Title of King, becauſe he is a King, or at leaſt half a King, and yet in reality no King, becauſe he has no Right to Allegiance. But the Doctor may trifle and ſhuffle with Names as he pleaſes, he may give the Title of King, if he will, to every Rebel and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, to <hi>Oliver</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niello,</hi> for they adminiſtred the Regal Power for a time: But I hope he will not be offended if others follow not his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, if they call a Spade a Spade, and ſay that he has no Right to the Title of King, who has no Right to the Office, and no Right to Allegiance.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>We muſt pray for him under</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>the Title and Name of King; for we are bound to pray for all who are in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that a Prince is, who has the whole Government in his hands, and has power to doe a great deal of hurt, or a great deal of good.</hi> All this was true of <hi>Oliver,</hi> he was viſibly in Authority, had the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his hands, and had power to doe a great deal of Hurt or Good, were the Clergy therefore bound to pray for their Sovereign Lord King <hi>Oliver?</hi> In thoſe days the Sons of the Church were of another Mind, they eſteemed it infamous and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to thruſt their lawfull Sovereign out of their Prayers, to make room for the Uſurper; and to ſtile him their Sovereign Lord, their King, or their Protector; and yet <hi>pray for all in Authority</hi> was then a Text in the Bible. What does the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle mean by all in Authority? Not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all that have the Adminiſtration of it, for then Pyrates, Robbers and Rebels will be comprehended in that Expreſſion: But the Motive or Reaſon annexed is a clear Limitation of it, we muſt pray for them, <hi>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life;</hi> which ſhews we muſt here underſtand ſuch Authority as is for the Quiet and Peace of of Society, and ſuch are all lawfull Powers, even the moſt Tyrannical; but ſuch are not the Uſurpers of that Authority that belongs to others, whether Rebels, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or titular Tyrants; for theſe are the great Enemies of Society, their Uſurpation of their Authority tends to its Subverſion, and conſidering its natural and ordinary Effects, it can never be expected that <hi>a quiet and peaceable Life</hi> ſhould be attained under them. But the Doctor underſtands by the Expreſſion, <hi>ſuch as have the whole Government in their Hands, though they are not perfectly ſettled.</hi> And whoſe Authority have they? Certainly God's Authority, for according to him, <hi>the whole Authority of Government is God's;</hi> but if they have God's Authority, his Propoſitions give them a Right to Allegiance; and to what purpoſe then is his Diſtinction of a through Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And if they have not his Authority, how impertinent is the alleadging that Text for a Right to our Prayers? We are bound to pray for all Men, for private and publick Enemies, for Thieves and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and Uſurpers; but we are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally obliged to this out of Charity to their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96186:13"/>
Souls, and therefore we muſt pray chiefly for their Repentance and Converſion, and to pray thus for Uſurpers, (that God would bleſs them thus with the chiefeſt of his Bleſſings,) is (as ſays the Doctor) <hi>ſo far from being a Fault, that it is a Duty, while we do it in ſuch terms as not to pray againſt the Diſpoſſeſſed.</hi> But if in the late Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a Doctor had ejected <hi>Charles,</hi> and inſerted <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and had prayed in theſe Terms, <hi>Bleſs we beſeech thee our Sovereign Lord King</hi> Oliver, I preſume, <hi>the Maſter of the Temple</hi> would have been as forward as any Man to charge Hypocriſie, baſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, and breach of Allegiance upon him. And Reaſon would have made good the Charge; for to pray for <hi>Oliver,</hi> as our Sovereign Lord, is to acknowledge before God and Man that he is ſo; and to teach the People to acknowledge him, and to pay him that Subjection and Allegiance that is due to a Sovereign. Is not Prayer for a King one of the principal Expreſſions of Allegiance? And when we pray for the Uſurper in the room of the lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, does not the very nature of the thing require this Interpretation, that we do not own him for our King, whom we thruſt out of our Prayers, and that we have transferred our Allegiance, where we pay the moſt benefical Expreſſion of it? this is the general Senſe of the People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, and he that can ſatisfie his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to own an Uſurper for his King and Sovereign Lord in the moſt Solemn Manner that can be, tho he owns no Allegiance to be due to him, when the Reaſon for which he does it, the Nature of the Thing, and the Conſtruction of the People do imply an acknowledgment of Allegiance, may I think be ſatisfied in any thing, and need not ſcruple any Compliance whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Directions about Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a Government not throughly ſettled, to which Allegiance is not required; but tho he requires it not here, in the Sequel of his Diſcourſe he infers it as a neceſſary and indiſpenſible Duty: for when he<note place="margin">

                     </gap> this a Civil Government, to which God's Authority and Allegiance is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential. 2. I would ask whether Self-Preſervation, publick Good, and Gratitude for Protection do oblige me to obey and ſubmit to the Prince who governs, and to wiſh and pray for, and do my utmoſt to endeavour his Proſperity? if it does I ſee no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and Allegiance; if it does not, then I am at liberty to diſturb the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay am under an Obligation by my former Allegiance to do it, when I can; and how does this contribute to the Safety of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties? 3. Suppoſe ſuch a Prince ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an Oath of Allegiance, and the Subjects according to their Duty ſhould refuſe it, and the Prince had Power to compel them, what muſt be the effect of this, but the utter Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Nation?</hi> But there is no need of tranſcribing the reſt of his Diſcourſe, it will be obvious to every one that conſiders it, that it is applicable throughout to his own Directions for Submiſſion without Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance. Thus the Doctor does engage the Doctor, his Arguments do overthrow his Directions, or his Directions his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. His Propoſitions prove that Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance is due to every Uſurper, his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deny it, and his Arguments againſt the Biſhop do again infer it; let him chooſe the one or the other, either Allegiance is due to all Uſurpers, and then he loſes Bp. <hi>Overal's</hi> Convocation-Book, ſeveral
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96186:13"/>
Pages of his own Book, and innumerable paſſages about a through Settlement: Or it is due only to Uſurpers that are ſettled, and then his Propoſitions and all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from Scripture, and almoſt all from Reaſon are irrecoverably gone. The World knows he can prove which he pleaſes, but I think he is not ſo great a Writer, as to be able to prove Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

If a <hi>little Writer</hi> had made ſuch a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, How unmercifully would the great Judges have treated him, he had certainly loſt all his Credit in conveyancing for ever; and doubtleſs nothing can be more abſurd, than to pretend that a Deed of Conveyance is a good Settlement, when there is one way to defeat it; or that a Government is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled, when there is viſibly one way to over-throw it. Why ſhould not a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proſpect of Reſtoration by Foreigners ſpoil a Settlement, as well as a proſpect of effecting it by Subjects; is it becauſe <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners will be no gentle Maſters?</hi> We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well when the Government of rebellious Subjects was the moſt cruel Tyranny that ever the Nation felt. But be they hard or <hi>gentle Maſters,</hi> what is that to a Settlement? The point is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Government of the reſtored Prince will be gentle, but whether there be a proſpect of Reſtoring him, for if there is, it is a plain Demonſtration that there is no through Settlement. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion then upon Foreigners, was in the bottom only an Amuſement; it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for nothing but to throw Duſt in our Eyes, and to create a weak Prejudice, to ſupply the want of Argument.</p>
               <p>We return then to that which is the only colourable Proof of a through Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement; <hi>When the Power of the diſpoſſeſſed Prince is broken, and there is no viſible proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a Reſtoration.</hi> Nothing is more arbitrary and various, than the proſpect which Men have of future Revolutions; almoſt every Man has a peculiar Proſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive through which he looks, and every one looks through his own Organs and his own Prejudices. Men of Sanguine Complexion, whoſe Spirits are brisk and volatile, as they happen to be prepoſſeſſed, will judge a Prince's Condition to be hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or deſperate upon every little turn of Providence; the Melancholick and Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96186:14"/>
on both ſides, will be always anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and aboding the worſt, either deſpair of a Reſtitution or eternally fear it, and never think the new Government to be ſettled enough: Even Men of a well ballanc'd Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, of ſedate and prudent Judgment, will yet have a different proſpect of Things; ſome will think a Prince irrecoverably loſt, and others who have as a good foreſight, will think his recovery probale. Not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity only of Temper and Judgment, but alſo the intricacy and obſcurity of the Matter and Object, and the conſtant viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of humane Affairs, muſt neceſſarily occaſion difference of Opinions; even the moſt able and skilful Politicians are often deceived in ballancing of Governments, and paſſing judgment on their Strength and Stability; and if hereunto we add, that the Decrees of God, who governs Governments, are unſearchable; that his Providence is an unfathomable Abyſs; that he often lifteth up the Poor out of the Duſt, and levels proud Uſurpers with it; that in Hiſtory there are innumerable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Princes and Governments Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed and Exalted from the very bottom of Deſpair; and in fine, that we are aſſured by Experience, that the moſt improbable and unexpected Events do happen almoſt as often as thoſe that are moſt probable and moſt certainly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When all this, and much more is conſidered as it ought, it muſt needs be acknowledged, That the Judgments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the final Depreſſion of a diſpoſſeſſed Prince, and the ſecure Eſtabliſhment of an Uſurper, muſt be exceeding difficult, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and uncertain; and then the reſult is, that ſeeing it is hardly poſſible to be aſſured of a through Settlement, as the Doctor underſtands it, and ſeeing Men of the beſt Judgments are often miſtaken, and are never unanimous about it, and a very ſmall part of Mankind can be thought capable of judging it, the Conſequence is, that a through Settlement is no ſufficient direction for Allegiance.</p>
               <p>The Doctor gives this deſcription of a through Settlement, to determine the preſent Controverſie about Allegiance; but whether the diſpoſſeſſed Prince is ſo broken, that there is no viſible proſpect of his Reſtoration, we may be determined by the viſible Hopes and Fears of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Parties. 'Tis plain his Power is not totally broken, and 'tis a palpable abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to ſay that a Prince, who is ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a War, is abſolutely Conquered. <hi>Let not him that girdeth on his Armour boaſt himſelf, as he that putteth it off;</hi> the Event of War is always doubtful, and when the War is finiſhed, it will be time enough to triumph, and to talk of a through Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If the Doctor thinks it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence ſooner, his Opinion is contradicted by Experience and common Senſe, for no Man that has any Title to it, will believe that the purchaſe of War is ſecure before the War is over; or that an Uſurper is throughly ſettled in his Throne, when the depoſed Prince is purſuing his Right to it by War: That Reſtoration for which we have an annual Thanskgiving, was once eſteemed morally impoſſible without a Conqueſt by Foreigners, and the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nation, but with God it was not impoſſible, and that which has been may be. The Doctor has formerly told the World, <hi>That though</hi>

                  <hi>God for wiſe Reaſons may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permit ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations, yet while his Providence ſcoures the Perſons of the depoſed and baniſhed Princes from Violence, he ſecures their Title too; as it was in</hi> Nebuchadnezzar'<hi>s Viſion, the Tree is cut down, but the ſtump of the Roots is left in the Earth. The Kingdom ſhall be ſure to them after they ſhall know that the heavens do rule,</hi> Dan. 4. 26.</p>
               <p>In thoſe times the Right and Title of the natural Prince were of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that there could be no Settlement of the Uſurper, as long as a <hi>ſtump of the Tree</hi> remained; but Times and Principles are altered, and now ſays the Doctor, <hi>We muſt not take the</hi>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:96186:14"/>
The Doctor, no doubt, may conſider Settlement without Right, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that a Prince may be ſettled without it: But any one elſe may conſider it with relation to Right if he pleaſes; for a legal Settlement is, I hope, a Settlement; and 'tis as certain that the extinction of all legal Claims and Competitors, will contribute much to a through Settlement.</p>
               <p>We may conſider Settlement in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and in a legal, or moral Senſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Poſſeſſion, and in relation to Right. He that dwells in a Houſe, and keeps out the right Owner may be ſaid to be ſettled in it, becauſe he keeps Poſſeſſion, but enquire in <hi>Weſtminiſter-hall</hi> whether this be good Settlement, and the query will be eaſily reſolved. <hi>Oliver</hi> was ſettled in ſome ſenſe at <hi>White-hall,</hi> ſo he was in the Government; but that Settlement was thought to be of no validity in Law and Conſcience, nor did it give him a divine Right to the Palace and the Throne. Settlement is a Word of manifold and ambiguous Meaning, and muſt be always interpreted according to the nature of the Matter to which it is applied; when civil Property is the ſubject Matter, the very nature of the Thing requires it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the civil or legal Signification of it, and then (as it has been well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) it denotes two Things, peaceable Poſſeſſion and legal Right. This is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable in relation to private Rights, And why does it not require that Interpretation in reſpect to politick Dominion? Is that the ſenſe of all Lawyers when they ſpeak of private Eſtates? And is there any Lawyer that ever applied that Term to a Government uſurp'd and poſſeſs'd without Right? Is there any other good Author that called ſuch a Poſſeſſion a through Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The Lawyers have always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered Right as neceſſary to the firm Eſtabliſhment of any Poſſeſſion, and it would be a contradiction to their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to conſider otherwiſe; for if Right be not requiſite to the Settlement of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, there is an end of all Law, and there is no need nor uſe of it in the World.</p>
               <p>When a Man is <hi>Poſſeſſor malae fidei</hi> (and ſuch are all Uſurpers) the Lawyers do not account him to be throughly ſettled in his Poſſeſſion; for as he is bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Reſtitution, ſo he may be ejected by Law; and they never look upon him as ſettled till he becomes a lawful Poſſeſſor and has acquired a legal Right by Preſcription of a 100 Years, or time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial, in which they preſume a Dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of the true Proprietor. Their Doctrine is the ſame concerning the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Rights of Sovereignty; they never ſuppoſed it to be eſtabliſhed without Right; they affirm the Uſurper (as long as he is ſuch) is bound to <note n="*" place="margin">Navarre. 26.

               <p>But the Law of <hi>England</hi> is yet more rigid in requiring legal Right, it differs from the Civil Law in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Preſcription; (<note n="b" place="margin">Finch's Diſc. of Law, p. 132.</note> for by the Common Law Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription maketh no Right in Land,) but the difference is in favour of Right againſt Poſſeſſion, which cannot in any tract of time advance to a legal Settlement, when an antecedent legal Right can be made out againſt it. And can we think that the Law is more careful of private Property than of Sovereignty, of Lands and Tenements than of the Royal Crown and Dignity? That it has provided that the Rights of the Subjects be Sacred, Inviolable, and Eternal, and hath left the Crown to every one that can catch it, though all the Eſtates in the Realm are held in Fee of the Crown, and are deriv'd Originally from it? On the contrary, the Favour and Preſumption of the Law is always for the King; no time is allowed to preſcribe againſt his Rights; it is the firſt <note n="c" place="margin">Caſe of the Poſtnati, p. 36.</note> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Law that his Crown is Hereditary, it is entailed on his Poſterity for ever. <note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. 68.</note> Deſcent is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be a Title ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than all others, it being an undoubted Title made by Law, it cannot be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any other Title. <note n="e" place="margin">Cook in Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin's Caſe.</note> Allegiance is not due to the Crown, but to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Perſon of the King, which is ever accompany'd with the Politick Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <note n="f" place="margin">Judge Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin's Works, p. 22.</note> it is due to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body by Nature, God's Law and Man's Law, cannot be forfeited nor renounced by any Means, it is inſeparable from the Perſon; and it has been ſaid to be due to him, <note n="g" place="margin">Poſtnati, 104.</note> even when he is driven out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

Theſe Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Parliaments were as illegal as the Uſurpations, they could not alter the nature of things, lawful Parliaments did always declare them to be invalid and null, the whole Body of the Nation have rejected and made no account of them, and they never yet were effectual to eſtabliſh Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation: But they who had no Right thought the Pretente and Opinion of it neceſſary to a Settlement, they knew that Parliaments were the beſt Inſtruments to delude the People, and therefore they made them to recognize Force and Uſurpation to be Right and Inheritance; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of Uſurpers is an evident Proof that it has been the Univerſal Senſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Laſtly, I appeal to the Senſe and Reaſon of Mankind, whether according to the natural courſe of things there can be a through Settlement of an Uſurped Power, while the rightful Prince is actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting his Right.

Nature and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Common Intereſt of Mankind do conſpire for Right and Juſtice, againſt Injury and Oppreſſion; and 'tis not likely they ſhould be eſtabliſh'd in ſpite of ſo powerful a Combination. Laſtly, it was never yet known in this Nation, that a Legal Right to the Crown, when proſecuted, was totally deſerted, or a through Settlement acquir'd without it, and therefore I conclude that Reaſon and Experience do aſſure us, that Right is neceſſary to a through Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Reſult is this, that ſeeing the Civil Law, the Law of Nations, the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Practice of Uſurpers, the conſtant Senſe of the People, and even Reaſon it ſelf do unanimouſly agree in proving the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Right to Settlement; it is very unreaſonable to conſider Settlement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, or when we meet with it in any Author, to give it ſuch an Interpretation as is warranted by no good Writer, and is contradictory to Law and Practice, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Experience; and when on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it may fairly be interpreted in a ſenſe agreeable to them.</p>

               <p>IN the former Section the Doctor has laid down Propoſitions which he aſſerts to be <hi>plam, and to carry their own Evidence with them;</hi> but if that be true, the reſt of his Pamphlet is Supererogation: for what need of lighting Candles to the Sun, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more Evidence to the greateſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that can be, and of confirming ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Truths by ſuch Mediums as are not ſelf-evident. Indeed the Doctor was conſcious that they were not evident, but that there was need of urging more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confirm them, and of anſwering material Objections againſt them. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins firſt with Arguments from Scripture; and here</p>

of <hi>England,</hi> that expounds this paſſage as requiring Allegiance to Uſurpers; the whole Church in the late age of Uſurpations, thought the higher Powers in the Apoſtle to be the rightful Powers, who were then diſpoſſeſſed, and they acted accordingly in defiance of Conſiſcations, Priſons, and Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. But the Revolution has turn'd Mens Heads round, and together with new Lords and Laws, we have new Reaſons and new Reſolutions of Caſes, and to ſupport a new Government, new Interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Doctor himſelf has expounded otherwiſe in his Caſe of Reſiſtance, and in thoſe Days his Expoſition was authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and the current Doctrine of the Church. But now Caſes are changed, The Caſe of Allegiance confounds the Caſe of Reſiſtance, and Uſurpers whom he once excluded out of the Text, do in their turn exclude the rightful Powers, and which is more, that which was then thought mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly falſe, is taken now for <hi>little leſs than Demonſtration.</hi> We will try however to reſcue this Text to the rightful Powers attain, and it will be the more eaſie to do if, becauſe we may have the Doctor's Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>It is obſerved before, that the Doctor's new Expoſition does take in all Powers whatſoever, as well ſettled as throughly ſettled; and his Reaſons are applicable to both alike. <hi>The Scripture has made no diſtinction between ſettled and unſettled Powers, but the general Rule is, that all Power is the Ordinance of God, unſettled Powers are certainly Powers in being, and to ſay the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of ſettled Powers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> he ought to have ſaid it in expreſs Words, or elſe no body could have underſtood him only of Powers that are throughly ſettled: For then in order to the fulfilling of this precept, it would be neceſſary for Subjects to be well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>lled in Politicks, and to know exactly how much goes to a through Settlement, that they may know to whom they ought to pay Allegiance; And let any Man judge in what Perplexities this would involve the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men? Beſides this, the reaſon the Apoſtle gives for Submiſſion to higher Powers, is not a through Settlement, but the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God; and to this I add that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that only ſettled Powers are of God, had made the Apoſtle's direction ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for the great Queſtion would ſtill have been undetermined, what Powers are of God, and what Powers they muſt obey, if ſome Powers are of God, and ſome not.</hi> Thus the Doctor's Arguing does hold for all Uſurpers, or for none; but if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe Reaſons, the Rule muſt be reſtrained to Powers throughly ſettled, then it is certain thoſe Reaſons are Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, for they equally conclude againſt all Reſtrictions, and a Reaſon that proves too much, does prove nothing at all.</p>
               <p>But it is abſolutely neceſſary that the Rule be underſtood with ſome Reſtriction. Theſe Propoſitions, <hi>There is no Power but of God, and the Powers that be are ordain'd of God,</hi> if they be underſtood as ſimply univerſal, will comprehend the Power of Robbers, Pyrates and Rebels, the Papal Power, the Power of Anti-chriſt, and the Power of the Devil. It is univerſally true, that there is no Power but it is of God, and St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> nay the<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſ. 32. Conc. 2.</note> Scripture it ſelf, declares it to be true even of the Power of the Devil; And is this a good Reaſon for being ſubject to the Devil? Does it bind us to be ſubject to the Pope, or Anti-chriſt? Or does it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Subjection unto Thieves and Rebels? The whole ſcope of the Apoſtle, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Expreſſion, and right Reaſon, do require that theſe Powers be excepted out of the Rule; and let us ſee now whether there be not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame neceſſity for excepting of other Uſurpers.</p>
               <p>1. The deſign of the Apoſtle, and his manner of Expreſſion do require it. His deſign was to enforce Submiſſion as due to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, the Power then in being over the <hi>Romans:</hi> Thus the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

                  <hi>At the time of writing this Epiſtle the ſupreme Power was in the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperors, and therefore when St.</hi> Paul <hi>commands the</hi> Roman <hi>Chriſtians to be ſubject to the higher Powers, the plain meaning is that they ſhould be ſubject to the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperor:</hi> And again,<note place="margin">P. 121.</note> 
                  <hi>According to the Apoſtle's Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine thoſe Princes who where then in being, that is, the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperors, were advanced by God; the Powers that be,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Emperors who now govern the World are now ordained and appointed by God.</hi> Now if the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were lawful Powers, it is plain the Apoſtle required Subjection unto lawful Powers, and not unto Uſurpers; and the former general Propoſition, <hi>There is no Power but of God,</hi> muſt be reſtrained by the later, <hi>The Powers that be are ordained of God.</hi> The later Propoſition ſhews what Power he ſpeaks of in the former, and reſtrains it to this Senſe, <hi>There is no lawful Power but of God:</hi> This Interpretation is natural and agreeable to the common Rules of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting, and to the common Senſe and Reaſon of Manking; if the Apoſtle had liv'd in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chriſtians to be ſubject to the King then in being as ordained by God, Would this have been a good Argument for Subjection to the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> as the Ordinance of God? Could the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which required Allegiance to a lawful King be of any advantage to an Uſurper? And would not ſuch an Interpretation have appeared unreaſonable and unnatural? The Doctor excepts unſettled Powers out of the Rule, but he can give no other Reaſon for it, but that the Powers then in being were throughly ſettled; he muſt allow then that the ſame Reaſon will hold good for the exception of Uſurpers, if the ſame Powers were lawful.</p>
               <p>He ſaw himſelf that this Conſequence was unavoidable, and therefore to prevent the Force of it, he denies the <hi>Roman</hi>

                     <hi>Caſe of Alleg.</hi> P. 20.</note> Emperors to have been lawful Powers; affirms <hi>that for many Ages together the Titles of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperors were all of them either ſtark nought, or the very beſt of them very doubtful,</hi> and I believe he is the firſt that ever affirmed it. What, were their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles nought, and were they all Uſurpers for many Ages together? What Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Lawyer, or good Author, what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration or even probable Argument can be produce for ſo incredible an Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? But what have we to do here with the Emperors of many Ages? he knows that either <hi>Claudius</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> were the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers to whom Subjection is requir'd by the Apoſtle, and it was plainly his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſpeak to their Titles, if he intended to ſpeak to the purpoſe; but he declines this, (for it was impoſſible to prove them Uſurpers;) he ſays only in general, (and without proof he ſays it,) that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Titles were either <hi>ſtark nought or very doubtful.</hi> And is there no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween no Title and a doubtful Title? the Laws of Nature and Nations, and I believe the Municipal Laws of all Societies do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Poſſeſſion to be a good and lawful Right where the Title is doubtful, and the antecedent Right cannot be ſufficiently proved; if the Titles therefore of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors were doubtful they were lawful Emperours, and if Allegiance be due to ſuch, it is no good Conſequence that Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance is due to Uſurpers.</p>
               <p>He ſhould have prov'd that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors were manifeſt Uſurpers of that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty which was the Right of others, and he ſhould have prov'd this particularly of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Nero:</hi> But the Title of theſe Emperors was unqueſtionable; for, 1. They had no Competitors who claim'd a Right to the Empire, and therefore either there was no better Right, or it was extinguiſh'd by Dereliction. 2. Neither the <hi>Senate</hi> nor the <hi>Roman</hi> People had a good Right againſt them, for they had not that which they had parted with; that Right which they had, by their own Acts and Deeds they convey'd upon the Emperors. The <hi>Lex Regia</hi> which is mention'd in <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Code, and ſome Remains whereof are publiſh'd in <hi>Gruter</hi>'s Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is an authentick evidence of this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96186:17"/>
of their Right. It is very probable that this Law was renew'd at the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every Emperor, and it appears plainly from the Remains of it, that <hi>Auguſtius, Tiberius, Caius, Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> had the Imperial Power conferred on them by a written Law, and therefore they were lawful Emperors. It is certain they had all of them the concurrent agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Roman Senate</hi> and People; <hi>Claudius</hi> was firſt ſet up by the Soldiers, but the Senate ſoon conſented to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and ſwore Fidelity to him, and the Roman People, and all the Provinces received him as their Emperour; and the ſame univerſal concurrence there was to the Advancement of <hi>Nero,</hi> without any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Thus the Senate and People by expreſs Law, or by their Submiſſion and Oaths of Fidelity (which were as evident Declarations of their Will, as any Law could be) had transferred their Right upon the Emperors, and therefore had not that which they transferred, and there is no pretence of Right for any others; and then it is evident thoſe Emperors were Rightful Princes, becauſe they had a Lawful Right, and becauſe no other Right could be made good againſt them.</p>
               <p>The Doctor inſinuates this Prejudice againſt their Right, <hi>that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>

                  </gap>ill, there is an end of all Juſtice and Faith among Manking. But the Conſent of the Senate and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Emperors, may be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Reaſon, and Neceſſity, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good; there was no other way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Civil War and the Diſſolution of the Empire. We find in Hiſtory that this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon prevail'd upon the wiſeſt of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and ſince there are rational Grounds for their Conſent, why ſhould it be aſcrib'd to Fear and Folly, rather than to Reaſon or Wiſdom. In the conſent of a Multitude there may be as many Reaſons as Men; and therefore we muſt have regard only to their Act of conſenting, and not to their Reaſons; otherwiſe no conſent of a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will be valid, for the Reaſons of many of them will be always invalid, and ſuch as may be reſolv'd into ſome Paſſion or other. The Doctor adds, that <hi>it is plain</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>the Romans themſelves were great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, and had no other Right to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their Empire, but Conqueſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> always pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Juſtice in their Wars, and if their pretence was true, and the Right of Conqueſt in a juſt War be a good one, they had a juſt Right to their Acquiſitions; they obtain'd a juſt Right to many of their Provinces by the dedition of the former Sovereigns and by expreſs Compacts with them, and by the extinction of all Competitors. But in ſhort, it may ſuffice to anſwer, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they had a Right to their Provinces by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and the Law of Nations declares that to be a good one.</p>
               <p>This is all that the Doctor hath objected to the Title of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and for any thing he hath objected, their Title was juſt and lawful. He ſays, <hi>if we</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt obey ſuch Powers as the Roman Power was, I know very few Powers that we may not obey;</hi> and he had ſaid it to ſome purpoſe, if he had prov'd that Power to be Uſurpation. But I know no Powers that are more lawful, and if we are requir'd to obey ſuch Powers only, we are under no Obligation to be the Subjects of Uſurpers; if the Powers intended by the Apoſtle were lawful, then he requir'd Subjection only to lawful Powers, and to ſay that he ſpeaks of ſuch Powers is not <hi>gratis dictum.</hi> for there is evidence of it; if I were the Doctor, I ſhould ſay there <hi>is little leſs than Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That the Rule of the Apoſtle muſt be reſtrain'd to lawful Powers does ſeem evident, as from the Powers then in being, ſo alſo from the Nature of the Duty, and the Apoſtle's manner of expreſſing it.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96186:18"/>
Subjection or Non-Reſiſtance is the Duty requir'd; but Scripture it ſelf and the Law of Nations do allow Reſiſtance of Uſurpers; and therefore this Rule of Scripture ought not ſo to be interpreted as to prohibit that which is allow'd by Scripture and by the Conſent of Nations, eſpecially when it may be interpreted in a Senſe agreeable to them: Who can doubt but that the Recuperative Wars of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt the Nations that uſurp'd upon them, recorded in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> that the Reſiſtance of <hi>Abſalom</hi> by <hi>Joab,</hi> and other Loyal Subjects, and the Depoſition of <hi>Athaliah</hi> after a Settlement of ſix Years Poſſeſſion, are approv'd in Scripture? Does Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity any where forbid ſuch Recuperative Wars? Have not all Nations ever allow'd and practis'd them? And are not they allow'd by all Divines and Chriſtians, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>Quakers, Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians?</hi> But if ſuch Wars for the recovery of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Dominion are lawful; it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that Uſurpers may be lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and therefore they are not ſuch Powers as are declar'd by the Apoſtle to be God's Ordinance, and unreſiſtible. Nothing can be objected to this Argument, but that a Recuperative War may be lawful to the diſpoſſeſſed Sovereign, and yet unlawful to the Subjects; and this indeed is<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caſe of Alleg.</hi> P. 26.</note> aſſerted by the Doctor. But here it ſhall ſuffice to reply in ſhort, that if an Uſurper be God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and Miniſter, he has a Divine Right to the Throne, and therefore a Recuperative War againſt him is a War againſt God; it cannot be lawful to diſpoſſeſs any one of a Power for which he has God's Authority, no Truth and Principle can be more evident than this, and ſo the Reſult muſt be, either that the Uſurper is not God's Ordinance, or that a War to diſpoſſeſs him is abſolutely unlawful; if the Doctor chooſe the former, he overthrows his Book, if he chooſe the latter, he contradicts Scripture, the Law, and Practice of all Nations, the Judgment of all Lawyers, and almoſt all Divines, and aſſerts a Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which the L. <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>3. It ſhould be conſidered that an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one that reſiſts, oppoſes, and fights againſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; he is ſo, much more than a Rebel; for his Oppoſition is greater, and his Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation is onely proſperous Reſiſtance; all the Iniquity of Reſiſtence does lie in the Uſurpation of that Power which by divine Ordinance is inveſted in another; for when Reſiſters have a lawfull Right to the Power of the Sword, there is no Iniquity in their Reſiſtence, and they are not within the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Prohibition; that which makes them liable to Damnation is the uſurping the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Sword, and uſing it againſt thoſe who have a divine Commiſſion for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it: There can be no Reſiſtence without Uſurpation, and therefore Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers muſt be condemned by the Apoſtle as well as the Reſiſters, and if the Reſiſter in the Apoſtle does comprehend the Uſurper, it is impoſſible he ſhould be God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and have a Right to Subjection by virtue of his Authority.</p>
               <p>To this it will be objected, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is he who reſiſteth a Sovereign in Poſſeſſion, that ſuch a Reſiſter uſurps the Power of the Sword, and is liable to Damnation; but if by a proſperous Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence he gets Poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power, he ceaſeth to be an Uſurper, and has God's Authority; and the former Power is no longer the Ordinance of God, but is depoſed by him. The force of this Objection conſiſts in theſe two Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: 1. That Subjection is due to all Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſours of Sovereignty. 2. That a lawful Sovereign ceaſes to be God's Ordinance, when he is diſpoſſeſſed. But neither of theſe Propoſitions are affirmed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; he ſays not that every Sovereign in Poſſeſſion is God's Ordinance, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, there is now no Power over us, but of God, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the Powers now in being are ordained of God. It is very obvious that theſe Propoſitions are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the Powers then in being, and the former Propoſitions included in the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are univerſal, and every one that has but natural Logick, does know that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals are not comprehended in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96186:18"/>
As to the 2d Prepoſition, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile has given us no intimation how a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign that is God's Ordinance can ceaſe to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Doctrine is neither taught by the Apoſtle, nor by any of the inſpir'd Writers. The whole Scripture is a perfect Stranger to theſe two Propoſitions, and the <hi>great Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> for Uſurpation cannot produce any Text of Scripture, which contains them either expreſly, or virtually. To except the Uſurpers of Sovereignty out of the number of Reſiſters, is therefore a precarious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that has no Foundation in the 13th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor in any Chapter of the Bible.</p>
               <p>4. Let us then ſuppoſe that Reaſon is the ſole Judg of this Controverſie, Whether a Sovereign diſpoſſeſſed is no longer God's Ordinance? And whether a proſperous Reſiſter, who has uſurped the Sovereignty, is ordained by God, and has his Authority to govern? Theſe are not Propoſitions that carry their own Evidence, and from what Topicks ſhall we deduce them? From the politick Good and the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane Society? But this Proof will be as doubtfull at leaſt as the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be prov'd; not only becauſe it is a great Queſtion, whether the publick Good can ſet up Kings and depoſe them; but alſo becauſe it will ſeem evident to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the Encouragement of Reſiſtence and Uſurpation by conveying divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon every proſperous Reſiſter, and the unavoidable conſequence of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Wars, the greateſt Evil to Society, which will often end in Anarchy, and the Diſſolution of Society, are the things which are moſt deſtructive to the publick Good, and the Preſervation of Society.</p>
               <p>Are thoſe Propoſitions then to be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Topick of Providence? We all acknowledge that the World is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Providence; but this can be no Proof, that whoever gains any thing by any concurrence of Providence has God's Authority to keep it: If it were, theſe two Conſequences would be inevitable, 1. That God does authorize all the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and all the Wickedneſs in the World, for no Man can commit Wickedneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome concurrence of God's Providence, and if that be a proof of his Authority, then it neceſſarily follows, that God does authorize it. 2. That there is no ſuch thing as the Obligation of Juſtice; for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> there be, no doubt it binds us to render to every Man his due; but if it is impoſſible to get the Poſſeſſion of any thing without God's Providence, and that is always a Conveyance of his Authority; then he who has the Poſſeſſion of another's Property, has acquired a Divine Right to it, and there can be no Obligation upon him to reſtore it. And in ſhort, nothing can be due to a Man, which he has not in his Poſſeſſion; and therefore ſince <hi>ſuum ouiqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cribuere</hi> is the onely Office of Juſtice, and that Office is impracticable, it follows, that Juſtice is only an empty Word, that has no ſignificancy in it. Theſe are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate conſequences of that Doctrine which overturn at once the very Foundations of all Religion, civil Society, and Morality; and therefore we are as ſure that it is falſe, as that God is holy, that Juſtice is a Duty, or that Wrong is not Right, nor Vice Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>Providential concurrence thereof to the gaining of any Poſſeſſion, is in its ſelf no Proof of the conveyance of divine Authority, it neither deprives the former Poſſeſſor of his Right, nor transfers it to the new one; this is undeniable in the Caſe of private Property, and there is equal Reaſon to allow it in the Caſe of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty. Private Property and Sovereignty are different Things indeed, but the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right apply'd to both is the ſame, and the concurrence of Providence to the acquiring of both the ſame; and therefore if Providence extinguiſhes not the Right to one, neither does it ſo to the other; if it gives not a divine Right to Robbers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does it to Uſurpers: Since the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and co-operation of Providence is the ſame in bringing any one to the unjuſt Poſſeſſion of a Purſe, a Houſe, a City, and a Kingdom; and it is impoſſible for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96186:19"/>
to obſerve any difference as to the conveyance of Power, (though there be a difference in the extenſion of Power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the Uſurpation,) it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows, that from the preciſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Providence, Reaſon cannot poſſibly diſtinguiſh between God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Permiſſion, his conveying Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon an Uſurper and not upon a Robber, his eſtabliſhing the Poſſeſſion of a Throne by divine Donation, when he gives no Eſtabliſhment to the Poſſeſſion of a Robber.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, Reaſon ſeems to aſſure us, That God's Providence does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give Authority to Injuſtice; that Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery is not God's Ordinance; that great Robbers are no more authorized by him than little Robbers; that as Stealing of it ſelf introduces no Right, ſo neither does Rebelling no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Uſurping; that Proſperity in Wickedneſs is no Proof of a divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; laſtly, that if reſiſting God's Ordinance be unlawful, it is unlawful to carry on and continue that Reſiſtance, it is unlawful to reſiſt a King ſo far as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, and to uſurp his Throne; and if it be unlawful to reſiſt and to uſurp, it is unlawful to continue the Uſurpation by keeping Poſſeſſion againſt the rightful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; for that is only a continuation of his Injuſtices which increaſes his Crime; and if it be unlawful to reſiſt a lawful Prince, to depoſe him, to uſurp his Throne, and to continue the Uſurpation; it ſeems evident beyond all Contradiction, that an Uſurper while he is ſuch, is never eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by God's Authority; for that is never granted to unlawful Acts or Poſſeſſions. In ſhort, If it be unjuſt to uſurp, the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is bound to Repentance and Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he who has unjuſtly invaded another's Right, is bound in Juſtice to reſtore it: And if the Uſurper is bound to reſtore the Power he has uſurped, he cannot have a divine Right to that which he is bound to reſtore to another, and conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the Eſtablishment of divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This to me is the voice of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and if Reaſon is ſo far from proving that an Uſurper is God's Ordinance, that it proves the contrary; if that Propoſition is not to be found in the <hi>13th</hi> of the <hi>Rom.</hi> nor in any part of the Bible; if an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be properly a Reſiſter of God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; if the Examples in Scripture, and the Law of Nations do prove it lawful to reſiſt him; and finally, if the Powers to whom the Apoſtle requires Subjection were lawful Powers, than it is evident that the Rule of the Apoſtle muſt be underſtood of lawful Powers, and that there is as much evidence for excepting of Uſurpers, as there is for excepting Thieves or Rebels. Thus there is Reaſon to except Uſurpers out of the Rule; and this will appear more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable when we have examined the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Arguments againſt it.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96186:20"/>
Nations, which have always allowed the Reſiſtence of Uſurpers, do put that out of Queſtion; and therefore ſuppoſing the Goſpel has given us no diſtinction between rightful Princes and Uſurpers, that ſilence can be no Argument againſt it; for the Goſpel has left the Rights of Princes as it found them, it requires Subjects to render them thoſe Rights, and if by the Laws of Nations Allegiance is the right of lawful Princes, it is their Right alſo by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Where may we find in Scripture any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between a true and a falſe Father, a lawfull Husband or Maſter, and ſuch as uſurp thoſe Characters? Yet Subjection is required to Fathers, Husbands, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as well as to Sovereign Princes: but there was no need that the Scriptures ſhould declare, that it was due only to real Fathers, and to lawful Husbands and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; or that it ſhould give Rules to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from the Uſurpers of thoſe Authorities; common ſenſe is ſufficient to inform us, that ſuch a Diſtinction is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be made, and in ordinary caſes it is eaſie to diſtinguiſh them. The Scripture requires Obedience to Parents, but tells us not who they are, nor diſtinguiſhes real Parents from pretended, and yet no one thinks that final Obedience is due to the Uſurpers of that Authority. Suppoſe it to be in the Caſe of Subjection to Civil Powers, the Scripture requires it, but diſtinguiſhes not between lawfull Powers and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Muſt we therefore conclude, that it requires Subjection to Uſurpers? And why may we not conclude alike for the Uſurpers of paternal Authority? Is it becauſe Senſe and Reaſon do agree that Uſurpers muſt be diſtinguiſhed in the one Caſe, but not in the other? But Reaſon tells me plainly, that Obedience is not due to the Uſurpers of Civil Power; for he who has no Right to Power, has no Right to Obedience. The Foundations of Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Civil Authority may be different, but in both the Duty of Obedience muſt be founded on a Right to Obedience: nothing can be due to him who has no Right; as an Uſurper of paternal Power has no Right, ſo neither has the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Civil Power; he has neither a legal nor natural Right; and as for the Right of Providence, both the Uſurpers may lay an equal Claim to it, for they are both advanced by the ſame way of Providence. There is no more Reaſon therefore to pay Obedience to a Civil Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, than to the Uſurpers of the Power of Fathers, Husbands, or Maſters, and where there is a plain neceſſity of making a diſtinction, the ſilence of Scripture is no Argument againſt it.</p>
               <p>There is no expreſs Diſtinction in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between the legal and illegal Poſſeſſor of an Eſtate, there are onely general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions of Injury and Injuſtice, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precepts of rendring every Man his Due, but what Eſtates or Properties are due to every Man, is left to the Civil Laws of Nations to determine; and yet the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Scripture in theſe points, is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the Diſtinction of Right in private Poſſeſſions, and how can it hold good againſt the ſame Diſtinction in reſpect of Sovereignty? There is the like Reaſon and Neceſſity for admitting it in the one caſe, as there is in the other; if there be any difference, it is on the ſide of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, which is the preſerver of private Property, and of much greater Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and therefore in reaſon ought to be better ſecured, and the right to it be more inviolable; however if there be no diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture about the Rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, ſo neither about the Rights of Property; and therefore the Silence of Scripture is of itſelf no Argument againſt it.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe the Throne to be vacant, and two Competitours claiming it, and claiming a Right to our Allegiance, how ſhall the Conſcience of the Subject be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in this Diſpute? Here the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is perfectly ſilent, and gives him no particular Directions; but the Laws of the Land, and the Oath of Allegiance will direct him to pay his Allegiance to the true and lawfull Heir, if he knows him; and the Doctour acknowledges,<note place="margin">Caſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. <hi>p.</hi> 52.</note>

But ſuppoſe farther, that the falſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der does actually uſurp the Throne, and the lawful Heir does ſtill demand our Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Here again we ſuppoſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be ſilent, and that there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in it between rightful Princes and Uſurpers, and then it is evident, we can have no other direction but the Law of the Land, and if the Law determines our Allegiance to the rightful Heir, we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bound to obey the Law, becauſe it <hi>contradicts not the Laws of God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Force of this Objection, as far as I can apprehend it, is this: That learned Men who are skilled in Law and Hiſtory do often differ in their Opinions of a legal Right, and it cannot then be ſuppoſed that unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, who are the greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſhould be able to judge of it; and therefore it cannot be a Rule to them. But is not this Objection as ſtrong againſt the Law of God, as againſt the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? If nothing can be a ſufficient Rule to the unlearned, which the unlearned can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree in, Does it not plainly follow, that the Scripture cannot be a Rule of Faith to the unlearned, (who are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of Mankind,) becauſe the moſt learned do differ in interpreting it?

                  <hi>of Conſcience ought not to depend on ſuch Niceties of Law and Hiſtory as learned Men cannot agree about, and that is a Reaſon why legal Rights ſhould not be the Rule of our Obedience to Princes; but is this a Reaſon to reject the Directions of Scripture too, becauſe ſome Men will diſpute the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Texts?</hi> Well, but are not Law and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory in many things as plain as the plaineſt Texts in Scripture? And if thoſe can be no Rule of Conſcience becauſe learned men do raiſe Diſputes about them, does it not follow, that the plaineſt Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture can be no Rule of Faith, if the learned raiſe a Controverſie about them; if nothing can be a ſufficient Rule which has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the learned, neither Law, nor Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, nor Scripture, nor even Senſe or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are ſufficient Rules: for inextricable Difficulties have been raiſed about them by perverſe Diſputers. He will ſay, that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right depends on the Niceties of Law and Hiſtory, but Articles of Faith upon plain and evident Texts of Scripture; and yet even thoſe evident Texts are many of them perplex'd by the Niceties of Criticiſm, and the ſubtile Interpretations of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. The Scripture evidently teaches the Divinity of Chriſt; but the Doctor knows, (and no Man better) that the <hi>Socinians</hi> who deny it, do elude the plaineſt Texts, and by their Skill in Criticiſm do wrangle them into Niceties. A Rule then may be plain and ſufficient, though learned men do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it is difficult and obſcure, and ſay it <hi>depends on Niceties,</hi> and the Queſtion then is, Whether humane Laws may be a plain Rule to determine the Rights and Titles of Princes; for it is certain the Rule may be plain in its ſelf, though learned Men may make a Nicety of it.</p>
               <p>But nothing can be a more palpable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, than to ſay that Law cannot be a plain Rule of Right, for that is to ſay, that the Law giver cannot plainly declare his Will, and that no Controverſie about Right can be determin'd by Laws; and if the Law may be a plain Rule to determine the Rights of Subjects, may it not be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> plain about the Rights of Princes? Have not our Laws plainly declar'd the King to be irreſiſtible? Do they not plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him with the whole Power of the <hi>Militia?</hi> I know that learned Men do not agree in theſe Points, but I think the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor will grant that the Law is clear about them. And in the nature of the Thing there is no Reaſon, but it may be as clear about the Right and Title to the Crown; for may it not be plainly declar'd by Law, that the Crown ſhall deſcend by Hereditary Succeſſion, and that he who invades the Crown without this Right is an Uſurper, and has no Legal Right to Allegiance? this we believe to be our Law, and we believe it to be a plain and ſufficient Rule to the Subjects: But when we ſay that the Law is plain, we do not deny but learned Men may have another Opinion of it, we intend that the Law is plain in it ſelf, and may be made plain to Men of common Underſtanding, who will take the pains to inform their Judgment, and judge without Byaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and Intereſt. The very deſign of Law is, that it ſhould be a plain Rule of Right and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and it is a Rule to the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as well as to the Lawyers; it is preſum'd they may underſtand it, if they will, and the ignorance of Law is always preſum'd to be affected, and to be culpable as well as the Tranſgreſſion of it. To ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Law cannot be a plain Rule to the unlearned who are bound to obey it, is a plain Contradiction to the very nature and end of the Law, and is to charge it downright with Folly and Barbarity.</p>
               <p>There are many Difficulties in Law, as there are in Religion, and in both the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned muſt conſult the learned, the Lawyers and Divines; but they muſt judge alſo for themſelves, and judge rightly at their peril; if a Lawyer, or a Judge, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe

The Law no doubt requires our Allegiance to the legal King; but he who ſhould pay his Allegiance to another King, though he ſhould think him to be the legal King, his Miſtake would be no good Plea in Law againſt an Indictment for Treaſon; the reaſon is, becauſe the Law is ſuppos'd to be ſufficiently promulg'd to all, and therefore the ignorance of it is inexcuſable. In ſhort I demand, was not the Law of the Land ſufficient to inform all Men, that K. <hi>James</hi> the Firſt had a legal Right to the Crown, and that <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and the Second, had it ſucceſſively after him; was there any honeſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Man in <hi>England</hi> who ever doubted of their Right, and that when the two laſt were actually excluded from the Poſſeſſion of it? Nay, was the Right of K. <hi>James</hi> the Second, either unknown, or uncertain to any of that Character? I think the Doctor will confeſs that the legal Right of theſe Princes was among all honeſt Men certain and unqueſtionable; and thence it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that the Law of the Land may be a clear Rule of the Prince's Right and the Subjects Obedience, and if the Law may ſufficiently direct us how to diſtinguiſh between Rightful Princes and Uſurpers, there is no need of any other Direction.</p>
               <p>But though the Law be in it ſelf a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule as far as the intention of it reaches, yet Controverſies may alſo ariſe, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus in thoſe Kingdoms where there is a known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted Rule of Succeſſion, yet there are ſometimes Controverſies about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact which are neceſſary to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it; as for inſtance in Hereditary Kingdoms, who is the right Heir; in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, who is duly elected.

                     <hi>Puffendorf de Ju. Nat. &amp; Gen.</hi> lib. 7. c. 7. ſ. 15.</note> as it is thought there can be none in the Diſputes about the right to Succeſſion,) there is no other way but for every Man to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to examine the Competitors Evidence for their Claim and Title, to judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and to act accordingly. But it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not hence, that Law is an inſufficient Rule, becauſe it prevents not, or decides not all Controverſies about Right; for neither can Scripture, which we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be a ſufficient Rule in Religion, decide all Controverſies that relate unto it; for inſtance, it requires <hi>Chriſtians to obey them that have the Rule over them,</hi> not every one ſurely that intrudes himſelf into the Office of a Ruler, but only thoſe that are lawfully called to it; but who thoſe are the Scripture does not determine, that is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute concerning matter of Fact, and muſt be decided by ſuch Evidence as can be had concerning it.</p>
               <p>But when the matter of Right and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact is clear, (as ordinarily they are in the Rights of Sovereigns to their Crowns) then there is a plain Direction for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance of Subjects: But in caſes extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, when Right and Fact are doubtful, and there is no ſuch Evidence concerning them as may direct honeſt and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to the right Object of their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, in ſuch Caſes it is agreed, That if either of the Competitors be in Poſſeſſion, the Subjects muſt pay their Allegiance to the Poſſeſſor, for the Laws of Nature and Nations, declare Poſſeſſion to be a juſt Right when there is not a better, and Allegiance certainly is due where there is a juſt and lawful Right to it. And thus the unavoidable Defects of Political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions are ſupplied by ſuch Rules, as are founded on the Law of Nature and the Conſent of Nations; and therefore if the Scripture has only required Obedience to the higher Powers in general, and has left us to the direction of other Laws, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine which thoſe Powers are to whom

our Obedience is due; we are not left to Niceties and Uncertainties, but have as clear and plain direction as the nature of the Thing will admit, and reaſonable Men will expect no more.</p>

                  <hi>the Reaſon the Apoſtle gives for Submiſſion to the higher Powers is not a legal Right, but the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God; that all Power (or every one who exerciſes the ſupreme Power) is of God, and the Ordinance of God, which ſeems plainly intended to wave the Diſpute about the legality of the Powers.</hi> But, 1. This Objection does conclude as ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Principle as againſt his Adverſaries; he requires Allegience not <hi>to every one who exerciſes the ſupreme Power,</hi> ſo did <hi>Oliver;</hi> but to a Poſſeſſor through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled by the general Conſent of the People: But <hi>the Reaſon the Apoſtle gives for Subjection to the higher Powers,</hi> is not a through Settlement or the Conſent of the People, <hi>but the Authority of God; that every one who exerciſes ſupreme Power is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, which ſeems plainly to wave all Diſputes</hi> about Settlement and Conſent. He can make no reply which will not ſerve his Adverſaries; if he ſays that Settlement and Conſent are not the formal Reaſon of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, but only the Signs of God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to which it is immediately due; we ſay the ſame for our Principle; we confeſs that the Duty of Allegiance muſt be ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately reſolved into God's Authority; we only affirm that a lawful Right is a Sign of that Authority; we maintain that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance is due to God's Authority, and thus far we are agreed; But how ſhall we know when a Prince is inveſted with this Authority? When he is ſettled, ſaith the Doctor; when he has a lawful Right, ſay others; and here lies the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: If the Apoſtle had required Subjection to all Poſſeſſors for the ſake of Poſſeſſion, there could have been no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the legality of Powers; but ſince the Apoſtle's Reaſon of Subjection is not Poſſeſſion, but the Ordinance of God, and he does not ſay that every one who is in Poſſeſſion is ordained by God, (for <hi>every one who exerciſes the ſupreme Power</hi> is the Doctor's ſaying, and not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's,) it remains a Queſtion what Powers in the meaning of the Apoſtle are ordain'd by God, whether lawful only, or alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Powers; and if he means lawful only, the Diſpute about Legality is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable.</p>

                     <hi>Vind.</hi> p. 56.</note> of his Arguments from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. demands, <hi>How God does inveſt any Prince with his Authority, whom he does not immediately nominate?</hi> To this he Anſwers himſelf, and confutes himſelf, but my Anſwer is, That God annexes his Authority to thoſe Princes who have a lawful Right to govern, or to execute the <hi>Regal Office.</hi> And what ſays the Doctor? <hi>If God's Authority be annexed to the Regal Office, a Prince muſt be in the actual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Regal Office, before he can have God's Authority; as a Man muſt be actually Married before he can have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the Divine Laws give to a Husband.</hi> By Regal Office either he means the Duty in the Abſtract, and whoever ſaid that God's Authority was annexed to the Duty; or he muſt mean a Right to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, or the actual Execution of it; if he means the former, he aſſerts a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Abſurdity, That he who has a Right to an Office muſt be in the actual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it; if the later, he only aſſerts. That a Prince who actually adminiſters the Regal Power muſt be in the actual Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it; and thus this ſhew of Argument is nothing but an Amuſement, and ſo is the ſimilitude of an Husband; for the Relation of a Husband is ſubſequent to Marriage, and no Man can have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Husband before he is a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: But the Relation of a King is not founded upon Poſſeſſion, but upon a Right to govern, which implies a Right to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and we acknowledge that a King muſt actually have that Right, before he can have God's Authority; but this very inſtance of a Husband is a convincing Proof, that God's Authority may be given to thoſe that cannot exerciſe it, for that is the condition of many Husbands.</p>

                  <hi>a Right to the Crown the Authority of Government, is contrary to the Senſe of Mankind, when they ſpeak of Sovereign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For he has actual Authority, who actually adminiſters the Government, and it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Authority which is God's Authority, not Authority in Fancy and Idea, for God does not give Authority to govern without the Power of Government, which is a very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inſignificant Authority.</hi> The Reply is very obvious; a Right to the Crown is a Right to govern, and that implies Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to govern; and a Prince may have actually this Authority, and yet not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually adminiſter it: And this is ſo far from being <hi>contrary to the Senſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> that nothing is more conſonant to it; for all Men know that there may be Power without Authority, and Authority without Power, and there is no Man in his Wits but can eaſily diſtinguiſh them; and this is not an Authority <hi>which ſubſiſts only in Fancy,</hi> for it has a moral Efficacy and obliges to Obedience, and it might as well be ſaid that all Duty, Law and Right, are nothing but <hi>Fancy and Idea;</hi> but to ſay that <hi>God never gives Authority to govern without the Power of Government,</hi> is an Aſſertion manifeſtly falſe; Have not Parents, Maſters, and Husbands, Authority from God to govern, when they cannot govern thoſe that are ungovernable?

St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> affirms that the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Deſign was not to ſhew that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> did not tend to overthrow civil Polity, but rather to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it better; <hi>Theophylact,</hi> that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel did not teach Men Diſobedience and Rebellion, but Quietneſs and Obedience; and this is the common Senſe of modern Expoſitors, that the Apoſtle here intended to vindicate <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> from the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Diſloyalty and Rebellion with which it was reproach'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles. Calvin</hi> obſerves, that there are always tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Spirits in the Church, who think the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be advanc'd, unleſs all earthly Powers be aboliſhed; but the Jews above all others thought it an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity that the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who were a flouriſhing Kingdom before the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their Redeemer, ſhould after his Manifeſtation continue ſtill in Servitude: And not the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, but alſo the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> thought it abſurd to ackgowledge thoſe for their lawful Governours who did cruelly perſecute them, and endeavour to deſtroy the Kingdom of Chriſt: This laſt Objection is mentioned by <hi>Origen</hi> as aim'd at by the Apoſtle; and for theſe Cauſes, ſays <hi>Calvin,</hi> it is probable he was induc'd to give ſo ſtrict a Charge of Subjection to Governours. Thus it appears that Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors have Foundations, Deſigns, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for this Precept of Subjection: But as for the pretended Objection of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> it is at beſt but gueſſing, and no Argument can be deduced from it.</p>

We acknowledge that God ſets up Uſurpers, and <hi>gives them a Kingdom, Power, and Strength, and Glory;</hi> but he gives and ſets them up as he ſets up Robbers, Murtherers, and Rebels, by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them Power and Strength, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, or not hindring them from the Abuſe or wicked Exerciſe of it. In ſhort, when Providence ſets up Uſurpers, it is not by the conveyance of Authority, but onely by giving them power and liberty to abuſe it; the Power whereby they are enabled to ſubdue their Oppoſers is from God, but the Abuſe of it, to remove a rightfull Prince, and to uſurp his Throne, is mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from themſelves, and is no otherwiſe from God than are all other Acts of Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Injuſtice. There are two ways then whereby God removes and ſets up Kings, and gives the Kingdom of Men to whomſoever he pleaſes; by the Permiſſion of Power, and the Conveyance of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he permits a Prince the Poſſeſſion of a Throne, when it is unjuſt and unlawfull for him to poſſeſs and keep it, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys Authority when his Providence opens a way to the lawfull Poſſeſſion of it; and if the Paſſages inſiſted on may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this ſenſe, they are far enough from proving that Uſurpers have God's Authority.</p>
               <p>And that it is reaſonable to underſtand them in this ſenſe, will appear by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, them with other Paſſages of Scripture which aſſert the divine Providence in the Government of the World: <hi>The Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth rich, he bringeth low and lifteth up; he raiſeth the poor out of the Duſt, and lifteth

up the Beggar from the Dung-hill, to ſee them among Princes, and to make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit a Crown of Glory,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 7, 8. <hi>Thine is the Kingdom, O Lord, both Riches and Honour come of thee, and thou reigneſt over all, and in thine Hand it is to make Great, and to give Strength unto all,</hi> 1 Chr. 29. 4, 12. <hi>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away,</hi> Job 1. 21. <hi>and</hi> Pſ. 75. 6, 7. <hi>Promotion cometh neither from the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>nor from the</hi> Weſt, <hi>nor from the</hi> South, <hi>but God is the Judge; he putteth down one and ſetteth up another.</hi> It would be endleſs to produce all thoſe paſſages, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Riches and Poſſeſſions, Honour and Promotion, do proceed from God; but theſe may may ſuffice, for they unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably evince, that the Wealth and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of private Perſons is as much directed by Providence, as the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt Monarchs; that God giveth Riches as well as Kingdoms <hi>to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will;</hi> and that when private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are Enriched and Promoted by the Ruine of others, it is God that <hi>putteth down one and ſetteth up another.</hi> But now it follows not hence, that every one who is in the Poſſeſſion of Riches and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, does enjoy them by ſuch a Gift of God, as conveys Right and Authority to poſſeſs them; for then there could be no unjuſt Poſſeſſion of any Thing, ſeeing every Man would have a divine Right to what he actually Poſſeſſes; and therefore there is a neceſſity of Expounding thoſe Paſſages ſo, as to diſcharge God from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author of Injuſtice, to reconcile his Providence with the Rules of Right and Wrong, and to diſtinguiſh it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moral Nature of the Poſſeſſion to which it concurrs. When Riches are taken away from the rightful Owner, we may ſay as <hi>Job</hi> did, that <hi>the Lord hath taken them away,</hi> and that he hath given them to the wrongful Poſſeſſor; but this muſt be interpreted only of his permiſſive Providence, unleſs we will ſay that all Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have God's Authority and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But when God's Providence, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Poſſeſſion of Riches, conveys a Right to poſſeſs them, we are ſure this Providence is more than Permiſſive, and that Riches ſo acquired are properly, and ſtrictly the Gift of God. Undoubtedly it may be ſaid of Riches, that God <hi>giveth them to whomſoever he will;</hi> but it would be plainly inconſequent to conclude from ſuch Expreſſions, that every one who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes Riches does hold them by a Divine Right, and by God's Authority.</p>
               <p>And this is a manifeſt Proof, that when God is ſaid <hi>to give Kingdoms, to remove Kings and ſet up Kings,</hi> it does not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow from thoſe Expreſſions, that all Poſſeſſors of Kingdoms have God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to keep them; for if the mere force of the Words could advance it, ſince the very ſame may be apply'd to Riches, and the ſame thing is actually affirmed concerning them, in Words equally expreſs and forcible; it would follow that all who have Riches, have a divine Right to them; but this Propoſition is inconſequent from thoſe Words, and therefore ſo is the other, that all Uſurpers have a divine Right to their Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>There is no material difference in the Expreſſion; there may be difference in the ſubject Matter, or nature of the Things, to which it is apply'd, and the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may require different Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the diverſity of the Matter. Thus it may be objected, that when God is ſaid to give Riches, and to give Kingdoms, the nature of the thing does require, that when Riches are given without a lawful Right to them, we ſhould look upon it only as a permiſſive Gift; but when God gives Kingdoms, it is reaſonable to underſtand, that he confers a Right to poſſeſs, and Authority to govern them. Now if the neceſſity of this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation could be demonſtrated from Reaſon and the Nature of the Thing, I acknowledge we ſhould be bound to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it as the genuine Senſe of Scripture: But I have ſhewn that it is impoſſible to prove that Doctrine from Reaſon, and to find any difference in the nature of the Thing, between the Concurrence of God's Providence to the unjuſt Poſſeſſion of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to the Uſurpation of a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:96186:24"/>But ſince the Expreſſion of God's giving a Thing, does not always imply a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Right and Authority to poſſeſs it, and in the Caſe of a Kingdom, there is no way to prove that it does but by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Reaſon; it is plain that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from thoſe paſſages of the Prophet, which pretends to be drawn from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Teſtimony, muſt at laſt be reſolved into Reaſon: It is no where declared in Scripture, that God's giving of Kingdoms is to be underſtood otherwiſe than his giving of Riches; and if nothing but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can ſhew, that giving of Kingdoms muſt always ſignifie a conveyance of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then it is Reaſon (and not thoſe Prophetick paſſages) which proves, that all Uſurpers have God's Authority; and therefore thoſe paſſages ought not to be urged as Proofs from Scripture, nor be brought to prove that it is the Doctrine of Scripture that God does give Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Uſurpers; for the reſult of that Proof muſt at leaſt be this, that Scripture teaches it, becauſe Reaſon teaches it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe paſſages do aſſert no more, than that God's Providence does rule the World, and particularly Kingdoms, and that they are not governed either by Fate or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or merely by the Conduct, Power, and Policy of Princes. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> aſcribed his Greatneſs to himſelf, as the building of <hi>Great Babylon,</hi> ſo his Empire and his Kingdom <hi>to the Might of his Power,</hi> to his own Strength and Policy; he gave not Glory to God, nor had any regard to his Providence and Dominion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God admoniſhes him by Dreams and Viſions, ſends a Prophet to convert him, and when he ſtill perſiſted in his Atheiſm, he puniſhes him with the loſs of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and his Kingdom; and the end of all this Diſcipline, <hi>was to convince him, that the moſt high ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will:</hi> Of which Words the beſt Explication is, that which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himſelf did make after his Conviction; that <hi>God's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is an everlaſting Dominion, and that he doth according to his Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth,</hi> Dan. 4. 34, 35. Now what can be inferred from theſe paſſages, but only that God governs the World, and that his Government, or his Will is irreſiſtible? But are we therefore forbidden to diſtinguiſh between his poſitive and permiſſive Will? Far be it from us to deny God's Sovereign Dominion, let him be <hi>Anathema</hi> that does it; we maintain only that God is not the Author of Wickedneſs, that his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is unſearchable to us, and that Law is the only Rule of our Actions.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider what the Doctor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in the Vindication of theſe paſſages. To what he urges concerning<note place="margin">Vind. <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51.</note> 
                  <hi>God's removing and ſetting up Kings;</hi> I reply, that thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expreſſions do prove only that God's Providence is always concerned in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and Depreſſion of Kings; but ſometimes his Providence is only permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and that extinguiſhes no Right, nor conveys any Authority: He ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have proved, that God does always remove and ſet up Kings by his poſitive and authoritative Will, and that the Text does ſay ſo; for if the Text does neither ſay it expreſly, nor virtually, it is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to produce it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>this is evidently the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note> 
                  <hi>meaning to attribute all the Changes and Revolutions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the divine Providence.</hi> I grant it, for it is certain no King can be removed or ſet up <hi>whether God will or no:</hi> But when God is ſaid to give Kingdoms to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will, <hi>Does whomſoever</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>ſignifie thoſe only who have a legal Right? Does giving ſuppoſe an antecedent Right in him to whom it is given? Does giving to whomſoever he will ſignifie giving it only to thoſe to whom the Law gives it? Do we uſe to ſay a Man may give his Eſtate to whom he will, when his Eſtate is entailed, and he cannot alienate it from the right Heir? We ſhould think this a very abſurd way of ſpeaking among Men;</hi> and he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates 'tis abſurd, <hi>To expound God's giving a Kingdom to whomſoever he will, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his giving the Kingdom to the right Heir.</hi> It may ſuffice to anſwer, That a legal Right
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96186:24"/>
to a Kingdom is a Gift of Providence, and God inveſts it in <hi>whomſoever he will;</hi> what is it which brings any particular Perſon to legal Right, but Providence? God that conferr'd it upon <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, might have given it to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> or to any other Man in the World; and therefore when it is aſſerted that God never gives a Kingdom without a lawful Right to it, this is very well conſiſtent with that Aſſertion of the Prophet, though it be underſtood of God's Authoritative Gift, and in the utmoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Words; for though God's Authority be annexed to Right, yet he <hi>gives</hi> that Right <hi>to whomſoever he will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But farther, he inſtances in the giving of an Eſtate, and that inſtance will lead us to a Reſolution of his Queſtions. God giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Eſtates to whomſoever he will; this Propoſition is contain'd in Scripture, and is undeniably true: it is nevertheleſs certain that no one can have a Divine Right to an Eſtate, when the legal Right is another's; and then though God's Providence gives Poſſeſſion of an Eſtate, that Gift is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Right or Authority to keep it. But then the Doctor bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kly demands, <hi>does whomſoever ſignifie thoſe only who have a legal Right to an Eſtate? does giving it ſuppoſe an antecedent Right? does giving an Eſtate to whomſoever be will, ſignifie giving it only to thoſe to whom the Law gives it.</hi> The Anſwer is obvious, God gives Eſtates by his permiſſive, and by his poſitive Will; by the latter to thoſe only who have a legal Right, by the former to every one that gets Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; in reſpect to this Gift <hi>whomſoever</hi> may be taken univerſally, but muſt be limited to a lawful Right in reſpect to the other.</p>
               <p>Thus in the diſpoſal of Kingdoms, every one who has Poſſeſſion, has a permiſſive Gift, but not a poſitive or authoritative Gift, which always attends upon Right; in relation to the former, God does give Kingdoms abſolutely to <hi>whomſoever he will,</hi> without regard to Right; in relation to the latter, God does give Kingdoms to <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi> he gives Right to poſſeſs them. In ſhort, he <hi>gives</hi> them to <hi>whomſoever he will,</hi> but God's <hi>Will</hi> is either poſitive or permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; and it is impoſſible to diſtinguiſh by which of them he gives any Poſſeſſion, but by conſidering the Right to poſſeſs them. When an Eſtate is entail'd, the Poſſeſſor cannot give it to whomſoever he will, for he has no Right to alienate it from the Heir, neither does Providence properly give it to thoſe who have no Right to it: But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs God can <hi>give</hi> Eſtates to <hi>whomſoever he will,</hi> by permitting Power, or conveying a legal Right to poſſeſs it: God can do both, when it is not in the Power of a Man to do either; and therefore there is a great Diſparity in this Caſe, between God's giving and Man's giving.</p>
               <p>And now what Abſurdity is there in ſaying <hi>that God giveth a Kingdom to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will</hi> permit the Poſſeſſion of it, and conveys his Authority on <hi>whomſoever he will</hi> confer a Right to poſſeſs it? does the Abſurdity lie in diſtinguiſhing between his permiſſive and authoritative Will? that is a Diſtinction generally receiv'd, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I ſee no Reaſon why it is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the diſpoſal of Kingdoms. Is it abſurd to ſay that God gives a thing when he only ſuffers the taking it? that is the Language of Scripture, thus ſaith God himſelf unto <hi>David, I will give thy Wives unto thy Neighbour, and he ſhall lie with them; I will do this thing before all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and before the Sun.</hi> But ſurely no Right was hereby given unto <hi>Abſalem</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Wives. The Actions of <hi>ſeducing, deceiving,</hi> and <hi>moving</hi> unto Wickedneſs, of <hi>blinding</hi> and <hi>hardening</hi> Men in it, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly attributed to God in Scripture, and if ſuch Expreſſions may be reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded only of God's Permiſſion, or his being the accidental cauſe of ſuch Effects; there can be certainly no Abſurdity in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding God's giving a Kingdom without Right, by granting Power to Uſurpers, and permitting them to abuſe it. Laſtly, Does the Abſurdity lie in reſtraining <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will</hi> unto rightful Princes, when we ſpeak of God's giving Authority? But if God gives a legal Right to <hi>whomſoever he will,</hi> then there is no Reſtriction, becauſe none are excepted. God gives Riches <hi>to whomſoever he will,</hi> but he always gives a legal Right when he gives Authority to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96186:25"/>
keep them; and in fine, it is no Abſurdity to reſtrain the general Expreſſions of Scripture when the matter does require it. <hi>Thou haſt wrought all our Works in us,</hi> ſaith the Prophet; if we underſtand this of God's poſitive Operations, wicked Works muſt be excepted: <hi>He hardneth whom (or whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever) he will,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; and I think the Doctor will not think it abſurd to reſtrain the Words, to thoſe who make themſelves obnoxious to the Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, by their obſtinate Incredulity: and if this Expreſſion may be reſtrain'd in one place, ſo it may in another, if there be equal Reaſon for it. In ſhort, it is no Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity to reſtrain ſuch general Words, when it is abſurd to underſtand them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſtriction.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor argues, that<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caſe of Alleg.</hi> p. 20.</note> theſe Paſſages relate <hi>to the Four Monarchies, which were all as manifeſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ever were in the World, and yet ſet up by the Decree and Counſel of God, and foretold by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Spirit.</hi> Here he affirms that the moſt manifeſt Uſurpers that ever were in the World, were ſet up by God; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qently they had God's Authority to govern, and therefore a Right to Allegiance; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Uſurpers are never the better for being ſet up by God, and thoſe Paſſages are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd ſuperfluouſly to prove it. But if the moſt manifeſt Uſurpers in the World are God's Ordinance, what ſhall become of his diſtinction between Uſurpers ſetled and unſetled, ſuch as <hi>Cromwel</hi> was, and ſuch as thoſe that are enthron'd by a full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, ſuch as have and ſuch as have not the conſent of the People: If all Uſurpers have God's Authority, theſe diſtinctions are perfect Banter; but if all have it not, certainly the moſt manifeſt Uſurpers that ever were in the World were without it: But let this paſs for an <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. It appears not, that thoſe Monarchies were Uſurpations: I grant they were ſuch <hi>in ſieri,</hi> thoſe, I mean, who ſet them up, were Uſurpers in doing it, and for ſome time, it may be, after their Advancement: but they ſoon became rightful Sovereigns, by the extinction of the former Right; and if at firſt they were Uſurpers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards rightful Sovereigns, How knows the Doctor that thoſe Paſſages in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, relate to the four Monarchies, as Uſurpations, and not as rightful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? He affirms, that <hi>the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vind. <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note> 
                  <hi>Prophet tells us with reſpect to the very Revolutions, which were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Force and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, that God changeth Times, and removeth and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up Kings.</hi> Then it follows, that even the unjuſt and violent Changes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are acted and authoriz'd by God; for if in reſpect to them it is ſaid, that God changeth Times and ſets up Kings, and ſetting up is the act of God, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Authority, then it is certain that God does act and authorize Changes; then thoſe very Uſurpers, whoſe Government is founded only upon <hi>Force,</hi> without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People, have God's Authority; and then rebellious Subjects, and ambitious Princes, who overturn a lawful Government by <hi>Force,</hi> have God's Authority for it; for in reſpect to that Force and Violence he affirms, that Governments are deſtroy'd and ſet up by God. Thus in the tranſport of his Anger, the Doctor forgets his own Principles, and the Convocation's.</p>
               <p>2. Suppoſe thoſe Paſſages do relate to Uſurpers, and to the very Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence by which Empires are overturn'd; How does it appear that God's ſetting up Kings, and giving of Kingdoms muſt be expounded of God's poſitive, and not of his permiſſive Will, of his giving of Authority, and not of his conceſſion of Power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Rebels and Uſurping Princes are enabled to accompliſh their wicked Enterprizes: If thoſe Paſſages relate to the very <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Governments, and the wicked <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence</hi> by which Uſurpers are advanc'd, then certainly they muſt be underſtood of God's permiſſive Providence, unleſs we will make God the Author and Abettor of the higheſt Wickedneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. The Doctor will not affirm that thoſe Paſſages do prove that Uſurpers are ſet up by God, when they are making their way to the Throne, nor when they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally place themſelves in it; for till they

are ſettled in it by conſent, he himſelf does allow that they have not God's Authority; and yet they will prove this, if they prove any thing for Uſurpers; for they limit not God's ſetting up, to Conſent and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they make no difference between Kings <hi>in ſieri,</hi> and <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> between their aſcending to the Throne, their fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and their ſettlement in it; they inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that all the Gradations and Steps of ſuch Revolutions are alike from God, that he bringeth about the whole Change, and that the Invaſions and Rebellions by which Kings are removed, are as much from him as the Advancement of a new King to the Throne, and his Eſtabliſhment in it: And therefore if they prove that Uſurpers have God's Authority, they prove it for Rebels and Invaders alſo.</p>
               <p>But perhaps the four Monarchies which we ſupoſe to be Uſurpations were ſet up by God's Authority, becauſe <hi>they were ſet up by the Decree and Counſel of God, and foretold by a prophetick Spirit.</hi> I have obſerv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſome of God's Decrees are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive, and ſuch are his Decrees about wicked Events, among which I reckon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Violence and Uſurpations: But they were <hi>foretold by a prophetick Spirit;</hi> And what then? Have Uſurpers therefore God's Authority, becauſe God, who is omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and ſees future things as preſent, does behold them committing Wickedneſs, and foretels it by a Prophet; or is God's Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a Conveyance of his Authority?</p>
               <p>Among other Changes and Revolutions foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the Judgment of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned Men, the ſetting up of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> is predicted, and that under the name of a King, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36, 37, 38, 39. and I ſee no Reaſon why the ſetting up of this King may not as well be aſſcribed to God's Decree and Counſel, as any other King in <hi>Daniel.</hi> However it is ſaid expreſly of the Beaſt in the 13th of <hi>Revelations,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to be the Antichriſt, <hi>that Power was given him over all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations:</hi> Here we have his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for an univerſal Empire. <hi>And Power was given him to continue forty two Months:</hi> Here is a Settlement for a long Tract of Time. <hi>And all that dwell upon the Earth ſhall worſhip him:</hi> Here is the Conſent and Submiſſion of the People to eſtabliſh him; and if this King has not God's Authority upon the Doctour's Principles, and by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of as expreſs words of Scripture, as any he produces for Uſurpers, I wonder who can have it? Let us know whether this Power of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was not given him of God, and whether he could have it without his Will and Appointment? A Power over all Nations muſt certainly be given him by God; and yet I think this giving of Power is no Conveyance of Authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Uſurper, nor does it inferr any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Obedience: and this Inſtance overthrows all his Arguments from God's giving Power and Kingdoms, for here is a Power and Kingdom which is given by God, to which we cannot be Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Apoſtacy from him.</p>
               <p>The Doctor obſerves, That <hi>under the fourth Monarchy the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſe of Al. p. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt was to be ſet up, and Antichriſt was to appear, and the Increaſe and Deſtruction of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Antichriſt is to be accompliſhed by great Changes and Revolutions in humane Governments.</hi> Hence he infers, That ſince <hi>God has declared, that he will change Times and Seaſons, remove Kings, and ſet up Kings, to accompliſh his own wiſe Counſels, it juſtifies our Compliances with ſuch Revolutions;</hi> he ſhou'd have added, <hi>for otherwiſe Antichriſt could neither be advanced nor deſtroyed.</hi> Thus it was once argued for Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, <hi>That God's hiding</hi>

                  <hi>the lawfulneſs of it from the primitive Chriſtians was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to help Antichriſt to his Throne:</hi> and now Compliance with Uſurpers is urged to be lawfull, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſet up and pull down <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that ſo God's Counſels may be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and may it not as reaſonably be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſince God has declared he will make Revolutions, remove and ſet up Kings, that therefore Rebellions and unjuſt Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are lawfull, becauſe they are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ways of effecting Revolutions? No, ſays he, <hi>we muſt not, contrary to our Duty
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96186:26"/>
promote ſuch Revolutions upon a pretence of fulfilling Prophecies, but when they are made and ſettled, we ought to ſubmit to them:</hi> What! Can it be contrary to our Duty to promote Revolutions which God decrees, promotes, and effects? Is it lawfull for no one to promote them? And how then ſhall they be accompliſhed? But why is it lawful to ſubmit to them when they are made and ſettled? Why, becauſe God has decreed them, that muſt be a Reaſon for it, or his Decrees and Counſels are here imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently urged. But we are ſure that God has decreed the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and when his Kingdom is ſettled, muſt <hi>all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations,</hi> pay Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him? If God's Decree be a a Reaſon for Submiſſion, we have no more to doe, but to fall down and worſhip, when we ſee his Decree accompliſhed in the Advancement of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> And if this be not <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> there is no ſuch thing in the World.</p>
               <p>How vain is it to diſtinguiſh between promoting and ſubmitting in reſpect to the fulfilling of Decrees and Prophecies? Does not he that ſubmits promote? And what Ground is there for that Diſtinction in Scripture? It was God's Decree that <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſhould have the Adminiſtration of Sovereign Power, and he might have foretold it by Prophecy; but it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould have been accompliſhed without a general Submiſſion: Was that therefore a general Duty, and was the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bound to it, to fulfill Decrees and Councils? What have we to do with God's unſearchable Decrees? Our Rule is Law, the Laws of God and Nature for religious and moral Actions, the Laws of Kingdoms and Commonweals for thoſe that relate to Civil Society. As for God's Decrees, they are unknown to us, till they are fulfilled, and when they are, we can never know whether they are poſitive or permiſſive, whether they require our Submiſſion or Reſiſtence, but by the nature of the Events. Uſurpations are decreed by God, and ſo are Robberies, ſo is <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> and if there be no difference between theſe Decrees, as there may be none, and there can be none gathered out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> or out of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of Scripture, it follows neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that God's Decreeing of Uſurpers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not any Obligation of Subjection to them. Thus I have done with his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Dreams, Decrees, and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and I hope it appears, that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour's Commentary upon <hi>Daniel</hi> does by no means make good his Commentary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>

                  <hi>not uſurped Powers are of God, had made the Apoſtle's Direction ſignifie nothing; for the great Queſtion had ſtill been undetermined, what Powers are of God, and what they muſt obey, if ſome Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be of God, and ſome not.</hi> The Apoſtle directed the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Powers then in being; and if there was any Diſpute whether they were lawfull Powers or Uſurpers, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determines it, by declaring they were God's Ordinance, and that Subjection was therefore due to them; he tells them the Powers then in being were ordained by God, and that was enough to ſilence all Diſputes about them. The Doctour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, That <hi>had the Apoſtle confin'd himſelf to the then preſent Powers, it would have directed them at that time; but,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it would have been no general Direction to Chriſtians in other Ages to obey the preſent Powers;</hi> it would have been very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for ſome Men, if the Apoſtle had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch a Direction; but what if he hath not? Why, <hi>then we have no Direction in Scripture, what to do in ſuch diſputed Caſes unleſs by a Parity of Reaſon.</hi> Well, ſuppoſe that we have not; the Direction is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, if we will be content with what may be reaſonably expected: St. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Chriſtians to pay Subjection to the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> who were lawfull Powers; and the Reaſon upon which he enjoins it, extends the Obligation to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in all Ages and Nations who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of ſuch lawful Powers. But the Apoſtle has not directed us to diſtinguiſh what Powers are lawful; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we any Directions to find out
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96186:26"/>
true Parents, lawful Husbands, Maſters, and Paſtors; and yet, I think, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not to be charged with Imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The Scripture preſcribes the Duties of theſe ſeveral Relations, but gives no Rules to diſtinguiſh the Relatives, the True and Lawful from the Falſe and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, that depends upon the infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Fact, of Cuſtoms, and of Laws, and therefore cannot be comprehended in general Rules; ſo does the Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween lawful Powers and unlawful, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the various Conſtitutions of Civil Politics, and often upon Matters of Fact; and therefore that Diſtinction could not be bounded and defined within Rules, nor conſequently be determined in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In ſhort, it may be inferred, by parity of Reaſon from the Apoſtle, that the ſupreme Powers in every civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are God's Ordinance and irreſillible; But which are the ſupreme Powers he hath left to be determined by the Laws of every Government? The Doctor himſelf hath told the World, That <hi>whatever</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſe of Reſiſt. <hi>p.</hi> 111.</note> 
                  <hi>Power in any Nation, according to the Fundamental Laws of its Government, cannot and ought not to be reſiſted; that is, the ſupreme Power of that Nation, the higher Powers to which the Apoſtle requires us to be ſubject;</hi> And is there any Nation in the World, which hath made an Uſurper irreſiſtible by a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law? The Doctor may recant this, but he will pardon me if I am ſtill of his Opinion.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor is <hi>ſure the only</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſe of Al. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Direction in Scripture, is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to thoſe who are in the actual Adminiſtration of Government.</hi> And I am ſure there is no ſuch Direction there; and which is more, the Doctor himſelf is ſure of it, for he is ſure that Uſurpers who have the <hi>actual Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> without the conſent of the People, have no Title to Subjection. He ſeems to lay ſtreſs upon thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>At God's Miniſters attending continually upon this very Thing;</hi> the Emperors were then actually Adminiſtring the Government, and that was their Buſineſs, as <hi>God's Miniſters:</hi> But does the Apoſtle ſay, that Sovereign Powers are not God's Miniſters, when they are hindred from their Buſineſs, though they are ſtill attending upon it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to remove the Impediment? Do they ceaſe to be God's Miniſters, becauſe their Subjects are Rebels? Obedience is required to Spiritual Rulers, becauſe they watch over Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 11. Are the People then diſcharged from their Duty, if they will not ſuffer their Paſtors to watch over them, but ſeparate from them? And are the Paſtors no longer God's Miniſters, becauſe they can't exerciſe their Function?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>given us of any kind of Duty, to a Prince removed from the Adminiſtration of Government, whatever his Right may be.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſay I, is there any the leaſt notice of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Duty to Uſurpers; no more is there of paying Obedience to a Father, or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, remov'd from the Government of their Families, or to a Biſhop removed from his Church by Perſecution; there is no more than this, that the Scripture requires Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them, and neither Scripture nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon does teach us that when they are violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed from the actual Adminiſtration of their reſpective Governments, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ceaſes and the Duty with it. And thus much may be ſaid for Sovereign Princes; Subjection is required to them, but neither Scripture nor Reaſon do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that the Relation is extinguiſhed when they are violently depoſed: On the contrary, we are expreſly required to give Princes their dues, and what thoſe are we muſt learn from the Laws of Nature and Nations, for the Scripture has not taught us.</p>
               <p>But <hi>we have no Example in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Scripture, that any People were ever blamed for ſubmitting to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> In the 2d. of <hi>Samuel</hi> we have the People of the Jews ſubmitting to <hi>Abſalom;</hi> in the 13th. of <hi>Revel.</hi> the People of all Nations to <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> but in neither do we find that they are blamed for it. But I wonder when he was heaping up theſe negative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that he did not remember, that if they are good for any thing, they overthrow his own Hypotheſis; he maintains that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96186:27"/>
Allegiance is not due to all Uſurpers (though all his Arguments from Providence and Scripture do prove it) but only to thoſe that are ſetled by a general conſent; and yet there is no Rule, no Example, not an Iota for this Diſtinction in Scripture. But this was not convenient to be remember'd, for then he had loſt theſe pretty Arguments. But in Scripture we have Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> of Subjects <hi>being condemn'd for refuſing to ſubmit to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> This indeed is to the purpoſe: But where are theſe Examples to be found? <hi>in the Prophecies of</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>and the Diſcourſes of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our with the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Phariſees, <hi>about paying Tribute to</hi> Caeſar. Let us now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine theſe Examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Saviour's Argument relies wholly on the Poſſeſſion of Power, whoſe Image and Superſcription hath it? and if this be a good Reaſon, it is good in all other Caſes, that we muſt ſubmit to all Princes who are poſſeſs'd of Sovereign Power.</hi> I refer the Reader to our Saviour's Diſcourſe, and let him ſatisfie himſelf, whether this Propoſition is in it, <hi>That Allegiance is due to all Princes in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Sovereignty,</hi> or this other, which is contradictory it to, <hi>That it is due only to theſe Poſſeſſors that are ſetled by the conſent of the People;</hi> that I think cannot he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from the <hi>Image and Superſcription,</hi> for Uſurpers may coin Money before they are ſetled; neither is it any Proof that a Prince is in Poſſeſſion, becauſe his Coin is current; if it is, Allegiance is due to King <hi>JAMES,</hi> or at leaſt all the Money that has his Image and Superinſcription. Is the Doctor ſure that the Coin preſented to our Saviour had the Image of <hi>Tiberius?</hi> Others ſay it had the Image of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and then our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Argument could not relye upon Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, for the Coin of a Prince deceas'd could ſuggeſt no Argument that Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was due to the Poſſeſſor.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> I take to be the better Expoſitor; thus he upon thoſe Words: <hi>Whoſe is this Image and Superſcription? The Inſcription on the Coin is</hi> Caeſar Aguſtus, <hi>ſuch a Year after the taking of</hi> Judaea; <hi>this being a Record of the Conqueſt of the</hi> Romans <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ver this Nation, and the Right by them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, by the dedition of</hi> Hyrcanus, <hi>and an expreſſion of the Years ſince that taking, about 90 Years, (for ſo long ago did</hi> Pompey <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and take</hi> Jeruſalem,) <hi>ſhew that now it is unlawful to ſeek change, after ſo long continuance of that Power, ſo fairly and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſetled.</hi> So the excellent Dr. <hi>Hammond;</hi> and in his Annotations he evinces hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, the Legality of the <hi>Roman</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over <hi>Judaea.</hi> Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> on the contrary, ſuppoſes that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, and that our Saviour reprov'd the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for not ſubmitting to an Uſurper; but he was pleas'd only to ſuppoſe it; and I preſume to affirm, that it is impoſſible to prove it: For an Uſurper muſt have ſome Competitor who claims a right to the Sovereignty, and let him name us that Perſon, if he can, that was <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor; if he cannot, he may ſuppoſe, but he can never prove him an Uſurper.</p>
               <p>His other Inſtance is out of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> and here he acknowledges that his Argument for Submiſſion <hi>is Prophecy, or an expreſs Command from God to ſubmit to the King of</hi> Babylon: And was <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> then an Uſurper, if Allegiance was requir'd to him by God's reveal'd Will? Was he not King over the <hi>Jews</hi> by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nomination? Did not the Sin of the <hi>Jews</hi> conſiſt in their Diſobedience to God's expreſs Command? And how can he prove that the Prophet would have condemn'd them, if they had refuſed to ſubmit without expreſs Revelation, or that he himſelf would have adviſed them to ſubmit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p>Before the firſt Conqueſt of <hi>Judaea</hi> under <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> could be under no Obligation to ſubmit to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> but when their Kings had made a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary dedition to him, and confirm'd it by an Oath, then their Obedience was due to him as their lawful Sovereign: Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt is afterwards ſtiled Rebellion, and the Violation of that Oath was puniſhed with final Captivity and Deſtruction, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. The Doctor pretends there was a neceſſity of an expreſs Command to ſubmit, becauſe they could not without it ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any other Prince, while any of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96186:27"/>
                  <hi>David</hi>'s Family were living, becauſe <hi>God himſelf had entail'd the Kingdom upon his Poſterity.</hi> But this is a groundleſs Fancy, and contradicted by himſelf; for in his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication he maintains, <hi>That whether there be a Divine Entail or no, it is always lawful to ſubmit to Force,</hi> and then ſure there was no need of a Revelation. But where is that Reaſon to be found in Scripture? Does the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> mention it? Had the Jews any Scruple then about a Divine Entail? The Prophet declares from God, that if <hi>Zedekiah</hi> would ſubmit to the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> he ſhould live in Safety, <hi>chap.</hi> 38. and after his Captivity, and the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he aſſures the remaining <hi>Jews,</hi> that if they would ſtill abide in the Land, God would deliver them from the King of <hi>Babylon, chap.</hi> 42. The only Motive which he urges to the King and People is an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Safety by Submiſſion: But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that they were bound to it by Oath and Covenant, and they are therefore branded by both the Prophets with Rebellion, becauſe they revolted from their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor argues hence, <hi>That where the Entail of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Crown is only by Humane Laws, there is no need of Prophecy to direct the People to ſubmit to any new Prince whom God ſets over them.</hi> Well, ſuppoſe there was need of Prophecy in caſe of a Divine Entail; how does it follow there is no need of Prophecy when an Entail is by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws; perhaps it may follow from ſomething elſe, but I am not ſubtile enough to diſcern how it follows from his Premiſes: It will follow as well, that becauſe a King by a Divine Entail cannot be depos'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prophecy, there is no need of Prophecy to depoſe a King of Human Entail; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> could not lawfully Sacrifice his Son without an expreſs Command, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other Parents may murther a Son without it. When God ſets up a Prince by his poſitive Will, there is no need of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to preſcribe Submiſſion, but there is need of a new Revelation to inform us, when it is his Will to convey Authority to an Uſurper, for the Event<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is no Indication of it.</p>
               <p>But ſince the Prophet's Motive for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the <hi>Jews</hi> was Safety, may we not for the ſame Reaſon ſubmit to any King in Poſſeſſion? I anſwer the Caſe may be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; for, 1. The Jews were bound to ſubmit to the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for they were his rightful Subjects by Dedition, and by God's expreſs Appointment; and though Safety is a good Argument to enforce Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is none againſt it. 2. The caſe of abſolute Conqueſt, when the Lawful Prince is a Captive, the Government diſſolv'd, and no poſſibility of reſtoring it, is manifeſtly different from the caſe of a People depoſing their lawful Prince, advancing an Uſurper, ſupporting him by their Power, oppoſing their Rightful Sovereign, and ſtill in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of reſtoring him; their Safety in this caſe is no Argument for perſiſting in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; and if they are under any Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, it is of their own making and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing. 3. Submiſſion is not Allegiance, and though the former is lawful, when it is to no purpoſe to reſiſt, yet it is no more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to aſſiſt an Uſurper to the deſtruction of a Rightful Prince, meerly for my own Safety, than it is to aſſiſt a High-way-Man to ſave my own Purſe, or to compound for my own Life, by aſſiſting an Aſſaſſine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy my Neighbour's,</p>
               <p>Thus I have conſider'd all the Doctor's Arguments from Scripture, but there is one Text more to be conſider'd, which the Doctor propounds as an Objection againſt his Principle; the place is <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. 4. where God himſelf does thus complain of the <hi>Iſraelites, They have ſet up Kings but not by me, they have made Princes and I knew it not.</hi> Here we are aſſur'd, that all Kings have not been ſet up by God, and this is as plainly and expreſly declar'd as Words can do it, and how then is this reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Apoſtle's univerſal Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>there is no Power but of God?</hi> I have intimated that this Propoſition is reſtrained by the following Words unto the Powers then in being, which were lawful Powers: And thus the Texts are eaſily reconcil'd, and there is no Contradiction between
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96186:28"/>

                     </gap> God tells him, I exalted thee out of the Duſt, and made thee Prince over my People</hi> Iſrael. This might have been ſaid of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who yet had no Title to God's Authority; and it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the general Concurrence of God's Providence, and the conceſſion of Power to uſurp the Throne. But as for theſe Kings, if God did actually deprive the Family of <hi>David</hi> of their Right to the Kingdom of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> then they were lawfull Kings, becauſe Poſſeſſion was a Right when there was no other; if he did not, (which ſeems very doubtful,) they were certainly Uſurpers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Divine Right; and therefore though they were exalted by God's Providence, yet they could not be inveſted with his Authority.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The true Anſwer is this:</hi> Iſrael <hi>was a Theocracy, and therefore they ought to have received their Kings from God's Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but inſtead of that, they ſubmitted to any who could ſet up themſelves over them; and this,</hi> he ſays, <hi>was a great Crime, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in effect a renouncing their Prerogative of having Kings ſet up by God's Nomination, and putting themſelves into the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the World, where Kings are ſet up onely by his Providence.</hi> This contains the force of his Anſwer, and at moſt 'tis only conjecture, and ſuch as has little ſhew of Probability. No doubt it was a Crime not to conſult God, when they might have conſulted him; but upon the Doctour's Principle it could be no fault to <hi>ſubmit to any who could ſet themſelves over them;</hi> for he ſays himſelf concerning thoſe Princes, that they were <hi>ſet up by God,</hi> and ſurely it could be no fault to ſubmit to his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. He affirms expreſly, <hi>That in</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>God did ſometimes ſet up Kings onely by his Providence, and theſe providential Kings had all the Rights of other Sovereign Princes of</hi> Judah <hi>or Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> conſequently they had a Right to Submiſſion, and therefore it was no fault to pay it; and if it was a fault to ſubmit to thoſe Kings of Providence, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were not inveſted with God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and then the meaning of the Words in debate is this; <hi>they have ſet up Kings</hi> by the Concurrence of my Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>but not by me,</hi> but without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of my Authority. As for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of receiving Kings by expreſs No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, I underſtand not upon the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Principles, how that could be any Prerogative; I am ſure it could be no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for if Kings of Providence have divine Authority as much as Kings by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, where is the difference? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

good Kings be made by Providence, as well as by a Prophet? Is not the one God's Act and will as much as the other? There can be no Priviledge or Advantage in a ſingular way of making Kings, if all are made by God and enjoy his Authority: and therefore in the nature of the thing it ſelf, it could be no Crime to forego it. I hope it appears now, that his Scripture-Proofs are as ill grounded as his Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I might well ſpare the Labour of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining his other Reaſons, but if they be not anſwered, they may be thought unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, and therefore I will briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them.</p>

                  <hi>eaſieſt and intelligible Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Original of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Government; that all Power is from God, who is the Sovereign Lord of the World.</hi> Having obſerved this, he recites the various Opinions about the Origine of Monarchy, and confutes them ſeverally, and concludes at laſt, That <hi>he cannot ſee where to fix the Foundation of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Government, but in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, who by the choice of the major or ſtronger part of the People, or by Conqueſt, or Submiſſion, or the long ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Continuance of Power, or by humane Laws, gives a Prince and his Family Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Throne, which is a good Title againſt all humane Claims, and requires the Obedience of Subjects, as long as God is pleaſed to continue Him and his Family in the Throne; but it is no Title againſt God, if he pleaſe to advance another Prince.</hi> To ſet this Matter in a clear Light, I obſerve,</p>
               <p>1. That our Diſpute with the Doctor is not about the Origine, or firſt Beginning of Government, whether it began in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Authority, or by Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; but about the Reſolution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Obedience, whether they muſt be reſolved into Right or Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>2. The Diſpute is not whether the Power of Government is derived from God, or whether it is founded upon this Providence. We acknowledge that the Authority of Government is derived only from God, and from him no otherwiſe but by a Providential Conveyance of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon particular Perſons; and thus far we are agreed: But then the Queſtion is, Whether God's Providence does inveſt a Prince with his Authority by the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Right, or by the conveyance of Poſſeſſion without it? In ſhort, whether every Prince in Poſſeſſion is inveſted with God's Authority: We affirm that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is founded in God's Authority, but we deny that God conveys it upon every Prince in Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>3. When we ſay God's Authority is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to Right, we do not confine this to a Right by political Laws of particular Governments; the <hi>adaequate</hi> Rule of Right is Law, and whatſoever is Law may create a Right, and conſequently Right may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult not only from political Laws of this or that Government, but alſo from the Laws of God, of Nature, and Nations; the Will of God revealed is a Law to us, and therefore when God nominates a King by expreſs Revelation, he has a Right to the Poſſeſſion of Sovereignty and the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Subjects: In a ſtate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f Nature, as they call it, wherein Men are under no Government nor Obligation of Subjection, they may chooſe a Sovereign, and when they have choſen him, he has a Right to Sovereignty by the Law of Nature: By the Law of Nations it is generally ſaid, how truly I diſpute not, that Conqueſt in a juſt War does create a lawful Right. And laſtly, when political Societies are Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and a Rule of Succeſſion Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, either at the firſt, by an Original Agreement, or afterwards by Preſcription or poſitive Laws; that Law of Succeſſion does create a Right to the Sovereignty, which is confirmed by the Laws of God, and Nature, and Nations; but if this Law be violated, and an Uſurpation is made againſt it, the Uſurpers may acquire a Right by Preſcription, which implies an undiſturbed Poſſeſſion, and a Dereliction of the former Right; and this new Right (which commences from the extinction
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96186:29"/>
of the former) is ſuch by the Law of Nature, which is Equity, and of Nations, which is the Conſent of civilized Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Where there is no Rule of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or no Right in any Perſon to the Sovereignty, as when a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family is extinguiſhed, in<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sherlock's</hi> Caſe of Reſ. p. 129.</note> ſuch Caſes <hi>The Poſſeſſion of Sovereign Power is Title e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when there is no better Title to oppoſe it; for then we may preſume that God gives him the irreſiſtible Authority of a King, to whom he gives an irreſiſtible Power.</hi> When there is no other Right, Poſſeſſion is a Right by the Law of Nature and Nations; but Poſſeſſion of another's Right has been always pronounced invalid, by the voice of Equity and the ſuffrage of all Nations. Theſe Two laſt Rights may perhaps be reduced to the Second, the Conſent of a free People; for they ſuppoſe them to be diſcharged from all former Obligations; and Poſſeſſion of Sovereignty ſuppoſes Submiſſion of the People, and that is nothing elſe but a Conſent to be governed, which in a free People, I have obſerved, does create a Right to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty by the Law of Nature. And now let us conſider what the Doctor does object againſt theſe Titles to Sovereignty.</p>
               <p>Againſt the Choice and Conſent of the People he objects, That <hi>then no Man is a Subject, but he who Conſents to be ſo, for the major Vote,</hi> ſays he, <hi>cannot include my Conſent unleſs I pleaſe; that is, the effect of Law and Compact, or Force, not of Nature.</hi> I anſwer, when a free People chooſe a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, if they conſent to chooſe, it is preſum'd (unleſs it be otherwiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) that they conſent the major Vote ſhall determine the Choice; this preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is grounded upon manifeſt Equity: But if any one refuſes to be determin'd by a Majority, he refuſes to enter into the Society, and may remove out of it; but if he will live within the Government of the new Sovereign, he accepts him for his Sovereign, and is bound to Obedience. He urges farther, <hi>That if Subjects give their Prince Authority, they may take it away again if they pleaſe.</hi> Bp. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> propounds this very<note place="margin">Sand. <hi>de Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. Conſe. Prael. 7. ſect.</hi> 21.</note> Inference, and his Anſwer is this, <hi>Contra ſtat ratio, &amp; omnia jura, omnia for a recla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, ſcilicet legitima pacta non eſſe reſcindenda.</hi> It is the Voice of Reaſon and of all Laws, and of all places of Commerce, that lawful Compacts are not to be reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Subjects are only inſtrumental Agents, God is the principal Agent in the making of a King, the People deſign the Perſon, and God conveys the Authority. It is God that makes Kings, the People are his Inſtruments, but he has given them no Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them. The Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<note place="margin">Vind. p. 16.</note> affirms, That <hi>the Conſent of the People are the means by which Princes gain a Right to their Thrones;</hi> and I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm no more; the People may be a means of conveying Right, though it be God alone that confers the Authority, and if God alone does<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make Kings, he alone can depoſe them. But farther, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple there can be no Hereditary Monarchy, one Generation can chooſe only for themſelves, their Poſterity having as much Right to chooſe as they had.</hi> True; if there could be no Right to Sovereignty without the conſtant Election of the Subjects; but that is no Principle of mine, and I am not bound to anſwer for it; but this I will anſwer for, that a Law made a Thouſand Years ago may be Obligatory now, and that it may create a Right to a Perſon now living, and that it may be a Sin to deprive him of it, tho' it be done by the help of Providence.</p>
               <p>His Objection againſt the Right of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſuppoſes it to be effected by <hi>unjuſt and violent Force,</hi> and I eaſily acknowledge that unjuſt Conqueſt gives no Right.</p>

And if an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation will deſtroy their Right, why not a ſhort one as well as a long one?</hi> Their Right is loſt by Ceſſion, not by Uſurpation; and the Ceſſion is not preſum'd by the Law of Nations when the Uſurpation is of ſhort continuance; ſhort poſſeſſion of an Eſtate is no right in any civiliz'd Society, but a long Poſſeſſion is a right almoſt all the World over: So it is in Kingdoms; and this conſent of Nations will juſtify this Diſtinction, though the Doctor will not <hi>underſtand it.</hi> He demands farther, <hi>How the People ſhall be juſtified in conſenting that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper ſhould reign while their rightful King is living?</hi> If they cannot hinder him from reigning, they need not juſtifying; if they can and will not, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtified, who can help it? And what is that to the matter of Preſcription? <hi>But how long muſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper reign before the People conſent to it?</hi> Till they can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be perſuaded that the former Right is extinguiſh'd. Laſtly, he asks again, <hi>Whether an hundered Years Poſſeſſion be a good right againſt a better claim, or how this better claim comes to expire after an hundred Years <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation?</hi> And I anſwer again, that Preſcription ſuppoſes the former Right to be extinguiſh'd, which is ſo far from being a better, that it ceaſes to be any Right; the extinction of it may be grounded upon Equity, or the poſitive Law of Nations; as to the time of its expiring, an hundred Years is not always neceſſary; if the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can be prov'd, that will ſuffice without reſpect to time, but without other Proof, by the conſent of Nations, undiſturb'd Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion for a hundred Years does entinguiſh the former Title.</p>

He gives no Reaſons to prove the Negative, but ſuppoſes it Self-evident. But the Reaſon and Practice of Mankind ſuppoſe the quite contrary; if Children cannot be bound by the Acts of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the Authority of Parents does ſignifie nothing; but we need not this Authority to enforce the Obligation of Laws: every Human Law does oblige the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Political Society, to which it is a Law, and therefore the Society being ſtill the ſame it was four hundred Years agoe, the Obligation reaches to every Member of it.

                  <hi>ſay, that the Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not derived from God without the Conſent of the People? For if God cannot make a King without the People, or againſt their Conſent declared by their Laws, the Authority muſt be derived from the People, not from God; or at leaſt if it be God's Authority, yet God cannot give it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without the People, nor otherwiſe than as they have directed him by their Laws. And this,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>is very abſurd, and what thoſe Perſons abhor the Thoughts of, who inſiſt ſo much upon a legal Right.</hi> But where is this horrible Abſurdity? Is it that God cannot make a King without the People? That indeed is an Abſurdity, but aſſerted by no one; the Queſtion is what God wills or does, and not what he can doe. He can make a King out of Stones, he can make him without the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without any Inſtruments, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any antecedent Right; but this he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver does, and what he can do is nothing to the purpoſe.

But where are we? Is it not his own Doctrine, that God does never make Kings without the Conſent of the People? No matter whether this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be Law or no, it obliges the People, and Providence never ſets up a King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and how then can he acquit himſelf of theſe imaginary Abſurdities?

God; which diveſts <hi>Charles</hi> I. and II. of God's Authority, and aſſigns it to the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwell;</hi> which gives the Sanction of divine Right to the greateſt Wickedneſs and Injuſtice, which is contradicted by almoſt all Divines and Lawyers, by the Voice of Nations, and by the Doctour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for he acknowledges that God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not always annexed to the <hi>actual Adminiſtration of Sovereign Power:</hi> Here he aſſerts, that it <hi>is the only Evidence we have</hi> of the <hi>receiving</hi> Authority from God; yet when he comes to account for <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> he confeſſes it is no Evidence, and makes the Conſent of the People to be the onely evidence of it. We grant that Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtence is founded on God's Authority communicated to Sovereigns; but we ſay, that it is always communicated with Right, that all juſt Rights are eſtabliſhed by God's Authority, that actual Adminiſtration is onely matter of Fact, which is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from Right, and that Uſurpers may have it by God's permiſſive Will, which is no Conveyance of Authority.

Here it will ſuffice to anſwer that removing and ſetting up Kings are equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expreſſions, which ſignifie either God's ſuffering or doing, his Permiſſion of Power, or his Conveyance of Authority: An Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is ſet up by permiſſive Providence, and to deny him Allegiance is no Oppoſition to God's Authority. But <hi>God cannot make a King, if he cannot oblige us to obey him; nor remove a King, if he cannot diſcharge us from our Allegiance to him.</hi> He can make and remove Kings by his permiſſive Will, without transferring our Allegiance; if the Doctour can prove that he makes Uſurpers otherwiſe, we are ready to ſhift ſides with Providence. But <hi>thoſe are bold Men, who will venture to ſay in plain contradiction to holy Scripture, that God cannot remove or ſet up Kings.</hi> As for me, I am none of thoſe <hi>bold Bayards;</hi> I believe that God governs the World, and that he removes and ſets up Kings; he removes Kings out of the World, and out of their Thrones, he ſets up lawfull Kings, and he ſets up Uſurpers. <hi>Henry</hi> the Great he removed by <hi>Ravilliack,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> I. by a <hi>High Court of Juſtice;</hi> he ſet up <hi>Charles</hi> H. and King <hi>James,</hi> and he ſet up <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Maſſianello:</hi> All this is true; but it follows not hence, that he does all this by his poſitive Will and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Authority.</p>
               <p>Our Church has taught us otherwiſe in the Office for King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Martyrdom, his Death is there always aſſcribed to God's permiſſive Will. <hi>Albeit thou didſt ſuffer them to proceed to ſuch a height of Violence, as to kill him, and to take poſſeſſion of his

Throne, yet didſt thou in great Mercy preſerve his Son, whoſe Right it was, and at length by a wonderfull Providence bring him back, and ſet him thereon.</hi> The Removal of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the ſetting up the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> are both attributed to God's permiſſive Providence; but the ſetting up of him, <hi>whoſe Right it was,</hi> to his poſitive and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Will: He ſuffered the Uſurpers to take Poſſeſſion of the Throne, but he ſet the rightful Heir thereon.</p>
               <p>But here again the Queſtion is not, what God can doe, but what he does; he can give a <hi>Man's Houſe, and his Wife, his Ox and his Aſs, and any thing that is his,</hi> to another who has no Right to them, and ſo he can give his Crown and Kingdom: But the Queſtion is whether God does give them by the bare Events of Providence? Whether he who has Poſſeſſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe, or Wife, or Kingdom, has a divine Right to them? I will be bold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Doctour affirms, that God never ſets up Kings without the Conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; others add, without their lawfull Conſent, or againſt a lawful Right; if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be no Confinement of Providence, neither is Right and lawfull Conſent; and if this Opinion be a contradiction to the Scripture, ſo is the former.

But has not God ways enough to puniſh Princes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licenſing their Subjects to abjure them?

Or is it any Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Non-reſiſtence, that then God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not licenſe Subjects to rebell againſt their Sovereign? Is it a Confinement of God's Power to puniſh leud Husbands, becauſe it is not lawful for their Wives to commit Adultery; or prodigal and tyrannical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, becauſe their Children cannot hang them, or in reſpect of both, becauſe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is due to Husbands and Parents as long as they are living?

to execute his Vengeance? Or is his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence cramped or limited, becauſe it is not lawfull for men to do evil?</p>

This is often the courſe of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to give and to take away a King in his Wrath.

               <p>Yet <hi>this ſeems very hard, that when God has actually</hi>

                  <hi>delivered us, we muſt refuſe our Deliverance, that we will not allow God to deliver us, unleſs he do it by Law.</hi> This is pretty and paſſionate, but, to uſe his own Eloquence, <hi>is a very nothing.</hi> It is often a Duty to refuſe Deliverance when God does deliver us; we are ſometimes bound to ſuffer Martyrdom <hi>not accepting Deliverance.</hi> A Maſter of a Family does cruelly treat his Wife, his Children, and Servants; God delivers them, by ſuffering a Robber to drive him out of his Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he offers to govern them gently, if they will ſwear to reſiſt the former Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, and accept of him as a Husband, Father, and Maſter. A Prince oppreſſes his Subjects, many of them rebel and bring Deliverance to the reſt with this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they will ſwear to joyn in the Rebellion; In theſe Caſes is it lawful for the oppreſſed to accept Deliverance? When a Deliverance is offered, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enjoyed without Sin, it is God's Providence that offers it, not for our Complyance but our Tryal; and to accept of ſuch a Deliverance will make us liable to his Vengeance. The Queſtion then is, whether it be a Sin to abjure our lawful Sovereign, and to aſſiſt an Uſurper againſt him, we believe that it is a Sin againſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, and againſt the Laws of God and Nature, and if it be a Sin, then inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Fleſh and Blood cannot make it lawful; and therefore to talk of God's Deliverance, when the only Queſtion is about the lawfulneſs of abjuring a lawful Sovereign, is in plain Engliſh only Cant and Banter.</p>

But admit his Principles were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receiv'd, it is evident they can never put an end to Diſputes of Right, nor bind the Subjects by Duty and Conſcience to an Uſurper; for he expreſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that <hi>the Providence</hi>

                  <hi>of God removes and ſets up Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alters no legal Rights, nor forbids thoſe who are diſpoſſeſſed to recover their Rights.</hi> The diſpoſſeſſed Prince has ſtill a legal Right and Claim, which he may lawfully proſecute by War; And is not here an admirable end the Controverſy about Right? Oh! but this Controverſy is between the Princes only, upon theſe Principles it can be none among the Subjects, for they are bound by Duty and Conſcience to the Prince in Poſſeſſion. And what are they bound to? Non-Reſiſtance and Submiſſion? Is that any Security to the Sovereign when he is invaded by the lawful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prince? Are they bound to Allegiance, or to an actual defence of the Uſurper againſt him? That they cannot be, for it would be a bond of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; if the diſpoſſeſſed Prince has a juſt cauſe of War, and this is evident to the Subjects, Is it lawful for them to ſupport an unjuſt Cauſe againſt a juſt Cauſe? It is generally agreed, that a War cannot be juſt on both ſides; <hi>Grotius</hi> gives this Reaſon, <hi>becauſe in the nature</hi>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96186:33"/>
conſiſts the reaſon of War, that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it ſhould be puniſhed by vindictive Juſtice:</hi> If the War of the legal Prince be therefore juſt, and the War of the Uſurper unjuſt, theſe Conſequences muſt inevitably follow. 1. That the Uſurper is bound to reſtore the Crown he has uſurp'd, for if it be unjuſt to defend it, it muſt be unjuſt to keep it. 2. If he is bound to reſtore it, he has no right to it by God's Donation. 3. He is reſponſible for all the Blood that is ſhed in an unjuſt War, his Soul muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all the Perſons that are kill'd, as for ſo many Murthers. And, 4. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects cannot lawfully aſſiſt him in murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Innocent Perſons, and much leſs in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting a Sentence of Death, (for ſuch in effect is War) upon their innocent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to whom they had ſworn Allegiance, and who ſeeks for nothing, but what is juſtly his own.</p>
               <p>And now upon the whole, is not this Scheme of Principles an incomparable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for Princes? Subjects muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Princes, but they may ſtand by and ſee them depoſed and murthered; if the beſt of Princes be unfortunate, they may lawfully abjure them, and ſwear Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the Uſurper, and then contribute their Purſes, Prayers, and Arms to deſtroy their lawful Sovereign. But let the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be ſure to be fortunate ſtill, and not to invade our Properties and Religion, let him look to it, or moſt Men will ſay, <hi>let him go if he cannot defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that he is placed in the</hi>

               <p>On the contrary, if Principles are to be judg'd by their being <hi>for the Security of the Prince and Subject,</hi> an immovable Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our lawful Prince, will appear to be the trueſt, <hi>for it is the beſt Principle to prevent all Revolutions of Government;</hi> and all the Miſchiefs of Civil War and Anarchy which uſually attend them, and therefore is moſt <hi>for the Peace and Security of Human Societies.</hi> But to this the Doctor has ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Objections.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>If this Principle would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all Revolutions, it is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>againſt it, that it is a bad Principle, becauſe it is contrary to God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of reproving and ſetting up Kings.</hi> This Objection concludes as ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Juſtice and Chriſtianity it ſelf; for it is certain, that if the Principles of Juſtice and of Chriſtian Religion were univerſally preach'd, there would be no Uſurpations nor Revolutions; and that is a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration with the Doctor, that <hi>they are bad Principles, meer Human Inventions, which cannot come from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is evident, <hi>that this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was either unknown to the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>World, or that it cannot prevent the Revolutions of Government.</hi> But ſtill it may be the beſt Principle to prevent them, and no Man ever affirm'd that it would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways actually prevent them. Mankind are not generally govern'd by Principles, but by Luſts and Paſſions: Chriſtianity is the beſt Religion to prevent Revolutions, and to preſerve the Peace of Societies, but we ſee, <hi>de facto,</hi> it fails of preventing them no leſs than our Principle of Allegiance.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Such Principles as muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Human Societies when ſuch</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Revolutions happen, and expoſe the moſt conſcientious Men to the greateſt Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, without ſerving any good end by them, cannot be true.</hi> I anſwer, there is no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Morality and Religion but may occaſion the diſſolution of Human Societies, but then the wickedneſs of Men is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Cauſe of it, and not the Principle. The Doctor has anſwer'd this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction himſelf, <hi>the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>takes care of all ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary caſes, and there we muſt leave them.</hi> And even his own Principle is liable to the ſame Objection; for till the new Prince is ſetled, no Allegiance is due to him, and therefore in that Interval which may laſt for an Age or more, ſince no Allegiance is due there can be no Sovereign, nor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and conſequently no Society. As for the Sufferings of conſcientious Men, that is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96186:33"/>
their Portion here, but great is their Reward in Heaven; and whereas he ſays thoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings can ſerve to no good end; the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>their Conſceinces void of Offence,</hi> is one good end, and the promoting the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good of Human Society in general, is another. But does not this Principle tend to diſſolve Societies? No otherwiſe than as Chriſtianity tends to ſet Men at variance in the ſame Houſhold, not naturally, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently, not in its own Nature, but in the Event of Things, and by the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Is the Right of any Prince ſo ſacred, as to ſtand in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi>

                  <hi>with the very Being of Humane Societies?</hi> I anſwer, That the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign is comprehended in the Society, and ought not to be oppoſed to it; that we muſt not do Evil that Good may come of it; and that Perjury and Injuſtice, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, Civil Wars and Anarchy, are againſt the Intereſts of Society. <hi>Muſt we defend the Prince's Right with the deſtruction of the Nation, and the Ruine of his Subjects?</hi> This perhaps may be a Caſe in the <hi>New At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantis</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia:</hi> But I ask another Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, may we abjure and ſacrifice a lawful Prince for the ſafety of his Rebels and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? <hi>Which is moſt neceſſary, that the Nation ſhould be governed, or that ſuch a Prince ſhould govern it? And if he be driven out of his Kingdom and cannot govern, muſt we th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n have no Government? Or how ſhall the Nation be governed, if the Subjects are bound to pay Allegiance to no other Prince?</hi> Let us remember the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and all theſe Queſtions are anſwered. The Loyal Members of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in thoſe days thought it neceſſary that the Nation ſhould be governed by the lawfull Prince, they reſerved their Allegiance for him when he was driven out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and could not govern, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to pay Allegiance to Uſurpers. In ſhort, it is better to be without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to do Evil for the ſake of thoſe who will not be governed by their lawfull Governours. But <hi>this is to make all Mankind the Slaves and Properties of Princes; as if all Men were made for Princes, not Princes for the Government of Men.</hi> To this I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome other Sayings of the former Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> in his <hi>Caſe of Reſiſtance: If the King be God's Miniſter; he is upon that Account as much greater than all as God is.</hi> pag. 104. <hi>The whole Nation is as much Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher Powers a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Doctour may reproach us if he will, for preaching the Doctrine of the Bowſtring, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all Mankind the Slaves and Property of Princes: But then he ſhould renounce his Nonreſiſtence and his King together; for that Doctrine is equally loaded with thoſe Reproaches, and our Principle will be as eaſily diſcharged from them.</p>
               <p>I have now done with the Doctor's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; there are ſome others which are ſcattered in his Book, but they are reducible to theſe I have examined. I have anſwered them fairly, and to my own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſatisfactorily, and all ingenuous Men I hope will be ſatisfied, that if I am in an Errour, I have ſome ſhew of Reaſon for it, though I pretend not to <hi>Demonſtrations, and ſelf-evident Propoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I muſt not give it over thus; for the Doctour has endeavoured to <hi>vindicate</hi> his Arguments: the greater part of his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> relates to Biſhop <hi>Overall</hi>'s Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation-Book, the Caſe of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and the Caſe of Obedience to the late Uſurpers; and theſe Diſputes will be managed better by others: It is my buſineſs to anſwer his Arguments from Scripture and Reaſon; what he offers in his Vindication from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is conſidered before, and now we muſt examine what he offers farther from Reaſon. Our Diſpute, as far as Reaſon is concerned, depends upon this ſingle Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether it can be proved by any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from Principles of Reaſon, that every Uſurper who is ſettled, is inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with God's Authority? But the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour pretends not in his <hi>Vindication</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce new Reaſons for the Affirmative, he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96186:34"/>
only repeats his former Arguments, and fortifies them with new Evaſions.</p>
               <p>His fundamental Argument from Reaſon is contained in his 3d Propoſition, and the ſumm of it is this, <hi>That God governs the World, and ſets up Kings, when by his Providence he advances them to the Throne, that he never does this by his permiſſive Will, becauſe all Events, and eſpecially ſuch as will do moſt good or hurt to the World, muſt be aſſcribed to his poſitive Will, his Order, and Appointment; and hence he concludes, that all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers being advanced by God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are inveſted with his Authority.</hi> I have endeavoured to confute this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in his <hi>Vindication</hi> I meet with a long Diſcourſe<note place="margin">Vind. p. 58. to 62.</note> about Providence where he endeavoured to defend it.</p>
               <p>He demands, <hi>How God does</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 58.</note> 
                  <hi>make Kings in</hi> England? <hi>he ſends no Prophets to annoint them; therefore he makes them no other way but by the Events of Providence, and how does God make Kings by his Providence? Truly this can be done no other way but by placing them in the Throne, and ſettling them there with the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People.</hi> And hence he infers, that when God makes a King by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Settlement, he inveſts him with his Authority, and makes it the Duty of Subjects to obey him. I reply to all this, that God makes Kings in <hi>England</hi> onely by his Providence, is true; but there are two ways of making Kings by Providence, by Permiſſion and Appointment; by the conveyance of Right and Authority, or of bare Power and Poſſeſſion: an Uſurper is made the wrong Way by God's Conceſſion of Power, and Permiſſion of his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But thus the Doctour argues againſt the Advancement of Uſurpers by God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Providence, <hi>A Prince,</hi> ſays he, <hi>may aſcend the Throne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 59.</note> 
                  <hi>and govern a Kingdom for many Years, (it may be 100 Years) without God's Authority, and then it ſhould ſeem that God does not rule in theſe Kingdoms, which he does not diſpoſe of by his own Will and Counſel, but ſuffers <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers to take the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them.</hi> Now if this be an abſurd or impious Conſequence, the Doctour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is bound to anſwer for it: he maintains that a Prince diſpoſſeſſed is diveſted of Gods Authority, and an Uſurper is not inveſted with it, till he is throughly ſettled; but this <hi>Interregnum</hi> may continue 100 years, or more; he acknowledges himſelf, that in <hi>England</hi> there was no Settlement for near 20 years together, in the times of the late ſucceſſive Uſurpations; <hi>and it ſhould ſeem then that God did</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>not rule in this Kingdom, when he onely ſuffered <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers to take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and that God did not govern it, when it was not governed by his Authority or Miniſter.</hi> How the Doctour will anſwer this I know not; but this I know, that God's Providence does govern in times of Uſurpation, of Civil War, of Anarchy, and in thoſe Countries where there is no Civil Government at all; and one may ſafely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that God governed this Kingdom in the time of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> when yet it was not governed by <hi>God's Miniſter,</hi> or by his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> But <hi>does Providence and Government ſignifie onely his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> No man ſays it; <hi>does God look on, and ſee Men ſnatch at Crowns, and take them, and keep them, and exerciſe an Authority which he never gave them?</hi> And does God then inſpire and authorize uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Princes to ſnatch at Crowns, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them? Does he onely look on and ſee infinite Villanies and Impieties every day committed? Does he ſuffer Schiſmaticks, Rebels, Pirates, and Murtherers, to exerciſe an Uſurped Authority which he never gave them? But <hi>to reſolve Providence into a bare Permiſſion, eſpecially</hi>

                  <hi>in matters of ſuch vaſt conſequence is to deny God's Government of the World.</hi> But we reſolve not Providence into a bare Permiſſion; 'tis our Faith, and our excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Comfort, that Providence over-rules Men's Wickedneſs, and brings Good out of Evil; but we believe alſo that God is not the Authour of Sin, be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of the World, but not in Derogation to his Juſtice and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor endeavours to anſwer this Objection againſt his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>That to ſay that proſperous</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, when they are ſettled in the Throne, are placed there by God and have his Authority, is to make God a party to their Wickedneſs.</hi> The force of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection conſiſts in this; that ſince accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctor's Scheme of Principles, it is Wickedneſs in an Uſurper to aſcend the Throne, and it muſt be Wickedneſs alſo to keep it, becauſe the legal Right of the former Prince remains, which to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from him is Injuſtice; hence it follows evidently, That if God authorizes the Uſurper to poſſeſs and keep the Throne, he gives him Authority to commit a Sin, which he will puniſh with Damnation, and is therefore the principal Author of the Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>And how is this Objection Anſwered? Firſt we are told, <hi>It is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt God's Government of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>the World,</hi> and this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>for if God cannot direct and over-rule the Wickedneſs of Men to accompliſh his own Counſels, without being the Author of thoſe Sins, whereby ſuch Events are brought to paſs, there is an end of God's Providence and Holineſs; for the moſt glorious Deſigns of Providence have been accompliſhed by very wicked Means, even the Crucifixion of our Saviour himſelf.</hi> Now this is a great Truth, but nothing to the purpoſe; God can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly over-rule Wickedneſs without being the Author of it; But what then? Does God's over-ruling Providence convey Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to perſiſt in Wickedneſs? Or does it alter the nature of Good and Evil, and make the unjuſt Detention of another's Right to be no Injuſtice? We have no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about God's bringing Good out of Evil; We maintain that it is unlawful to detain another's Right, and that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give Authority to do that which is unlawful, becauſe it is contrary to his Goodneſs and Holineſs: And to ſay that God authorizes no Man to be wicked, I am ſure, is no denial of his Providence, nor any Argument againſt it.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor ſpeaks particularly to the Caſe of transferring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; he ſuppoſes, <hi>No Man will</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 60.</note> 
                  <hi>deny, but that God as the ſupreme Lord of the World may give the Kingdoms of the World to whom he pleaſes, without doing Injuſtice to any Prince, who can have no Right, but by his Gift.</hi> This I grant is his unqueſtionable Prerogative. <hi>Then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the only diſpute can be, about God's bringing ſuch Events to paſs by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men.</hi> I Anſwer, we have no diſpute about it; no doubt it is God's Perogative to give Kingdoms and Riches to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſes; but the Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God does properly give them when they are unjuſtly Poſſeſſed, and when it is a Sin to keep them; if he does, we think the Conſequence is, that he authorizes Wickedneſs, and to this the Doctor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers nothing; but he laboriouſly proves what is nothing to the purpoſe, that it is Juſt for God to bring Good out of Evil. God permits Robberies for good Ends, but this proves not that Robbers have a divine Right to their Booty, it is a Sin to keep it, and as long as it is ſo, we are ſure they have not God's Authority for it.</p>
               <p>He ſuppoſes farther, that God may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ambitious Princes to depopulate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to depoſe Princes, and ſubdue their Kingdoms; and then he asks, <hi>Which moſt becomes the divine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 61.</note> 
                  <hi>Wiſdom to ſuffer ſuch Men, when they pleaſe, to overturn Kingdoms only to gratifie their own Luſts; or to give proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Succeſs to them when he ſees fit to new model the World, to pull down ſuch a Prince or to chaſtiſe ſuch a Nation?</hi> And thus he Anſwers his own Queſtion, <hi>I am ſure this much more becomes the divine Wiſdom, than a bare Permiſſion of ſuch Violence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further Deſign, which does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it.</hi> Thus he ſtill diſputes againſt his own Imaginations; for no one elſe does imagine, that God permits the depoſition of Princes without any other Deſign, than to gratifie the Luſts of Uſurpers; there are many good Ends for which he may
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96186:35"/>
permit it, the Chaſtiſement or the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Princes themſelves, and of their Subjects, the Diſciplining of them by Afflictions, the Tryal of their Faith and Patience, the Illuſtration of his own Glory, and many other Ends that are worthy of the divine Providence. When <hi>Charles</hi> I. was depoſed and murdered, that execrable Violence was permitted for wiſe Ends; but this was no Proof that God had authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively transferred his Kingdoms to his Depoſers and Murderers: And this is a plain Demonſtration, that it may become the divine Wiſdom to ſuffer Princes to be depoſed, and Kingdoms to be ſubdued, without any Deſign of transferring them to Uſurpers.</p>
               <p>But <hi>why may not God give them thoſe Kingdoms which he has overturned by them?</hi> Undoubtedly he may; he may give them by the Conveyance of a lawful Right, or by expreſs Revelation; but the diſpute is not, what God may do, but what he does, and whether he does properly give King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to Uſurpers. But the Doctor ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes again, That <hi>it is as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Sovereignty, Wiſdom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>and Juſtice of God, to give a Kingdom to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, as to ſuffer a wicked Tyrannical Prince to aſcend the Throne with a legal Title.</hi> This he ſuppoſes but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proof, and againſt Reaſon; God by Virtue of his abſolute Sovereignty may give a Kingdom to any one, as he can give any Man's Eſtate, or Wife, to any Man by the ſame Sovereign Dominion: But Firſt, The Poſſeſſion of an Eſtate, Wiſe, or Kingdom, is no Evidence of God's Donation: And Secondly, When God does really give a Kingdom, all former Rights are extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a divine Right, and it is no Injuſtice in him to whom it is given to poſſeſs and keep it. But according to the Doctor's Principle, the Right of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prince is ſtill valid, and he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute it by a lawful War, and therefore it muſt be unjuſt in the new Prince to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it from him; and this does make a great difference between the Doctor's Uſurper, and a Tyrannical Prince with a legal Title; the later has lawful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God which he can keep and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe without Sin, the Tyrannical abuſe of it is yet wholly from himſelf, and is only permitted by God for Ends agreeable to his Wiſdom and Juſtice. But the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Uſurper has Authority given him by God, and yet the Poſſeſſion and Defence of it againſt the lawful Prince is unjuſt and unlawful; now this is a plain contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the nature of the Thing, and to God's Wiſdom and Juſtice alſo, for hereby God is made to authorize that which is formally unjuſt, which is contradictory to his Juſtice; and to give a Prince a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and yet oblige him to reſtore it, which is diſagreeable to his Wiſdom. But in ſhort, let the Doctor prove if he can, that it is no Sin in an Uſurper to poſſeſs himſelf of the Throne, and that he is not bound to reſtore it, and there ſhall be an end of this Controverſie; I will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he has God's Authority, and that his Principle does not charge God as being the Author of Wickedneſs; but if that be impoſſible to be proved, he may waſh and varniſh, and lay on Colours till he is weary, the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> will ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>his Skin, and the</hi> Leopard <hi>his ſpots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Objection he labours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move is this, That his Principle <hi>juſtifies an unreaſonable and wicked</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Doctrine, by making the Acts or Permiſſions of Providence a Rule for prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice againſt Right and Juſtice.</hi> The ſumm of his Anſwer is this; <hi>He acknowledges that it is impious to juſtifie Actions from Succeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to conclude that is God's Cauſe, which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence proſpers, becauſe it confounds the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Good and Evil, and deſtroys all the ſtanding Rules of Right and Juſtice: But yet it is a neceſſary Duty to diſcharge thoſe Duties which the Providence of God lays upon us according to the Nature and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Providence; and thus God's Providence may in ſome Senſe be a Rule of Practice, and may make or extinguiſh a Duty by changing our relations or condition of Life; as in the preſent Caſe he muſt transfer my Allegiance when he changes my King.</hi> In another place he ſtates it<note place="margin">Vin. <hi>p.</hi> 44.</note> thus, <hi>The Laws of God are the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96186:35"/>
Rules of Good and Evil to us, not his Providence; but Providence lays new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations upon us by creating new Relations: The Laws of God preſcribe the Duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Prince, but the Providence of God makes him.</hi> I Anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. That impious Doctrine which teaches, that the Cauſe, which Providence proſpers, is God's, does ſeem the unavoidable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Doctor's Principle; for he teaches that all Events are God's doing, and that he poſitively decrees, appoints, accompliſhes all Uſurpations: But if all Events are God's doing, he is certainly the Author of that which he does; and in ſuch Events which are neceſſarily and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably accompanied with Iniquity, he muſt be the Author of the Iniquity too: And as to the Event of Uſurpation, if he decrees, aſſiſts, and accompliſhes it, if he does all this for Uſurpers, we muſt needs conclude, that their Cauſe is Gods', for it is impoſſible for God to do more than this for any Cauſe whatſoever.</p>
               <p>2. If the Laws of God, and not his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, are the Rules of Good and Evil to us, then it follows undeniably, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of it ſelf can never direct us how to diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil; and therefore when the Queſtion is, whether an Action be lawful or not, we muſt have recourſe to Laws, and not to Providence, to determine it: Thus when we diſpute about Allegiance to Uſurpers, the Queſtion muſt be, whether there be any Law that requires it; and if there be no ſuch Law, it is certain there is no ſuch Duty. It is true that the divine Providence does change our Condition and Relations, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing new Relations, does oblige us to new Duties: But it is alſo certain that all Changes which befall, our Selves, or the Perſons to whom we are related, do not extinguiſh our Relations and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, and therefore we muſt have ſome other Rule beſides Providence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us when they are extinguiſhed. When I am in Priſon, or my Father i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in Priſon, here is a providential Change, but no Ceſſation of Relation or Duty. When the Courſe of civil Government is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by Rebellion, and the Prince cannot actually adminiſter; here is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Change which affects my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, but is no diſcharge of my Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</p>
               <p>And how then ſhall I know when the Events of Providence do extinguiſh my Duty? My Duty does not ceaſe upon every Change in the condition of my Sovereign that is made by Providence, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Events of Providence ſhould direct me, when it is extinguiſhed by any Event of Providence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt be directed by ſome other Rule, which may inform me, when any Duty is extinguiſhed by a Change of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and that Rule can be nothing elſe but Law, either divine or humane Law. Thus it appears that though a Change is made ſometimes in our Duties, by the Events of Providence, yet our only Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Law, and thither we muſt appeal at laſt in all our Controverſies about the Change of Duty; and the reſult is, that if there be no Law that requires Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Uſurpers, the Events of Providence cannot make it to be a Duty. <hi>Providence,</hi> 'tis true, <hi>does make Kings, and God tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs my Allegiance when he changes my King:</hi> But the Queſtion is, whether Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence does not make Kings by Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and whether when my lawful Prince is diſpoſſeſſed, my Relation to him is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; and the only way to determine thoſe Doubts, is by appealing not to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but to Law and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Doctor tells us, <hi>That we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves in the diſcharge of thoſe Duties that Providence lays upon us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and intention of the Providence.</hi> But how ſhall I know that it is the intention of Providence, when an Uſurper is advanced, that I ſhould pay Allegiance to him? I know that God diſapproves Uſurpations and ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them, and declares that he will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them; and I know alſo, if Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſo great a Wickedneſs, that God's Providence does not aſſiſt or authorize it, though he does not interpoſe his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Power to hinder it, this I am
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96186:36"/>
taught by natural and reveal'd Religion, and I find no Precept in either to aſſiſt any Man in his Wickedneſs; in the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Uſurpation I find nothing but Injuſtice, in the Rebellion or Invaſion, in ſetting the Uſurper on the Throne, and in ſupporting him on it; and therefore I have reaſon to conclude, that ſince my Aſſiſtance is unlawful, neither the <hi>Nature</hi> nor <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Providence does require it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remain ſome other Objections and Evaſions in the <hi>Vindication</hi> which relate to Providence, and I will conſider them as they occur.</p>
               <p>He objects againſt our Principle, that it oppoſes Providence to Providence; the force of the Objection is this; <hi>God does ſettle the Crown on any</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vind. <hi>p.</hi> 43, 45.</note> 
                  <hi>Family no otherwiſe but by his Providence, and when an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper is ſetled in the Throne, he is advanc'd by Providence too; and therefore to oppoſe an Hereditary Right which is made by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Influence of Providence, against God's ſetting up an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper by other Acts of his Providence, is to oppoſe Providence againſt Providence, his former Providence againſt his later Providence.</hi> Now there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity at all in oppoſing Providence to Providence: A Divine Entail is nothing but an Act of Providence, and yet the Doctor thinks that the Providential Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of an Uſurper is of no validity againſt it, and thus himſelf does oppoſe Providence to Providence. God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may make Kings by Nomination, by the conveyance of a legal Right, and by granting Poſſeſſion without Settlement, and Poſſeſſion with it: And if it be no Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to oppoſe and prefer the firſt to all the others, and the fourth to the third, why is it abſurd to prefer the ſecond to the third and fourth: It would be abſurd indeed if the latter Providence were as clear a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of God's poſitive Will as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but that is the great Controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: All Men are agreed, that when a lawful King is on the Throne he has God's Authority; but not that an Uſurper ſetled or unſetled is inveſted with it. I am ſure there is a Providence that is only permiſſive, which conveys no Authority, which we cannot poſſibly diſtinguiſh, but by the moral nature of Events; and I think it is no abſurdity to diſtinguiſh Providence, nor to oppoſe Wrong to Right, a permiſſive Providence to a legal Right, which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by God's Authoritative Providence. And this ſingle Obſervation, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all that yet appears, an Uſurper is advanc'd only by permiſſive Providence, is a ſufficient Anſwer to all the Reflections which he makes upon our oppoſing Providence to Providence.</p>
               <p>He obſerves, that <hi>this is to ſhackle and confine Providence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>and that we will not allow God's Providence to change and alter.</hi> We only maintain that God's permiſſive Providence is no diſcharge of our Allegiance, and that we may not abjure and reſiſt our lawful Sovereign, becauſe God has ſuffer'd others to rebel, or to depoſe him: We confine not God's Providence, but we confine our ſelves to that which is juſt and lawful, and we hope it is no <hi>ſhackling</hi> of God, to ſay he is not the Author of Iniquity.</p>
               <p>He obſerves that when lawful Kings and Uſurpers are advanc'd,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>it is all but Providence ſtill;</hi> and he deſires to know, <hi>why the Providence of an Entail is more Sacred and Obligatory than any other act of Providence, which gives a ſetled Poſſeſſion of the Throne?</hi> And is not an unſetled Poſſeſſion an effect of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence too? Is a Divine Entail any thing more than an Act of Providence? <hi>It is all but Providence ſtill.</hi> But the Anſwer is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; it is God's Authority, and not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which is Obligatory; we are ſure that Lawful Kings have his Authority, but not that Uſurpers have it, they are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by God, but by his permiſſive Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence only.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He raiſes a great Duſt about oppoſing Humane<note place="margin">Pag. 43.</note> Rights and Laws to God's Authority. I will not diſpute with him about the Obligation of Humane Laws; it is enough to anſwer, that he ſuppoſes what he has not proved, that Uſurpers have God's Authority, becauſe they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd by his Providence; and if this is not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96186:36"/>
true, all his Harangues about Humane Laws and Providence do ſignify nothing. I have often urged the Caſe of Robbery, and the unjuſt poſſeſſion of private Eſtates and Properties, to ſhew the unconcluſiveneſs of all his Arguments from Providence, and to prove that Poſſeſſion by Providence is no Evidence of Divine Right or Authority. But the Doctor has found out Diſtinctions and Evaſions to take off the Force of theſe Inſtances, and now I am at leiſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of his Firſt Anſwer is, <hi>That the Diſpute is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſe of Al. p. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>not about legal Right but about Authority; no Man pretends that Thieves and Pirates have God's Authority; they have Force and Violence which every Man may ſubmit to when he cannot help it: but Sovereign Power is God's Authority, though Princes may be advanc'd to it by no honeſter means than Theft or Burglary.</hi> I anſwer, 1. That no difference is here aſſign'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Uſurpations of Sovereignty and private Property, but only this, that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power is God's Authority: I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd all his Arguments whereby he would make good his Propoſition, and if this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be unprov'd, the Evaſion that is founded on it muſt needs be inſufficient.</p>
               <p>2. This Evaſion is at laſt a begging of the Queſtion; the Fundamental Diſpute is, Whether God's Authority is always annex'd unto Sovereign Power? His Fundamental Argument from Reaſon, is that all Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Events are God's Appointment; it is objected that Piracy and Robbery are Providential Events, as well as Uſurpation; and the ſumm of his Anſwer is this, That So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power is God's Authority, which is nothing but arguing in a Circle, and is plainly <hi>petitio principii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Thieves and Pirates have often Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power; they exerciſe the Power of the Sword, they make Laws, decide Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and aſſume all the Properties and Badges of Sovereign Authority; and to make them abſolutely God's Ordinance according to the Doctor's Principle, the Sovereign Thieves and Pyrates are ſetled in their Adminiſtration by the voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Submiſſion of their Subjects; ſuch there have been in the World, and ſuch there may be, and whenever they ſhall be, they will have as good a Title to God's Authority as any Uſurper, for <hi>Sovereign Power is God's Authority,</hi> and when once the Subject Thieyes have conſented to their Sovereignty, upon pain of Damnation they muſt pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Allegiance to them.</p>
               <p>4. It has been anſwer'd, that Thieves and Pyrates have God's Providence as well as Uſurpers, though they have not God's Anthority. A Thief cannot take a Purſe whether God will or no, and he muſt have the Concurrence of God's Providence to take it, and if theſe are Arguments of God's Will and Appointment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Providence give a Divine Right, it is certain that the Thief has it, as well as the Uſurper, for they have both the ſame evidence for it.</p>
               <p>To this the Doctor replies, <hi>That there is a great difference</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vind. <hi>pag.</hi> 54, 55.</note> 
                  <hi>between theſe Caſes, which is this, that to the ſettlement of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, nothing more is requir'd but a meer legal Humane Right, and though the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God allots Men's private Fortunes, yet he gives no Man a Right to an Eſtate which he has got by Fraud, Injuſtice, and Violence; but leaves all ſuch legal Rights to the care of publick Government. But on the contrary, it is God's Authority which makes a King, and not a meer Humane Right, and God's Authority is not inſeparably annexed to Humane Entails, for he can make a King without a Humane Right; if meer Law made a King, as it makes an Heir to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, it were very unjuſt to own any but a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal King; but if God can remove a legal King and ſet up an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, then it is no Injuſtice when God does ſo, to transfer our Allegiance.</hi> This contains the force of his Reply, and in Anſwer to it I obſerve,</p>
               <p>1. That this is no Reply to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is only levell'd againſt his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Providence, the ſumm of it is this; that the Uſurpation of a Crown and an Eſtate are effected alike by Providence, and that 'tis impoſſible to find any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Concurrence of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Providence proves a Right, the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96186:37"/>
Uſurper of an Eſtate has a divine Right to it. The Doctour replies, that a legal Right is ſufficient for an Eſtate, but to make a King he muſt have God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Admit this to be true, what does it ſignifie to the Diſpute about Providence? How does it ſhew that there is not the ſame concurrence of Providence to the Uſurping of an Eſtate and the Uſurping of a Kingdom? As God can give Kingdoms, ſo he can give Eſtates to whomſoever he will, and if the meer providential Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Kingdom, is a proof that it is God's Will to give it, why is not the ſame providential Advancement to an Eſtate, a proof of the divine Donation alſo? If God may give the Poſſeſſion of an Eſtate without a Right to keep it, ſo he may give Kingdoms; and if God's Providence does not over-rule and cancel the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws in the one Caſe, how ſhall it appear that it cancels them in the other? he acknowledges that Providence gives no Right to the unjuſt Poſſeſſion of an Eſtate, and yet the unjuſt Poſſeſſion is certainly an Event; and therefore he muſt quit his fundamental Argument, which is drawn from the Events of Providence; for he muſt either confeſs that all Events are not God's Doing, or that his Doing, his Giving Poſſeſſion of any thing is no Evidence of any Right or Authority to poſſeſs it. In ſhort, his Reply is a Confeſſion that his general Arguments from Providence are unconcluſive. God's Providence is nothing when it conveys the unjuſt Poſſeſſion of an Eſtate; but when it conveys a Crown to an unjuſt Uſurper, it is an uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Evidence of his poſitive Will and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; this Diſtinction cannot be deduc'd from Providence itſelf, for in both Caſes the Concurrence is the ſame, he muſt go to ſomething elſe to prove it, either Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Scripture, and all his Arguments from both I have examined already.</p>
               <p>2. The ſame difference that is aſſigned in the Reply between a Crown and an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, may be applied to other Caſes; I will inſtance in a Biſhop's Right to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty, and to ſpiritual Juriſdiction; to the former nothing is required beſides a mere humane Right, but to enjoy the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he muſt have God's Authority; ſuppoſe now that both are uſurped by an illegal and ſchiſmatical Intruder, who is certainly in ſome ſenſe <hi>Epiſcopus divina Providentia:</hi> The Dr. will confeſs, that Providence has given him no Right to the Temporalties; the Queſtion then is, whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> has a Right to the Spiritual Juriſdiction, which is God's Authority? It may be urged, that there is indeed an ordinary lawful way, whereby Biſhops are inveſted with that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but God's Authority is not inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably annexed to that ordinary Vocation, he can make a Biſhop without it, and when he does ſo, a mere lawfull Vocation is not a ſufficient Reaſon to adhere to a Biſhop depoſed by God, nor can the want of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſtiſie the diſowning of a Biſhop whom God has advanced. The plain Reſolution of ſuch a Caſe is this: God can make a Biſhop without an ordinary Vocation, but this he never does, and he that pretends to an extraordinary Call, is bound to prove it by indubitable Evidence; if he cannot, we muſt reject the extraordinary, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the ordinary Biſhop, and they that do otherwiſe are ſchiſmatical Dividers of Catholick Communion. And thus it is in the Caſe of Kingdoms; God can depoſe a lawful King, and ſet up an Uſurper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out antecedent Right; but before we can transfer our Allegiance, we muſt be ſure that God has done this: The pretender to an extraordinary Commiſſion muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce extraordinary Evidence, but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Events of Providence are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove it; for the Thief and the ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Biſhop are in Poſſeſſion by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as well as the Uſurper; and many things do happen under the Direction of Providence, which God himſelf does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and puniſh, which Men are bound by God to reſiſt to the utmoſt of their Power.</p>
               <p>3. There is no ſuch great Diſparity, as is pretended, between Right to a Crown and Right to an Eſtate. Right in general is a moral Quality, whereby we may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs or doe any thing juſtly, it extends to Government of Perſons, as well as poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96186:37"/>
of Things, and when it is applied to the former it is called Authority: the Rule and meaſure of Right is Law, and the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Law does proceed onely from the Authority of God. A Right to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is a moral Power of poſſeſſing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it juſtly; a Right to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Family or Kingdom, is a moral Power to command thoſe Societies; and where there is no Right to command, there can be no Obligation to obey; theſe Rights may be acquired by the poſitive Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, and the Laws of Civil Societies, which are onely ſo many ſeveral ways of God's revealing his Will to Mankind; and therefore all Right either to Government or Eſtates, muſt be ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved into the Authority of God, the only Lawgiver; concerning the Right to govern there is no Queſtion; and as to Eſtates and other private Poſſeſſions, it ſeems evident, that no humane Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as merely humane, can create a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Right to any thing: for humane Law is nothing but the Will of Men, and the Act of one Man conveying a Poſſeſſion to another, cannot oblige a third Perſon to abſtain from it, and therefore cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate it as the Right of the other; the Obligation muſt proceed from ſome Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſuperiour to both, which does bind the one by the Act of the other, and that can be no other but God's Authority. In ſhort, Right is the Effect of Law, and Law hath its Obligation from God; and hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that as God's Authority is neceſſary to make a King, ſo is it neceſſary likewiſe to create a Right to an Eſtate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this reſpect there is no difference between the one Right and the other; for both are ultimately founded on God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. God by his Sovereign Dominion can diſpoſe of Eſtates as well as Crowns againſt Law, but humane Laws cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of either without God's Authority, but the Power of God to doe a thing is no Proof that he does it, and Providential Poſſeſſion is ſtill as good Evidence of God's Authority to an Eſtate, as of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to govern.</p>
               <p>There remains yet another Reply to the Objection, which muſt alſo be conſidered, it is this: That <hi>all private Injuries are reſerv'd by God</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vind. p. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>himſelf to the redreſs of Civil Government and Courts of Judicature, and therefore his Providence has no effect at all on ſuch perſonal Rights: But the nature of the Thing proves, that when ſuch Diſputes ariſe which are too big for humane Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which God hath reſerved to his own Judgment, as the Correction of Sovereign Princes, and the transferring of Kingdoms; here the final Determinations of Providence in ſettling Princes on their Thrones, does draw the Allegiance of Subjects after it.</hi> This contains the force of his Evaſion, and the firſt Anſwer to the former may ſuſtice to this; that though this difference be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between private Robbery, and the Uſurpation of a Crown, yet there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them as to the concurrence of Providence; for Robbery is a providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Event, and if every Event is God's Will and Appointment, the Robbery is confirmed by God's Will, and if the Civil Magiſtrate does redreſs it, he fights againſt God, by contradicting his Order and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. But,</p>
               <p>2. There is often no ſuch Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Robbery and Uſurpation; there is none when the <hi>Banditi</hi> are ſo ſtrong and powerfull, that the Civil Powers are not able to ſubdue them, for then their Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are too big for legal Redreſs; there is none in a ſtate of Nature when there is no Civil Government; there is none when Anarchy is introduced by Civil War, and the Adminiſtration of Juſtice is obſtructed by Rebellion; and laſtly there is none, when the injurious Poſſeſſion of an Eſtate cannot poſſibly be cleared by legal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: In all theſe Caſes it is impoſſible that Oppreſſions, Thefts, and Robberies, ſhould be redreſſed by humane Judicature; it is God alone that can redreſs them, and therefore according to the Doctour's way of arguing, <hi>the final Determination of Providence</hi> does in ſuch Caſes <hi>create a Right,</hi> and the unjuſt Poſſeſſour is not bound to Reſtitution.</p>

                  <hi>But,</hi> faith the Doctor, <hi>to make the Caſes parallel, he who</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>unjuſtly ſeizes another Man's Eſtate, muſt be throughly ſettled in it; but that no private Man can be who is under the Government of Laws, and has not ligal Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and when he has, whether Right or Wrong, he muſt not be violently diſpoſſeſſed again.</hi> But, 1. If we may ſuppoſe a ſtate of Nature, we may ſuppoſe a private Man, who is not under the Government of civil Laws, to be throughly ſettled in an Eſtate, which is by Right another's, and then the Caſe is parallel; the unjuſt Poſſeſſor has a Providential Right, and being under no Government, his claim by Providence is the ſame as the Doctor makes for Uſurpers, and it proves a divine Right to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Injuſtice. 2. When an Eſtate is unjuſtly poſſeſſed, and yet the juſt Right cannot poſſibly be proved by legal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, here is a through legal Settlement of the unjuſt Poſſeſſion, for which there is no legal redreſs, and therefore this Caſe is parallel in that reſpect to the Uſurpation of a Kingdom; the Queſtion upon it is, Whether the Intruder has a divine Right by Providence, and may therefore law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keep what God has given him? 'Tis true the injured Perſon cannot reſtore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Force, becauſe he has no Authority to uſe if, but 'tis certain the unjuſt Selzor is bound to Reſtitution, though the Law cannot compel him, and therefore has acquired no Right by his providential Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: And ſo is the Uſurper of a Crown obliged in Conſcience to reſtore it, and that is a plain Demonſtration that he has no Right to it; but if he will not reſtore it, the diſpoſſeſſed Prince has Authority to compel him, he may make a lawful War upon him, he has ſtill the Power of the Sword, and that is a Demonſtration that he has God's Authority: And thus much concerning the Objection about Thieves and Pirates. But there remain ſomethings more to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The Doctor obſerves in his Vindication, That his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary<note place="margin">Vind. p. 11.</note> is blundered for want of clear and diſtinct Notions concerning legal Powers, and he pretends to clear all the Difficulties by ſtating the Terms. Now, ſays he, <hi>We may underſtand legal, either with reſpect to the Laws of Nature, the Law of Nations, or the Law of a particular Kingdom; and in this laſt Senſe legal is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by all Men, who underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this Controverſie of legal Powers.</hi> Well, if I underſtand not my ſelf, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it, for I underſtand as well as I am able, and by legal Powers I have always underſtood ſuch Powers as are according to Law, either the Law of God, of Nature, of Nations, or of political Societies. In the preſent Controverſie the great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, to what Powers our Allegiance is due, we think it is due to legal Powers, and if it would be clearly proved, that an Uſurper is a legal Power according to any Law whatſoever, this Controverſie would be ended.</p>
               <p>He grants however, <hi>That le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Powers may be underſtood</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>in a larger Notion, as that may be ſaid to be legal, which is agreable to the Laws of Nature and Nations;</hi> and he adds, <hi>In this Senſe Submiſſion may make a legal King of him, who by the Laws of the Land can be only King</hi> de Facto. Now this, as he ſays, is <hi>worth conſidering,</hi> and a very little conſideration will ſhew the Inconſiſtency of this Doctrine. For according to the Doctor's Hypotheſis, the King <hi>de Facto</hi> has a legal Right by the Laws of Nature and Nations, and the diſpoſſeſſed Prince has ſtill a legal Right by the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And hence it follows undeniably, that at the ſame time two oppoſite Kings may have a legal Right to the ſame Throne, the one by the Law of Nature and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the other by the Law of the Kingdom. But it is eaſie to ſhew, that this does imply a manifeſt Repugnancy, and I will exemplifie it in the inſtances of <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Oliver. Charles</hi> is the legal King by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Oliver</hi> (who is in Poſſeſſion with the Submiſſion of the People) by the Laws of Nature and Nations; and hence it follows that <hi>Charles</hi> has a Right to be King, and <hi>Oliver</hi> has a Right to be King; but <hi>Charles</hi> has
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96186:38"/>
no Right becauſe it is in <hi>Oliver,</hi> and <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> has no Right becauſe it is in <hi>Charles.</hi> But though <hi>Charles</hi> has a Right to the Crown, yet he has no Right to poſſeſs it, for <hi>Oliver</hi> is a rightful Poſſeſſor of it, and yet he has no Right to keep it, becauſe <hi>Charles</hi> has a Right to take it from him. There cannot poſſibly be a greater abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity either in Law or Nature, than to ſay that the Poſſeſſor and the Diſpoſſeſſed, the Plaintiff and Defendant, have at the ſame inſtant a true and real Right to the ſame thing in Queſtion. When two oppoſite Rights are pleaded, the one is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none, if the Poſſeſſor has a good Right by the Law of Nature, the Right of the Diſpoſſeſſed muſt needs be extinguiſhed, for he cannot have a Right to poſſeſs that which is anothers by the Law of Nature, and if he has no Right to poſſeſs, he has no Right to recover, and his legal Right at laſt is only a Right to nothing. If the Doctor therefore can prove that his Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per has a Right by the Law of Nature and Nations, I will acknowledge that Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is due to him, and there is an end of the Controverſie; but in all his Harangues about the ſtate of Nature, the ſtate of Force, and the Submiſſion of the People, there is no Argument that proves it. In a ſtate of Nature, when Men are free from any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, a free Conſent, or a forced Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, are enough to make rightful Princes by the Law of Nature: But the Caſe is different, when rightful Princes are eſtabliſhed, and Subjects are ſworn to pay Allegiance to them; for then the Subjects are not <hi>ſui juris,</hi> they have no Right to conſent, and therefore their Conſent is nothing.</p>
               <p>But a ſtate of Force the Doctor thinks is parallel to a<note place="margin">Vind. p. 13.</note> ſtate of Nature, and when a Nation is Conquered, or private Subjects are under the Power of an Uſurper, then he thinks that <hi>force will juſtifie Submiſſion;</hi> and ſo do I too, and his own inſtance does ſufficiently prove it, for he tells us, <hi>When we happen to fall into the</hi>

Force will juſtifie Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Robbers, but will it juſtifie the aſſiſting of Robbers, or the joyning in Robbery with them?

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to a King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> with all the <hi>Miſtakes, Nonſenſe,</hi> and <hi>Trifling</hi> which the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour now diſcovers in it, had notwithſtanding the Doctour's <hi>Imprimatur</hi> before it ſaw the Light, as you may fully aſſure your ſelf from the following <hi>Teſtimony of a Perſon</hi> of very good Credit, who ſome time ſince gave me this following Account.</p>
            <q>The Caſe of Allegiance to a King in Poſſeſſion in M. S. was recommended to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> who read it over, and mightily approved it, and wiſhed it were <hi>then</hi> actually printed, eſpecially for the ſake of Dr.—who had written a Letter to him (which he alſo then read) wherein he endeavoured to perſuade him that Allegiance was due to the <hi>Regnant Power.</hi> He urged to have it <hi>printed</hi> as ſoon as might be, and that Care might be taken that Dr.—ſhould have a Copy; which ſhews a ſtrange Temper in the Maſter, to treat a Book and an Authour at ſuch a rate, which a little before he did ſo approve and commend.</q>
            <p>The Authour ought to take this for a very great Honour done him by the Doctour, as great as if the Book had been <hi>Licenced</hi> under his hand; and it will be ſome Comfort to him, to hear that once he ſtood ſo fair in the Doctor's Opinion, notwithſtanding his cuſtomary Complements of <hi>Nonſenſe and Trifling.</hi> But it is more material to obſerve, that the Doctour ſeems by this Account to have been more <hi>buſie againſt the Oaths while he refuſed them,</hi> than he is willing to acknowledge. He diſclaims being <hi>ever engaged in any Faction againſt taking the Oaths,</hi> or <hi>making it his buſineſs</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pref. p. 2.</note> 
               <hi>to diſſuade Men from it, or ſeeking out Men to make Proſelites,</hi> but confeſſes only that he <hi>declared his Thoughts</hi> againſt them <hi>when he was asked.</hi> But it ſeems to be a little <hi>more;</hi> for a Man to be a <hi>Party</hi> to the <hi>Printing</hi> of a <hi>Book</hi> tending to <hi>diſſuade Men from taking the Oaths,</hi> and <hi>to make Proſelites againſt it,</hi> for him to <hi>wiſh it were actually printed,</hi> to <hi>urge the printing it as ſoon as poſſible,</hi> and to direct whither a <hi>Copy</hi> ſhould be ſent. If this be more than what the Reverend Doctour would ſeem to own, he may have forgot that he was ſo far engaged in one Overt-Act for the <hi>making Proſelites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Oaths;</hi> and it would be more charitable for him to diſtruſt <hi>his own Memory,</hi> than to caſt a Slander upon the <hi>Inventions</hi> of his <hi>Neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would beg your leave to add one thing more, with regard to the Doctor's Raillery againſt the Notion of <hi>Preſumptive Conſent.</hi> He ſays, it <hi>is a very pretty Notion,</hi>

It <hi>ſerves a great many good turns;</hi> ſo that the Dr. looks upon it as a Notion fit for no purpoſe but <hi>to ſerve a turn;</hi> and one would think then, that he above all Men ſhould not ever have made uſe of it to <hi>ſerve his turn</hi> upon occaſion. And yet if we look back into his former Writings, we ſhall find that no other Authour has ſerved himſelf of this Notion in a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner than the Reverend Dr. In his <note place="margin">Ed. 1682.</note>
