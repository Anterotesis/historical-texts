         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF in adventuring to lay this little
Piece at your Highneſſes Feet, and
humbly beg your Royal Protection
of it, I have preſum'd too far, be pleas'd
to impute it to your own, moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Goodneſs, the knowledge of which
encourag'd me. Our Sex are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tender of their own Off-ſpring,
and may be allow'd to have more
fondneſs for thoſe of the Brain, then
any other; becauſe they are ſo few,
and meet with ſo many Enemies at
their firſt appearance in the World.
I hope therefore to find pardon, if like
an indulgent Parent, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to advance my firſt Born, by
entering it very early into your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48164:3"/>
I have not preſum'd to approach
your Highneſs out of any Confidence
in the merits of this Eſſay, but of the
Cauſe which it pleads, wherein the
Honour of the whole Sex ſeem'd to
exact of me no leſs a Patronage than
that of the Beſt, as well as Greateſt
among 'em, whom they are all am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
to ſee at their head. I have
only endeavour'd to reduce the Sexes
to a Level, and by Arguments to
raiſe Ours to an Equallity at moſt
with the Men: But your Highneſs
by Illuſtrious Example daily convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the World of our Superiority,
and we ſee with wonder, Vertues in
you, Madam, greater than your Birth.
In this I am peculiarly happy, that I
am exempted from the common Task
of other Dedicators, who lie under
an Obligation to publiſhing to the
World thoſe Excellencies of their
Patrons, which perhaps appear no
where but in their Epiſtles. In me
it were as great folly, to pretend to
<pb facs="tcp:48164:3"/>
make known the Illuſtrious Qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of your Highneſs, as it wou'd be
to go about to demonſtrate by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that the Sun ſhin'd, to a
Crowd that are warm'd by the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of it.</p>
            <p>I had attempted the Character of
a conſummate Woman, could I, tho'
but faintly have ſhaddow'd the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable
Graces of you Highneſs; but
the impoſſibillity of that Task forc'd
me to deſiſt. It were eaſy here to
lanch into thoſe glorious particulars,
which affirmed of any other than
your Royal Highneſs, would have
been extravagance of Flattery; but
to you Injuſtice, and in me the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
preſumption, to attempt with my
feeble Hand thoſe Perfections, which
the ableſt muſt fall infinitely ſhort
of. The luſtre of your Royal Vertues,
Madam, like the Sun, gives us
warmth and light, and while at a
modeſt diſtance we admire it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
our ſight, which too bold a
<pb facs="tcp:48164:4"/>
view confounds, yet the meaneſt and
moſt ignorant ſee thoſe Glories,
which the moſt exquiſite Artiſt can
never expreſs. The World therefore
will rather juſtify than comdemn my
conduct, if I do not wrong ſo bright
an Original with a dark obſcure Copy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> Tho' the world may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
my performance, it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
my choice in this Addreſs, and
own that had I known as well how to
Argue, as to Inſtance, I muſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have Triumph'd over all Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It may be eaſie to evade, or
baſtle the force of my Arguments,
but it is impoſſible without the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Stupidity, and Injuſtice to deny
the manifeſt Advantages of thoſe
Illuſtrious Graces, which raiſe your
Highneſs ſo far above theirs as well
as your own Sex. In this I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated
the conduct of prudent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
who, when they doubt the
ſufficiency of their ſtrength, retire
to ſome ſtrong Fort, and reſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb facs="tcp:48164:4"/>
under the Protection of it.</p>
            <p>There is yet another Reaſon, <hi>Madam,</hi>
which tho' the leaſt juſtifiable, was
nevertheleſs moſt prevalent with me
to devote this Eſſay to your Highneſs.
My Ambition to ſhew the profound
Reſpects I have always had for your
Highneſs, would not ſuffer me to let
ſlip any occaſion of expreſſing it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
tho I bluſh for the meanes of it.
Thus I find my ſelf reduc'd by my
Zeal, to the condition of poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
who muſt expoſe their Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to ſhew their Affection to their
Lord in a worthleſs Preſent. I am
ſenſible of the raſhneſs of my Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in aſpiring to the Patronage of
Your Highneſs, and the need I have
of an Apology; but were I able to
make one as I ought, I ſhould have
taken care to have had leſs occaſion
for it. Yet I doubt not from Your
Goodneſs that Indulgence, which I
cannot expect from Your Juſtice,
nor but that you will (like Heaven,
<pb facs="tcp:48164:5"/>
whoſe more immediate Images Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are) accept my unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
for the ſincerity with which it
is tender'd. If my unfeign'd Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
may procure pardon for my
Preſumption, that Your Happineſs
may equal Your illuſtrious Vertues,
and Your Royal Perſon be as far
out of the reach of Fortune, as your
Fame and Honour of Detraction,
ſhall ever be the prayers of</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
Your Royal Highneſs's
moſt Humble, moſt
Obedient, and moſt
Devoted Servant</closer>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PRefaces to moſt Books, are like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutors
to Puppet-Shows, they
come firſt to tell you what Figures are
to be preſented, and what Tricks they
are to play. According therefore to
ancient and laudable Cuſtom, I have
thought fit to let you know by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
or Advertiſement, (call it which you
pleaſe) that here are many fine Figures
within to be ſeen, as well worth your
curioſity, as any in <hi>Smithfield</hi> at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi>
Tide. I will not deny, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but that you may have ſeen ſome
of 'em there already; to thoſe that have,
I have little more to ſay, than that if
they have a mind to ſee them again in
Effigie, they may do it here. What is
it you wou'd have? Here are St.
<hi>George's, Batemans, John Dories,
Punchinello's,</hi> and the <hi>Creation of the
World,</hi> or what's as good; here's the
<hi>German Artiſt</hi> too, or one that can
ſhow more Tricks than he: If all this
will not invite you, y'are grown more
<pb facs="tcp:48164:6"/>
ſqueamiſh of late, Gentlemen, than you
us'd to be, and the poor Bookſeller will
make but an indifferent Market of you.
Well, let the worſt come to the worſt,
'tis but ſhifting the ſcene to <hi>Smithfield,</hi>
and making an Intereſt in half a dozen
Vizor-Masks to be ſure of your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
But he, good Man, is deſirous to
pleaſe you at firſt hand, and therefore
has put a fine Picture in the front to
invite you in, ſo like ſome of you (as
he proteſts) that you ought never look
in a Glaſs again, if it offends you. For
my part, I declare, he has acted clear
againſt my Opinion in this caſe, and ſo
he has been told; for many a poor Man
has loſt the ſhowing of his Monſter, by
gratifying the curioſity of the gaping
Crowd with too exact a picture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doors. Beſides, there's an unlucky
Rogue of a left-handed Barber, that
looks like an ill Omen in the beginning.
He was told too, that if he wou'd pleaſe
moſt of you, he ought to take example
by your Glaſſes and flatter you. Yet
he continued obſtinate and unmoveable
to all theſe weighty Reaſons, and is ſo
fondly bent for his Picture, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
againſt all advice to have it.
<pb facs="tcp:48164:6"/>
Nay, and he wou'd have Rhimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
it too, which, he ſays, weigh
more with you, than all the Reaſon in
the world. I thought fit to let you
know this, that the Bookſeller might
not loſe the credit of his Fancy, if it
takes with you, as he is perſwaded it
will. For you muſt know, I am a great
lover of ſtrict Juſtice, and therefore
would by no means Rob, or Defraud
him of the Glory of his Invention, or
by any ſiniſter way ſullie, or diminiſh
the Honour, or Reputation of his Parts
and Ingenuity. For the ſame Reaſon
likewiſe I muſt acquaint you, that the
Rhimes are none of mine neither; and
now my Hand is in, I don't much care
if I tell you, that I am not very good
at that ingenious Recreation, called
<hi>Crambo,</hi> from which ſome riſe to be
very conſiderable Rhimers. This now
is more then I was oblig'd to tell you,
and therefore I hope no body will deny,
but that I deal ingenuouſly at leaſt
with you.</p>
            <p>This one would think were Preface
ſufficient; but there are ſome Men ſo
impertinently curious, that they muſt
needs have a Reaſon for every thing,
<pb facs="tcp:48164:7"/>
that is done in the World, tho' it were
in their favour (for which perhaps it
were hard to give a good one) when
it were their Intereſt to be ſatisfied,
and thankful without further enquiry.
To comply therefore in ſome meaſure
with the humour of theſe People, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch think fit to peruſe this Book, I
muſt tell 'em very freely, that I was ſo
far from aiming to oblige, or diſoblige
'em by it, that it was never intended
for their View. It was occaſion'd by a
private Converſation, between ſome
Gentlemen and Ladies, and written at
the requeſt, and for the Diverſion of
one Lady more particularly, by whom
with my conſent it was communicated
to two or three more of both Sexes,
my Friends likewiſe.</p>
            <p>By them I was with abundance of
Complements importun'd to make it
publick; now tho' I do with good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
attribute much more, of what was
ſaid to me upon this Occaſion, to their
good Breeding and Friendſhip, than to
their real Opinions of my Performance;
yet I have ſo much ſatisfaction in their
Sincerity, and Friendſhip as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
they would not ſuffer, much leſs
<pb facs="tcp:48164:7"/>
perſwade me to expoſe to the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, of which they doubted ſo far,
as to think it would not be tollerably
acceptable. Nor have I leſs aſſurance
of their Judgment and Skill in things
of this nature, beſide that I have been
inform'd by ſome of 'em, that it has
been ſeen, and favourably receiv'd by
ſome Gentlemen, whom the world thinks
no incompetent Judges. After all this
Encouragement, I ſuppoſe, I ſhall not
be thought vain, if, as I pretend not
to the applauſe, ſo I fear not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the world: Yet I preſume not
ſo far upon the Merits of what I have
written, as to make my Name pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
with it. I have elſewhere held,
that Vanity was almoſt the univerſal
mover of all our Actions, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of mine, as well as of others;
yet it is not ſtrong enough in me, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
me to bring my Name upon the
publick ſtage of the World.</p>
            <p>There are many Reaſons, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me to this cautious, reſerv'd way
of procedure; tho' I might otherwiſe
be very ambitious of appearing in the
deſence of my Sex, cou'd I perſwade
my ſelf, that I was able to write any
<pb facs="tcp:48164:8"/>
thing ſutable to the dignity of the
Subject, which I am not vain enough
to think. This indeed is one Reaſon,
becauſe I am ſenſible it might have
been much better defended by abler
Pens, ſuch as many among our own Sex
are; though I believe ſcarce thus much
wou'd have been expected from me, by
thoſe that know me. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
another Reaſon, which was yet
more prevalent with me, and with thoſe
few Friends whom I conſulted about
it, which is this; There are a ſort of
Men, that upon all occaſions think
themſelves more concern'd, and more
thought of than they are, and that,
like Men that are deaf, or have any
other notorious Defect, can ſee no body
whiſper, or laugh, but they think 'tis
at themſelves. Theſe Men are apt to
think, that every ridiculous deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they meet with, was intended
more particularly for ſome one or other
of them; as indeed it is hard to paint
any thing compleat in their ſeveral
Kinds, without hitting many of their
particular Features, even without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from them. The knowledge of this,
with the conſideration of the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:48164:8"/>
of Reputation in our Sex, (which
as our delicateſt Fruits and fineſt Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are moſt obnoxious to the injuries
of Weather, is ſubmitted to every infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
Blaſt of malicious Breath) made
me very cautious, how I expos'd mine
to ſuch poiſonous Vapours. I was not
ignorant, how liberal ſome Men are
of their Scandal, whenever provok'd,
eſpecially by a Woman; and how
ready the ſame Men are to be ſo,
tho upon never ſo miſtaken Grounds.
This made me reſolve to keep 'em in
Ignorance of my Name, and if they have
a mind to find me out, let 'em catch
me (if they can) as Children at Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Buff do one another, Hoodwinkt;
and I am of Opinion I have room enough
to put 'em out of Breath before they
come near me.</p>
            <p>The Event has in Effect prov'd my
ſuſpicio<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Prophetick; for there are (as
I am inform'd) already ſome, ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to intereſt themſelves againſt me,
that they take Characters upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
before they ſee 'em; and, for
fear they ſhould want ſome Body to
throw their Dirt at, with equal Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and Injuſtice Father this Piece
<pb facs="tcp:48164:9"/>
upon the Gentleman, who was ſo kind as
to take care of the Publication of it,
only to excuſe me from appearing. This
made me once reſolve to oppoſe my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
to their Clamour, and perfix
my Name, which I thought I was
bound to do in Juſtice to him. In this
Reſolution I had perſiſted, had not the
very ſame Gentleman generouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
and over-rul'd me to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
repreſenting how weak a defence
Innocence is againſt Calumny, how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the Ears of all the World are, and
how greedily they ſuck in any thing to
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he prejudice of a Woman; and that (to
uſe his own Expreſſion) the ſcandal of
ſuch Men, was like Dirt thrown by
Children, and Fools at random, and
without Provocation, it would dawb fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
at firſt, though it were eaſily waſht
off again: Adding, that he deſir'd me
not to be under any concern for him; for
he valued the Malice of ſuch men, as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
as their Friendſhip, the one was as
feeble, as tother falſe.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe I need make no Apology to
my own Sex for the meaneſs of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
the bare intention of ſerving
'em will (I hope be accepted, and of
<pb facs="tcp:48164:9"/>
Men, the Candid and Ingenuous I am
ſure will not quarrel with me for any
thing in this little Book; ſince there is
nothing in it, which was not drawn from
the ſtricteſt Reaſon I was Miſtreſs of,
and the beſt Obſervations I was able to
make, except a ſtart or two only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Salique Law, and the
<hi>Amazons,</hi> which, if they divert not
the Reader, can't offend him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble the Reader with
any account of the Method I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
he will eaſily diſcover that in
reading the Piece it ſelf. I ſhall only
take notice to him of one thing, which
with a little attention to what he reads
he will readily find to be true, that is,
that the Characters were not written
out of any Wanton Humour, or Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Deſign to characterize any Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſons, but to illuſtrate what I
have ſaid upon the ſeveral Heads, under
which they are rang'd, and repreſent not
ſingle Men, but ſo many Clans, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
of Men, that play the Fool ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
in the World. If any Individual
ſeem to be more peculiarly markt, it is
becauſe he is perhaps more notorious
to the World, by ſome one or more Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb facs="tcp:48164:10"/>
of the General Character here given
I am ſure that there is no Man, who is
but moderately Accquainted with the
World, eſpecially this Town, but may
find half a Dozen, or more Originals
for every Picture. After all, if any
Man have ſo little Wit, as to appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
any of theſe Characters to himſelf,
He takes a liberty I have hitherto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
given him, but ſhall do it now in
the Words of a Great Man, <hi>If any
Fool finds the Cap fit him, let him
put it on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome Men, (I hear) who
will not allow this Piece to be written
by a Woman; did I know what Eſtimate
to make of their Judgments, I might
perhaps have a higher Opinion of this
Triffle, than I ever yet had. For I
little thought while I was writing this,
that any Man (eſpecially an Ingenious
Man) ſhould have the ſcandal of being
the reputed Author. For he muſt
think it ſcandalous to be made to Father
a Womans Productions unlawfully.
But theſe Gentlemen, I ſuppoſe, believe
there is more Wit, than they'l find in
this Piece, upon the Credit of the
Bookſeller, whoſe Intereſt it is to flatter
<pb facs="tcp:48164:10"/>
it. But were it as well written as I
could wiſh it, or as the Subject wou'd
bear, and deſerves; I ſee no reaſon
why our Sex ſhou'd be robb'd of the
Honour of it; Since there have been
Women in all Ages, whoſe Writings
might vie with thoſe of the greateſt Men,
as the Preſent Age as well as paſt can
teſtifie. I ſhall not trouble the Reader
with their names, becauſe I wou'd not
be thought ſo vain, as to rank my ſelf
among 'em; and their names are already
too well known, and celebrated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any additional Luſtre from ſo
weak Encomiums as mine. I pretend
not to imitate, much leſs to Rival thoſe
Illuſtrious Ladies, who have done ſo
much Honour to their Sex, and are
unanſwerable Proofs of, what I contend
for. I only wiſh, that ſome Ladies now
living among us (whoſe names I forbear
to mention in regard to their Modeſty)
wou'd exert themſelves, and give us
more recent Inſtances, who are both by
Nature and Education ſufficiently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
to do it, which I pretend not to.
I freely own to the Reader, that I
know no other Tongue beſides my Native,
except <hi>French,</hi> in which I am but very
<pb facs="tcp:48164:11"/>
moderately skill'd. I plead not this
to excuſe the meaneſs of my Performance;
becauſe I know, I may reaſonably be
ask'd, why I was ſo forward to write;
For that I have already given my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
above, if they will not ſatisfie the
Reader, he muſt endeavour to pleaſe
himſelf with better, for I am very little
ſolicitous about the matter. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
add, that for my Good Will I hope
the Favour of my own Sex, which will
ſatisfie my Ambition.</p>

ESSAY
In Defence of the
Female Sex, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Converſation we had
'tother day, makes me, Dear
<hi>Madam,</hi> but more ſenſible
of the unreaſonableneſs of
your deſire; which obliges me to
inform you further upon a Subject,
wherein I have more need of your
inſtruction. The ſtrength of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſprightly Fancy, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Addreſs, you ſhew'd upon that
Occaſion, ſpeak you ſo perfect a
Miſtreſs of that Argument (as I
doubt not but you are of any other
that you pleaſe to engage in) that
whoever, would ſpeak or write
well on it, ought firſt to be your
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48164:14"/>
Schollar. Yet to let you ſee how
abſolutely you may command me,
I had rather be your <hi>Eccho,</hi> than
be ſilent when You bid me ſpeak,
and beg your excuſe rather for my
Failures, than want of Complacence.
I know You will not accuſe me for
a Plagiary if I return You nothing,
but what I have glean'd from You,
when You conſider, that I pretend
not to make a Preſent, but to pay
the Intereſt only of a Debt. Nor
can You tax me with Vanity, ſince
no Importunity of a Perſon leſs
lov'd, or valu'd by me than your
ſelf could have extorted thus much
from me. This Conſideration leaves
me no room to doubt but that you
will with your uſual Candour par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
thoſe Defects, and correct thoſe
Errors, which proceed only from
an over forward Zeal to oblige
You, though to my own Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>The defence of our Sex againſt ſo
many and ſo great Wits as have ſo
ſtrongly at ack'd it, may juſtly
ſeem a Task too difficult for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48164:14"/>
man to attempt. Not that I can,
or ought to yield, that we are by
Nature leſs enabled for ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpize,
than Men are; which I
hope at leaſt to ſhew plauſible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for, before I have done: But
becauſe through the Uſurpation of
Men, and the Tyranny of Cuſtom
(here in <hi>England</hi> eſpecially) there
are at moſt but few, who are by
Education, and acquir'd Wit, or
Letters ſufficiently quallified for
ſuch an Undertaking. For my own
part I ſhall readily own, that as
few as there are, there may be
and are abundance, who in their
daily Converſations approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
much more able, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Aſſertors of our Cauſe, than
my ſelf; and I am ſorry that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Buſineſs, their other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,
or too great Indulgence of
their Eaſe, hinder them from doing
publick Juſtice to their Sex. The
Men by Intereſt or Inclination are
ſo generally engag'd againſt us,
that it is not to be expected, that
any one Man of Wit ſhould ariſe ſo
generous as to engage in our Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48164:15"/>
and be the Champion of our
Sex againſt the Injuries and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of his own. Thoſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
days are over, and there
is not ſo much as a <hi>Don Quixot</hi> of
the Quill left to ſuccour the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Damſels. 'Tis true, a Feint
of ſomething of this Nature was
made three or four Years ſince by
one; but how much ſoever his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia
may be oblig'd to him, I am
of Opinion the reſt of her Sex are
but little beholding to him. For as
you rightly obſerv'd, <hi>Madam,</hi> he
has taken more care to give an
Edge to his Satyr, than force to
his Apology; he has play'd a ſham
Prize, and receives more thruſts
than he makes; and like a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negade
fights under our Colours
only for a fairer Opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
us. But what could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
elſe from a Beau? An Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
that can no more commend in
earneſt a Womans Wit, than a
Man's Perſon, and that compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ours, only to ſhew his own
good Breeding and Parts. He le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
his Scandal at the whole Sex,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48164:15"/>
and thinks us ſufficiently fortified,
if out of the Story of Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Years he has been able to
pick up a few Examples of Women
illuſtrious for their Wit, Learning

would have ſpar'd him that labour,
by granting that all Ages have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
Perſons famous or infamous
of both Sexes; or they muſt throw
up all pretence to Modeſty, or

            <p>I have neither Learning, nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to make a Precedent, or
indeed any uſe of Mr. W's. labour'd
Common Place Book; and ſhall
leave Pedants and School-Boys to
rake and tumble the Rubbiſh of

I ſhall not enter into any diſpute,<note place="margin">Some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be allow'd to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of Education.</note>
whether Men, or Women be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
more ingenious, or learned;
that Point muſt be given up to the
advantages Men have over us by
their Education, Freedom of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
and variety of Buſineſs and
Company. But when any Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
is made between 'em, great
allowances muſt be made for the
diſparity of thoſe Circumſtances.
Neither ſhall I conteſt about the
preheminence of our Virtues; I
know there are too many Vicious,
and I hope there are a great many
Virtuous of both Sexes. Yet this
I may ſay, that whatever Vices are
found amongſt us, have in general
both their ſource, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from them.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion I ſhall at preſent
handle is, whether the time an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Gentleman ſpends in the
Company of Women, may juſtly
be ſaid to be miſemploy'd, or not?
I put the queſtion in general terms;
becauſe whoever holds the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
muſt maintain it ſo, or the Sex
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48164:16"/>
is no way concern'd to oppoſe him.
On the other ſide I ſhall not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Negative, but with ſome
Reſtrictions and Limitations; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I will not be bound to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thoſe Women, whoſe Vices and
ill Conduct expoſe them deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Cenſure of the other Sex,
as well as of their own. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
being thus ſtated, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the end and purpoſes, for which
Converſation was at firſt inſtituted,
and is yet deſirable; and then we
ſhall ſee, whether they may not all
be found in the Company of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Theſe Ends, I take it, are
the ſame with thoſe we aim at in
all our other Actions, in general
only two, Profit or Pleaſure. Theſe
are divided into thoſe of the Mind,
and thoſe of the Body. Of the
latter I ſhall take no further No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
as having no Relation to the
preſent Subject; but ſhall confine
my ſelf wholly to the Mind, the
Profit of which is the Improvement
of the Underſtanding, and the
Pleaſure is the Diverſion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion
of its Cares and Paſſions.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48164:17"/>
Now if either of theſe Ends be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
by the Society of Women,
I have gain'd my Point. However,
I hope to make it appear, that they
are not only both to be met with in
the Converſation of Women, but
one of them more generally, and in
greater meaſure than in Mens.</p>
            <p>Our Company is generally by
our Adverſaries repreſented as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
and irkſome to Men of
Senſe, and by ſome of the more
vehement Sticklers againſt us, as
Criminal. Theſe Imputations as
they are unjuſt, eſpecially the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſo they ſavour ſtrongly of the
Malice, Arrogance and Sottiſhneſs
of thoſe, that moſt frequently urge
'em; who are commonly either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
Fops, whoſe ſucceſs in their
Pretences to the favour of our Sex
has been no greater than their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and fallen very far ſhort of their
Vanity and Preſumption, or a ſort
of moroſe, ill-bred, unthinking
Fellows, who appear to be Men
only by their Habit and Beards,
and are ſcarce diſtinguiſhable from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48164:17"/>
Brutes but by their Figure and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility.
But I ſhall wave theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
at preſent, however juſt,
and come cloſer to our Argument.
If Women are not quallified for the
Converſation of ingenious Men, or,
to go yet further, their friendſhip,
it muſt be becauſe they want ſome
one condition, or more, neceſſarily
requiſite to either. The neceſſary
Conditions of theſe are Senſe, and
good nature, to which muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for Friendſhip, Fidelity and
Integrity. Now if any of theſe
be wanting to our Sex, it muſt be
either becauſe Nature has not been
ſo liberal as to beſtow 'em upon
us; or becauſe due care has not been
taken to cultivate thoſe Gifts to a
competent meaſure in us.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Cauſes is that,
which is moſt generally urg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, whether it be in Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or Spight. I might eaſily cut
this part of the Controverſy ſhort
by an irrefragable Argument, which
is, that the expreſs intent, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for which Woman was created,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48164:18"/>
was to be a Companion, and help
meet to Man; and that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe, that deny 'em to be ſo,
muſt argue a Miſtake in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and think themſelves wiſer
than their Creator. But theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
are generally ſuch paſſionate
Admirers of themſelves, and have
ſuch a profound value and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for their own Parts, that they
are ready at any time to ſacrifice
their Religion to the Reputation of
their Wit, and rather than loſe
their point, deny the truth of the
Hiſtory. There are others, that
though they allow the Story yet
affirm, that the propagation, and
continuance of Mankind, was the
only Reaſon for which we were
made; as if the Wisdom that firſt
made Man, cou'd not without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
have continu'd that Species by
the ſame or any other Method, had
not this been moſt conducive to his
happineſs, which was the gracious
and only end of his Creation. But
theſe ſuperficial Gentlemen wear
their Underſtandings like their
Clothes, always ſet and formal,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48164:18"/>
and wou'd no more Talk than
Dreſs out of Faſhion; Beau's that,
rather than any part of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Figure ſhou'd be damag'd,
wou'd wipe the dirt of their ſhoes
with their Handkercher, and that
value themſelves infinitely more
upon modiſh Nonſenſe, than upon
the beſt Senſe againſt the Faſhion.
But ſince I do not intend to make
this a religious Argument, I ſhall
leave all further Conſiderations of
this Nature to the Divines, whoſe
more immediate Buſineſs and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it is to aſſert the Wiſdom of
Providence in the Order, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of this World, againſt all that
ſhall oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore if we be
naturally defective,<note place="margin">No distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in Souls.</note> the Defect muſt
be either in Soul or Body. In the
Soul it can't be, if what I have
hear'd ſome learned Men maintain,
be true, that all Souls are equal,
and alike, and that conſequently
there is no ſuch diſtinction, as Male
and Female Souls; that there are
no innate <hi>Idea's,</hi> but that all the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48164:19"/>
Notions we have, are deriv'd from
our External Senſes, either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
or by Reflection. Theſe
Metaphyſical Speculations, I muſt
own Madam, require much more
Learning and a ſtronger Head, than
I can pretend to be Miſtreſs of, to
be conſider'd as they ought: Yet
ſo bold I may be, as to undertake
the defence of theſe Opinions, when
any of our jingling Opponents think
fit to refute 'em.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be in the Body,<note place="margin">No advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the Organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Bodies.</note>
(if I may credit the Report of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Phyſicians) for there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the Organization of thoſe
Parts, which have any relation to,
or influence over the Minds; but
the Brain, and all other Parts (which
I am not Anatomiſt enough to
name) are contriv'd as well for the
plentiful conveyance of Spirits,
which are held to be the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Inſtruments of Senſation, in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as Men. I ſee therefore no
natural Impediment in the ſtructure
of our Bodies; nor does Experience,
or Obſervation argue any: We uſe all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48164:19"/>
our Natural Faculties, as well as
Men, nay and our Rational too, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
only for the advantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mention'd.</p>
            <p>Let us appeal yet further to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,<note place="margin">Confirm'd from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Brutes.</note>
and obſerve thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that deviate leaſt from ſimple
Nature, and ſee if we can find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
difference in Senſe, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
between Males and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males.
In theſe we may ſee Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
plaineſt, who lie under no
conſtraint of Cuſtom or Laws,
but thoſe of Paſſion or Appetite,
which are Natures, and know no
difference of Education, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Byaſs by prejudice. We
ſee great diſtance in Degrees of
Underſtanding, Wit, Cunning and
Docility (call them what you
pleaſe) between the ſeveral Species
of Brutes. An Ape, a Dog, a
Fox, are by daily Obſervation
found to be more Docile, and
more Subtle than an Ox, a Swine,
or a Sheep. But a She Ape is as
full of, and as ready at Imitation as
a He: a Bitch will learn as many
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48164:20"/>
Tricks in as ſhort a time as a Dog,
a Female Fox has as many Wiles
as a Male. A thouſand inſtances of
this kind might be produc'd; but I
think theſe are ſo plain, that to
inſtance more were a ſuperfluous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
I ſhall only once more take
notice, that in Brutes and other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Male and Female in point of
Sagacity, notwithſtanding there is
the ſame diſtinction of Sexes, that
is between Men and Women. I
have read, that ſome Philoſophers
have held Brutes to be no more
than meer Machines, a ſort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Clock-work, that Act only by
the force of nice unſeen Springs
without Senſation, and cry out
without feeling Pain, Eat without
Hunger, Drink without Thirſt,
fawn upon their Keepers without
ſeeing 'em, hunt Hares without
Smelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here Madam is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for our Antagoniſts againſt the
laſt Argument ſo thick, that there
is no beating 'em out. For my
part, I ſhall not envy 'em their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
let 'em lie like the wild <hi>Iriſh</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48164:20"/>
ſecure within their Boggs; the field
is at leaſt ours, ſo long as they
keep to their Faſtneſſes. But to
quit this Topick, I ſhall only add,
that if the learnedeſt He of 'em all
can convince me of the truth of
this Opinion, He will very much
ſtagger my Faith; for hitherto I
have been able to obſerve no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between our Knowledge
and theirs, but a gradual one; and
depend upon Revelation alone,
that our Souls are Immortal, and
theirs not.</p>
            <p>But if an Argument from Brutes
and other Animals ſhall not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
as concluſive,<note place="margin">Experience of Mankind.</note> (though I can't
ſee, why ſuch an Inference ſhould
not be valid, ſince the parity of
Reaſon is the ſame on both ſides
in this Caſe.) I ſhall deſire thoſe,
that hold againſt us to obſerve
the Country People, I mean the
inferiour ſort of them, ſuch as not
having Stocks to follow Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
upon their own Score, ſubſiſt
upon their daily Labour. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
theſe, though not ſo equal
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48164:21"/>
as that of Brutes, yet the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the two Sexes is more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
than amongſt Gentlemen, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Traders, or rich Yeomen. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
them in their ſeveral Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and their Capacities will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
equal; but talk to them of
things indifferent, and out of the
Road of their conſtant Employment,
and the Ballance will fall on our
ſide, the Women will be found the
more ready and polite. Let us
look a little further, and view our
Sex in a ſtate of more improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
amongſt our Neighbours the
<hi>Dutch.</hi> There we ſhall find them
managing not only the Domeſtick
Affairs of the Family, but making,
and receiving all Payments as well
great as ſmall, keeping the Books,
ballancing the Accounts, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Buſineſs, even the niceſt
of Merchants, with as much Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Exactneſs as their, or our
Men can do. And I have often
hear'd ſome of our conſiderable
Merchants blame the conduct of our
Country-Men in this point; that
they breed our Women ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48164:21"/>
of Buſineſs; whereas were
they taught Arithmetick, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arts which require not much
bodily ſtrength, they might ſupply
the places of abundance of luſty
Men now employ'd in ſedentary
Buſineſs; which would be a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
profit to the Nation by ſending
thoſe Men to Employments, where
hands and Strength are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
eſpecially at this time when
we are in ſuch want of People.
Beſide that it might prevent the
ruine of many Families, which is
often occaſion'd by the Death of
Merchants in full Buſineſs, and
leaving their Accounts perplex'd,
and embroil'd to a Widdow and
Orphans, who underſtanding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Husband or Father's
Buſineſs occaſions the Rending, and
oftentimes the utter Confounding a
fair Eſtate; which might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
did the Wife but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Merchants Accounts, and
were made acquainted with the
Books.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48164:22"/>
I have yet another Argument
from Nature, which is, that the
very Make and Temper of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſhew that we were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for Fatigue; and the Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of our Wits, and Readineſs of
our Invention (which are confeſs'd
even by our Adverſaries) demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
that we were chiefly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Thought and the Exerciſe of
the Mind. Whereas on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it is apparent from the ſtrength
and ſize of their Limbs, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and Hardineſs of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
that Men were purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fram'd and contriv'd for Action,
and Labour. And herein the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Contrivance of Providence
is abundantly manifeſted; for as
the one Sex is fortified with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Ability to undergo the
neceſſary Drudgery of providing
Materials for the ſuſtenance of
Life in both; ſo the other is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with Ingenuity and Prudence
for the orderly management and
diſtribution of it, for the Relief and
Comfort of a Family; and is over
and above enrich'd with a peculiar
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48164:22"/>
Tenderneſs and Care requiſite to
the Cheriſhing their poor helpleſs
Off-ſpring. I know our Oppoſers
uſually miſcall our quickneſs of
Thought, Fancy and Flaſh, and
chriſten their own heavineſs by the
ſpecious Names of Judgment and
Solidity; but it is eaſie to retort
upon 'em the reproachful Ones of
Dullneſs and Stupidity with more
Juſtice. I ſhall purſue this Point
no further, but continue firm in my
Perſuaſion, that Nature has not
been ſo Niggardly to us, as our
Adverſaries would inſinuate, till I
ſee better cauſe to the contrary,
then I have hitherto at any time
done. Yet I am ready to yield
to Conviction, whoever offers
it; which I don't ſuddenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>It remains then for us to enquire,
whether the Bounty of Nature be
wholly neglected, or ſtifled by us,
or ſo far as to make us unworthy
the Company of Men? Or whether
our Education (as bad as it is)
be not ſufficient to make us a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48164:23"/>
nay a neceſſary part of Society
for the greateſt part of Mankind.
This cauſe is ſeldom indeed urg'd
againſt us by the Men, though it
be the only one, that gives 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
advantage over us in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
But it does not ſerve
their Pride, there is no Honour to
be gain'd by it: For a Man ought
no more to value himſelf upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wiſer than a Woman, if he
owe his Advantage to a better E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
and greater means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
then he ought to boaſt
of his Courage, for beating a Man,
when his Hands were bound. Nay
it would be ſo far from Honourable
to contend for preference upon this
Score, that they would thereby at
once argue themſelves guilty both
of Tyranny, and of Fear: I think
I need not have mention'd the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note>
for none can be Tyrants but
Cowards. For nothing makes one
Party ſlaviſhly depreſs another, but
their fear that they may at one
time or other become Strong or
Couragious enough to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
equal to, if not ſuperiour to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48164:23"/>
their Maſters. This is our Caſe;
for Men being ſenſible as well of
the Abilities of Mind in our Sex,
as of the ſtrength of Body in their
own, began to grow Jealous, that
we, who in the Infancy of the
World were their Equals and Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in Dominion, might in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Time, by Subtlety and Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem,
become their Superiours;
and therefore began in good time
to make uſe of Force (the Origine
of Power) to compell us to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
Nature never meant; and
made uſe of Natures liberality to
them to take the benefit of her
kindneſs from us. From that time
they have endeavour'd to train us
up altogether to Eaſe and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
as Conquerors uſe to do to
thoſe, they reduce by Force, that
ſo they may diſarm 'em, both of
Courage and Wit; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make them tamely give up their
Liberty, and abjectly ſubmit their
Necks to a ſlaviſh Yoke. As the
World grew more Populous, and
Mens Neceſſities whetted their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
ſo it increas'd their Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48164:24"/>
and ſharpen'd their Tyranny
over us, till by degrees, it came to
that height of Severity, I may ſay
Cruelty, it is now at in all the
Eaſtern parts of the World, where
the Women, like our Negroes in
our Weſtern Plantations, are born
ſlaves, and live Priſoners all their
Lives. Nay, ſo far has this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Humour prevail'd, and ſpread
it ſelf, that in ſome parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>
which pretend to be moſt refin'd
and civiliz'd, in ſpite of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Zeal for Religion which
they ſo much affect, our Condition is
not very much better. And even
in <hi>France,</hi> a Country that treats our
Sex with more Reſpect than moſt
do,<note place="margin">Original of the Salique Law.</note> We are by the <hi>Salique Law</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from Soveraign Power. The
<hi>French</hi> are an ingenious People, and
the Contrivers of that Law knew
well enough, that We were no leſs
capable of Reigning, and Governing
well, than themſelves; but they
were ſuſpicious, that if the Regal
Power ſhou'd fall often into the
hands of Women, they would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
their own Sex, and might in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48164:24"/>
time reſtore 'em to their Primitive
Liberty and Equality with the Men,
and ſo break the neck of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
Authority they ſo much
affect over us; and therefore made
this Law to prevent it. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
indeed tell us other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but they can't agree among
themſelves, and as Men are Parties
againſt us, and therefore their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may juſtly be rejected. To
ſay the truth Madam, I can't tell
how to prove all this from Ancient
Records; for if any Hiſtories were
anciently written by Women, Time,
and the Malice of Men have effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
conſpir'd to ſuppreſs 'em;
and it is not reaſonable to think
that Men ſhou'd tranſmit, or ſuffer
to be tranſmitted to Poſterity, any
thing that might ſhew the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and illegallity of their Title to
a Power they ſtill exerciſe ſo arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
and are ſo fond of. But
ſince daily Experience ſhews, and
their own Hiſtories tell us, how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
they endeavour, and what
they act, and ſuffer to put the ſame
Trick upon one another, 'tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48164:25"/>
to ſuppoſe they took the ſame
meaſures with us at firſt, which
now they have effected, like the
Rebels in our laſt Civil Wars, when
they had brought the Royal Party
under, they fall together by the
Ears about the Dividend.<note place="margin">Amazons; why they rejected the Society of Men.</note> The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Hiſtory takes no notice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch Authority they had before
the Flood, and their Own confeſs
that whole Nations have rejected it
ſince, and not ſuffer'd a Man to live
amongſt them, which cou'd be for
no other Reaſon, than their Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
For upon leſs provocation the
Women wou'd never have been ſo
fooliſh, as to deprive themſelves of
the benefit of that Eaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which a good agreement with
their Men might have afforded 'em.
'Tis true the ſame Hiſtories tell us,
that there were whole Countries
where were none but Men, which
border'd upon 'em. But this makes
ſtill for us; for it ſhews that the
Conditions of their Society were
not ſo eaſie, as to engage their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to ſtay amongſt 'em; but as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
preſented it ſelf, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48164:25"/>
and retired to the <hi>Amazons:</hi>
But ſince our Sex can hardly boaſt

I cut this ungrateful Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſhort in acknowledgment; tho'

            <p>You will excuſe, I know Madam,
this ſhort, but neceſſary Digreſſion.
I call it neceſſary, becauſe it ſhews
a probable Reaſon, why We are at
this time in ſuch ſubjection to them,
without leſſening the Opinion of
our Senſe, or Natural Capacities ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at preſent, or for the time
paſt; beſide that it briefly lays o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
without any Scandal to our
Sex, why our Improvements are at
preſent ſo diſproportion'd to thoſe
of Men. I wou'd not have any of
our little, unthinking Adverſaries
triumph at my allowing a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between the Improvements
of our Sex and theirs; and I am
ſure thoſe of 'em that are ingenious
Men, will ſee no reaſon for it from
what I have ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48164:26"/>
After having granted ſo great a
diſparity as I have already done in
the cuſtomary Education, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
Liberties of the Sexes,
'twere Nonſenſe to maintain, that
our Society is generally and upon
all accounts as Beneficial, Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and Entertaining, as that of
Men. He muſt be a very ſhallow
Fellow, that reſorts to, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
us in hopes by our means
to make himſelf conſiderable as a
Schollar, a Mathematician, a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
or a States-man. Theſe
Arts and Sciences are the reſult on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of much Study and great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
and without one at leaſt of
'em are no more to be acquir'd by
the Company of Men, however
celebrated for any or all of them,
than by ours. But there are other
Quallifications, which are as indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably
neceſſary to a Gentleman,
or any Man that wou'd appear to
Advantage in the World, which
are attainable only by Company,
and Converſation, and chiefly by
ours. Nor can the greateſt part of
Mankind, of what Quallity ſoever,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48164:26"/>
boaſt much of the uſe they make,
or the benefit they reap from theſe
acknowledg'd Advantages. So that
Schollars only, and ſome few of
the more thinking Gentlemen, and
Men of Buſineſs have any juſt
claim to 'em. And of theſe the
firſt generally fall ſhort enough
ſome other way to make the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
even.<note place="margin">Character of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</note> For Schollars, though
by their acquaintance with Books,
and converſing much with Old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
they may know perfectly
the Senſe of the Learned Dead,
and be perfect Maſters of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
be throughly inform'd of the
State, and nicely skill'd in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies
of Ages long ſince paſt, yet
by their retir'd and unactive Life,
their neglect of Buſineſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Converſation with Antiquity,
they are ſuch Strangers to, and
ſo ignorant of the Domeſtick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
and manners of their own
Country and Times, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
like the Ghoſts of Old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
rais'd by Magick. Talk to
them of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or <hi>Perſſian</hi>
Monarchies, the <hi>Grecians</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48164:27"/>
Common-wealths. They anſwer like
Oracles, they are ſuch finiſh'd State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that we ſhou'd ſcarce take
'em to have been leſs than Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents
of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> Tutours to
<hi>Cyrus</hi> the great, old Cronies of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours
at leaſt to the Twelve <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi>
ſucceſſively; but engage them in
a Diſcourſe that concerns the preſent
Times, and their Native Country,
and they heardly ſpeak the Language
of it, and know ſo little of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of it, that as much might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
be expected from an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Mummy. They
are very much diſturbed to ſee a
Fold or a Plait amiſs in the Picture
of an Old <hi>Roman</hi> Gown, yet take
no notice that their own are thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare
out at the Elbows, or Rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and ſuffer more if <hi>Priſcian's</hi>
Head be broken then if it were
their own. They are excellent
Guides, and can direct you to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Ally, and turning in old <hi>Rome;</hi>
yet loſe their way at home in their
own Pariſh. They are mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers
of the Wit and Eloquence of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48164:27"/>
the Ancients; yet had they liv'd
in the time of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Coeſar</hi>
wou'd have treated them with as
much ſupercilious Pride, and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
as they do now with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
They are great hunters of
ancient Manuſcripts, and have in
great Veneration any thing, that
has ſcap'd the Teeth of Time and
Rats, and if Age have obliterated
the Characters, 'tis the more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for not being legible. But if
by chance they can pick out one
Word, they rate it higher then the
whole Author in Print, and wou'd
give more for one Proverb of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
under his own Hand, then
for all his Wiſdom. Theſe Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,
bigotted Idolaters of time
paſt, are Children in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all their lives; for they
hang ſo inceſſantly upon the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Strings of Authority, that their
Judgments like the Limbs of ſome

But as theſe Men, will hardly be
reckon'd much ſuperiour to us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of their Learning or
Improvements, ſo neither will I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
another ſort diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to theſe in their Humors and
Opinions:<note place="margin">Character of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Squire.</note> I mean thoſe whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
have been wiſe and provident,
and rais'd Eſtates by their Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Induſtry, and given all their
Poſterity after 'em Means, and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to be Fools. Theſe are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſent to School in their Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and were they kept there till
they came to Years of Diſcretion,
might moſt of 'em ſtay, till they
cou'd tuck their Beards into their
Girdles before they left carrying a
Satchel. In conformity to Cuſtom,
and the Faſhion, they are ſent ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſerve an Apprenticeſhip to
Letters, and for eight or nine years
are whipt up and down through
two or three Counties from School
to School; when being arriv'd a Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
or Seventeen Years of Age,
and having made the uſual <hi>Tour</hi>
of Latin, and Greek Authors, they
are call'd Home to be made Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48164:28"/>
As ſoon as the young Squire
has got out of the Houſe of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
ſhaken off the awe of Birch,
and begins to feel himſelf at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he conſiders that he is now
Learned enough, (and 'tis ten to
one but his Friends are wiſe enough
to be of his Opinion) and thinks
it high time to ſhake off the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Acquaintance he contracted,
with thoſe crabbed, vexatious, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
Fellows, that gave him ſo
much trouble and ſmart at School,
Companions by no means fit for a
Gentleman, that writ only to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and perplex poor Boys, and
exerciſe the tyranny of Pedants and
School-maſters. Theſe prudent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
taken, his Converſation
for ſome years ſucceeding is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken up by his Horſes, Dogs
and Hawks (eſpecially if his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
be in the Country) and the
more ſenſleſs Animals that tend 'em.
His Groom, his Huntſman, and his
Falconer are his Tutors, and his
walk is from the Stable to the
Dog-kennel, and the reverſe of it. His
diverſion is drudgery, and he is in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48164:29"/>
higheſt ſatisfaction when he is moſt
tir'd. He wearies you in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his Sport, in the Afternoon
with the noiſie Repetion and Drink,
and the whole Day with Fatigue
and Confuſion. His Entertainment
is ſtale Beer, and the Hiſtory of
his Dogs and Horſes, in which he
gives you the Pedigree of every one
with all the exactneſs of a Herald;
and if you be very much in his
good Graces, 'tis odds, but he makes
you the Compliment of a Puppy of
one of his favourite Bitches, which
you muſt take with abundance of
Acknowledgments of his Civillity,
or elſe he takes you for a ſtupid,
as well as an ill bred Fellow. He
is very conſtant at all Clubs and
Meetings of the Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
where he will ſuffer nothing
to be talk'd or hear'd of but his
Jades, his Curs, and his Kites. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe he rings perpetual Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and treſpaſſes as much upon
the patience of the Company in the
Tavern, as upon their Encloſures
in the Field, and is leaſt imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
when moſt drunk.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48164:29"/>
His grand Buſineſs is to make
an Aſſignation for a Horſe Race;
or a Hunting Match, and nothing
diſcompoſes him ſo much as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.
Thus accompliſh'd,
and finiſh'd for a Gentleman, he
enters the Civil Liſts, and holds
the Scale of Juſtice with as much
Blindneſs as ſhe is ſaid to do. From
hence forward his Worſhip becomes
as formidable to the Ale-Houſes,
as he was before Familiar; he ſizes
an Ale Pot, and takes the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Bread with great Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Sagacity. He is the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of all the Deer, and Poultry
Stealers in the Neighbourhood,
and is ſo implacable a Perſecutor
of Poachers, that he keeps a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
of all the Dogs and Guns in
the Hundred, and is the Scare-Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
of the Pariſh. Short Pots, and
unjuſtifiable Dogs and Nets, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him with ſufficient matter for
Preſentments, to carry him once a
Quarter to the Seſſions; where he
ſays little, Eats and Drinks much,
and after Dinner, Hunts over the
laſt Chace, and ſo rides Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48164:30"/>
Drunk home again. At home
he Exerciſes his Authority in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Letters, Pattents to Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
for erecting Shovel Board,
Tables and Ginger Bread Stalls.
If he happen to live near any little
Borough or Corporation that ſends
Burgeſſes to Parliament, he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ambitious and ſue for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of being made their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative.
Henceforward he grows
Popular, bows to, and treats
the Mob all round him; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any in his Diſcourſe
or not, there is good Senſe in his
Kitchin and his Cellar, which is
more agreeable and edifying. If
he be ſo happy as to out-tap his
Competitour, and Drink his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
into an Opinion of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
he is choſen, and up he
comes to that Honourable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
where he ſhews his Wiſdom
beſt by his Silence, and ſerves his
Country moſt in his abſence.</p>
            <p>I give you theſe two Characters,
<hi>Madam,</hi> as irreconcileable as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Oyl, to ſhew that Men
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48164:30"/>
may and do often Baffle and Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the Effects of a liberal Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as well by Induſtry as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence.
'Tis hard to ſay, which
of theſe two is the more Sottiſh;
the firſt is ſuch an Admirer of Le<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that he thinks it a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Learning to talk what
other Men underſtand, and will
ſcarce believe that two, and two,
make four, under a Demonſtration
from <hi>Euclid,</hi> or a Quotation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle:</hi>
The latter has ſuch a fear
of Pedantry always before his Eyes,
that he thinks it a Scandal to his
good Breeding, and Gentility to
talk Senſe, or write true <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
and has ſuch a contemptible Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his paſt Education, that he
thinks the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets good for
nothing but to teach Boys to cap
Verſes. For my Part I think the
Learned, and Unlearned Blockhead
pretty equal; for 'tis all one to
me, whether a Man talk Nonſenſe,
or Unintelligible Senſe, I am diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and edified alike by either;
the one enjoys himſelf leſs, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
his Friends to do it more; the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48164:31"/>
other enjoys himſelf and his own
Humour enough, but will let no
body elſe do it in his Company.
Thus, <hi>Madam,</hi> I have ſet them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
You, and ſhall leave you to
determine a Point, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</p>
            <p>There are others that deſerve to
be brought into the Company of
theſe upon like Honourable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;<note place="margin">The Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the F<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m the Sex not ſo defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as commonly thought.</note>
but I keep them in reſerve
for a proper place, where I may
perhaps take the Pains to draw
their Pictures to the Life at full
length. Let us now return to our
Argument, from which we have
had a long breathing while. Let
us look into the manner of our
Education, and ſee wherein it falls
ſhort of the Mens, and how the
defects of it may be, and are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſupply'd. In our tender years
they are the ſame, for after Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
can Talk, they are promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
taught to Read and Write by
the ſame Perſons, and at the ſame
time both Boys and Girls. When
theſe are acquir'd, which is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48164:31"/>
about the Age of Six or Seven
Years, they begin to be ſeparated,
and the Boys are ſent to the <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
School,</hi> and the Girls to <hi>Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Schools,</hi> or other places, to learn
Needle Work, Dancing, Singing,
Muſick, Drawing, Painting, and
other Accompliſhments, according
to the Humour and Ability of the
Parents, or Inclination of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Of all theſe, Reading and
Writing are the main Inſtruments
of Converſation; though Muſick
and Painting may be allow'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
ſomething towards it, as
they give us an inſight into two
Arts, that makes up a great Part
of the Pleaſures and Diverſions of
Mankind. Here then lies the main
Defect, that we are taught only
our Mother Tongue, or perhaps
<hi>French,</hi> which is now very faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and almoſt as Familiar amongſt
Women of Quality as Men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the other Sex by means of a
more extenſive Education to the
knowledge of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi>
Languages, have a vaſter Feild for
their Imaginations to rove in, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48164:32"/>
their Capacities thereby enlarg'd.
To ſee whether this be ſtrictly true
or not. I mean in what relates to
our debate, I will for once ſuppoſe,
that we are inſtructed only in our
own Tongue, and then enquire
whether the diſadvantage be ſo
great as it is commonly imagin'd.
You know very well, <hi>Madam,</hi> that
for Converſation, it is not requiſite
we ſhould be Philologers, Rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Philoſophers, Hiſtorians or
Poets; but only that we ſhould
think pertinently and expreſs our
thoughts properly, on ſuch matters
as are the proper Subjects for a
mixt Converſation. The <hi>Italians,</hi>
a People as delicate in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
as any in the World,
have a Maxim that our ſelves, our
Neighbours, Religion, or Buſineſs
ought never to be the Subject.
There are very ſubſtantial Reaſons,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>
to be given for theſe Reſtrictions
for Men are very apt to be vain,
and impertinent, when they talk of
themſelves, beſides that others are
very jealous, and apt to ſuſpect,
that all the good things ſaid, are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48164:32"/>
intended as ſo many arguments of
preference to them. When they
ſpeak of their Neighbours, they are
apt out of a Principle of Emulation
and Envy, natural to all the race of
<hi>Adam</hi> to leſſen, and tarniſh their
Fame, whether by open Scandal,
and Defamatory Stories, and Tales,
or by malicious Inſinuations, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Circumſtances, ſiniſter and
covert Reflections. This humour
ſprings from an over fondneſs of
our ſelves, and a miſtaken conceit
that anothers loſs is an addition to
our own Reputation, as if like two
Buckets, one muſt neceſſarily riſe
as the other goes down. This is
the baſeſt and moſt ungenerous of
all our natural Failures, and ought
to be corrected as much as poſſible
e'ry where; but more eſpecially in
<hi>Italy,</hi> where Reſentments are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſo high, and Revenges proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
with ſo much Heat, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſity.
Religion is likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tender there, as in all other
places, where the Prieſts have ſo
much Power and Authority. But
even here, where our differences
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48164:33"/>
and Diſputes have made it more
tame, and us'd it to rough hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
it ought carefully to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
for nothing raiſes unfriendly
warmths among Company more than
a religious Argument, which therefore
ought to be baniſht all Society inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only for Converſation and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Buſineſs is too dry and barren
to give any Spirit to Converſation, or
Pleaſure to a Company, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rather to be reckon'd among
the Encumbrances than Comforts of
Life, however neceſſary. Beſides
theſe, Points of Learning, abſtruſe
Speculations, and nice Politicks,
ought, in my opinion, to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
becauſe being things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
much Reading and Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they are not fit to be canvas'd
<hi>ex tempore</hi> in mixt Company, of
which 'tis probable the greateſt part
will have little to ſay to 'em, and
will ſcarce be content to be ſilent
Hearers only; beſides that they are
not in their nature gay enough to
awaken the good Humour, or raiſe
the Mirth of the Company. Nor
need any one to fear, that by theſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48164:33"/>
limitations Converſation ſhou'd be
reſtrain'd to too narrow a compaſs,
there are ſubjects enough that are
in themſelves neither inſipid, nor
offenſive; ſuch as Love, Honour,
Gallantry, Morality, News, Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and a numberleſs train of other
Things copious and diverting. Now
I can't ſee the neceſſity of any other
Tongue beſide our own to enable
us to talk plauſibly, or judiciouſly
upon any of theſe Topicks: Nay, I
am very confident that 'tis poſſible
for an ingenious Perſon to make a
very conſiderable progreſs in moſt
parts of Learning, by the help of
Engliſh only.<note place="margin">Great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements to be made by the help of Engliſh Books only.</note> For the only reaſon
I can conceive of learning Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
is to arrive at the Senſe, Wit
or Arts, that have been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the World in 'em. Now
of thoſe that have taken the pains
to make themſelves Maſters of thoſe
Treaſures, many have been ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
as to impart a ſhare of 'em
to the Publick, by Tranſlations for
the uſe of the Unlearned; and I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my ſelf ſometimes, that ſeveral
of theſe were more particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48164:34"/>
by Ingenious, good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
Men in Kindneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to our Sex. But whatever
the Motives were, the obliging
Humour has ſo far prevail'd, that
ſcarce any thing either Ancient or
Modern that might be of general
uſe either for Pleaſure, or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is left untouch'd, and moſt
of them are made entirely free of
our Tongue. I am no Judge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Accuracy, or Elegance
of ſuch Performances; but if I may
credit the report of Learned and
Ingenious Gentlemen, (whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Sincerity I have no reaſon
to queſtion) many of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Authors have loſt nothing by
the change of Soil. I can ſee and
admire the Wit and Fancy of <hi>Ovid</hi>
in the Tranſlation of his Epiſtles,
and Elegies, the ſoftneſs and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Tibullus,</hi> the Impetuoſity
and Fire of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> the Gayety,
Spirit and Judgment of <hi>Horace;</hi>
who, though he may appear very
different from himſelf through the
diverſity, and inequality of the
Hands concern'd in making him
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48164:34"/>
ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet may eaſily be
gueſs'd at from the ſeveral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Pieces render'd by the Earl of
<hi>Roſcommon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> and
other ingenious Gentlemen, who
have oblig'd the Nation with their
excellent Verſions of ſome parts of
him. Nor is it poſſible to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
of the ſweetneſs and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
of <hi>Virgil,</hi> after having read
thoſe little but Divine Samples
already made Publick in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
by Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> which gives
us ſo much Impatience to ſee the
whole Work entire by that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Hand. I have heard ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Gentlemen ſay, That it
was impoſſible to do Juſtice in
our Tongue to theſe two laſt
Celebrated Roman Poets, and
and I have known others, of whoſe
Judgments I have as high an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
affirm the contrary; my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Latin diſables me from
determining whether we are in the
right, but the Beauty of what I
have already ſeen by the means of
thoſe Gentlemen, has ſo far preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48164:35"/>
me in favour of the latter; that
might I have 'em entire from the
ſame hands, I think I ſhou'd ſcarce
envy thoſe who can taſt the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Originals. Nor is it to
the Poets only, that we ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
for the Treaſure of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
we have no leſs Engagements to
thoſe, who have ſucceſsfully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
in Proſe, and have mads us
familiar with <hi>Plutarch, Seneca, Cicero,</hi>
and in general with all the famous

Reaſon for this unfair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure;
which is, that when about
an Age and an half ago, all the poor
Remains of Learning then in Being,
were in the hands of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48164:36"/>
they wou'd ſuffer none to
paſs Muſter, that were not deeply
engag'd in thoſe intricare, vexatious
and unintelligble Trifles, for which
themſelves contended with ſo much
Noiſe and Heat; or at leaſt were
not acquainted with <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
and their Commentators; from
whence the Sophiſtry and Subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Schools at that time
were drawn. This Uſurpation was
maintain'd by their Succeſſors, the
Divines, who to this day pretend
almoſt to the Monopoly of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and though ſome generous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have in good meaſure broke
the neck of this Arbitrary, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Authority; yet can't they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
to extend the name of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beyond the Studies, in which
the Divines are more particularly
converſant. Thus you ſhall have
'em allow a Man to be a wiſe Man,
a good Naturaliſt, a good Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician,
Politician, or Poet, but
not a Scholar, a learned Man, that
is no Philologer. For my part I
think theſe Gentlemen have juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the uſe of the Term, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48164:36"/>
that to the knowledge of words,
which belongs more properly to
Things. I take Nature to be the
great Book of Univerſal Learning,
which he that reads beſt in all or
any of its Parts, is the greateſt
Scholar, the moſt learned Man;
and 'tis as ridiculous for a Man to
count himſelf more learned than
another, if he have no greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of knowledge of things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is more vers'd in Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
as it would be for an Old
Fellow to tell a Young One, his
Eyes were better than his, becauſe
he Reads with Spectacles, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>Madam,</hi> you ſee we may
come in Time to put in for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if we have a mind, without
falling under the Correction of
Pedants. But I will let Learning
alone at preſent, becauſe I have
already baniſh'd it (though not
out of diſreſpect) from mix'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
to which we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and of which the greateſt
Magazines and Supports are ſtill
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48164:37"/>
in Reſerve. I mean the many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Authors of our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
whoſe Works it were endleſs
to recount. Where is Love, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Bravery more lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
than in our Tragedies,
who has given us Nobler, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

any of their Plays acted, my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
move by their Direction, my
Indignation, my Compaſſion, my
my Grief are all at their Beck.
Nor is our Comedy at all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to our Tragedy; for, not to
mention thoſe already nam'd for
the other part of the Stage, who
are all excellent in this too, Sir
<hi>George Etherege</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Sed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
for neat Raillery and Gallantry
are without Rivals, Mr. <hi>Wicherley</hi>
for ſtrong Wit, pointed Satyr, ſound

Imitation; Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> for ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
gentile, eaſie Wit falls ſhort of
no Man. Theſe are the Maſters
of the Stage; but there are others
who though of an inferiour Claſs,
yet deſerve Commendation, were
that at preſent my Buſineſs. Nay,
even the worſt of 'em afford us
ſome diverſion; for I find a ſort of
fooliſh Pleaſure, and can laugh at
Mr. <hi>D—y</hi>'s Farce, as I do at the
Tricks, and Impertinencies of a
Monkey; and was pleaſed to ſee
the humour and delight of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
in Mr. <hi>H—n</hi>'s Eating, and
Drinking Play which I fancy'd was
written in a Victualling Houſe. In
ſhort, were it not for the too great
frequency of looſe Expreſſions, and
wanton Images, I ſhould take our
Theaters for the beſt Schools in the
World of Wit, Humanity, and
Manners; which they might eaſily
become by retrenching that too
great Liberty. Neither have the
Poets only, but the Criticks too
Endeavour'd to compleat us; Mr.
<hi>Dennis</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rimer</hi> have by their
Ingenious, and judicious labours
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48164:38"/>
taught us to admire the Beauties
as we ought, and to know the
faults of the former. Nor are we
leſs beholding to theſe for forming
our Judgments, than to thoſe for
raiſing our Fancies.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Sources from whence
we draw our gayer part of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
I don't mean in excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the other parts of Poetry, in
moſt of which (as I have heard
good Judges ſay) we equal at leaſt
the Ancients, and far ſurpaſs all
the Moderns. I honour the Names,
and admire the Writings of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Suckling</hi> and <hi>D'avenant,</hi> I am
raviſh'd with the Fancy of <hi>Cowley,</hi>
and the Gallantry of <hi>Waller.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
the <hi>Fairy Queen,</hi> am rais'd,
and elevated with <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,
Prince Arthur</hi> compoſes and reduces
me to a State of Yawning indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Mr. <hi>W—ſtl—y</hi>'s <hi>Heroicks</hi>
lull me to Sleep. Thus all Ranks and
Degrees of Poets have their uſe, and
may be ſerviceable to ſome body
or other from the Prince to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
Cook, or Paſt-beard Box-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48164:38"/>
I ſhould mention our Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts,

to deſcend to every particular,
of theſe Mr. <hi>Oldham</hi> is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and to go no further, the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable
Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> will be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Our Proſe Writers, that are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for a gay Style and Iovial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
are ſo many, that it would
ſwell this Letter too much to name
'em, ſo that I ſhall only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,

Letters and Dialogaes by

Dialogues of Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> muſt be
more Splenetick than <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> or
more ſtupid, than the Aſs he laugh'd

            <p>Nor are we leſs provided for the
ſerious Part; Morality has gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
been the Province of our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48164:39"/>
Clergy who have treated of all parts
of it very largely with ſo much
Piety, Solidity, and Eloquence,
that as I think I may venture to
ſay, they have written more upon it
than the Clergy of all the reſt of
the World; ſo I believe no Body
will deny that they have written
better. Yet I cou'd wiſh, that our
Ingenious Gentlemen wou'd em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their Pens oftner on theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
becauſe the ſeverity of the
other's Profeſſion obliges 'em to
write with an Air, and in a Style
leſs agreable, and inviting to
Young People, Not that we are
without many excellent Pieces of
Morality, Humanity and Civil Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
written by, and like Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
But it is the Excellence of
'em, and the ability of our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which appears in the Spirit,
Wit, and curious obſervations in
thoſe Pieces, which make me deſire
more of the ſame Nature, Who can
read the Eſſays of that Wonderful
Man my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> or the no leſs
to be admir'd Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s,
or Mr. <hi>Osborns</hi> advice to a Son,

Eſſay (to which laſt we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
oblig'd for an incomparable
Verſion of <hi>Seneca</hi>) and abundance
of others, without wiſhing for more
from the ſame or the like hands?
Our Neighbours the <hi>French,</hi> have
written a great deal of this kind,
of the beſt of which we have the

and St. <hi>Evremont</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be immortal in all Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
I need not mention any more,
it is apparent from theſe that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
want not the means of being
Wiſe and Prudent without more
Tongues than one; nay, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too, if they have any Ambition to
be ſo.</p>
            <p>The numberleſs Treatiſes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,
Philoſophy, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
Natural, and other Hiſtory
(in which I can't paſs ſilently by,
that learned One of Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi>
which the World he writ of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48164:40"/>
can't match) written originally in,
or tranſlated to our Tongue are
ſufficient to lead us a great way
into any Science our Curiouſity ſhall
prompt us to. The greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
we ſtruggled with, was the
want of a good Art of Reaſoning,
which we had not, that I know of,
till that defect was ſupply'd by the
greateſt Maſter of that Art Mr.
<hi>Locke,</hi> whoſe Eſſay on Human Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
makes large amends for
the want of all others in that
kind</p>
            <p>Thus Madam I have endeavour'd
to obviate all our Adverſarie's
Objections, by touching upon as
great a Variety of things relating
to the Subject as I conveniently
cou'd. Yet I hope I have troubled
you with nothing but what was
neceſſary to make my way clear,
and plain before me; and I am apt
to think I have made it appear, that
nothing but diſencouragement or an
Idle Uncurious Humour can hinder
us from Rivalling moſt Men in the
knowledge of great Variety of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48164:40"/>
things, without the help of more
Tongues than our Own; which the
Men ſo often reproachfully tell us
is enough. This Idleneſs is but
too frequently to be found among
us, but 'tis a Fault equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both Sexes. Thoſe that
have means to play the Fool all
their lives, ſeldom care for the
trouble of being made wiſe. We
are naturally Lovers of our Eaſe,
and have great apprehenſions of the
difficulty of things untry'd; Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in matters of Learning, the
common Methods of acquiring
which are ſo unpleaſant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie.
I doubt not but abundance
of noble Wits are ſtiffled in both
Sexes, for want but of ſuſpecting
what they were able to do, and
with how much facility. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhews us every day Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
that arrive at a moderate,
nay ſometimes a great Reputation
by their Confidence, and brisk at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
which they maintain by
their Diligence; while great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Men naturally more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
lye neglected by, for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48164:41"/>
want of Induſtry to improve,
or Courage to exert themſelves.
No Man certainly but wiſhes he
had the Reputation in, and were
Reſpected and Eſteem'd by the
World as he ſees ſome Men are for
the Fruits of their Pens; but they
are loth to be at the pains of an
Attempt, or doubt their ſufficience
to perform; or what I believe is
moſt general, never to enquire ſo
far into themſelves, and their own
Abilities, as to bring ſuch a thought
into their Heads. This laſt I fancy
is the true Reaſon, why our Sex,
who are commonly charged with
talking too much, are Guilty of
Writing ſo little. I wiſh they
would ſhake of this lazy Deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and let the noble examples
of the deſervedly celebrated Mrs.
<hi>Philips,</hi> and the incomparable Mrs.
<hi>Behn</hi> rouſe their Courages, and
ſhew Mankind the great injuſtice
of their Contempt. I am confident
they would find no ſuch need of
the aſſiſtance of Languages as is
generally imagin'd.<note place="margin">Ignorance of Latine <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</note> Thoſe that
have of their own need not graft
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48164:41"/>
upon Foreign Stocks. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thought that the not teaching
Women Latin and Greek, was an
advantage to them, if it were right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſider'd, and might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
to a great heigth. For
Girles after they can Read and
Write (if they be of any Faſhion)
are taught ſuch things as take not
up their whole time, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuffer'd to run about at liberty
as Boys, are furniſh'd among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
toys with Books, ſuch as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
Novels, Plays</hi> and <hi>Poems;</hi>
which though they read careleſsly
only for Diverſion, yet unawares
to them, give 'em very early a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Command both of Words
and Senſe; which are further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by their making and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Viſits with their Mothers,
which gives them betimes the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of imitating, converſing
with, and knowing the manner,
and addreſs of elder Perſons. Theſe
I take to be the true Reaſons why
a Girl of Fifteen is reckon'd as ripe
as a Boy of One and Twenty, and
not any natural forwardneſs of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48164:42"/>
Maturity as ſome People would
have it. Theſe advantages the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
of Boys deprives them of,
who drudge away the Vigour of
their Memories at Words, uſeleſs
ever after to moſt of them, and at
Seventeen or Eighteen are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
their Alphabet of Senſe, and
are but where the Girles were at
Nine or Ten. Yet becauſe they
have learnt Latin and Greek, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
with Scorn all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Books
their beſt helps, and lay aſide their
Latin ones, as if they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Maſters of all that Learning,
and ſo hoiſt Sail for the wide
World without a Compaſs to Steer
by. Thus I have fairly ſtated the
difference between us, and can find
no ſuch diſparity in Nature or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
as they contend for; but
we have a ſort of ungenerous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
that deal more in Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
than Argument, and when they
can't hurt us with their Weapons,
endeavour to annoy us with ſtink
Pots. Let us ſee therefore, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
whether we can't beat them
from their Ammunition, and turn
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48164:42"/>
their own Artillery upon them;
for I firmly believe there is nothing,
which they charge upon us, but
may with more Juſtice be retorted
upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>They tax us with a long Liſt of
Faults, and Imperfections, and
ſeem to have taken a Catalogue of
their own Follies and Vices, not
with deſign to correct them, but
to ſhift of the Imputation to us.
There is no doubt, but particular
Women may be found upon whom
every charge may be juſtified; but
our Sex is not anſwerable for
them, till they prove there are no
ſuch Men, which will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Dooms-day. However, like ill
Neighbours they bring the Dirt
out of their own Homes not out of
Neatneſs, but out of Envy to their
Neighbours, at whoſe Doors they
lay it. But let them remove their
Follies as oft as they pleaſe, they
are ſtill as conſtant to them, as the
<hi>Needle</hi> to the <hi>North Pole,</hi> they
point them out which way ſoever
they move. Let us ſee what theſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48164:43"/>
Qualities are, they ſo liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon, and after ſee how they
fit the Donours, and ſurvey 'em
in their proper Figures and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
The moſt familiar of theſe
are Vanity, Impertinence, Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
Diſſimulation, Inconſtancy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with Vanity,<note place="margin">Vanity.</note> it is a
Failing the greateſt Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
are tinctured with, more or
leſs. For all Men are apt to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves with a Fancy, that
they have ſome one or more good
Quallities, or extraordinary Gifts,
that raiſe 'em above the ordinary
Level of Men; and therefore hug
and cheriſh, what they think
valuable and ſingular in 'em. It is
never commendable, ſometimes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable,
when the excellencies
are real, and it is moderate ſo
much muſt be allow'd to humane
frailty. It is ridiculous and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
when it is extravagant, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd,
or groundleſs. It is very
injudicious, and makes men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
dote on their Defects, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48164:43"/>
expoſe their blemiſhes by their
Fondneſs, which makes 'em more
remarkable by the care and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
beſtow'd on 'em. It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades
hard Favour'd and diſtorted
Fellows to dreſs, and value their
Perſons, Cowards to pretend to
Courage, and provoke Beatings,
Blockheads to ſet up for Wit, and
make themſelves ridiculous in Print,
Upſtarts to brag of their Families,
and be reminded of the Garrets they
were born, and the Stalls they
were brought up in. In Women
the object of it is their Beauty,
and is excuſable in thoſe that have
it. Thoſe that have it not may
be pardon'd, if they endeavour at
it; becauſe it is the only undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
advantage our Sex has over
the other, and what makes 'em
reſpected beyond all other Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and is alone ador'd. In Men
it has not only this Object, but
all thoſe before mention'd, and a
hundred other. It is admirably
ſeen in a Writing, reciting Fop Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
is in full Luſtre in a Beau,
but its moſt unlucky Proſpect is in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48164:44"/>
a Swaggering Coward, who is a
Fool beyond the Conviction of
Smart.<note place="margin">Character of a Bully.</note> His Courage is like an
Ague Fit, that leaves him upon a
Fright, and returns when he is
out of the reach of a Cudgel.
He ſpends much time in the Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
School, and Fights briskly
where there is no danger of Wounds
nor Smart. His Hands are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
but his Heels do him all the
Service. He is a nice obſerver of
Punctilio's, and takes more Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
than are given him. He
draws firſt, and runs firſt, and if
ever he makes another Man run,
it is after him. He is a Pebble that
ſparkles like a Diamond, but wants
hardneſs. He talks perpetually of
what he will do, but thinks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
of what he ſhall ſuffer. He
is often in Quarels, yet ſeldom in
Rencounters, and is glad of a
Challenge, that he may know
whom, and when to avoid. He
brings up the Rear at an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and leads the Van in the
Retreat. He is a Man of much
Paſſion, but the moſt predominant
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48164:44"/>
is his Fear. He offers affronts rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
but has too much honour to
juſtifie them, and will ſubmit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
terms of ſatisfaction rather than
occaſion Blood-ſhed. He is ſo full
of Courage, that it boils over when
there is no occaſion, and his <hi>Sword</hi>
and <hi>Perſon</hi> are always at Leiſure,
and at your Service, till you want
them, and then to his great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he is always indiſpenſably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
otherwiſe. He wears <hi>Red,</hi>
and a long <hi>Sword</hi> openly to ſhew
his Valour, and <hi>Mail</hi> privately to
ſhew his Diſcretion. He threatens
terribly, but he is like a Witch, if
you draw Blood of him, he has no
power to hurt you. No Man ſhews
or boaſts more of his Scars with
leſs Reaſon. He ſcorns to take a
blow in the Face, and a Back-piece
is as good to him as a whole ſute
of Armour. He is at firſt the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of all the <hi>Young Bullies,</hi> at

their <hi>Cub Heclors</hi> upon him, as
they do young <hi>Beagles</hi> on a <hi>Hare.</hi>
Good uſage makes him inſolent,
but he fawns like a <hi>Spaniel</hi> moſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48164:45"/>
upon thoſe that beat him. When
he is diſcover'd by all the reſt of the
World, the Cheat paſſes ſtill upon

terrible Figure he makes in his
Glaſs, tho' he is ready to ſhake at

Mad, Fooliſh, and Vain; theſe
are your Men of nice Honour,
that love Fighting for the ſake of
Blows, and are never well but when
they are wounded They are ſevere
Interpreters of Looks, are affronted
at every Face that don't pleaſe 'em.
and like true Cocks of the Game
have a quarrel to all Mankind at
firſt ſight. They are paſſionate
Admirers of ſcarr'd Faces, and dote
on a Wooden Leg. They receive
a Challenge like a <hi>Billet Douce,</hi>
and a home thruſt as a Favour.
Their common Adverſary is the
Conſtable, and their uſual Lodging
the Counter. Broken heads are a
diverſion, and an Arm in a Scarfe
is a high ſatisfaction. They are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48164:45"/>
in their expences with the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
for they have their Doublets
pinkt on their Backs, but they
are as good as an Annuity to
the Surgeon, tho' they need him
not to let 'em blood. <hi>Flanders</hi> is
their Miſtreſs, and a Clap from
her carries 'em off the Stage. If
they return, an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> is their
Retreat, or the <hi>Sheriff</hi> their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutour.
Theſe two, <hi>Madam,</hi> are
very different extravagances, and
very ſtrange one's, yet they are
real, and ſuch as appear every
day. But, what is moſt to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at, ariſe both from the ſame
Principle, and the ſame miſtaken
Notion, and are only differenc'd by
the diverſity of Tempers in Men.
The common Motive to both is
Vanity, and they jointly concurr
in this Opinion, that Valour is the
moſt eſtimable, and moſt honourable
Quality, that Man is capable of; they
agree in a deſire to be honour'd and
fear'd, but they differ in their methods
in perſuing this common End. The
one is naturally active, bold and
daring; and therefore takes the
true courſe to arrive at it by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48164:46"/>
what he can do, by what he
dare ſuffer, and his immoderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
and indiſcretion ſuffer him to
know no bounds. The other is
mean Spirited and fearful, and ſeeks
by falſe Fire to Counterfeit a heat
that may paſs for genuine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the Froſt in his Blood, and
like an ill Actor, over-does his Part
for want of underſtanding it, which
'tis impoſſible he ſhou'd. Among
peaceable Men, and thoſe of his
own Temper he comes of with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
flying, and thoſe are the Men
he wou'd be valiant amongſt only,
cou'd he read Men's hearts. But the
firſt Rencounter betrays the Aſs
thro' the Lions Skin, and he is
Cudgel'd like an Aſs in Spite of his
Covering. It is our happineſs <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
that we lie under no manner of
Temptation from theſe two Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">Imitation ridiculous.</note>
whereof one is ſo dangerous,
the other ſo ridiculous. For all
humours that are forc'd againſt the
natural bent of our tempers muſt be
ſo. Nature is our beſt guide, and
has fitted ev'ry Man for ſomethings
more particularly than others; which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48164:46"/>
if they had the ſenſe to proſecute,
they wou'd at leaſt not be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
if they were not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
But ſo prevalent are our
Vanity, and this Apiſh Humour of
Imitation, that we perſuade our
ſelves, that we may practiſe with
applauſe, whatever we ſee another
ſucceed in, tho' as contrary to the
intent of our Nature, as Dancing to
an Elephant; ſo ſome Men that talk
well of ſerious matters, are ſo
mov'd at the applauſe ſome merry
Drolls gain, that they forget their
gravity, and aiming to be Wits, turn
Buffoons; There are others, that
are ſo taken with the actions and
grimace of a good Mimick, that
they fall preſently to making aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
Faces and wry Mouths, and
are all their lives after in a Vizor,
Maskt tho' bare fac'd.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and innumerable others
of the like Nature, are the leſſer
Follies of Mankind, by which
their Vanity makes 'em fit only
to be laugh'd at. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who by more ſtudied and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48164:47"/>
refin'd Follies arrive to be more
conſiderable, and make a great
Figure and Party among their
Sex.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt rank of theſe is the
<hi>Beau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Character of a Beau.</note> who is one that has more
Learning in his Heels than his
Head, which is better cover'd
than fill'd. His Taylor and his
Barber are his Cabinet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
to whom he is more behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for what he is, than to his
Maker. He is One that has tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
to ſee Faſhions, and brought
over with him the neweſt cut ſuit,
and the prettieſt Fancy'd Ribbands
for Sword Knots. His beſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
at <hi>Paris</hi> was his Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Maſter, whom he calls the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs,
and his chief Viſits to the
Opera's. He has ſeen the <hi>French</hi>
King once, and knows the name
of his cheif Miniſter, and is by
this ſufficiently convinc'd that there
are no Politicians in any other Part
of the World. His improvements
are a nice Skill in the Mode, and a
high Contempt of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48164:47"/>
and of Senſe. All the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he has of the Country, or
Manners of it, is in the keeping of
the Valet that follow'd him hither,
and all that he retains of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is a few modiſh words to lard
his diſcourſe with, and ſhew his
Breeding, and the names of his
Garniture. He ſhou'd be a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
for he ſtudies nothing but
himſelf, yet ev'ry one knows him
better, that thinks him not worth
knowing. His looks and geſtures
are his conſtant Leſſon, and his
Glaſs is the Oracle that reſolves
all his mighty doubts and ſcruples.
He examines and refreſhes his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
by it, and is more dejected
at a Pimple, than if it were a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.
When his Eyes are ſet to a
languiſhing Air, his Motions all
prepar'd according to Art, his Wig
and his Coat abundantly Powder'd,
his Gloves Eſſenc'd, and his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher
perfum'd and all the reſt
of his Bravery rightly adjuſted, the
greateſt part of the day, as well
the buſineſs of it at home, is over;
'tis time to launch, and down he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48164:48"/>
comes, ſcented like a Perfumers
Shop, and looks like a Veſſel with
all her rigging under ſail without
Ballaſt. A Chair is brought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the door, for he apprehends
every Breath of Air as much, as if
it were a Hurricane. His firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
is to the <hi>Chocolate</hi> Houſe, and
after a quarter of an Hours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
to himſelf in the great Glaſs,
he faces about and ſalutes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and puts in practice his Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
Meditations; When he has
made his Cringes round, and play'd
over all his Tricks, out comes the
fine <hi>Snuſh Box,</hi> and his <hi>Noſe</hi> is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal'd
a while: After this he begins
to open, and ſtarts ſome learned
Argument about the neweſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
and hence takes occaſion to
commend the next Man's Fancy in
his Cloths, this uſhers in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the Appearance laſt <hi>Birth
Night,</hi> or <hi>Ball</hi> at Court, and ſo a
Critick upon this <hi>Lord,</hi> or that
<hi>Ladies</hi> Maſquing Habit. From
hence he adjourns to the <hi>Play-houſe,</hi>
where he is to be met again in the
ſide Box, from whence he makes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48164:48"/>
his Court to all the Ladies in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
with his Eyes, and is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
only with the <hi>Orange-Wench.</hi>
After a while he engages ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Vizor, and they together
run over all the Boxes, take to
Pieces every Face, examine every
Feature, paſs their Cenſure upon
every one, and ſo on to their Dreſs;
here he very Judiciouſly gives his
opinion upon every particular, and
determines whoſe Colours are well
choſen, whoſe Fancy is neateſt, and
whoſe Cloths ſit with moſt Air;
but in concluſion ſees no Body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
but himſelf in the whole
Houſe. After this he looks down
with contempt upon the Pit, and
rallies all the ſlovenly Fellows,
and awkard Beau's (as he calls
them) of t'other End of the
Town, is mightily offended at their
ill ſcented <hi>Snuff,</hi> and in ſpight of all
his <hi>Pulvilio</hi> and <hi>Eſſences,</hi> is overcome
with the ſtink of their <hi>Cordovan
Gloves.</hi> To cloſe all, Madam in the
Mask muſt give him an account of
the Scandal of the Town, which
ſhe does in the Hiſtory of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Intrigues real or feign'd; at
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48164:49"/>
all which he laughs aloud and often,
not to ſhew his ſatisfaction, but his
Teeth. She ſhews him who is
kept by ſuch a Lord, Who was
lately diſcarded by ſuch a Knight,
for granting Favours too indiſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſuch a Gentleman: who has
lately been in the Country for two
or three Months upon extraordinary
Occaſions. To all which he gives
great attention, that he may paſs for
a Man of Intelligence in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Place. His next Stage is
<hi>Locket's,</hi> where his Vanity, not his
Stomach, is to be gratified with
ſomething that is <hi>little</hi> and <hi>dear,
Quails</hi> and <hi>Ortalans</hi> are the meaneſt
of his Diet, and a Spoonful of <hi>Green
Peaſe</hi> at <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> are worth to
him more than the inheritance of
the <hi>Feild</hi> where they grow in <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
Every thing falls in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,
as it falls in price, and he
wou'd not ſo much as taſt the
<hi>Wine,</hi> if the hard name, and the
high rate did not give it a reliſh.
After a glaſs or two, (for a Pint
is his ſtint) he begins to talk of
his Intrigues, boaſts much of the
Favours he has receiv'd, and ſhews
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48164:49"/>
counterfeit Tokens, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
ſlanders ſome Lady or other
of unqueſtion'd Vertue with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
fondneſs for him. His
Amours are all profound Secrets,
yet he makes a Confidence of 'em
to every Man he meets with. He
pretends a great reverence for the
Ladies, and a mighty tenderneſs
of their Reputations; yet he is
like a <hi>Fleſh Flye,</hi> whatever he blows
on is tainted. He talks of nothing
under Quality, tho' he never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a Favour, which his Man
might not have for half a Crown.
He and his Footman in this Caſe are
like <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> at an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Fare is the
ſame, but the Price is vaſtly differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
Thus the Show goes forward,
till he is beaten for Treſpaſſes he
was never guilty of, and ſhall be
damn'd for Sins he never Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
At laſt, with his Credit as
low as his Fortune he retires ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly
to his Cloiſter, the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi>
or <hi>Fleet,</hi> and paſſes the reſt
of his days in Privacy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.
Here, <hi>Madam,</hi> if you
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48164:50"/>
pleaſe wee'l give him one <hi>Viſit</hi>
more, and ſee the laſt <hi>Act</hi> of the
<hi>Farce;</hi> and you ſhall find him
(whoſe Sobriety was before a <hi>Vice,</hi>
as being only the <hi>Pimp</hi> to his
other <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and who fear'd a
lighted <hi>Pipe</hi> as much as if it had
been a great <hi>Gun</hi> levell'd at him)
with his <hi>Noſe Flaming,</hi> and his
<hi>Breath</hi> ſtinking of Spirits worſe
than a <hi>Dutch Tarpawlin's,</hi> and ſmok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of a ſhort <hi>Pipe,</hi> that for ſome
Months has been kept hot as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
as a <hi>Glaſs-Houſe,</hi> and ſo I
leave him to his Meditations.</p>
            <p>You wou'd think it yet more
ſtrange, that any one ſhould be
<hi>Slovenly</hi> and <hi>Naſty</hi> out of <hi>Vanity;</hi>
yet ſuch there are I can aſſure you,
<hi>Madam,</hi> and cou'd eaſily give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of 'em, but that ſo foul
a Relation muſt needs be Nauſeous
to a Perſon ſo Neat as your <hi>Self;</hi>
and wou'd be treating You as the
<hi>Country Squire</hi> did his <hi>Court Friend,</hi>
who when he had ſhew'd him all
the Curioſities of his Houſe and
Gardens, carried him into his Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48164:50"/>
But there are more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now
to juſtifie what I have ſaid of
the Humour of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who was
as vain and as proud in his <hi>Tub,</hi>
as <hi>Plato</hi> cou'd be in the midſt of
his fine <hi>Perſian Carpets,</hi> and rich
<hi>Furniture.</hi> Vanity is only an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of being taken notice of,
which ſhews it ſelf variouſly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the humour of the Perſons;
which was more extravagant in the
<hi>Anti-Beau,</hi> than in the <hi>Beau Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</hi>
Vanity is the verieſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus</hi>
in the World, it can Ape <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi>
and can make Men decry
themſelves on purpoſe to be Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;
like ſome cunning <hi>Preachers</hi>
that cry up <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Self-denial</hi>
perpetually, and are pamper'd
all the while by the Zeal and at
the Charges of their Followers,
who are affraid the good Man
ſhou'd ſtarve himſelf. It is the
Bleſſing of Fools, and the Folly of
Ingenious Men. For it makes thoſe
contentedly hugg themſelves under
all the ſcorn of the World, and the
Indignities that are offer'd 'em, and
theſe reſtleſs and diſſatisfied with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48164:51"/>
its applauſe. Both think the World
envious, and that their merit is
injur'd, and it is impoſſible to
right either of 'em to their Minds;
for thoſe have no title to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of merit, and theſe not ſo
much as they think they have.
Yet it is the Happineſs of the firſt
that they can think themſelves ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of moving <hi>Envy;</hi> for though
they commonly miſtake the Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Men,<note place="margin">Vanity a Bleſſing to Fools.</note> for their applauſe, yet
Men are ſometimes ſo ill Natur'd
as to undeceive 'em, and then it is
their Comfort, that theſe are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Men, and miſrepreſent the
Worlds opinion of 'em. Cou'd
theſe Men be convinc'd of their
miſtake, I ſee nothing that ſhou'd
hinder them from being deſperate,
and hanging or diſpoſing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſome other ſuch way. For
though a Man may comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
under Afflictions, it is either that
they are undeſerved, or if deſerved,
that he ſuffers only for Overſights,
or raſh Acts, by which the wiſeſt
Men may be ſometimes overtaken;
that he is in the main Diſcreet and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48164:51"/>
Prudent, and that others believe
him ſo. But when a Man falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own <hi>Contempt,</hi> and does
not only think himſelf not wiſe,
but by <hi>Nature</hi> made abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of ever becoming <hi>Wiſe,</hi> he
is in a deplorable <hi>State,</hi> and wants
the common <hi>Comfort,</hi> as well of
<hi>Fools,</hi> as <hi>Wiſe Men,</hi> Vanity; which
in ſuch a Caſe is the only proper
<hi>Mediatour</hi> of a <hi>Reconcilement.</hi> No
Quality ſeems to be more Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially
diſtributed to every Man
according to his Neceſſity; for
thoſe that have leaſt Wit, ought to
have the greateſt Opinion of it;
as all other Commodities are rated
higheſt, where they are ſcarceſt.
By this means the level is better
maintain'd amongſt Men, who,
were this imaginary Equality de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,
might be apt to reverence,
and idolize one another too much,
and forgetting the common Fate,
they are all Born to, pay Honours
too near divine to their Fellow
Mortals. But as the humour of
the World now runs, this ſort of
<hi>Idolatry</hi> is ſcarce likely to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48164:52"/>
Faſhion. We have too great
an Opinion of our ſelves, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
too well of any one elſe, and
we are in nothing more difficult
than in points of Wit and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
in either of which we ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unwillingly yield the Preference
to any Man. There is nothing of
which we affect to ſpeak with more
humility and indifference than our
own Senſe, yet nothing of which
we think with more Partiality, and
Preſumption. There have been
ſome ſo bold as to aſſume the Title
of the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and their own Writings; and
we meet with others daily, that
think themſelves <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>Wit.</hi>
Theſe are the moſt Vexatious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
in the World, that think
they have a Priviledge to torment
and plague every Body; but thoſe
eſpecially who have the beſt Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for their Wit or Judgment; as
<hi>Fleas</hi> are ſaid to moleſt thoſe moſt,
who have the tendereſt <hi>Skins,</hi> and
the ſweeteſt <hi>Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe the moſt voluminous Fool
is the Fop Poet, who is one that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48164:52"/>
has always more Wit in his Pockets
than any where elſe,<note place="margin">Character of a Poeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> yet ſeldom or
never any of his own there. <hi>Eſop</hi>'s
<hi>Daw</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of him; For he
makes himſelf fine with the Plunder
of all Parties. He is a Smuggler
of Wit, and ſteals <hi>French</hi> Fancies
without paying the cuſtomary
Duties. Verſe is his <hi>Manufacture;</hi>
For it is more the labour of his
Finger than his brain. He ſpends
much time in Writing, but ten
times more in Reading what he has
Written. He is loaden conſtantly
with more Papers, and duller than
a <hi>Clerk</hi> in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and ſpends
more time in <hi>Hearings,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearings.</hi>
He asks your Opinion,
yet for fear you ſhou'd not jump
with him, tells you his own firſt.
He deſires no Favour, yet is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
if he be not Flatter'd, and
is offended always at the Truth.
His firſt Education is generally a
<hi>Shop,</hi> or a <hi>Counting-Houſe,</hi> where his
acquaintance commences with the
<hi>Bell-man</hi> upon a new Years day.
He puts him upon Intriguing with
the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and promiſes to <hi>Pimp</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48164:53"/>
for him. From this time forward
he hates the name of <hi>Mechanick,</hi>
and reſolves to ſell all his ſtock, and
purchaſe a Plantation in <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi>
He is now a Poetical <hi>Haberdaſher</hi>
of <hi>Small Wares,</hi> and deals very
much in <hi>Novels, Madrigals, Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
Funeral,</hi> and <hi>Love Odes,</hi> and
<hi>Elegies,</hi> and other Toyes from <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

which he has a Shop ſo well
furniſh'd with, that he can fit you
with all ſorts and Sizes upon all
Occaſions in the twinkling of an
Eye. He frequents <hi>Apollo</hi>'s <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi>
in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and picks
up the freſheſt Intelligence what
<hi>Plays</hi> are upon the Stocks, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be launch'd; who have lately
made a good Voyage, who a ſaving
one only, and who have ſuffer'd a
Wreck in <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s-<hi>Inn-Feilds,</hi> or
<hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> and which are brought
into the Dock to be Careen'd and
fitted for another Voyage. He
talks much of <hi>Jack Dryden,</hi> and <hi>Will.
Wyc<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

and proteſts he can't help having
ſome reſpect for 'em, becauſe they
have ſo much for him, and his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48164:53"/>
Writings; otherwiſe he cou'd ſhew
'em to be meer Sots and Blockheads
that underſtand little of Poetry, in
compariſon of himſelf; but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears
'em meerly out of Gratitude,
and Compaſſion. Once a Month
he fits out a ſmall <hi>Poetical Smeck</hi>
at the charge of his Bookſeller,
which he lades with <hi>French Plunder</hi>
new Vampt in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſmall Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of <hi>Tranſlated Odes, Elegies</hi>
and <hi>Epigrams</hi> of Young Traders,
and ballaſts with heavy <hi>Proſe</hi> of his
own; for which returns are to be
made to the ſeveral Owners in Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
or applauſe from the Prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Tyre Women that deal for
'em. He is the Oracle of thoſe that
want Wit, and the Plague of thoſe
that have it; for he haunts their
Lodgings, and is more terrible to
em, than their Duns. His Pocket
is an unexhauſtible Magazine of
<hi>Rhime,</hi> and <hi>Nonſenſe,</hi> and his
Tongue like a repeating Clock with
Chimes, is ready upon every touch
to ſound to 'em. Men avoid him
for the ſame Reaſon, they avoid
the <hi>Pillory,</hi> the ſecurity of their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48164:54"/>
               <hi>Ears;</hi> of which he is as mercilefs a
Perſecutor. He is the Bane of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
a Friend to the Stationers,
the Plague of the Preſs, and the
Ruine of his Bookſeller. He is
more profitable to the <hi>Grocers</hi> and
<hi>Tabacconiſts</hi> than the <hi>Paper Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;</hi>
for his Works, which talk
ſo much of Fire and Flame, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
expire in their Shops in <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour</hi>
and <hi>Smoak.</hi> If he aſpire to
<hi>Comedy,</hi> he intrigues with ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
<hi>Damſel</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to inſtruct himſelf in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of it, and is cullied by her
into <hi>Matrimony,</hi> and ſo is furniſh'd
at once with a Plot, and two good

            <p>I ſhall not trouble you with any
more Inſtances of the fooliſh vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Mankind;<note place="margin">Vanity U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal.</note> becauſe I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
I have been too large upon
that Head already. Not that I
think there is any Order or Degree
of Men, which wou'd not afford
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48164:54"/>
many and notorious inſtances for
our Purpoſe. For as I think <hi>Vanity</hi>
almoſt the Univerſal mover of all
our Actions, whether good or bad;
ſo I think there are ſcarce any Men
ſo Ingenious, or ſo Vertuous, but
ſomething of it will ſhine through the
greateſt Part of what they do, let
them caſt never ſo thick a Vail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it. What makes Men ſo ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of leaving a Reputation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
'em in the World, though
they know they can't be affected
with it after Death, but this even
to a degree of Folly? What elſe
makes great Men involve themſelves
in the Fatigues and Hazards of
War, and intricate Intrigues of
State, when they have already
more than they can enjoy, but an
Itch of being talk'd of and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
to which they ſacrifice their
preſent happineſs and repoſe?</p>
            <p>But I ſhall carry theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
no farther; becauſe I have
already ſingled out ſome of thoſe
many whoſe <hi>Vanity</hi> is more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
and ridiculous, than any our
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48164:55"/>
Sex is chargeable with, and theſe
ſlight Touches may ſerve to let 'em
ſee, that even the greateſt, and
Wiſeſt are not wholely exempt, if
they have it not in a higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
tho' they exerciſe it in things
more Popular, and Plauſible. I
hope therefore the burthen of this
good Quality will not hereafter be
laid upon us alone, but the Men
will be contented to divide the Load
with us, and be thankful that they
bear leſs than their Proportion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Impertinence</hi> comes next under
Conſideration,<note place="margin">Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</note> in which I ſhall be as
brief, as I conveniently can, in
regard I have been ſo long upon
the precedeing Head. <hi>Impertinence</hi>
is a humour of buſying our ſelves
about things trivial, and of no
Moment in themſelves, or unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
in things of no concern to
us, or wherein we are able to do
nothing to any Purpoſe. Here our
Adverſaries inſult over us, as if
they had gain'd an intire <hi>Victory,</hi>
and the <hi>Field</hi> were indiſputable;
but they ſhall have no cauſe for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48164:55"/>
               <hi>Triumph,</hi> this is no Poſt of ſuch
mighty advantage as they fondly
perſuade themſelves. This <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
ariſes from an Erroneous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that all thoſe things in which
they are little concern'd, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted,
are triffles below their care
or notice,<note place="margin">Commonly miſtaken.</note> which indeed they are
not by Nature ſo well able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.
Thus, when they hear us
talking to, and adviſing one another
about the Order, Diſtribution and
Contrivance of <hi>Houſhold Affairs,</hi>
about the <hi>Regulation</hi> of the <hi>Family,</hi>
and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
the provident management of
a <hi>Kitchin,</hi> and the decent ordering
of a <hi>Table,</hi> the ſuitable <hi>Matching,</hi>
and convenient diſpoſition of <hi>Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and the like, they preſently
condemn us for impertinence. Yet
they may be pleaſed to conſider,
that as the affairs of the World are
now divided betwixt us, the <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi>
are our ſhare, and out of which
we are rarely ſuffer'd to interpoſe
our Senſe. They may be pleaſed
to conſider likewiſe, that as light
and inconſiderable as theſe things
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48164:56"/>
ſeem, they are capable of no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Senſe higher or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
than thoſe of <hi>Brutes</hi> without
our care of 'em. For were it not
for that, their Houſes wou'd be
meer <hi>Bedlams,</hi> their moſt luxurious
Treats, but a rude confuſion of ill
Digeſted, ill mixt Scents and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
and the fine Furniture, they
beſtow ſo much coſt on, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive
heap of glittering <hi>Rubbiſh.</hi>
Thus they are beholding to us for
the comfortable Enjoyment of what
their labour or good Fortune hath
acquir'd or beſtow'd, and think
meanly of our care only, becauſe
they underſtand not the value of it.
But if we ſhall be thought imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for Diſcourſes of this Nature,
as I deny not but we ſometimes
juſtly may, when they are unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;
what cenſure muſt thoſe
Men bear, who are prepetually
talking of <hi>Politicks, State Affairs</hi>
and <hi>Grievances</hi> to us, in which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
neither they, nor We are much
concern'd, or if we be, are not able
to propoſe, much leſs to apply any
Remedy to 'em? Surely theſe are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48164:56"/>
impertinent; not to call the <hi>Beau,</hi>
or <hi>Poetaſter</hi> on the <hi>Stage</hi> again,
whoſe whole Lives are one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſcene of Folly and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence;
let us make the beſt of our
<hi>News Monger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is one whoſe Brains having
been once over-heated,<note place="margin">Character of a Coffee-Houſe Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician.</note> retain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Fire in 'em ever after.
He miſtakes his Paſſion for Zeal,
and his Noiſe and Buſtling, for
Services. He is always full of
Doubts, Fears, and Jealouſies, and
is never without ſome notable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of a deep laid Deſign, or a
dangerous Plot found out in a <hi>Meal
Tub,</hi> or <hi>Petticoat.</hi> He is a mighty
Liſtner after <hi>Prodigies,</hi> and never
hears of a <hi>Whale,</hi> or a <hi>Comet,</hi> but he
apprehends ſome ſudden <hi>Revolution</hi>
in the State, and looks upon a
<hi>Groaning-board,</hi> or a <hi>ſpeaking-head,</hi>
as fore-runners of the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
He is a great Lover of the
King, but a bitter Enemy to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and thinks it impoſſible
for him to have any but <hi>Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,</hi>
and though he be very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48164:57"/>
for the Government, yet he
never finds any thing in it but <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi>
and <hi>Miſcarriages</hi> to declaim
upon. He is a Well-wiſher to the
<hi>Church,</hi> but he is never to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd
to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> and
rails moſt inveterately at the <hi>Act</hi> of
<hi>Uniformity.</hi> He hates <hi>Perſecution</hi>
implacably, and contends furiouſly
for <hi>Moderation,</hi> and can ſcarce think
well of the <hi>Toleration,</hi> becauſe it is
an Act of the State. He profeſſes
himſelf of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
pretends to like the Worſhip of it,
but he goes to Meetings in ſpight

                  </gap>rſon</hi> of his <hi>Pariſh.</hi> His <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
is very tender and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in Matters of Ceremony, but
it is as ſteely and tough as Brawn
behind his Counter, and can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
any Sin of Gain. He lodges
at home, but he lives at the <hi>Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</hi>
He converſes more with
<hi>News Papers, Gazettes</hi> and <hi>Votes,</hi>
than with his <hi>Shop Books,</hi> and his
conſtant Application to the <hi>Publick</hi>
takes him off all Care for his <hi>Private
Concern.</hi> He is always ſettling the
<hi>Nation,</hi> yet cou'd never manage his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48164:57"/>
own <hi>Family.</hi> He is a mighty Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
at all <hi>Elections,</hi> and tho' he has
no <hi>Vote,</hi> thinks it impoſſible any
thing ſhou'd go right unleſs he be
there to Bawl for it. His buſineſs is at
<hi>Home,</hi> but his thoughts are in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and he is earneſtly inveſting
of Towns till the <hi>Sheriff's Officers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer
his Doors. He is buſie in
forcing of <hi>Counterſcarps,</hi> and ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Breaches,</hi> while his <hi>Creditors</hi>
take his <hi>Shop</hi> by ſurprize, and make
Plunder of his <hi>Goods.</hi> Thus by
mending the <hi>State,</hi> He marrs his

talking of the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> till
the Execution of 'em ſilence him.</p>
            <p>This ſort of Impertinents the
<hi>Coffee-houſes</hi> are every day full of;
nay, ſo far has this contagious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence
ſpread it ſelf, that <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Houſes,</hi> and <hi>Shops,</hi> nay, the
very <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Bulks</hi> are infected
and peſter'd with Politicks and
News. Not a Pot cou'd go glibly
down, or a ſtitch go merrily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
without <hi>Namur,</hi> a while ago;
'twas <hi>Spice</hi> to the <hi>Porter</hi>'s <hi>Ale,</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48164:58"/>
               <hi>Wax</hi> to the <hi>Cobler</hi>'s <hi>Thread;</hi> the
one ſuſpended his Draught, and
the other his Awl to enquire what
was become of the <hi>Rogue,</hi> and were
very glad to hear he was taken,
and expected no doubt he ſhou'd
come over and make 'em a <hi>Holy-day</hi>
at his Execution. They were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
rejoyc'd at the Arreſting of the
Mareſchal <hi>Boufflers,</hi> and made no
queſtion but they ſhou'd ſee him
amongſt the reſt of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> at
<hi>Bartholomew Fair</hi> for Two Pence.
This Folly of the <hi>Mob</hi> was in ſome
meaſure excuſable, becauſe their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
led 'em into an expectation
of ſeeing what had given the World
ſo much Trouble. But thoſe that
have better knowledge of things
have no ſuch <hi>Plea,</hi> they ought to
have been wiſer, than to have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
themſelves ſo much and ſo
earneſtly about affairs, which all
their care and Sollicitude could have
no more Influence upon, than over
the Weather. 'Twas pleaſant to ſee
what Shoals the report of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of a <hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>Flanders Mail,</hi>
brought to the <hi>Secretary</hi>'s <hi>Office,</hi> the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48164:58"/>
               <hi>Poſt Office,</hi> and the <hi>Coffee-Houſes;</hi>
every one Crowding to catch the
News firſt, which as ſoon as they
had, they poſted away like ſo
many Expreſſes to diſperſe it among
their Neighbours at more diſtance,
that waited with Ears prickt up to
receive 'em, or walk'd uneaſily
with a Fooliſh Impatience to and
from the Door, or Window, as if
their looking out ſo often wou'd
fetch 'em the ſooner. Moſt Men in
their News are like <hi>Beau</hi>'s in their
Diet, the worſt is welcome while
'tis freſh and ſcarce, and the beſt is
not worth a Farthing when it has
been blown upon; and commonly
they fare like <hi>Beau</hi>'s, are fond of it
while 'tis young and inſipid, and
neglect it when 'tis grown up to its
full, and true reliſh. No ſooner is it
rumour'd that a Breach is made in the
<hi>Caſtle Wall,</hi> or the <hi>White Flag</hi> hung
out, but a <hi>Council of War</hi> is call'd
in every <hi>Coffee-houſe</hi> in Town; the
<hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch Prints,</hi> their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencers
are call'd for immediately,
and examin'd, and not a Shot is
mention'd but they ſtart as if the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48164:59"/>
Ball whizz'd juſt then by their Ears.
After this follows a ſerious debate
about a general Aſſault, and whether
they ſhall ſtorm immediately, or
not; who ſhall begin the Attack;
what Conditions ſhall be granted
on Capitulation. The Caſtle of
<hi>Namur</hi> thus taken, or Surrender'd,
they proceed to take their Meaſures,
and ſettle the next Campaign, and
whatever harm we ſuffer by thoſe
miſcheivous <hi>French</hi> in the Field,
they are ſure to take ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and pay 'em off Swingingly
in the <hi>Coffee-houſes:</hi> But as if this
were not enough, Our greateſt
Actions muſt be Buffoon'd in Show,
as well as Talk. Shall <hi>Namur</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and our Hero's of the City not

that the <hi>Coffee-houſes</hi> dar'd more than

with Feather in Cap, to the general
Rendezvous in the <hi>Artillery Ground.</hi>
There theſe terrible Mimicks of

               <hi>Mars</hi> are to ſpend their Fury in
<hi>Noiſe</hi> and <hi>Smoke,</hi> upon a <hi>Namur</hi>

and by the help of <hi>Guns</hi> and

<hi>Smith-field</hi> in all its Bravery, and
wou'd be too hard for the greateſt
Man in all <hi>France,</hi> if they had him
but amongſt 'em. Yet this is but
Skirmiſhing, the hot Service is in
another Place, when they engage

            <p>Nothing is more common, and

Moſt Men wou'd have little

about nothing, but what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
or were concern'd in. A
Monkey is not liker a Man in his

They are very much miſtaken, that

from any Principle of Charity or

never ſo little to the purpoſe, only
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48164:60"/>

<hi>Muskettoes</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
They are perpetually in a hurry of
Buſineſs, yet are forc'd to rack their
Inventions to employ their Leiſure.
They are very buſie for every Body,
and ſerve no Body. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

expected every where with Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
yet come ſooner alwayes than
they are welcome. They will walk
a Mile, and ſpend an hour to tell
any one how urgent their Buſineſs
is, and what haſt they are in to be
gone. Their Expedition is their
greateſt Loſs, For Time is the only
thing that lies heavy upon their
hands. They are walking <hi>Gazetts,</hi>
that carry News from one Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

            <p>There are another ſort of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinents,<note place="margin">Character of a Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſo.</note>

which the reſt of the World ſlight
as uſeleſs, and below their regard.
Of theſe the moſt Egregious is the

Periwinkles, Sea Shrubs, Weeds,

and the greateſt part of his
Moveables are the remainders of
his Deluge. His Travels are not
deſign'd as Viſits to the Inhabitants
of any Place, but to the Pits, Shores
and Hills; from whence he fetches
not the Treaſure, but the Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
He is raviſh'd at finding an
uncommon ſhell, or an odd ſhap'd
Stone, and is deſperately enamour'd
at firſt ſight of an unuſual markt
Butter-flie, which he will hunt a
whole day to be Maſter of. He
trafficks to all places, and has his
Correſpondents in e'ry part of the
World; yet his Merchandizes
ſerve not to promote our Luxury,
nor encreaſe our Trade, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enrich the Nation, nor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
A Box or two of <hi>Pebbles</hi> or
<hi>Shells,</hi> and a dozen of <hi>Waſps, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
and <hi>Caterpillars</hi> are his Cargoe.

and wou'd give more for the Shell
of a <hi>Star-fiſh,</hi> or <hi>Sea Urchin</hi> entire,
than for a whole <hi>Dutch</hi> Herring
Fleet. He viſites Mines, Colepits,
and Quarries frequently, but not
for that ſordid end that other Men
uſually do, <hi>viz.</hi> gain; but for the
ſake of the foſſile Shells and Teeth
that are ſometimes found there.
He is a ſmatterer at <hi>Botany,</hi> but for
fear of being ſuſpected of any uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
deſign by it, he employs his
curioſity only about <hi>Moſſes, Graſſes,
Brakes, Thiſtles,</hi> &amp;c. that are not
accus'd of any vertue in Medicine,
which he diſtinguiſhes and divides
very nicely. He preſerves careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe <hi>Creatures,</hi> which other Men
induſtriouſly deſtroy, and cultivates
ſedulouſly thoſe Plants, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
root up as Weeds. He is the
Embalmer of deceas'd Vermin, and
dreſſes his Mummyes with as much
care, as the Ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> did
their Kings. His Caſh conſiſts
much in old Coins, and he thinks
the Face of <hi>Alexander</hi> in one of 'em
worth more than all his Conqueſts.
His Inventory is a liſt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48164:62"/>
of all Countries, and the Shells
and Pebbles of all Shores, which can
no more be compleat without two

<hi>Barber</hi>'s without a batter'd
<hi>Cittern.</hi> A piece of Ore with a
Shell in it is a greater Preſent than
if it were fine Gold, and a ſtring of
<hi>Wampompeag</hi> is receiv'd with more
joy, than a <hi>Rope</hi> of <hi>Orient Pearl,</hi> or

to give him a lift, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Flood, to which he is ſo
much oblig'd for ſparing his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Toys only. But as great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
uſe, he corrects him ſometimes
for not ſpeaking to his Mind, and
gives him the lie now and then in
order to ſupport his Authority. He
ſhakes the World to Atoms with
caſe, which melts before him as
readily as if it were nothing but a
Ball of Salt. He pumps even the
Center, and drains it of imaginary
ſtores by imaginary Loopholes, as
if punching the Globe full of holes
cou'd make his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> hold
Water. He is a Man of <hi>Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and does that in a few days,
which coſt <hi>Moſes</hi> ſome Months to
compleat. He is a Paſſionate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of his own Works without a
Rival, and ſuperciliouſly contemns
all <hi>Anſwers,</hi> yet the leaſt <hi>Objection</hi>
throws him into the Vapours. He
ſets up for a grand <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48164:63"/>
palms <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> upon the World,
which future Ages may (if they
pleaſe) expect to hear his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for; at preſent he is in no
humour to give 'em any other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
than his own word, that
he is infallible. Yet thoſe that have
a Faith complacent enough to take
a Gentleman's word for his own
great Abilities, may perhaps be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to a ſight of his grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
his <hi>Raree Show;</hi> the
particulars of which he repeats to
'em in a whining <hi>Tone,</hi> e'ry whit as
formal and merry, though not ſo
Muſical, as the Fellows that uſed
formerly to carry <hi>theirs at their
Backs.</hi> His ordinary diſcourſe is
of his <hi>Travels under Ground,</hi> in
which he has gone farther (if he
may be believ'd) than a whole
Warren of <hi>Conies.</hi> Here he began
his Collection of Furniture for his
Philoſophical <hi>Toy Shop,</hi> which he
will conclude with his Fortune,
and then like all Fleſh revert to the
place from whence he came, and be
tranſlated only from one Shop to
another.</p>

all Parts both of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> to

that they may give their Names to

I know that the deſire of knowledge,

is the Pretence; But what
Knowledge is it? What Diſcoveries
do we owe to their Labours? It is
only the Diſcovery of ſome few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded

all. You can be my Witneſs, <hi>Madam,</hi>
that I us'd to ſay, I thought Mr.
<hi>Boyle</hi> more honourable for his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Labours, than for his Noble
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48164:65"/>
Birth; and that the <hi>Royal Society,</hi>
by their great and celebrated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
were an Illuſtrious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

a very great Veneration for the

vaſt difference between the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Members that compoſe it. Were
<hi>Supererogation</hi> a Doctrine in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
'tis probable ſome of 'em
might borrow of their Fellows
merit enough to juſtifie their Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
but alas they are come an
Age too late for that trick; They
are fallen into a Faithleſs, Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Generation of Men that will
give credit no farther than the
viſible Stock will extend: And tho'
a Vertuoſo ſhould ſwell a Title-Page
even till it burſt with large
Promiſes, and ſonorous Titles, the
World is ſo ill natur'd as not to think
a whit the better of a Book for it.
'Tis an ill time to trade with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48164:66"/>
Faith, when ſo many have
ſo lately been broken by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock
of that <hi>Commodity;</hi> no ſooner
now a days can a Man write, or
ſteal an Hypotheſis, and promiſe
Demonſtration for it hereafter in
this or the next World; but out
comes ſome malicious Anſwer or
other, with Reaſons in hand againſt
it, overthrows the credit of it, and
puts the poor Author into Fits.
For though a great Philoſopher that
has written a Book of three Shillings
may reaſonably inſult, and deſpiſe
a ſix penny Anſwer, yet the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſo low pric'd a Refutation
wou'd make a <hi>Stoick</hi> fret, and <hi>Frisk</hi>
like a Cow with a Breeze in her
Tail, or a Man bitten by a <hi>Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula.</hi>
Men meaſure themſelves by
their <hi>Vanity,</hi> and are greater or leſs
in their own Opinions, according to
the proportion they have of it; if
they be well ſtock'd with it, it may
be eaſie to confute, but impoſſible
to convince 'em. He therefore that
wou'd ſet up for a great Man, ought
firſt to be plentifully provided of
it, and then a Score of <hi>Cockle Shells,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:48164:66"/>
a dozen of <hi>Hodmandods,</hi> or any
Triffle elſe is a ſufficient Foundation
to build a Reputation upon. But
if a Man ſhall abdicate his lawful
Calling in pure affection to theſe
things, and has for ſome years ſpent
all the Time and Money he was
Maſter of in proſecution of this
Paſſion, and ſhall after all hear his
<hi>Caterpillars</hi> affronted, and his <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-flies</hi>
irreverently ſpoken of, it
muſt be more provoking to him,
than 'tis to a <hi>Lion</hi> to be pull'd
by the <hi>Beard.</hi> And if, when to
crown all his Labours, he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
a Water ſo near a kin to
the famous one, that cou'd be kept
in nothing but the hoof of an Aſs,
that it was never found but in the

written a Book of Diſcoveries, and
Wonders thereupon, if (I ſay) the
Impertinent Scriblers of the Age,
will ſtill be demanding <hi>Proofs</hi> and

throw down his <hi>Pen</hi> in a rage, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48164:67"/>
pronounce the world, that cou'd
give him ſuch an interruption, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to be bleſt with his future
labours, and breath eternal Defiance
to it, as irreconcilable, as the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
of the Sons of <hi>Oedipus.</hi> To
which prudent Reſolution, let us
leave him till he can recover his
Temper.</p>
            <p>Theſe Inſtances, <hi>Madam,</hi> will
(I hope) ſuffice to ſhew that Men
are themſelves altogether as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
as they maliciouſly miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
us. It is not for want of
plenty of others that I content my
ſelf with theſe; but I am not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to trouble you with any of an
inferiour Character. Theſe are all
impertinents of <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Note,</hi> and
have ſeverally the good fortune to
find crowds of <hi>Fools</hi> of their own
Sex to applaud and admire them.
<hi>Impertinence</hi> is a failing, that has
its <hi>Root</hi> in <hi>Nature;</hi> but is not worth
Laughing at, till it has receiv'd the
finiſhing ſtrokes of Art. A Man
through natural defects may do
abundance of incoherent, fooliſh
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48164:67"/>
Actions, yet deſerve <hi>Compaſſion</hi>
and <hi>Advice</hi> rather than <hi>Deriſion.</hi>
But to ſee Men ſpending their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
as well as Lives, in a courſe
of <hi>Regular Folly,</hi> and with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious,
as well as expenſive I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſs
running through tedious
<hi>Syſtems</hi> of impertinence, wou'd have
ſplit the ſides of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> had it
been his fortune to have been a
Spectator. 'Tis very eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
which of theſe <hi>Impertinents</hi> is
the moſt ſignal; the <hi>Vertuoſo</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
without a Competitour. For
our Follies are not to be meaſur'd
by the degree of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in 'em, but by the Study,
Labour and Expence they coſt us
to finiſh and compleat 'em. So that
the more Regularity and Artifice
there appears in any of our Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
the greater is the folly
of 'em. Upon this Score it is, that
the laſt mention'd deſervedly claim
the preference to all others; they
have improv'd ſo well their Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into an Art, that the <hi>Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
and <hi>Ignorant</hi> are induc'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there is ſome ſecret Vertue,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48164:68"/>
ſome hidden Myſtery in thoſe dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
toys of theirs; when all their
Buſtling amounts to no more than a
learned <hi>Impertinence,</hi> (for ſo they
abuſe the Term) and all they teach
Men is, but a ſpecious expenſive
method of throwing away both
Time and Money.</p>
            <p>I intend not in what remains to
trouble you with any more ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
becauſe I am ſenſible theſe
have already ſwell'd this <hi>Letter</hi> to
a <hi>Volumn,</hi> which was not at firſt my
intent. I ſhall therefore diſpatch
the remaining part of the charge in
as few Words as poſſible. Amongſt
the reſt <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> is none of the
leaſt <hi>Blemiſhes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion become neceſſary.</note> which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to fix upon us. This Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
though it can't upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
deſerve the name of a
<hi>Vertue,</hi> yet according to the
preſent Conſtitution of the World,
is many times abſolutely neceſſary,
and is a main ingredient in the
Compoſition of Human Prudence.
It is indeed oftentimes criminal,
but it is only accidentally ſo, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48164:68"/>
Wit, and moſt other good
Qualities may be, according, to the
Ends and Purpoſes to which they
are miſemploy'd. Diſſimulation is
nothing but the hiding or diſguiſing
our ſecret thoughts, or Inclinations
under another appearance. I ſhall
not endeavour to abſolve our Sex
wholly from all uſe of this Quality, or
Art (call it which you pleaſe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I think it may upon many
ocſicaons be uſed with Innocence
enough, and upon ſome can't with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great Imprudence be omitted.
The World is too full of <hi>Craft, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi>
and <hi>Violence,</hi> for abſolute <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi>
to live in it. It behoves
thereſore our Sex as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to live with ſo much Caution,
and Circumſpection in regard to their
own Security, that their Thoughts
and Inclinations may not be ſeen
ſo naked, as to expoſe 'em to the
<hi>Snares,</hi> deſigns, and practices of
<hi>Crafty Knaves,</hi> who wou'd make a
property of 'em; or lay 'em open to
the wicked <hi>Efforts,</hi> and miſchievous
Impreſſions of <hi>Envy,</hi> or <hi>Malice,</hi>
whoſe pleaſure ſprings from the hurt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48164:69"/>
of others. Nothing gives our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
ſo great an advantage over
us, as the knowledge of our Opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
and Affections, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
agreable to which they will
be ſure to bate all their Traps and
Devices. For this reaſon it is that
it has been Proverbially ſaid of
Old, that, <hi>He that knows not how to
diſſemble, knows not how to live.</hi>
The Experience of all Ages ſince
has confirm'd this Obſervation,
and ours no leſs than any of the
Preceding. This premis'd, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
no Wiſe Man will blame our
Sex for the uſe of an Art ſo neceſſary,
to preſerve 'em from becoming a
<hi>Prey</hi> to every deſigning Man, an
Art of which himſelf muſt make
great uſe to deſerve that Title. Yet
I am afraid, that upon enquiry our
Sex will not be found to have ſo
much of it as is requiſite, at leaſt
not generally; Our ſedentary Life,
and the narrow Limits to which our
Acquaintance, and Buſineſs are
Circumſcrib'd, afford us ſo little Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
ſo regular a Face of things,
that we want the means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48164:69"/>
the Maſter of ſo uſeful an Art,
which no queſtion but we ſhou'd as
ſoon acquire as Men, had we but
equal Opportunities. Hence it is
that <hi>Women</hi> are more apt to ſhow
their <hi>Reſentments</hi> upon all <hi>Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
than <hi>Men;</hi> and are thought na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
more <hi>Peeviſh</hi> and <hi>Captious,</hi>
by thoſe that apprehend not the true
reaſon; Whereas <hi>Men</hi> are altogether
as <hi>Stomachful,</hi> and take <hi>Offence</hi> as
ſoon, but they cover and ſuppreſs
their Indignation better, not with
a deſign to forget any Injury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
but to wreak their <hi>Revenge</hi>
more covertly and effectually. This
is another advantage Men derive
from liberty of Converſation and
promiſcuous Buſineſs, wherein the
Variety of Contingencies they have
to provide againſt, and the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Tempers they deal with,
force 'em to turn and wind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into all <hi>Shapes,</hi> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
themſelves to all Humours.
There is indeed yet a higher ſort of
<hi>Diſſimulation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when criminal.</note> which is always <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,</hi>
that is when Men not only
cloud their real <hi>Sentiments</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48164:70"/>
but make Profeſſion of
and ſeem zealouſly to affect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
this by a more proper and
reſtrain'd Name is call'd <hi>Deceipt,</hi>
and is always us'd in an ill Senſe.
This Art is moſt practic'd in Courts
where <hi>Policie,</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> reign;
there You may ſee <hi>Enemies</hi> hugging
and careſſing one another with all
outward <hi>Expreſſions</hi> of <hi>Tenderneſs</hi>
and <hi>Friendſhip</hi> imaginabe, while
they are ſecretly contriving each
others ruine. There you may ſee
Men cringing to thoſe, they wou'd
<hi>Spurn</hi> if they durſt, and <hi>Flattering</hi>
thoſe they deſpiſe and rail at behind
their <hi>Backs,</hi> The Court is a place
where we come very rarely other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than as <hi>Spectators,</hi> not as <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;</hi>
as <hi>Ornaments,</hi> not as <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and therefore are ſeldom
involv'd in the guilty Practices of
it. Nor is it the Court only, but
all Places are infected with this Vice,
where there is any Encouragement
of Profit or Pleaſure to be hop'd
from ſucceſsful Treachery, of which
no Place is ſo barren as not to afford
ſome. This Deceipt is ſo far from
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48164:70"/>
being the Vice of our Sex, that they
are the common Object on which it
is daily practic'd: Nothing is more
frequently met with than falſe <hi>Love</hi>
in Men,<note place="margin">Falſe Love commonly practic'd.</note> which is now grown ſo
familiar, that a Company of Six of
both Sexes can ſcarce meet, but a
<hi>Sham Paſſion</hi> commences immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
is urg'd, proteſted, and ſworn
to be real with all imaginable Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
If theſe falſe Arts, mock
ſighing, and Dying prevail upon
any fooliſh, eaſie, credulous <hi>Woman,</hi>
the <hi>Sham Lover</hi> is blown up with
the Succeſs, he is big and in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
till he be deliver'd of the Secret,
which with great ſatisfaction he
proclaims in all Places where he
comes: 'tis his higheſt Exploit of
<hi>Gallantry,</hi> which he will by no
means loſe the credit of. Thus he
thinks her ruine a ſtep to Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and founds his own Honour
upon her Infamy. This <hi>Madam</hi> is
the baſeſt of Treachery; for they
are not ſatisfied with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of their falſe Promiſes, and
Oaths, but they inſult over the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a too fond <hi>Woman,</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48164:71"/>
in her Diſhonour. I am ſorry
there are any <hi>Women</hi> ſo fooliſh and
forward, as to give hopes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to ſuch ungenerous
Fellows; yet we may be aſſur'd,
that they are not a quarter ſo many
as thoſe vain <hi>Boaſters</hi> wou'd make
'em. Much more be ſaid on this
head, but that I think it high time
to paſs on to the next, which is
<hi>Enviouſneſs,</hi> ſo foul a Blot to a fair
Character, that no Merit can waſh
it out, or atone ſufficiently for
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Envy</hi> is the Parent of <hi>Calumny,</hi>
and the Daughter of <hi>Jealouſie.</hi> Men
ſeldom envy others, till they fear
being out ſtrip'd by 'em in Fortune
or Reputation.<note place="margin">Enviouſneſs</note> It is the moſt
criminal, becauſe the moſt injurious
to Vertue, and worth of all our
natural Failings, againſt which it's
Malice is generally bent. This
vice and <hi>Jealouſie</hi> ſeem to be more
particularly hated of <hi>Providence</hi> than
any other; For they carry their
Puniſhment inſeparably along with
'em, The Envious and the Jealous
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48164:71"/>
need no other Tormentours than
their own Thoughts. The Envious
Man ruines his own to diſturb ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Tranquillity, and ſacrifices
his own Happineſs and Repoſe to a
perverſe Deſire of troubling his
Neighbours. He feeds like <hi>Toads</hi>
upon the Venome of the Earth, and
ſucks in Scandal greedily, that he
may at Pleaſure diſgorge it to the
greater annoyance of other Men.
His mind has the <hi>Vapours,</hi> a Sweet
Report of any one throws it into
Convulſions, and Agonies, and a
foul one is the Releif and Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it. A wholeſome Air free
from the Blaſts of <hi>Detraction</hi> and
<hi>Slander</hi> is as certainly pernicious to
him, as <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Toads.</hi>
This Vice is generally diſclaim'd by
both Sexes, yet generally practic'd
by both. Men love as little to have
their Reputation as their Chimneys
over-topt by their Neighbours; For
they think by that means their names
become dark, as their Houſes do ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky
by the other: Yet thro' a lazy
Malignity had rather pull the other's
down to their Level, than build
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48164:72"/>
their own up higher. This Humour
prevails indeed, yet not in equal
Meaſure in both Sexes. For as we
have confeſſedly leſs <hi>Ambition,</hi> ſo
have we apparently leſs of this Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which uſually attends it, and
ariſes from a ſelf Intereſted Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which makes 'em endeavour by
baſe ſiniſter means to level that
Merit which they think ſtands in
their way to Preferment, and which
they deſpair of being able to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
by honourable attempts. For
what need any one uſe baſe Sleights
to ſtop the Man, whom by fair
Speed he thought he cou'd overtake.
No ſooner is any Man rais'd to any
Eminence in the World, but half
the Sex at leaſt join in Confederacy
to raiſe a Battery of Scandal againſt
him, to bring him down again.
<hi>Honour</hi> is the <hi>Pillory</hi> of great
Deſert, whither a Man is no ſooner
rais'd, but the vile Raſcally inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Croud gather immediately toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to throw Dirt at him, and make
that which was intended as a Grace,
and Reward, but a more honourable
Puniſhment. Our Sex ſeldom ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48164:72"/>
to this Pitch of Envy, our
Ambition is more bounded, and our
Deſires ſooner ſatisfied, Hence it is
that we are leſs troubl'd at the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
of others; for not giving our
ſelves the Liberty of aiming at things
far out of our Power, they are the
ſooner compaſs'd, and we the ſooner
at Eaſe. He, that thinks himſelf
Happy, is incapable of Envying
another's Felicity, ſince he ſees him
poſſeſs'd of nothing which either he
has not or deſpiſes not. Yet it muſt
be confeſs'd that the leſſer Piques,
and Grudgings are daily to be met
with among us, but no leſs among
Men. What is it that ſpawns daily
ſuch Fryes of <hi>Satyriſts</hi> without Wit,
and <hi>Criticks</hi> without Judgment, but
this humour of carping, and nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
at the Reputation of others?
But they are generally abundantly
furniſht with Impudence, a good
Quality that commonly ſupplies
largely the want of all other.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Critick</hi> of this ſort is one that
for want of <hi>Wit</hi> ſets up for <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Character of a City Critick</note>
yet he has ſo much Ambition
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48164:73"/>
to be thought a <hi>Wit,</hi> that he lets
his <hi>Spleen</hi> prevail againſt <hi>Nature,</hi> and
turns <hi>Poet.</hi> In this Capacity he
is as juſt to the World as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Injurious. For as the <hi>Critick</hi>
wrong'd ev'ry Body in his Cenſure,
and ſnarl'd, and grin'd at their
Writings, the <hi>Poet</hi> gives 'em Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to do themſelves Juſtice, to
return the Compliment and laugh at
or deſpiſe his. He wants nothing
but Wit to fit him for a <hi>Satyriſt,</hi> yet
he has <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with that Want, and write
without it. His works are <hi>Libells</hi>
upon others, but <hi>Satyrs</hi> upon himſelf,
and while they <hi>Bark</hi> at Men of <hi>Wit,</hi>
call him Fool that writ 'em. He
takes his Malice for a Muſe, and
thinks himſelf inſpir'd when he is
only <hi>Poſſeſs'd,</hi> and blown up with
a Flatus of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Vanity.</hi> His
great helps to Poetry are <hi>Crambo,</hi> and
<hi>Arithmetick,</hi> by which he aſpires to
Chime, and Numbers, yet miſtakes
frequently in the tale of his Fingers.
He has a very great <hi>Antipathy</hi> to
his own species, and hates to ſee a
Fool any where but in his Glaſs.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48164:73"/>
For (as he ſays) they <hi>Provoke</hi> him
<hi>And offend his Eyes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">7th. Satyre of Boileau Eng.</note> He <hi>Follows 'em
as a Dog perſues his Prey, and barks
whenere</hi> He <hi>ſmells 'em in his way:</hi> He
<hi>knows, to ſay no more</hi> that <hi>Wit is ſcarce,
to gingle out a Rhime, or tag a Verſe:
Or Cobble wretched Proſe to numerous
Lines: There if</hi> he <hi>has a Genius there
it ſhines.</hi> His Fund of <hi>Criticiſm</hi> is
a Set of Terms of Art pickt out of
the <hi>French Criticks,</hi> or their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators;
and his <hi>Poetical</hi> ſtock is a
Common Place of certain <hi>Forms</hi> and
<hi>Manners</hi> of Expreſſion. He writes
better in <hi>Verſe</hi> than <hi>Proſe;</hi> For in
that there is <hi>Rhime,</hi> in this neither
<hi>Rhime</hi> nor <hi>Reaſon.</hi> He talks much of
the <hi>Naivete</hi> of his Thoughts, which
appears ſufficiently in the Dullneſs of
'em; yet nothing but the <hi>Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
Spiritleſs <hi>Air</hi> is his own. He
rails at Mr. <hi>Oldham</hi> for want of
Breeding and good Manners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a grain of either, and ſteals his
own Wit to beſpa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

but like an ill <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> he lets
the <hi>Spirit</hi> flie of in the drawing

He cenſures Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> for too
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48164:74"/>
much <hi>Wit,</hi> and corrects him with
none. The difference between Mr.
<hi>Cowley</hi> and him is this; the one
has too much Wit, and too fine for
the Standard; the other not enough
to blanch his baſe Metal, or cover
the Braſs of his Counterfeits. To
compleat himſelf in the Formalities
of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> he falls in love and
tells the World, it is oblig'd to his
<hi>Paſſion</hi> for his <hi>Poetry;</hi> but if his
<hi>Miſtreſs</hi> prove no more indulgent
than his <hi>Muſe,</hi> his Amour is like to
conclude but unluckily. For if his
Love be no warmer than his Lines,
his <hi>Corinna</hi> may play with his
Flame without danger of Burning.
He pretends to have written only
his ſincereſt Thoughts; I don't
know how well his Miſtreſs may take
that from the <hi>Lover,</hi> but I dare
ſwear the World did not expect it
from the Poet. He is happieſt at
the Picture of a Rhiming Fool, for he
need only to look in his Glaſs, and
he may Copy a Country <hi>Wit</hi> from

Humour laſts, there's a good <hi>Sugar-Jobber</hi>

            <p>You may wonder, <hi>Madam,</hi> why
I ſhou'd give you the trouble of this
Character, after I had given you
my word to trouble you with no
more of this Nature. I muſt confeſs,
I am ſorry that ſo fooliſh an Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cou'd make me forget my ſelf; but
a Book newly publiſh'd happening
juſt at this Juncture unluckily to fall
into my Hands, I cou'd not without
Indignation ſee the Scurrility and
Inſolence, with which Mr. <hi>Oldham,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> are treated; and
cou'd not but reſent a little the
Wrongs done to the Memory of
Men whom the reſt of the World
with Juſtice admire; and cou'd not
help taking Notice upon ſo fair an
Opportunity, that they are not,
tho' dead, to be ſo rudely plaid
with, and made the May-Game of
e'ry <hi>Splenetick Boy.</hi> There are
ſome yet living, whoſe Wit and
Performances deſerve a more reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

with from him. But they are able
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48164:75"/>
to revenge their own Quarrel, if
they think he deſerves the honour
to be Scourg'd by 'em. Nothing but
Envy and a Vain Conceit of himſelf
cou'd move him to attack the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Men, whoſe Verſe will
alwayes command Admiration,
while his own raiſe nothing but
Scorn and Indignation. If his Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
were but bleſt with half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
ſuch Authors, he wou'd in a
ſhort time infallibly be <hi>Stationer</hi>
general to all the <hi>Grocers</hi> and <hi>Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coniſts</hi>
in the Town.</p>
            <p>After this Digreſſion, <hi>Madam,</hi> let
us return to our Subject. We ſtand
yet charg'd with <hi>Levity,</hi> and <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,</hi>
two Failings ſo nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and ſo generally United, that
it his hard to treat of 'em apart;<note place="margin">Levity.</note> we
will therefore conſider 'em briefly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<hi>Levity</hi> is an unſteddy Humor
that makes men like and diſlike, ſeek
and reject frequently the ſame things
upon ſlender or no Reaſons. This is
the Humour of the Infancy of both
Sexes, and proceeds from the ſtrength
of their Appetites, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48164:75"/>
of their Judgments. At theſe
tender Years every thing we ſee
moves our Curioſities, and becauſe
we think little beyond our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
deſire impatiently whatever
pleaſes. This wears of in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the growth of our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when we begin to conſider
the Fatigue, Hazard, Diſreputation,
and other Inconveniences that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unreaſonable, or inordinate
Deſires. Herein our Sex have a
manifeſt Advantage over the other;
For it is confeſs'd on all hands that
our Judgments ripen ſooner than
theirs,<note place="margin">Leſs Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among Women then Men.</note> whence of courſe it Follows,
that this Folly prevails not ſo long
upon us, as them. 'Tis yet true,
that even the moſt experienc'd and
wiſeſt of Us have no ſmall mixture
of it, which appears in the greateſt
Part of our Actions. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
likewiſe, that Men have a
greater proportion of it than we.
From this it is that <hi>Novelty</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
all its Charms, and that Men
perſue with ſo much Eagerneſs and
Impatience what they ſo ſoon ſlight
if obtain'd. I appeal to the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48164:76"/>
of all mankind, if they do
not generally frame to themſelves
much greater Idea's of any thing
they deſire, and are unacquainted
with, than they find real, when they
become Familiar to 'em; and if they
did not imagine greater Pleaſures,
while they were in perſuit, than
they met with after they were in
Poſſeſſion of their Wiſhes. The
Imagery of <hi>Fancy</hi> is, like ſome Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
raviſhing, and ſurprizing at a
due diſtance, but approach 'em near,
and all the Charms and Beauty va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and they appear rough and
unpleaſant. Hence it is that Men
grow uneaſie, and their deſires pall
ſo ſoon upon the full enjoyment of
their Wiſhes; they ſee then the
imperfections as well Beauties of
what they coveted, which glitter'd
ſo far of, and like the Moon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
all Luſtre and Smoothneſs,
but when arriv'd at, all dark and
uneven. Theſe Fallacies Men are
more ſubmitted to than we, by
thoſe very Priviledges which give
'em in ſome things the advantage
over us. The variety of Buſineſs,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48164:76"/>
and Society they run through, the
large acquaintance they contract,
give 'em encouragement to aſpire
to, and hopes to obtain many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
things, which our Sex ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
lift their Thoughts up to. I
know this aſpiring Humour of theirs
is generally call'd <hi>Ambition,</hi> and I
allow the Term to be proper; but
their Ambition works upon their
Levity, which only can make them
Barter certain Eaſe, Peace and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
for uncertain Pomp and
Splendour; and forſake a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they know to be good, for one
they know no more of, than that
it Shines, and that it Glitters, and
and ſo part with the true Jewel for
the falſe one. Theſe are the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and applauded Follies of
Mankind, and ſhew the Weakneſs
and Levity of thoſe we call the
greateſt, and wiſeſt Men, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
the Eaſe and Pleaſure of
their Lives to <hi>Popular Breath,</hi> and
ſounding Titles, which is like bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
a ſmall Diamond for a large
Glaſs Bubble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:48164:77"/>
               <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> is ſo like <hi>Levity</hi> that
little more needs to be ſaid of it,<note place="margin">Inconſtancy</note>
only that it is commonly reſtrain'd
to the change of Affections in regard
to Perſons, and ſo is cheifly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in Love and Freindſhip. It
is founded upon Levity, thro' which
we firſt make an injudicious Choice,
and are afterwards as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
diſguſted with it. This
happens oftner in <hi>Love,</hi> than <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi>
becauſe the Impreſſions of <hi>Love</hi>
are more ſuddenly receiv'd, and the
Effects of it more violent, than thoſe
of <hi>Friendſhip;</hi> and the Deſires, which
are commonly kindled by one ſingle
Perfection, ſuch as <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>Wit,</hi>
not being ſuddenly anſwered, are
in Proceſs of time extinguiſh'd, or
abated by obſervation of ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful
Imperfection or other in the
Perſon belov'd. This is indeed the
true Reaſon,<note place="margin">Love, why ſo ſoon cold.</note> why <hi>Love,</hi> which is
generally ſo hot at firſt, cools com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſo ſuddenly; becauſe being
generally the Iſſue of Fancy, not
Judgment, it is grounded upon an
over great Opinion of thoſe Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
which firſt ſtrike us, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48164:77"/>
which fall in our Eſteem upon more
mature Examination. From whence
it is likewiſe that Men are leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in their Affections, than we;
for Beauty only being generally the
Object of their Paſſion, the Effect
muſt neceſſarily be as fadeing as the
Cauſe; their Love therefore being
only the reſult of wonder and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
is abated by Familiarity, and
decays, as they wear of, by Degrees.
Beſide, that, a Love ſo Founded is
liable to be raviſh'd by any Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Beauty; or if not ſo, yet the
Novelty of the Former once worn
of, the New Comer has the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Fancy the Slave of Novelty
to gain the Superiority. This is
the Cauſe why ſo few real and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Paſſions are found amongſt Men.
For Charms depending upon, and
owing their Power to Fancy; can
maintain no Conqueſts any longer,
than that is on their ſide, which is
as inconſtant as the Wind.<note place="margin">Women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanter Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> In this
alſo we are leſs faulty, than they;
For, not uſually fixing our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
on ſo mutable a Thing as the
<hi>Beauty</hi> of a <hi>Face,</hi> which a thouſand
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48164:78"/>
accidents may deſtroy, but on <hi>Wit,
Good Humour,</hi> and other <hi>Graces</hi> of
the <hi>Mind,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Body,</hi>
our Love is more durable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in proportion to the longer
continuance of thoſe Qualities in
the Object. Neither indeed have
we the means, or temptation to be
Fickle and inconſtant ſo ready as
Men have; For Modeſty, and the
Rules of Decency obſerv'd among
Us, not permitting to us the Liberty
of declaring our ſentiments to thoſe
we love, as Men may, we dare
not indulge a wanton Fancy, or
rambling Inclination, which muſt
be ſtiffled in our own Breaſts, and
cou'd only give us a hopeleſs An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety,
unleſs we were able to inſpire
the ſame Paſſion for us in them;
which it were vain to expect, without
breaking thro' all reſtraint of <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
and <hi>Decorum</hi> at the price of our
Fame and Reputation, which I hope
few are ſo daring as to venture.
Beſides this our Tempers are by
Nature calm, ſedace, and tender,
not apt to be ruffl'd, and diſturb'd
by Paſſions, and too fearful to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48164:78"/>
any thing in ſatisfaction of
'em; theirs on the contrary, bold,
active, and uneven, eaſily ſuſceptible
of all manner of Deſires, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
executing any Deſigns to gratifie
'em. Thus are we debarr'd the
liberty of chuſing for our ſelves,
and confin'd to pleaſe our ſelves out
of the number that like and addreſs
to us, of which if we fix our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
upon any one, we are
generally fixt and unmoveable, as
having neither the Inclination to,
nor opportunity of Inconſtancy, that
the Men have. I don't deny but
that there may be ſome among us
guilty of this Fault, but they are
vaſtly ſhort of the Number of Men
involv'd in the like Guilt, amongſt
whom it is now grown ſo faſhionable,
that is become no Scandal; but is
daily juſtified, and the Treachery
boaſted of as high Gallantry. The
Crimes therefore of ſome few <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
ought, to be no reproach to the
Sex in general. Of Infidelity in
Friendſhip I ſhall ſay little, becauſe
I think there are ſo few Inſtances of
any thing that deſerve the Name,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48164:79"/>
that ſcarce any Age has been ſo
fruitful as to produce two Pair of real
and true Friends. I know that the
Name is commonly given to ſuch as
are linkt by any Ties of Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity,<note place="margin">Friendſhip.</note>
Affinity, Intereſt, mutual
Obligations, Acquaintance, and the
like: But theſe are ſuch Friendſhips
(if they may be call'd ſo) as are
always contracted with a tacit
Reſerve to Intereſt on both ſides,
and ſeldom laſt longer than the
Proſperity of either Party, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that are frequently renounc'd
upon ſlight Diſobligations, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
and die of themſelves. Yet
if I may preſume to give my Opinion
in a Caſe, where matter of Fact
does not appear, I think we ſhou'd
be the more Faithful even in this
too: For as we are leſs concern'd in
the Affairs of the World, ſo we have
leſs Temptation from Intereſt to be
falſe to our Friends. Neither are
we ſo likely to be falſe thro' Fear;<note place="margin">Women tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Friends than Men.</note>
becauſe our Sex are ſeldom engag'd
in matters of any Danger. For
theſe Reaſons it is, our Sex are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
more hearty and ſincere in the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48164:79"/>
ordinary Friendſhips they make
than Men, among whom they are
uſually clogg'd with ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
of Intereſt, and Puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's
of Honour; to which laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
are owing the greateſt part of
thoſe honourable Actions, which
are miſtakenly imputed to Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
For ſomething done to ſalve
Honour, commonly puts a Period
to all Friendſhip, with unfortunate
Perſons; whom Men think they may
afterward grow cold to without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the moſt conſiderable
Imperfections, or at leaſt thoſe,
which with moſt Colour of Reaſon
are charg'd upon us, as general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
and I hope, <hi>Madam,</hi> I have
fairly ſhown, that the other Sex are
both by Intereſt and Inclination
more expos'd, and more Subject to
'em, than we. <hi>Pride, Luſt, Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and many more, are by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers
againſt us thrown into the
Scale to make weight and bear
us down, but with ſuch manifeſt
Injuſtice, that without giving my
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48164:80"/>
ſelf any further trouble, I dare appeal
to any reaſonable <hi>Man,</hi> and leave
him to decide the Difference. I
know there was a <hi>Tullia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">More ill Men than Women.</note> a <hi>Claudia,</hi>
and a <hi>Meſſalina;</hi> there was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
a <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> a <hi>Nero,</hi> a <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula;</hi>
but if the Sexes in general
are to be reproach'd with, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
by theſe; Human Race is
certainly the vileſt Part of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
'Tis very ill <hi>Logick</hi> to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from Particulars to Generals,
and where the Premiſſes are ſingular,
to conclude Univerſally: But if
they will allow us the Liberty they
take themſelves, and come to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
the Vicious of both Sexes,
they will certainly out poll us by
infinite Numbers. It were therefore
better Policy ſurely in them, to quit
a way of arguing, which is at once
ſo falſe, and ſo much to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Cauſe they contend
for: and when they can by ſound
Arguments make out any Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
their Sex has over ours, other
than what I have already granted,
I am ready to be convinc'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their Convert; and I make
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48164:80"/>
no doubt but every ingenuous Man
will do as much by me. Thus I
have endeavour'd to vindicate our
Sex, from the unjuſt Imputations
with which ſome unreaſonable, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Men wou'd load us: For I am
willing to think the greater, or at
leaſt the better Part of their Sex,
more generous than to encourage
their Scandal. There remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, but to ſhew that there
are ſome neceſſary Qualifications
to be acquir'd, ſome good Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be made by Ingenious
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> in the Company of our
Sex.</p>
            <p>Of this number are <hi>Complacence,

Man is fi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted for Society. This is
beſt learnt in our Company, where
all Men affect Gaiety, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be agreable. <hi>State News,
Politicks, Religion,</hi> or private <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs</hi>
take up the greateſt Part of
their Converſation, when they are
among themſelves only. Theſe are
Subjects that employ their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
too much, to leave any room
for <hi>Complacence;</hi> they raiſe too
much heat to ſuffer Men to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
and pleaſant, and Men are too
ſerious when they talk of 'em, to
ſuppreſs their natural Temper,
which are apt to break out upon any
Oppoſition. Men are as apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48164:81"/>
their Opinions, as their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and wou'd take it as well to
have their Titles to their Eſtates que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd,
as their Senſe; and perhaps
in that they imitate the Conduct
of our Sex, and do, like indulgent
Mothers, that are moſt tender of
thoſe Children that are weakeſt.
But however it be, I have obſerv'd,
when ſuch Arguments have been
introduc'd even in our Company,
and by Men that affect Indifference,
and abundance of Temper, that
very few have been able to ſhew
ſo much Maſtery, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appear'd either in their Air,
or Expreſſion, or in the Tone of
their Voices, which argued a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Warmth, and Concern, than
is proper for the Converſation of
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> or the Company of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
Theſe Uneaſineſſes happen
not ſo often among us, becauſe the
Men look upon us to have very
little Intereſt in the Publick Affairs
of the World, and therefore trouble
us very ſeldom with their grave,
ſerious Trifles, which they debate
with ſo much earneſtneſs among one
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48164:82"/>
another. They look upon us
as Things deſign'd and contriv'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for their Pleaſure, and therefore
uſe us tenderly, as Children do
their Favourite Bawbles. They
talk gayly, and pleaſantly to us,
they do, or ſay nothing that may
give as any Diſguſt, or <hi>Chagrin,</hi>
they put on their chearfulleſt
Looks, and their beſt Humour,
that they may excite the like in us:
They never oppoſe us but with a
great deal of Ceremony, or in
Raillery, not out of a Spirit of
Oppoſition, (as they frequently
do one another) but to maintain
a pleaſant Argument, or heighten
by variety of Opinions an agreable
Entertainment. Mirth, and Good
Humour reign generally in our
Society, Good Manners always;
For with us Men ſhew in a manner,
the Reverſe of what they are one
to another: They let their thoughts
play at Liberty, and are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the Expreſſion, that nothing
harſh, or obſcene eſcape 'em, that
may ſhock a tender Mind, or offend
a modeſt Ear. This Caution it is,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48164:82"/>
which is the Root of <hi>Complacence,</hi>
which is nothing but a Deſire to
oblige People, by complying with
their Humours. 'Tis true ſome
Tempers are too Obſtinate, and
froward, ever to arrive at any great
Heigth of this good Quality, yet
there is nothing ſo ſtubborn, but it
may be bent. Aſſiduity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Practice will contract ſuch
Habits, as will make any thing
eaſie and familiar, even to the worſt
contriv'd Diſpoſition; but where
Nature concurs, Men are ſoon
Perfect. This is one great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
Men reap by our Society, nor
is it to be deſpis'd by the Wiſeſt of
'em, who know the uſe of this
Accompliſhment, and are ſenſible,
that it is hardly, if at all, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
but by converſing with us.
For tho' Men may have Wit and
Judgment, yet the Liberty they
take of thwarting, and oppoſing
one another makes 'em Eager, and
Diſputative, Impatient, Sowre, and
Moroſe; till by converſing with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they grow inſenſibly aſham'd of ſuch
Ruſtick Freedom. The truth of this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48164:83"/>
is Evident from the Obſervation of
the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> and <hi>Inns</hi> of <hi>Court,</hi>
I mean thoſe Students in 'em that
lead a more recluſe and Monaſtick
Life, and converſe little with our
Sex. They want neither Wit, nor
Learning, and frequently neither
Generoſity, nor Good Nature, yet
when they come into gay, tho' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Company, are either damp'd
and ſilent, or unſeaſonably Frolickſom
and Free, ſo that they appear either
Dull, or Ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Nor is <hi>Complacence</hi> the only thing
theſe Men want,<note place="margin">Gallantry acquir'd by our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> they want like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the <hi>Gallantry</hi> of thoſe Men
that frequent our Company. This
Quality is the heigth and perfection
of Civility, without which it is
either Languiſhing, or Formal, and
with which it appears always with
an engaging Air of Kindneſs, and
Good Will. It ſets a value upon the
moſt inconſiderable Trifles, and
turns every Civility into an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
For in ordinary Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities,
and civil Correſpondencies,
we regard not ſo much what, as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48164:83"/>
how things are done, the Manner is
more lookt upon than the Matter of
ſuch Courteſies. Almoſt all Men
that have had a liberal, and good
Education know, what is due to
Good Manners, and civil Company.
But till they have been us'd a little
to Our Society, their Modeſty ſits
like Conſtraint upon 'em, and looks
like a forc'd Compliance to uneaſie
Rules, and Forms of Civility. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
frequently with us makes
'em familiar to Men, and when they
are convinc'd, as well of the Eaſineſs,
as the Neceſſity of 'em, they are
ſoon reconcil'd to the Practice.
This Point once gain'd, and they
become expert in the common, and
neceſſary Practices. Thoſe that have
any natural Bravery of Mind, will
never be contented to ſtop there;
Indifference is too cold and Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
a thing for 'em, a little For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Ceremony, and common Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
ſuch as are paid to e'ry one
of Courſe, will not ſatisfie their
Ambitious Spirits, which will put
'em upon endeavouring for better
Receptions, and obliging thoſe,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48164:84"/>
whom they can't without Reproach
to themſelves offend. This is the
Original, and firſt Spring of <hi>Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
which is an Humour of Oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all People, as well in our Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
as Words. It differs from
<hi>Complacence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Difference betwixt Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Gallantry.</note> this being more active,
that more paſſive; This inclines us
to oblige, by doing or ſaying after
our own Humours ſuch things as
we think will pleaſe; that by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to, and following theirs.
A Man may be <hi>Complacent</hi> without
<hi>Gallantry,</hi> but he can't be <hi>Gallant</hi>
without <hi>Complacence.</hi> For 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to pleaſe and be agreable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhewing our own Humours to
Others; but 'tis impoſſible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome regard to theirs: yet this
Pleaſure will be but faint and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid,
without a Mixture of both.
This mixture of Freedom, Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and a deſire of pleaſing,
when rightly tempered, is the true
Compoſition of Gallantry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which,
who ever is compleat Maſter, can
never fail of being both admir'd, and
belov'd. This Accompliſhment is
beſt, if not only to be acquir'd by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48164:84"/>
converſing with us; for beſides the
natural Deference, which the Males
of every obſervable Species of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
pay to their Females, and the
Reaſons before given for <hi>Complacence,</hi>
which all hold good here, there is
a tender Softneſs in the Frame of
our Minds, as well as in the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Bodies, which inſpire
Men, a Sex more rugged, with the
like Sentiments, and Affections,
and infuſes gently and inſenſibly
a Care to oblige, and a Concern
not to offend us.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that they employ all
their <hi>Art,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Invention <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ words">
                     <desc>〈◊…〉</desc>
                  </gap> our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</note> 
               <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Invention</hi> to ſay
and do things, that may appear to
us, ſurprizing and agreable either for
their Novelty or Contrivance. The
very End and Nature of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among us retrench aboundance
of thoſe things, which make the
greateſt part of Men's diſcourſe,
and they find themſelves oblig'd
to ſtrain their Inventions to fetch
from other Springs, Streams proper
to entertain us with. This puts
'em upon beating and ranging ore
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48164:85"/>
the Fields of Fancy to find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
new, ſomething pretty to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to us, and by this means refines
at the ſame time their Wit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges,
and extends their Invention;
For by forcing 'em out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Road, they are neceſſitated to
invent new Arguments, and ſeek new
ways to divert and pleaſe us, and
by reſtraining the large Liberty they
take one with another, they are
compell'd to poliſh their Wit, and
File off the Roughneſs of it. To
this they owe, the Neatneſs of
Raillery, to which abundance of
Gentlemen are now arriv'd; For
Contrariety, of Opinions, being
that which gives Life, and Spirit
to Converſation, as well Women as
Men do frequently hold Arguments
contrary to their real Opinions, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to heigthen the Diverſion, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the pleaſure of Society. In
theſe the utmoſt Care is taken to
avoid all things that may ſound harſh,
offenſive, or indecent, their Wit is
employ'd only to raiſe mirth, and
promote good Humour, Conditions
that can't well be obſerv'd, when
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48164:85"/>
Men contend for Realities, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
for the Reputation of their
Wit or Judgment,<note place="margin">Fools no fit Companions for Women.</note> and the truth of
their Opinions. 'Tis true theſe
Improvements are to be made only
by Men, that have by Nature an
improvable Stock of Wit and good
Senſe; For thoſe that have it not,
being unable to diſtinguiſh what is
proper for their Imitation, are apt
to Ape us in thoſe Things which are
the peculiar Graces and Ornaments
of our Sex, and which are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Objects of Sight, and need
no further Reflection, or thinking.
This Affectation is notorious in our
Modern <hi>Beau</hi>'s, who obſerving the
Care taken by ſome of our Sex in the
ſetting of their Perſons, without
penetrating any farther into the
Reaſons Women have for it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
that what became them,
might be ridiculous in themſelves,
fall to licking, ſprucing, and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their Campaign Faces, and ill
contriv'd Bodies, that now, like all
Fooliſh Imitatours, they out do the
Originals, and out-powder, out-patch,
and out-paint the Vaineſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48164:86"/>
and moſt extravagant of our Sex at
thoſe Follies, and are perpetually
Cocking, Bruſtling, Twiring, and
making Grimaces, as if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
we ſhou'd make Addreſſes
to 'em in a ſhort Time. Yet ought
not this to diſcourage any Ingenious
Perſon, or bring any Scandal upon
our Converſation, any more than
Travelling ought to be brought into
Diſrepute, becauſe it is obſerv'd,
that thoſe, who go <hi>abroad Fools, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
Fops.</hi> It is not in our power to
alter Nature, but to poliſh it, and
if an Aſs has learnt all his Paces,
'tis as much as the thing is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, 'twere abſurd to expect he
ſhou'd chop <hi>Logick.</hi> This is ſo far
from being an Objection againſt us,
that it is an Argument, that none
but Ingenious Men are duely quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to converſe with us; Who by
our Means have not only been fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and finiſh'd for great things,
but have actually aſpir'd to 'em.
For 'tis my Opinion, that we owe
the Neat, Gentile Raillery in Sir
<hi>George Etheredge,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles
Sedley</hi>'s Plays, and the Gallant
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48164:86"/>
Verſes of Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
much with Ladies. And I
remember an Opinion of a very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Perſon, who aſcribes the
Ruine of the <hi>Spaniſh Grandeur</hi> in great
meaſure, to the ridiculing in the
Perſon of <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> the <hi>Gallantry</hi>
of that <hi>Nation</hi> toward their <hi>Ladies.</hi>
This Opinion however Ingenious
carries me beyond the Scope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of the preſent Argument, and
therefore I ſhall leave all further
Conſideration of it to thoſe that are
more at leiſure, and leſs weary than
I am at preſent.</p>
            <p>There remain yet ſome things to
be ſpoken to, but I muſt confeſs to
you, <hi>Madam,</hi> that I am already very
much tired, and I have reaſon to
fear that you are more. When you
enjoyn'd me this Task, I believe,
you did not expect, I am ſure, I
did not intend ſo long a Letter. I
know I have written too much, yet
I leave you to judge, whether it be
enough. One Experience I have
gain'd by this Eſſay, that I find,
when our Hands are in, 'tis as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48164:87"/>
hard to ſtop 'em, as our Tongues,
and as difficult not to write, as not
to talk too much. I have done
wondring at thoſe Men, that can
write huge Volumes upon ſlender
Subjects, and ſhall hereafter admire
their Judgment only, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
their Imaginations, and curb
their wandring Fancies. I pretend
no Obligation upon our Sex for this
Attempt in their Defence; becauſe
it was undertaken at your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and for your Diverſion only,
which if I have in any meaſure
ſatisfied, I have my Ambition, and
ſhall beg nothing farther, than that
my ready Obedience may excuſe
