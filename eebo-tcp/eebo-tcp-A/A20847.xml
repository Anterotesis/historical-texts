            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE GENERALL READER</head>
            <p>IN publishing this Essay of my Poeme, there is this great disaduantage against me; that it commeth out at this time, when Verses are wholly deduc't to Chambers, and nothing esteem'd in this lunatique Age, but what is kept in Cabinets, and must only passe by Transcription; In such a season, when the Idle Humerous world must heare of nothing, that either sauors of Antiquity, or may awake it to secke after more, then dull and slothfull ignorance may easily reach vnto: These, I say, make much against me; and especially in a Poeme, from any example, either of Ancient, or Modern, that haue proued in this kind: whose vnusuall tract may perhaps seeme difficult, to the female Sex; yea, and I feare, to some that think themselues not meanly learned, being not rightly inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Muses: such I meane, as had rather read the fantasies of forraine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, then to see the Rarities &amp; Historie of their owne Country deliuered by a true natiue Muse. Then, whosoeuer thou be, possest with such stupidity &amp; dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that, rather then thou wilt take paines to search into ancient and noble things, choosest to remaine in the thicke fogges and mists of ignorance, as neere the common Lay-stall of a Citie; refusing to walke forth into the <hi>Tempe</hi> and Feelds of the Muses, where through most delightfull Groues the Angellique harmony of Birds shall steale thee to the top of an easie hill, where in artificiall caues, cut out of the most naturall Rock, thou shalt see the ancient people of this Ile deliuered thee in their liuely images: from whose height thou mai'st behold both the old and later times, as in thy prospect, lying farre vnder thee; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaying thee downe by a soule-pleasing Descent through delicate embrodered Meadowes, often veined with gentle gliding Brooks; in which thou maist fully view the dainty Nymphes in their simple naked bewties, bathing them in Crystalline streames; which shall lead thee, to most pleasant Downes, where harmlesse Shepheards are, some exercising their pipes, some singing rounde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies, to their gazing flocks: If as, I say, thou hadst rather, (because it asks thy labour) remaine, where thou wert, then straine thy selfe to walke forth with the Muses; the fault proceeds from thy idlenesse, not from any want in my industrie. And to any that shall demand wherfore hauing promised this Poeme of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Iland so many yeeres, I now publish only this part of it; I plainly answere, that many times I had determined with my selfe, to haue left it off, and haue neglected my papers sometimes two yeeres together, finding the times since his Maiesties happy comming in, to fall so heauily vpon my distressed fortunes, after my zealous soule had labored so long in that, which with the general happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the kingdom, seem'd not then impossible somewhat also to haue aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me. But I instantly saw all my long nourisht hopes euen buried aliue before my face: so vncertaine (in this world) be the ends of our cleerest endeuors. And what euer is herein that tastes of a free spirit, I thankfully confesse it to proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the continuall bounty of my truly Noble friend Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi>; which hath
<pb facs="tcp:22429:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
giuen me the best of those howres, whose leasure hath effected this which I now publish. Sundry other Songs I haue also, though yet not so perfect that I dare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to publique censure; and the rest I determine to go forward with, God enabling me, may I find means to assist my endeuour. Now Reader, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderstanding of my Poeme, thou hast three especiall helps; First the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to direct thee still, where thou art, and through what Shires the Muse makes her iourney, and what she chiefly handles in the Song thereto belonging. Next, the Map, liuely delinearing to thee, euery Mountaine, Forrest, Riuer, and Valley; expressing in their sundry postures; their loues, delights, and naturall si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations. Then hast thou the Illustration of this learned Gentleman, my friend, to explaine euery hard matter of history, that, lying farre from the way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reading, may (without question) seem difficult vnto thee. Thus wishing thee thy hearts desire, and committing my Poeme to thy charitable censure, I take my leaue.</p>

            <l>From whom you would suppose this Ile first tooke the name,</l>

            <l>That <hi>Brute,</hi> on whom wee might our first beginning ground.</l>
            <l>To this Assertion, thus I faithfully reply;</l>
            <l>And as a friend to Truth, doe constantlie denie</l>
            <l>Antiquitie to them, as neerer to those times;</l>

            <l>Whereas, betwixt them two, might easely haue been seene</l>

            <l>The blood dropt softly downe, as if the wound had sense</l>

            <l>The <hi>Danes,</hi> a deadly blowe supposing it to bee,</l>
            <l>Sent such an ecchoing shoute that rent the troubled ayre.</l>

Their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are the Archbishop and the Abbot. Vpon an appointed day they meete all at</hi> Swanescomb, <hi>and harbouring themselues in the woods, with Boughes in euery mans hand, they incompasse his way. The next day, the Duke comming by</hi> Swanescomb, <hi>seemed to see with amazement, as it were a wood approching towards him, the</hi> Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish <hi>men at the sound of a Trumpet take themselues to Armes, when presently the Archbishop and Abbot were sent to the Duke and saluted him with these words: Behold, Sir Duke, the</hi> Kentish <hi>men come to meet you, willing to receiue you as their Liege Lord, vpon that condition, that they may for euer enioy their ancient Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Laws vsed among their ancestors; otherwise, presently offering warre; being readie rather to die, then vndergoe a yoake of Bondage, and loose their ancient Laws. The</hi> Norman <hi>in this narrow Pinch, not so willingly, as wisely granted the desire: and hostages giuen on both sides, the</hi> Kentish <hi>men direct the</hi> Normans <hi>to</hi> Rochester, <hi>and deliuer them the County and the Castle of</hi> Douer.
