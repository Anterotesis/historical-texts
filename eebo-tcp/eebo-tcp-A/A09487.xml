            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Some are drawne from generall Rules and Maximes, the which are vsually followed and obserued in the gouernment of Estates; and the others from Circumstances, which fall out in particular occurrents. For as we may not so relye vpon

the first that we not examine and exactly weigh the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities of a busines which may be obserued, be it in the Person which must assist; or in the causes, motiues, means, place, time, and other circumstances: So we must not tye our selues so confidently to these last, as wee desist from the first.

                  <p>THe Estate of many Lords, seemes to hold a meane betwixt a Principallity and a popular Estate,<note place="margin">Aduantages of a Seignoury.</note> being neither subiect to the tyranny of one alone, nor to the confusion of a multitude: And the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty being giuen to the wisest, many see more then one, and few resoluing better then a multitude; it seemes that this kind of Gouernment should be-most desired. And if rich men haue the Gouernment, there is no doubt, but the Estate wilbe better preserued: Hauing alwaies bin held profitable, that such as receiued most losse by the ruine of the Estate, should likewise haue the greatest share in the gouernment, as hauing the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest with them of the Estate.</p>
                  <p>Yet experience hath taught vs,<note place="margin">Disaduantages and inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of a Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noury.</note> that this forme is not more assured then a popular Estate, for where there shall be many gouernours, there will alwayes be diuersity of opinions; And euery one abounding in his owne Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (especially such as haue greatest authority) will finde out occasions of Disputes in their deliberations, and breed factions in the Estate. Their resolutions will be many times discouered, and being profitable to giue the gouernment to one more worthy, if in a Principality they are many times troubled to find one that is capeable, with more difficulty shall they picke out many, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1813:21"/>
may be capeable and worthy of this Command.</p>
                  <p>And if they will say that one may supply the defect of another, this would be difficult among equals; The voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being numbred and not weighed: And admit this might be done, yet it were not good for the Councell, which must consist of a greater number th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Likewise in a combustion and trouble, they haue found that the Command of one alone was necessary, and that it was very vnsafe in a time full of Iealousies, Difficulties, and Distrusts to impart the gouernment of affaires to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

                  </p>
                  <p>Besides all these inconueniences, a Seignoury as well as other formes of Estates, is not onely exposed to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but more to the Enterprises of a multitude, whom they must content or keepe them in awe by force. To content them without yeelding vnto them part of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, were very difficult, and it were impossible to admit them to offices, without danger to change the Seignoury into a popular Estate, as it happened at <hi>Rome.</hi> To retaine them by force, were no safe thing: and admit it might be done, yet the distrust they should haue of them, would be a cause that in the least warre attempted against stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they would make vse of this occasion, to take Armes and to shake off the yoake.</p>
                  <p>In this feare the Lords durst not traine vp their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Armes; and entertaining strangers to mannage the the warre, it is to be feared they will get credit among the people.

So as this kind of gouernment cannot safely vndertake a War, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of ruine. So whether for the diuision which may grow among them, or for the weakenesse of power diuided among many; or be it for the difficulty to agree and resolue; Or be it that the Subiects many times know not whom to obey; Or for that affaires which ought to be kept secret, are most commonly divulg'd: This kind of gouernment is none of the safest.</p>

And thus satisfying the Nobility with honours, the People with rest and commodities, inuring their Subiects to warre as little as may be, especially by Land; suppressing speedily all warre with strangers, and factions among themselues, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining a neutrality with Princes, not wedding any quarrels; and changing party as their interest change, thus they maintaine themselues.</p>

Among men that are equall and impatient of Rule, as your Sea-faring men be, and such as dwell in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Forrest, by reason of the austerity and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their manners and liuing, a popular Estate would be more proper then any other. <hi>Themistocles</hi> desiring to settle a popular Estate in <hi>Athens,</hi> aduanced Sea-faring men, and gaue authority to Marriners. <hi>Cato</hi> sayd that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> deserued to be free, for that they could not be restrained vnder the rule of him that would command them.</p>
                  <p>If there be an inequality, one part being richer then the other, and that wealth hath bred some dependance and respect of the meaner sort towards the great ones, a Seignoury and gouernment of few may be well establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed amongst such men.</p>
                  <p>If in this inequality there be a Diuision or Discord, some being vnwilling to yeeld to others; and that there be found some one that hath more power and credit, they must of necessity settle a principality.</p>
                  <p>After a Battaile lost, or some other disgrace happened, a people being amazed, finding no Councell in themselues,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1813:23"/>
they willingly referre the disposition of their affaires to him or them which promise to preserue them. So as in such an incounter it is easie in steed of a popular Estate to settle a Seignoury or a principallity.

                  <p>I will adde, that a fearefull and timerous people gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to their pleasures, little carefull and incapable of affaires, are better gouerned and more happily by a Prince, then by any other kind of gouernment. Where as contrarywise, a people that is rough, auaritious, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, and hardy, do vnwillingly yeild themselues vnder a principallity, if it be not very moderate, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together warlicke, in the which absolute commaunds are supported by force.</p>
                  <p>It may likewise be sayd, that a Principallity is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned better in a great Estate, consisting of persons of diuers qualities; and a small Estate is more fitting for a Seignoury or popular Gouernment: for that in a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, being necessary to trayne vp the Subiects to Armes to defend it, it fals out vsually, that he which is master of the Forces, makes himselfe likewise master of the Estate; as it hath hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AN vnlawfull Commaund is called Vsurpation, the which is eyther made by onealone, or by few men, or by the Faction of a multitude. That which is done by one alone, is eyther practized vpon a Prince, or vpon a Seignoury, or against a Popular Estate: And he which attempts is a Stranger or a Subiect. I will not lay open the manner of their proceedings, nor the meanes which an Vsurper should hold. It is too common a Science, and too much practized in these dayes, the which deserues rather to be forgotten then taught, for the miseries which it doth procure,<note place="margin">Of the miseries it doeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and the difficulties they encounter.</note> not only to the preiudice of those, whom they may ouermaster; but likewise to those which are thrust on to such interprizes. For if there be difficulty to prepare the affaires, and bring them to an end, there is no lesse to maintaine himselfe. And it is most certain, that there is more difficulty for a Prince which hath vsurped the liberty of another, to preserue him selfe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereas a multitude which hath recouered their liberty, hath no cause to feare the hatred of Subiects, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all receiue benefit by this Enterprize: And the enuy of Neighbours is sometimes pacified by the hatred they beare to him whom the people haue expelled in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his bad carriage.</p>

There are an infinite number of other difficulties proceeding from the new Command of a new Lord, with whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot so easily accommodate themselues.

                  <p>And it is necessary that in all these changes there should be Iniustice, and likewise violence: vnlesse the change were made as at <hi>Venice,</hi> the which in the beginning was gouerned by the people; and afterwards the gate being shut to those which had retired out of the City, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Offices of the Estate, vnto those which had them, afterwards they made an Estate of many Lords, without any iealousie or violence. The same happens vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in all popular Estates, which insensibly change into a Seignoury, when as they receiue Strangers, and impart no Offices vnto them.

                  <p>It hath happned sometimes, that the greatest part of the Lords hauing beene defeated in Battaile, the people haue changed the Seignoury into a popular Estate: as the <hi>Tarrentins</hi> did, after the Battaile which was giuen against the <hi>lapiges,</hi> in the which in a manner all the Nobility of <hi>Tarrnetum</hi> dyed.

But among the demonstrations of a holy life, nothing doth so much draw the people as austerity, to the which the Commons will hardly beleeue, that any man will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himselfe, for ambition, vanity, or lying.

Whereas on the other side, old men as well by reason of their naturall coldnesse, as of their experience, the which by the course of their life they haue gotten, to haue executed many things in vaine the which they could not bring to a good effect, they, more willingly imbrace the safest party, misfortune cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to bandy their spirits, and to open their eyes to discouer the danger.

A most necessary thing in a man that will giue Councell; a small circumstance of more or lesse, doth many times cause a great variation in affaires.

of whom it is composed are great. Others haue not this vigour or Spirit, but a naturall docillity to heare the aduice of others, and a iudgment to discerne good from Euill: And these, as they are inferiour to the first, so are they Superiour to the last; who not able to take aduice in their owne heads, and contemning the aduice of others, know not how to make choyse of the sounder party.</p>
                  <p>And although it seemes that the first haue not any need to seeke the counsell of another; yet aswell to free himselfe from presumption, as to giue the more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and credit vnto their Enterprizes, they must commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them; and confesse that Sufficiency is neuer so great in any one person, but that many may adde something vnto it. And although that this Sufficiency be very commendable, yet it is dangerous in a Prince, who easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fals into presumption; and it seemes that the docillity which is found in others, yeilding an Eare to Counsell, is the more safe. Yet if these bring not Iudgment to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne good from euill, this meane Sufficiency would be as dangerous, as if he referd himselfe wholy to the Counsell of others: which is an Instrument, whereof they haue somtimes made vse to ruine many Estates; for that where the Councell shall consist of incapable men, aswell as the Prince; a thing which vsually fals out, when as the Counsellors are chosen by him, for that euery man seekes his like; and we much acknowledge some Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to iudge of that of another man, to make the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and in this case the Estate is the sooner drawne to its ruine, when as the number of Counsellors is greatest.

                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1813:53"/>Afterwards the Prince must duly consider of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of that which they counsell him; for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell being of doubtfull things, he must aduise whether Fortune may haue a greater share, in that which he meanes to vndertake, then wisdome: and if he finds that he hath more need of Fortune, he must beware how he imbarque himselfe, especially if the contrary succeed to that which he desires, he incurres more losse, then he can hope for profit, succeeding after his desire.</p>
                  <p>But if necessity reduceth him to this poynt, that he must eyther loose or hazard; it were better to tempt Fortune, the which although it did not succeed, yet at the least he should haue this contentment, to haue done what lay in him. Otherwise, he may not lightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque himselfe in a dangerous Enterprize, although that at the first sight the perill be not so neere. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the danger that euery bad resolution carries with it, it drawes after it likewise to maintayne it, an infinite number of such like, for that things cannot remayne alone, but are bound one vnto another, and inchayned together.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we may not haue so much respect vnto the present, as we forget the future. For althoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> that the accidents of Fortune are in such variety, and so frequent, as they may hinder vs from a certayne fore-sight of the future: and that to haue regard to an imaginary feare of a thing which may be or not be, it seemes that this were to imbrace the shaddow, and to leaue the body or substance.</p>
                  <p>Yet the greatest part of Errours which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in deliberations proceeds from this, that men suffer themselues too much to be carried away with the affect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1813:53"/>
of the future. Wherefore he must shew himselfe very stayed in such affections, and as for the affection of the present, he may not forget the consideration of the future: but he must accustome himselfe to set that which is to come before his Eyes, with such a resentment and apprehension, as if he saw it or touch it. So he may not for a feare a farre off, forbeare to remedy a present mischiefe.</p>
                  <p>He may not likewise suffer himselfe to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by any Example that is alledged, if all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities do not concurre. For although that these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons may ioyne at some corner, and that all things hold by some similitude or likenesse: yet there are very few Examples which do not hault: And the relation which is drawne from Experience, is many times defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue and imperfect, if it be not assisted by discourse and Reason.</p>
                  <p>Then hee must examine the quality of the person which giues the aduice, especially his interest, and aboue all things he must refuse to counsell a flatterer, and inuite him that counsels, to speake freely and with courage.</p>
                  <p>If for the respect of the greatnesse of the Prince who is counselled, it be necessary to flatter him;<note place="margin">Of the flattery of Councellors and how the Prince should auoyd them.</note> the Prince shall consider, if the flattery of him that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels him, (who must sometimes vse, as they say, words of silke) proceeds from cunning and subtilty, which the Councellor doth vse to perswade him to that which is for his good; or with a designe to get credit by his pleasing, he enters into this flattery: For in this last case, the Prince must stoppe his Eares, and open them to him that speakes freely, there being no condition of men, that haue so great need of true and free aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements then Princes, who vndergo a publicke life, and are to satisfie and content the opinion of so many people, which as they are accustomed to do any thing

that may diuert them from their course, they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues insensibly ingaged in the hatred and detestation of their Subiects, for occasions many times which they might well auoyd, without any interest of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if they had beene aduised and directed in time.</p>
                  <p>But the manner whereby most Princes liue at this day, few men are found that will practise this Trade, being the office of true Friendship towards the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, in a rough and dangerous tryall; So as they must not onely haue much affection and freedome, but also courage. Flattery is far more safe; for that by pleasing, it seemes they draw nearer vnto Friendship: and for that it is more agreeable to him whom they flatter, it is also more easie for him to practise that meanes to flatter.</p>
                  <p>Contrariwise Truth and Liberty, as if they approached neare to contempt, cannot be so safely practised with a Prince.<note place="margin">Of the truth &amp; liberty which ought to be in Councellors.</note> They haue their circumscriptions and limits: and many times it falls out, that (as the World is) they leaue truth in the eares of Princes, not onely without fruite, but with preiudice to him that speakes it.</p>
                  <p>If then the Prince will assure himselfe on that side, he must encourage one or two of those which approach nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest vnto him, and whom he knowes to be best affected, and freest from contempt of him,<note place="margin">Of the prime Ministers of an estate.</note> to deliuer freely vnto him in what manner they receiue his actions; and he must choose such men of a meane fortune, and are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing satisfied and content, to the end that on the one side they may haue no feare to touch their Masters heart to the quicke; least they should thereby lose the course of their aduancement; and on the other side being of a meane condition, they may haue the more commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with all sorts of people. A Prince is not to be credited, when he brags of his courage, to attend the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of his Enemy, for the seruice of his glory; if for his profit &amp; aduancement he cannot endure the liberty of a friends words; hauing no other effect nor aime but to

                  <head>CHAP. 22. Of the forme of Commanding.</head>
                  <p>THe fourth establishment to bee made in an Estate, is the forme of Commanding, in the which wee must consider two things; the power of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and the iustice of the commandement. The power of him which commands is either soueraigne or inferiour.<note place="margin">Of the power.</note> The commandement of the soueraigne is, either generall, or particular: The generall consists in the lawes which the soueraigne establisheth, vnder which wee comprehend the ordinary orders, customes and statutes.</p>
                  <p>The law is as it were a pledge and a generall safetie, which Princes giue vnto their subiects,<note place="margin">Of the law.</note> for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement of contracts, and their course of liuing, which ought to be maintained and obserued, especially amongst them for the generall good of the Estate. For reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone which God hath put into man, being vnable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him within the bonds of his dutie, and custome to liue ill, hauing made so great an impression in him, as neither prayers nor admonitions are able to retire him; it hath beene needfull to imploy the authority of lawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the force of the Prince, to reduce euery man to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for feare of punishment, and by the Establishment of certaine rules, to a sure order in the Estate, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme iudgments in Iustice. In effect it were dangerous, to leaue all to the iudgment of men, in the multitude whereof will grow a confusion of opinions, if they had not some rule which they ought to follow, and they might more easily bee carried away by hatred or fauour: the which cannot happen to Law-giuers, who making
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1813:55"/>
Lawes for the future, are not transported with any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate passion but for the publique. For although that the Iudges were wise and without passion, yet it is more easie to finde a small number of wise men which establish the Lawes, and the for me o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iudging, then to finde such a number as is necessary to be Iudges. Moreouer, the Lawes are made with mature deliberation, and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are giuen suddainly according to the occurrents of affaires: so as the rule is more safe taken from the Law, then if the Prince gaue it himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The Lawes are of diuers sorts,<note place="margin">Diuersity of lawes.</note> according to the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Subiects, for the gouernment whereof they are made. For some rule the power of Offices and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, as well Ecclesiasticall as Ciuill; and distinguish the function of their Charges, their Iurisdiction, honour, and preheminence one vpon another. Others rule the Treasure; others the military Discipline; others the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Policy; others Iustice, as well in regard of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of persons, of contracts, treaties, and commerce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; as for the punishment of Crimes, the order and forme of proceeding in Iudgements by the parties and Iudges. Some are made to contayne the Subiect in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards the Prince and Magistrate, and to maintayne Concord and Peace. Finally, the Law must haue for his principall end the good of the Estate, and to prouide for all the parts thereof, and for the inconueniences that may annoy it, and not for any particular profit for him that hath made it:<note place="margin">The ayme and end of the law.</note> Otherwise the Reuerence which hath caused it to be receiued, would part and be separated f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e may iustly desire: for that the Lawes ought to be made and published, to amend and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the nature of things, for the which they meane to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1813:56"/>
them, and not to second the appetite of him that makes them: We must therefore consider in making of Lawes, the qualities which must concurre in a Law. The first is,<note place="margin">Qualities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in the establishing of lawes.</note> that it be according to publique honesty, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the dignity of persons and things: that it be iust as well for the end whereunto it ought to tend, which is the publique good onely, as for the authority of him that makes it, who in establishing it, ought not to exceed the power that is giuen him. There is another quality which concernes the forme, to the end that Equality and proportion may be kept, as in the imposition of Iudges: for otherwise it were not a Law, but a violence, to the which in conscience we are not bound to obey, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o auoyd scandall and sedition. It must likewise be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet according vnto Nature, and the condition of such as ought to obey, and are Subiects, grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on naturall reason, and accommodated to the quality of affaires, and the customes of the Countrey. For there are lawes which are good in one Country, but would not be so in another. The Lawes in like manner must be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the time, being necessary to gouerne the Estate, as a pilot doth his ship, according to the wind that blowes, and not lightly established. Moreouer, the Law must be profitable to all, or to the greatest part; plaine, least its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity breeds some errour; briefe, and according vnto some without preface, with the commandment onely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the law.</note>Yet others are of a contrary opinion. For although that the principall intention of the Law ought not to be to teach the reason for the which it is made, no more then the Physitian, who is not called by the sick Patient, to giue him a reason of his prescriptions, but to cure him, hauing more need of health then Doctrine: yet for that they make Lawes for men capable to vnderstand that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the publique good, the Prince ought (as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father) not onely to make knowne vnto his people the end of the Law, but also the reason, that he may know
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1813:56"/>

For although that the Lawes ought not to be against men, yet they are made to commaund men; and for that pleasure doth many times deceiue men, deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in things which are pernicious and hurtfull; the Prince in making a Law, must not haue any regard to the pleasure or displeasure which his Subiects may take: but it shall suffice him, that those things which he ordaynes or commaunds, may be good and profitable to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. Yet this is not to say, that he should not proceede in those courses which may breed a popular contentment; but contrariwise he must haue this principal obiect after the good of the Estate.

                     </gap>: then a testimony of confusion then good orders: For few Lawes suffice to entertayne good men in their Duties, and to punish the wicked if they be well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The number of Lawes proceeds commonly from two causes, the one is the ambition and vanity of, those which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, who to gaine the reputation of wel ruling,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1813:57"/>
will prouide for all, yea for matters of small moment. The which is a cause that being of this quallity, they are not obserued, and the people accustoming themselues not to obay Lawes of small importance, they afterward do easily dispence with themselues from doing that which Lawes of greater importance commaunds. Wherefore it is better to leaue the care of such great and weighty things to the Magistrate, who may prouide according to occurrents.</p>
                  <p>The other cause, from whence the multitude of Lawes do vsually proceed, is the bad inclination of the Prince, who hauing an intent to domineere ouer the Magistrates &amp; publick, in his particular appetites and affayres, makes what Lawes he can to offend in particular, eyther those whom he feares or such as he hates: or of that, from whence he thinkes he may draw some profit for his owne particular.</p>
                  <p>I come vnto the obseruation of Lawes, without the which, the establishment were fruitlesse. To this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation two things are necessary: the example of great men, and of those which commaund; and Seuerity. For as the Lawes prescribe vnto Subiects the rule of well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,<note place="margin">Of the obserua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of lawes.</note> so the Prince ought to giue an Example for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation and entertaynment of the Lawes: And the Prince is called the liuing Law of the Estate, not only for his intelligence and power to make a Law; but also for the obseruation of that, which they teach by way of commaundment, the Prince by his Example commaunds it. When I say the Example of the Prince, I speak not of his person alone, but of those of his trayne, of his neerest Fauourites, and of the greatest personages: For it would little auayle him to obserue the Lawes, if he suffer the great men of his Court to break them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must haue an Eye, for that the Subiects of a meane condition cannot receiue a greater contentment then to see the actions of great persons conformable to the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1813:57"/>
common rule, conceiuing an opinion thereby to haue some equality and participation with them, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them equall in this obedience.</p>
                  <p>As the example of the Prince serues to inuite men to doe well,<note place="margin">Of seuerity.</note> so seuerity retires and hinders those (whom impunity might abandon) from doing euill. This seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty notwithstanding doth not extend to search out and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the most secret offences; but those which may be the cause of bad example. Likewise it is certayne that the punishments or dayned by the Lawes, are more in regard of the scandall then for the Crime, whereof God is the principall reuenger, and not so much to punish the offence past, as to strike terrour into the wicked for the future, by the rigour of punishment, not to commit the like fault.

Paines, to search out and examine the merite of their principall subiects; they cannot dispose of Offices pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to their Natures and capacities. For besides that there is a difference,<note place="margin">That the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of them.</note> in regard of the vnderstanding betwixt affaires of importance, and those of lesse moment in the Execution: there must be more courage in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and lesse subtilty in the lesse: which are two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts which seldome ioyne together: no more then in Iron tooles, where we see that a knife for that it hath the edge finer, will doe an effect that a Hatchet cannot doe; and he that will imploy a Hatchet like vnto that of a knife, he shall make it vnprofitable to cut any hard sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, wherein they imploy it vsually: so as they must imploy euery toole to the vse for which it is made.</p>
                  <p>For although that affaires ought to be mannaged by discretion, and not by inclination: yet it behoues the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Prince, to know that most part of the affaires of this world are gouerned more by inclination then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. Wherefore he must cunningly make vse of this defect. For Nature hath giuen to euery mans condition some good thing in exchange of some defect which is found in him: if it hath giuen to some one a flownesse to begin, it hath likewise imparted an obstinacy to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and finish the worke, ballancing his negligence with pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These Defects being common among men, the Prince shall accommodate himselfe, and distribute the charges according to euery mans humour and inclination; and to treate a businesse, it shall suffice to informe him whom he meanes to imploy, of the grounds and substance of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and to leaue the rest to him to mannage according to his naturall inclination, be it graue, modest, seuere, or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1813:63"/>
otherwise: for that they may vse diuers meanes tending to the same end; and if it be forced, the businesse wil not succeed. But in making choyce, he must consider, that the humour and sufficiency may be proportionable to the businesse, and to the humour of those with whom he is to treate. The same must be obserued for all those whom they imploy in charges and publique affaires.</p>

For neuer allowing those orders which are made with a mature deliberation and their quicknesse of spirit, furnishing them with others, which in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions seeme better; they striue to purchase beleefe, and in this attempt they sometimes cause trouble.</p>
                  <p>They which are of a meane vnderstanding, support the accidents which happen more easily; and when as they finde themselues in an Estate well ordred, and gouerned by good lawes, they maintaine themselues long. Such men most commonly are inclined to Fleagme. And if by a breeding contrary to their nature, they haue not beene stirred vp to ambition, they obey more willingly then the rest; for that their humour being grosse, the impression which nature hath bred, is more firme, and the desires and appetites stronger.</p>

onely consider the vertues of Men, but also the vices and naturall defects, which they may haue; and to obserue if these defects be so powerfull, as they may hinder him in the exercise wherein they meane to imploy him. As for example, in a Iudge, there is no doubt but a iust Man for his Iustice ought to be chosen; but if hee be fearfull, assure your selfe, if hee be to giue sentence against some great man, he will leaue Iustice to adhere to safety. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer a Magistrate must loue and vnderstand the Lawes: For louing them hee will obserue them; and louing and vnderstanding them, hee will make others capable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them.</p>
                  <p>But to make the choyce of Officers easily,<note place="margin">An easy means to make a good choice.</note> the meanes would bee (as wee haue formerly said) to make many degrees, and to choose out of the last degree, him whom they meane to aduance to the next, and so from degree to degree: For they should know by their actions what they would bee before they make choice of them.</p>
                  <p>This shall suffice for the principall qualities of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Officers. Let vs now come to the forme of making them.</p>

                  <p>THey are made either by election or by lot,<note place="margin">Three kinds of creating and making Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</note> or by both together. The election or choice is referred to one alone who names and chooseth whom hee pleaseth, which is the ordinary manner in all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallities; or else it is referred to many; and is done either by voice, or in lifting vp the hand and voice;<note place="margin">By election.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1813:64"/>
Citizens, out of which they will choose some one to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in some charge; or vpon all those which are of the same age or the same condition, out of which they will likewise by Lot draw one or two to aduance them to some Office. The Lot and choyce concurres together di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly. For either they choose a certaine number by voices, out of which afterwards they desire to draw one to bee an Officer; or hauing drawne many by Lot, they giue them power to choose one amongst them,<note place="margin">By lot and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> which is held most capable.</p>
                  <p>In this difference it is to be obserued, that the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of those which are not chosen is the lesse, when the Lot proceeds the choyce, then when the choyce goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lot. Wherefore in places whereas hatred is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilliable, it were better to make vse of this last kind, then of the first.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now see what time Officers ought to remaine in the exercise of their charges. This is diuersly obserued. In some Estates they continue them during life: In others they are limmited to a certaine time.<note place="margin">The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers is either for life or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time.</note> In some for a yeere; in others for two; and in others, although they were continued in their places during life, yet being many in the same charge, they made them serue alternatiuely one after another.</p>
                  <p>They which haue beene of opinion to make Officers temporary,<note place="margin">Reasons and considerations to make Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers for a time.</note> and not to continue them during life, had for their principall consideration to abate the insolence and pride which a long command brought with it; as also to haue meanes to call Officers to an Accompt, hauing giuen ouer their charges, fearing they should not bee able to draw them so easily, being still in authority: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to preuent the impunity of those, which had transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their Offices. To make many pertakers of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, not onely to satisfie the ambitious, to cut off discont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but also to recompence many good men, &amp; to make more capable of affairs, &amp; to stir them vp to the care of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1813:64"/>
publique. Some also haue beene of this opinion, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the gouernment might not bee vsurped by few men, who would make the rest subiect: hauing beene of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten seene by many examples, that the continuance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand hath made vsurpations easie, not onely vpon popular estates, but also in principalities and seignouries; the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and charges for life hauing beene made hereditary and patrimonicall in many estates.</p>
                  <p>They which would perpetuate them,<note place="margin">Reasons and considerations to perpetuate Offices during life.</note> haue had other consideration: For that making the Magistrates Annall, or for a short time they leaue their Offices before they are informed of their duties; so as the Estate falls alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of vncapable men, and by these suddaine and frequent changes, most part of affaires remaine vndeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Warrs begunne left vnperfit, Suits and differences laid by, and punishments and executions delayed. There is another consideration, which is, that the time being short, the Merchants study to doe their businesse speedily: and this change brings nothing, but new starued hors-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which must be filled; whereas they which are already full by their offices, might giue more ease vnto the people.</p>
                  <p>And as from new seruants growes the enuie of Families, so from new Magistrates proceeds the fall of Estates, which bring new Councells, new designes, new Lawes, new Customes, new Edicts, new kinds of liuing, and new Iudgements. <hi>Tiberius</hi> to withdraw the greate men of <hi>Rome</hi> from the knowledge of publique affaires, and to assure those the more whom he imployed in Offices, hee continued them during life. Wherefore to auoid the greatest part of the inconueniences which are found in either party; you must consider the forme of the Estate, and the humour of the subiects.</p>

But in neyther of these Estates, the Gouernour and he which commands the Forces, are not linckt together, as the one would fauour the vsurpation of his Companion. For as the Gouernour would not allow of his vsurpation that commaunds the Forces, for that it cannot be done but against his authority:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1813:65"/>
so he cannot expect and assistance from him, fearing that hauing made this ouerture, and the other making shew to yeeld vnto it, being Master of the forces, the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Estate and gouernour being weakned by this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, he would chase him away, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Master of the gouernment.

                  <p>But forasmuch as the Prince ought to be Master,<note place="margin">That the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of principall Officers &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the safety of the Prince &amp; peace of the people.</note> and dispose freely of great places, it seemes that hee might giue them for a certayne time; and the affaires so requiring it, they might continue them to the same persons, if he thought it fit; if not hee might take them into his hands, and deliuer them to others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cause of discontentment to those from whom he had taken them. For this expresse limitation of time would worke two effects: The one that they which are aduanced to these places; entring into them, would resolue to leaue them: the other, that being certayne they must goe forth, they will neuer thinke
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1813:66"/>
to become Masters, and settle themselues: whereas the time not being limmited, euery one will striue to continue in his place, and there to build his designes; but also will desire to bring in after him some one of his Children or Kinsmen. And if the Prince desires to retire him, he must buy his place of him, or cause it to be bought by some other; which is to bring in a venality, more shamefull and dangerous in an Estate, then any other abuse that can bee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. We will therefore conclude, that this change in the gouernment of Prouinces, and the command of great Troupes or Companies, be it of Souldiers or others which haue great authority in the Estate, is necessary for the safety of the Soueraigne, and the peace of the Subiect.</p>
                  <p>But for that in doing this altogether, they which would desire to continue in their charges,<note place="margin">Prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this change.</note> might plot together and trouble the Estate, to maintayne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; he must change them one after another, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the time of their charges to expire at diuers termes.</p>

But if he that is made Gouernour bee so great, as they neede not feare this Iealousie, yet the Prince must make vse of this meanes, to auoyde the swelling authority which hee may get in the Prouince by his owne meanes, or by that

For this were to make the Prince subiect to his Officer, and to make the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the people depend more on the credit which the Officer hath, then of the Authority which the Prince ought to haue ouer his Subiects, who obey not the Prince, but so farre forth as it shall please the Officer; and the Officer losing his credit, the Prince shall be no more obeyed.</p>

Their Duty is considered in foure diuers Subiects: eyther towards the Lawes, or towards the Soueraignes Commandments;<note place="margin">Wherein the Duty of Offi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</note> or towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magistrates; or towards priuate persons. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of the Lawes we comprehend the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Customes, which oblige the generall.

                  <p>As for those which are already receiued, they must cause them to be strictly obserued, and restore the

                  <p>But for that the Lawes are not sufficient to gouerne an Estate, for that they ordayne onely in generall, the Law-giuer, or Prince being vnable to fore-see an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of particularities which happen in affaires: For this cause the Magistrate is established, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the particularities, and to accommodate the Law thereunto by a iust and vpright interpretation; the which is taken eyther from the words of the Law, or from the intention of him that made it, or by the induction or conclusion which may bee drawne from it.</p>

But if by reason of ambiguity, and the diuers significations of words, there be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, they must seeke the proper signification either from the common manner of speaking, or from that which was peculiar to him that drew the Law; if it did not plainely appeare, that the intention of the Law-giuer had beene wholy contrary to the proper signification of words.</p>
                  <p>If there bee found a double interpretation, taken from the propriety of words, and the common vse of speaking; they shall follow the mildest; and if the words bee obscure, they must haue recourse

to custome, and to that which is practised in that regard. But if the interpretation be notwithstanding doubtfull, they must follow that which shalbe most proper for the matter, to the which it must be referr'd. And if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this they cannot draw any interpretation suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the businesse, or to reason; he must cause it to be interpreted by those who haue made the Law; or cause a declaration to be made by the Soueraigne.

They restrayne the ordinances commonly, when as the reason which seeme to haue beene the cause of the ordinance, doth not extend but to certayne cases, and ceaseth in all the rest, in regard of certayne circumstances; for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Law fayling, the disposition can take no place.</p>
                  <p>But to seeke out the reason of the Law, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether it be exprest by the Law it selfe, or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Interpreters; and to draw from thence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of things whereof the Law speakes, or if it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne. For if it be exprest by the Law, eyther the Law is formall in the case that it is in question, and then without doubt the Law must be followed; Or if it be not altogether formall, you must consider whether there be not some contrary Circumstances which hinder the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Law, that it takes not place in the businesse that is in questi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the reason be gathered from Interpreters, you must see if they can yeeld no better: And then you must follow it, restrayning it; if it be particular, and extending it if it be generall. But if it be doubtfull, and ordaynes generally, you may not in this doubt in any sort restrayne the effect
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1813:68"/>
of the Law, vnlesse it be in things that are odious and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: And whereas the Law shall bee limited in certaine cases, they must not easily extend it to others vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of equitie, vnlesse there were an Identite of reasons, especially in things which concerne the rigour of the Law, whereas the case not exprest is held for omitted. But in such occurrents, they shall gouerne themselues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Law, to the which all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, if it may bee, must bee referred; to the end that in all the Lawes of the estate, vniformitie may bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and naturall equitie followed, whereby all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men should bee gouerned, and regulated.</p>

Thus allowing one of the contraries which haue no meane, wee may induce that the other is forbidden: And in like manner, if the Law forbids one thing to auoid a mischiefe which may follow; wee may induce that it likewise forbids all other things, which may breed the like mischiefe, although they be not exprest. And so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny consequences may bee drawne from the Lawes, and referred to diuers examples, whereof the reason would be easie to applie from one to another.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to recollect my selfe,<note place="margin">That wee must stand to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the law, and make no questions vpon equity.</note> and to explaine more at large what I haue said, as long as the Law is certaine, wee must stand firme to its authority, and make no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile distinctions vpon equitie: For that the Laws are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to be obserued in their termes and tenor, and not to bee disputed of: I say so farre foorth as it is plaine and not obscure.

                  <p>When as vse and examples faile, they shall choose the opinion which shall approach neerer to naturall equitie then to rigour; and that which shall bee more conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the intention of the Law, then that which shall be drawne from the subtile interpretation of words: And that which shall bee taken from the true Interpretation of words, then from similitudes and coniectures: For that all similitudes halt; and coniectures neuer conclude di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly: Or from that which shall bee receiued, or most conformable to that which the ancients haue held, for that we may not slightly leaue the opinion of the ancient.

For you cannot au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize by this name that which some, (ayming at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, or by the indulgence or conniuency of the Magistrate) haue sometimes done: For that a custome cannot take its beginning from a casuall or rash vse, but from an vse continued by a common obseruation.</p>
                  <p>The second point necessary to authorise a custome, is the reiteration of many the like acts; not so much to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a plurality of examples, as a consent of opinion, by the frequency of these acts; and by this consent two Acts suffice to confirme a custome.</p>
                  <p>The third and last thing required for the approbation of a custome, is the time of tenne yeares at the least; some hold thirty yeares that the consent in this manner of liuing should continue: And that Custome shalbe of the more authority when it is fortified by the longer prescription of time.</p>

The first haue power to command all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Officers, without exception; or only certaine

Officers subiect to their Iurisdiction. They which haue power to command all in generall without execution, ought not to be brought into the Estate, for the change that such a power might vsually cause. For there being but one degree to climbe, and to make themselues Masters, ambition doth teach it speedily; and euery man doth the more easily indure it, for that all men are accustomed to obey them.</p>
                  <p>The dutie of a Superiour or principall Magistrate is,<note place="margin">The dutie of a Superiour or principall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</note> to containe those that are vnder him in the termes and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their charges; of whom he may be Iudge, and not they of him in qualitie of a Magistrate; but as a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And as for the Soueraigne, although they may iudge in their owne cause, to whom God hath giuen power to dispose without Iudgment, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> saith; yet it is much more fitting for the Soueraigne,<note place="margin">That it is fiting for a Prince to indure the Iudgement of the Magistrate</note> to suffer the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Magistrates, then to make himselfe Iudge in his own cause; prouided alwayes that the businesse doth not concerne the Soueraignty, or his particular person; but to the end that Maiestie may not suffer diminution of its greatnesse, or that the splendor of a Royall Name may not dazell the eyes of the Iudges: It hath bin wisely aduised in some Estates, that the Soueraigne should not plead but by his procuratour, and would neuer assist in Person.</p>
                  <p>And as in the power of the Prince, the power of Magistrates is held in suspence; so in the presence of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Magistrates,<note place="margin">The power of a Lieutenant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to that of the Magistrate.</note> the power of Inferiors hath no effect.

Wherefore the Law of God forbids them to take pitty of the poore in Iudgement: But one of the things most requisite in a Magistrate, is to make the grauity of offence knowne, as well to make of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1813:74"/>
Men, reciprically owe him all obedience, in executing his charge, bee it right or wrong, so as he exceeds not the termes of his power or Iurisdiction: For then they may contradict his ordinances by appeale or opposition; and if he proceeds, he must make a distintion, whether the grieuance be irreparable or not. If it may be repaired, they shall not oppose by fact, but by course of law: but if it be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable, they may oppose by fact, yea with force; not to offend the Magistrate, but to defend the innocent.</p>
                  <p>As for iniuries which priuate men doe vnto Magistrates, it is certaine that the Magistrate being wronged hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Iudge in his owne cause;<note place="margin">Of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate wronged when and how hee may bee Iudge in his owne cause.</note> vnlesse it bee for some vnreuerence or iniury done vnto him publiquely, in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Office. For in this case it is lawfull for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate being wronged to punish such Men, for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence done vnto the particular person of the Magistrate. For this reason if a Body or Colledge of Iudges hath bin wronged, they may censure and condemne those which haue done the offence, not to reuenge the iniury done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but to the Estate, whose Maiesty is wronged by the contempt they haue made of them.</p>
                  <p>As for obedience, it seemes requisite,<note place="margin">Mildnesse and patience requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</note> that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate should carry himselfe to priuate persons with all mildnesse and patience; yet in such sort, as the dignitie of his place be not vilified; as it would be if he should indure any indiscreete words in his presence, and not take exception: Or a countenance of little respect.<note place="margin">Discretion and grauitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out passion.</note> But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as hee ought not to shew himselfe rough and difficult of excesse: So he must not grow familiar, laugh, or ieast with priuate men; but to speake little, with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, without making shew of any passion of choller, Enuie, Iealousie, or such like, which may diminish the opinion which they haue of him.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to collect in few words that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the duty of Magistrates,<note place="margin">The dutie of Magistrates.</note> they must learne to obey the Soueraigne, to bend vnder the power of their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,

                  <p>The prouision of armes and ships,<note place="margin">Prouision of Armes and Shipping.</note> is the first part of the force; some hold it the greatest treasure of a Prince; and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiue</hi> writes that <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedony</hi>

I know that many haue held, that in a great Estate, there might inconueniences happen by this great prouision of Armes; for that hee that hath a will to mutine, to arme those of his faction, and to depriue the Prince of the meanes to make vse of this prouision, will make a designe to sease vpon the place where it is kept. But by the same reason, wee must not draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether any treasure, to supply vs in an vnexpected ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; nor to fortifie any places, least that comming to loose our money and our places, our enemy should grow the stronger, and wee the weaker.</p>
                  <p>But Wisedome preuents these inconueniences, the which wee must imploy to keepe these aduantages, and to make vse of them before the enemy comes to seaze of them: And if hee doth seaze of them, wee may not therefore conclude, that the prouision ought not to haue beene made; but that it is his fault that hath made it, not to bee able to keepe it. It is certaine, that a Sword or a Knife would cut him that knowes not how to handleit, but wee may not therefore say, that wee must neither make Sword nor Knife.

                  <p>THe third part of the force of an Estate, consists in the warlike discipline, that is to say, in Souldiers of good experience and well disciplined. And herein wee must obserue that the force doth not alwayes consist in the number, but in the resolution of the Souldier, and in the experience or conduct of the Commander. In all the battells which haue bin giuen, it is obserued, that few men haue fought; and those few, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the resistance that was made, haue won or lost the battell; and as the kinds of armes make the Souldier stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or more feeble, so they haue demanded what force is

                  <p>Those Nations which haue made vse of Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men only, haue sometimes gotten great Victories; as the <hi>Partbyans</hi> haue done: But when they were to besiege or defend a place, they aduanced little.

Wherefore the Prince besides the prouision of Armes, and other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for War, must be carefull that the Cauallery may be well mounted, &amp; prouide that they may haue horses in his owne Countrey; for he cannot be termed strong and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull in horse, if he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strained to haue recourse in that regard to his neighbour, who in time of war may faile him.</p>
                  <p>I haue said formerly that the force did not consist in the number, but in the bounty and courage of the souldiers; yet
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1813:81"/>
for that they are not all borne such, wee must chooseas neare as we can, those which promise so much; and by Discipline make them such, and indeauour to instruct and trayne vp others.<note place="margin">Of the choise of Souldiers.</note> For the choyce many haue made a question, whether we should draw them out of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, holding that the Prince, which innures the Subiects to Warre, thrust himselfe into danger to receiue a Law from them, and haue held an opinion, that it was more safe to imploy Strangers. But there haue beene Princes which haue not imployed their Subiects indifferently, but onely the Nobility of the Country, as the Kings of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Persia:</hi> the which haue made them strong in Cauallery, but weake in Foote. Some others hauing a distrust and iealousie of the Nobility, would make no vse of their seruice; but to make head against them, haue armed and put forces into the hands of some of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people. The <hi>Turke</hi> hath put his forces into the hands of Subiects of the Countries which hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered; but this hath bin in making them <hi>Turkes</hi> by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For causing the Children of Christians to be taken in their younger yeares, and to be instructed time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> breeding them vp to toyle and labour, vntill that they come to an age fit to beare Armes, they continue as naturall <hi>Turkes,</hi> not knowing other Fathers then the Grand Seignour, who haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to be sed and brought vp; nor other Countrey then that, for the guard whereof they are entertayned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Wee must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Strangers as little as may be.</note>To decide this question, we must vnderstand that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Estate is weake which cannot subsist of it selfe, and whose force depends of another: And he that supports himselfe wholy vpon forraigne forces of a Soueraigne and independant, he makes himselfe as it were a Subiect and dependant of another; and exposeth his Estate, not onely to the inuasion of the Stranger of whom he depends, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often seene that most part of those which haue called Strangers to their Succours, haue beene a prey to those

which succourd them:) But also the stranger fayling him either for that he is troubled to defend himselfe, or for some other occasion, he remaines at the mercy of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, the stranger fights more for gaine and his owne priuate interest, then for any good will hee beares him. As gaine drawes him, the same gaine may diuert him, and draw him to the Enemy. The <hi>Celtiberians</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned first by the <hi>Romans,</hi> abandoned the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; and afterwards corrupted by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> left the <hi>Romans.</hi> Imploying none but Strangers, the Enemy not able to hinder the leuie, may slacke and stay it in the greatest necessity of the Prince: The which hath fallen out too often in <hi>Suisser-land,</hi> to the preiudice of <hi>France.</hi> And the Enemy inuading the Nation, from whence you draw your Souldiers, many times in your greatest neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, these Strangers are forced to abandon you, to goe and serue their Country; as the <hi>Grisons</hi> did, who were in the seruice of King <hi>Francis,</hi> when as <hi>Iean Iaques do Medices</hi> inuaded their Country. Finally, the treason the Mutiny, ruine, and as I haue sayd, the vsurpation of an Estate is more to be feared by the succours of Strangers, then we can expect any aduantage.</p>

But I doe not hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that we should altogether reiect Strangers: For they may serue with our owne Souldiers; whom by this means we shall spare, and vppon whom we may settle our chiefe force; and not as some Estates doe, cause them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe all the toyle, expose them to assaults, and to all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous exploits, and dispence with the Strangers.</p>

And for that a permutation cannot bee made without a certaine price set downe vpon Merchandizes, and that they cannot Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate with all sorts of people by exchange, but it is needfull to make vse of Money: The price and estimation thereof must bee certaine and firme; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they should bring a confusion into the Commerce.

The which may bee done, if they resolue to make vse of the mixture of mettalls, no farther then it is necessary for a remedy; gold and siluer suffizing to make all sorts of Coine.</p>
                  <p>For in regard of the Coine, if they will not diuide the marke of Siluer into eight thousand peeces, as they haue sometimes done in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> for the <hi>Angeuines,</hi> which <hi>Rene</hi> Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> and <hi>Lorraine</hi> caused to bee coined, whereof the two hundred were worth but sixe pence, and forty a souse of base French Money; they may reduce them to a third part thereof, to make the peeces more solide; which may bee stampt with a bodkin; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no vse of the Copper, whose price is vnequall and variable in all Countries, and moreouer is subiect to rust.</p>
                  <p>Contratiwise the price of gold &amp; siluer,<note place="margin">The prise of Gold &amp; Siluer in proportion one of another</note> hath changed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, &amp; they haue inmpt'vsually in proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as one or two, little more or little lesse; &amp; the marke of gold vallewed at twelue marks of siluer. <hi>Herodotus</hi> writes, that in his time a pound of gold was worth thirteene pound of siluer.

not say, but there hath beene some Ages and some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, in the which Gold hath beene dearer: But this hath not beene generall, nor of long continuance. Wherefore makeing the coynes of one Mettall, and of a certaine waight, greatnesse, thicknesse, and well coyned in the forme of a medaille that is cast; as the <hi>Grecians, Latins, Hebrewes, Persians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in old time did: It would be a hard thing to be deceiued.</p>

So as they which haue gotten a little wealth, retire themselues speedily, to imbrace an other vocation, to the which the people carry more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and honour, then to this.</p>
                  <p>In truth wee must confesse, that there are certaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires which should be left to the poore and common people,<note place="margin">Trading at Sea profitable and honourable.</note> to enrich them. But there are others which they only can execut that are rich; as that at Sea, which is the most profitable in an Estate, and to the which they should attribute more honour then they doe here: For i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in all Estates they haue thought it fitting to inuite the Subiects by honour to the most painfull and dangerous Actions, the which might be profitable to the publique; This being of that quality, they should propound and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more honors to those that shall deale in it. And if Nobility hath taken its foundation from the courage of Men, and from their valour; there is no vocation in the which there is so much required as in this. They are not only to encounter and striue amongst men, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times against the foure Elements together; which is the strongest proofe that can bee of the resolution of a Man. This hath beene the occasion, that some hath beene of opinion, that they should open this doore to Marchants to attaine to Nobility, so as the Father and the Sonne hath continued in the same trade; and to suffer Noblemen
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1813:89"/>
who are commonly the richest in an Estate, to practise themselues (without preiudice to their condition) in this commerce at Sea, which would be more honourable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, then to bee vsurers, or Banckers, as in <hi>Italy</hi>; or to impouerish themselues, in doing nothing but spend, and neuer gather. Hence will grow many aduantages both to the publike and priuate. To the publike,<note place="margin">Aduantages which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue if the Nobility gaue themselues to the Commerc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> at Sea.</note> For that they that should deale in the commerce, hauing meanes, courage, and sufficiencie for this conduct, it would bee farre greater, putting more Ships to Sea and better armed, whereof the Estate at need might might make vse for its safety, and would carry the reputation of their Nation farre. The which they cannot doe, who beeing poore, and hauing no stocke but from others, haue not the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to hazard themselues in a great enterprize. And for the particular, this commerce being wisely mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, what hazard soeuer they run, there is more to be gotten then lost: And if the Gentlemen apply themselues, without ruining themselues in expences, or importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Prince with demaunds, they shall doe more in one yeere at Sea, then in tenne at Court. It availes not to say, That a Gentleman will sooner turne Pyrate then Merchant. For holding that order which may be prescribed in their Imbarquing, they may so mingle them one with another, as it would bee a difficult thing that all should agree to commit a villany. Finally experience hath taught, and doth daily, that where the richest haue dealt in this Commerce, it hath enrich both them, and the Estate vnder which they liued: And at this day the examples of the <hi>Venetians, Portugalls, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> haue made it knowne vnto vs.</p>

                  <p>For the direction of this trade, and the interest of the Associats, they haue established in either of these Townes a certaine number of Administratours: At <hi>Amsterdam</hi> twenty, at <hi>Miadleburg</hi> twelue, and in either of the rest s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as a generall prohibition would be something preiudiciall to the publique; so the free and indifferent tolleration of this expence, is hurtfull not onely to the publique but to the particular. It ought to be allowed to a great man, and a rich Subiect, who hath few or no Children, to spare his Crowns, to imploy them in the Ornament of the publique. This cannot be termed Excesse. Neither would I hinder many Treasurers
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1813:92"/>
and partizans, who haue done their businesse with the publique, and profited largely, to make the like expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But if in stead of building of priuate houses, they will raise some publique Edifices, I would esteeme them the more: But yet I would desire to adde two restrictions; the one, that they should not build with any Materialls, but such as are found in the Estate where they liue: The other to forbid them guilding and enriching with Gold or Siluer, which ought not to be allowed, yea, rather in publique buildings, there being nothing that doth so much decay Gold and Siluer in an Estate, as the like workes.</p>
                  <p>As for the common and priuate buildings, they may without this great expence prouide in building for the ornament of the publique,<note place="margin">An order in the low Countries for buildings in Townes.</note> after the manner which they obserue in many Townes of <hi>Flanders</hi> and the Iowe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: where the order is such, that he which meanes to build, takes not onely the plot from those which are deputed to that end by the Magistrate, but also the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of the front, or face of the building, the which must answere vpon the streete: The beauty whereof consists more in a certayne proportion, then in any enriching ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of stuffe or workemanship: And it shalbe most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made according to the front of some neare house, of small charge, according to the which they shall rule them selues for the height and fashion of the Doores, and other exteriour parts.

                  <p>From this policy there redounds vnto them another aduantage, which is, that the workemen by the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of this order, being aduertised of the forme how they are to make the Doores and other parts which must answere vpon the Streete; they haue them ready long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: So as priuate men that will build, they haue

                  <p>That excesse which consists in a great traine of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, is excused vpon two considerations:<note place="margin">Excesse in a great traine.</note> The one which regards the commodity of those that will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the other vpon the feeding and imploying of many men, the which being poore, and hauing no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, would be forced to steale or to dye for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if they had not this retreate.

It is certayne that the deceitfull Merchant, who hath a designe to steale the goods of another by playing banquerout, will say, that it is not good they should know the course, traffique, and negotiations of Merchants, which consist many times in papers and credit; nor that they should discouer the secrets of Houses and Families. But he that is an honest man, and will be knowne for such, for a good husband, and not a deceiuer, will ground his credit vpon his Discretion, and not vpon the vncertainty of his affaires; and will alwayes take delight, they should know his estate and manner of liuing: And there is no man which doth not more willingly lend an eare to a poore man, who shall be knowne for an honest man, and a good husband, then to a rich, which shall be held for a bad husband, and of little faith.</p>

                  <p>THe ground of the Finances being found, we must order the mannaging, which consists in two principall points. The one concernes the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding of it, the other the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which are to be admitted to this mannaging. The husbanding hath two parts, that is to say, the order and gouerning of the expences, or if it exceeds the receipt, the cutting off part of the charges.</p>

The <hi>Venetians</hi> would not ioyne in League with Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt, hauing had ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, being ioyned in League with <hi>Sixtus</hi> and <hi>Innocent,</hi> for that Popes comming to dye, they leaue Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors which haue other intentions and designes.</p>
                  <p>But the commodity or discommodity of Estates neare or farre off, is very considerable, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of those which vnite themselues, as of those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom they make the League. And vpon this consideration all the Leagues which they haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in Christendome against the <hi>Turke,</hi> haue gone to smoake: The danger of the <hi>Turke</hi> being held by Christian Princes vncertayne and farre off, and regarding more the Estates of some, then of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Being vnable but with much time and labour to possesse their minds with this necessary ardor to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt against him.</p>
                  <p>By the like reason a League with the <hi>Turke</hi> is of small profit to a Christian Prince, who hath his Estate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from him, vnlesse it be for the trade of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; as well for the great distance, as for that the manner of liuing of the one differs so much from that of the other, as there can grow no confidence betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>But if some one seekes vnto vs to bee receiued into

our league, whom wee hold not fit for our designe; they may propound such hard conditions vnto him, as hee would lose his desire. In like sort, if we be sought vnto to enter, eyther wee excuse our selues vpon the feare of some Enemy, against whom we must reserue our forees; as the <hi>Venetians</hi> did for feare of the <hi>Turke,</hi> when as they were sought vnto by <hi>Charles</hi> the Eight, or else wee will demand conditions of such aduantage for our selues, as hee which seekes vnto vs may not yeeld vnto.</p>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1813:119"/>
they must in treating prouide for the safety and the decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of differences. Some haue assured themselues of the mutuall faith simply, the which at this day is but weake in many. Others haue demanded hostages: the which ought to be of such consideration, as the Prince or Estate which giues them, may not bee long depriued of them, without preiudice by their absence. King <hi>Francis</hi> the first, being freed from Prison, and after many inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties shewed him by <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, who let him goe not through courtesie, but for feare of the League of <hi>Italy</hi>; yeilded to giue his children in hostage, hoping hee might recouer them, either by accord, or by some other meanes, the delay of the recouery being the lesse troublesome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for that they were in their courage: And so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his choyce either to giue his children, or twelue of of his principall Men of his Realme, he desired rather to giue his children, whom he might spare, then the others, which were more necessary for his seruice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they demand hostages of eyther part, when as eyther of them that treates,<note place="margin">Of Hostages.</note> promiseth to put some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in execution, which they doubt they would not doe without hostages: And this ought to be done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the distrust they may haue one of another. But if the question be, that the one executes before the other, it is for him that is to execute last to giue hostages. There was a memorable dispute betwixt the Embassadours of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and those of King <hi>Francis</hi> the first, after his discharge from Prison, whether that the French King should retire his Army our of <hi>Italy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Emperour had deliuered him his children. They promised on the Kings behalfe to put hostages into the hands of the King of <hi>England,</hi> for the penalty which should be imposed for want of retiring his Army, after he had receiued his children: And the Emperour made the like offers, to restore his children, when the Army should
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1813:119"/>
be retired; and to giue Hostages for the sure payment of the penalty, which should be degreed for want of satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Saying that there was no colour hee should trust the King, who had once deciued him. Whereunto the French Embassadours replyed, that the more he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to haue beene deceiued, the lesse the King ought to trust him, for that this opinion might induce him to faile the King: And besides the offers were not alike; for that it imported the King more to haue his Children, then for the Emperour to see the retreate of the Kings Army out of <hi>Italy</hi>; and therefore the assurance were not alike.</p>
                  <p>It hath happened that without any precedent treaty,<note place="margin">Hostages for the assurance of a Princes passage, through ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers Estate,</note> then the demand of a passage, they haue willingly giuen hostages to a Prince, which desired to passe through the Estate of another Prince, which was an enemy or susp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Arch-Duke <hi>Phillip,</hi> to passe from <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Flaunders;</hi> the King sent him many of the greatest Men of his Kingdome, for hostages and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his passage through <hi>France,</hi> the which the Arch-Duke caused to be sent backe againe, as soone as he entred into the Realme. Many haue demanded strong places, to assure the victors. And others for the safety of a passage, for a conquest which they meant to make. As <hi>Charles</hi> the Eight did going to <hi>Naples,</hi> to many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Potentates of <hi>Italy.</hi> Others haue ratified the treaties by marriage.</p>

                  <p>LEt vs come to Treaties of Neutrality, the which seemes naturall to Princes, who neither loue nor hate anything absolutely; but gouerne themselues in their Friendships according to their interests. And in effect Reason of State is no other thing but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of interest.</p>
                  <p>Neutrality may be of two sorts.<note place="margin">Two sorts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of Neutrality.</note> The one with Alliance of eyther part: The other without Alliance, and without any tye to the one or the other; which is that, that may properly be called Neutrality. The first Rules subscribed by the conditions of the Treaty. The second hath no Rule, but the discretion of the neuter Prince, who must carry himselfe in such sort, as he may not make shew that he inclines more to one side then to another. And for that the Affaires of Princes are not alwayes in one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, the Difficulty is to know when the Prince should leaue this Neutrality, and when hee should maintayne it.</p>
                  <p>The aduantages of Neutrality are,<note place="margin">The aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality.</note> that he which is Neuter, is honoured and respected of both parties, for the feare that eyther of them hath, should declare himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: He remaines Arbitrator of others and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>aduantages of Neutrality.</note>The disaduantages are, that a Neuter satisfies neither the one nor the other; and so remaines: He doth neyther purchase Friends, nor free himselfe from any Enemies; and in the end is made a prey to the Victor. And many haue held it more aduantage to hazard himselfe to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish with a companion, then to remaine in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, where hee is assured to bee ruined by the one or the other.</p>

                        </gap>.</note>To resolue this point, a powerfull Prince hath no neede of Councell. For in what fashion soeuer he remains, he may maintayne himselfe, and prescribe a Law to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Yet I hold that without great occasion he should not declare himselfe. For that whilest others ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by Warre, he fortifies himselfe with meanes; he may in the end make himselfe Iudge of their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and compounding them mildely with honour, hee preserues their Friendship, and maintaynes their Estate.</p>
                  <p>But in a weake Prince, what part soeuer hee takes, it will be hurtfull vnto him; especially if he be in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of two more powerfull Estates then himselfe.<note place="margin">That a Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For although a Neutrality doth not please eyther party; yet in effect it wrongs no man; and as he which is a Neuter, doth not serue, so he doth not hurt. And then the euent of the declaration which he should make, rather for the one then the other, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon the vncertaine issue of the Warre, he should haue no cause to say, that this part is more safe then a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality. And to change his resolution without an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to better his affaires, were not to carry himselfe wisely.</p>

                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1813:123"/>But if the Neuter be prest by necessity to declare himselfe,<note place="margin">Considerations to leaue a Neutrallity.</note> he must doe it for the most powerfull of the two parties, following the Councell of that <hi>Romane</hi>; that eyther he must make himselfe the strongest, or bee a friend to the strongest: Vnlesse hee saw that ioyning to the weaker, hee might ballance the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the stronger, and by this counterpeze reduce them to reason. The safety of Estates consisting cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in an equall counterpeze of power in the one and the other, and the greatnesse of a Prince drawing after it the ruine of his Neighbours; it is wisedome to preuent.</p>
                  <p>But power is considered in this subiect diuersly: Eyther absolute or conditionall; Absolute power is that which wee measure by the concurrence of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Forces, Treasure: Munitions, and other Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary preparations. A conditionall power is that, the which although it be lesse then an absolut, yet it is more fit to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour vs, or to doe vs harme. In this the Neighbourhood is of very great consideration; for that a Neighbour Prince of meane forces, may more easily or sooner hurt or succour vs, then a great Prince which lies farre off. Neere succours are alwayes sooner ready and with lesse charge: For wee may discharge a part when as time and occasions shall serue: If he be remote, he arriues too late after the occasions to defend vs, and too soone to oppresse vs. The greatest part perish by the way; and when he is arriued he hath more need of rest then to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile; and being vnable to send them backe so farre, we must still beare the charge and oppression.</p>

An A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hath charge to represent the affaires onely: But an Embassadour ought to represent the greatnesse of his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and his affaires. Wherefore for sufficiency, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>nt ought to haue as much as the Embassadour: But for wealth and that which concernes shew, it is not so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for him as for the other.</p>
                  <p>Neyther the one nor the other, for that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the Body,<note place="margin">Qualities and perfections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in an Embassadour.</note> ought (if it may be) to haue any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, as to haue one eye, to be pore-blind, squint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey'd, lame, crooked-backe, or extreamely foule and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: But contrariwise hee must be of a pleasing En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and not counterfeit, left hee be ridiculous or contemned. He must not likewise be sickely nor dainty, lest the discommodity of the wayes, or the change of the Ayre make him vnprofitable for his Maisters affaires. His Countenance must be graue and serious, yet mingled with mildnesse and a pleasing aspect. For his Age, he must nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be too young, nor too old, as well for the force and disposition of the body, as for that of the mind. For the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1813:127"/>
conditions of Fortune, he ought to be chosen of an honest condition, and Noble if it may be: Princes holding themselues contemned, when they send Men of little worth vnto them; as <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleuenth did, who imployed his Barber to execute this charge.</p>
                  <p>As for the profession whereon he ought to be chosen, that depends of the quality of the affaires whereon hee is to treate, or of the Prince to whom he is sent. For if they treated of meanes to make Warre, it would be no more proper to send a Church-man or a Lawyer, then if they treated of some right of bounds, or made some conference of Religion, to send a man making profession of Armes. For his goods, an Embassadour ought to haue in a meane proportion. A poore or needy man how sufficient soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, is nothing fit for charges of expence and shewe. But of all things they must haue a care not to send a poore Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, after one that was rich, and who had made an excesse of expence; For the first hauing accustomed those of the Prouince to this expence and charge, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comming after, and not doing the like, he will bee much lesse honoured and respected; And by consequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s doe his Maister lesse seruice. He must not likewise be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastfull to the Prince to whom he is sent, but rather they must choose one that may be pleasing vnto him: Yet for all this he must not be a subject, nor dependant, nor tyed by oath, nor any other bond, to him with whom hee is to reside. The example of that which Duke <hi>Sforse</hi> did to the Esquire <hi>Merueilles</hi> teacheth vs, not to choose ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Subiect for this charge. For the sufficiency, he must haue a quicke apprehension and naturall Iudgment. He must be practised in the affaires of the world, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in those of his owne Countrey, and of that where he is Embassadour.</p>
                  <p>And for that the life of man is too short, to attend a fit experience for the sufficiency which is necessary: hee ought to be conuersant with all sorts of Histories, which
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1813:127"/>
hee ought to haue read with iudgment, waighing all the Circumstances of Actions which are there represented: To know the diuersity of the establishment of Estates, and the reasons, if it may bee, of this diuersity; to vnderstand the right of limits, and represailes, the genalogies of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the pretentions of Kings vpon the Estates of other men. Their forces, means, alliances, and manner of liuing, he must likewise be resolute &amp; couragious in that which he hath wisely de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>An Embassadour chosen with these qualities may serue worthily and profitably. Yet I will adde hereunto the manner, how some of our time haue held he should go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne himselfe, but more succinctly.<note place="margin">Instructions for an Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour, how to gouerne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> First hee must fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his Family with modest and respective Men, not inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, quarrellers, or scandalous: Otherwise he is in danger to receiue an affront, either in abandoning his seruants, or not being able to stay them from punishment. This done, hee must make an ample instruction, least hee bee disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowed, the which shall follow word by word, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in affaires whereas tearmes strike the stroake; not promising any more, although he knew he should not bedisauowed: But before the promise, he shall hold the businesse in suspence vntill he hath power. Moreouer hee shall instruct himselfe, from the Mouth of him which had gone before him in the said charge, and shall retire from him the Treaties, instructions, and papers of importance: And parting he shall giue to haue some one in the Princes Court, which may Negotiate his businesse, and giue him aduice of all that passeth; for many times the Secretaries of Estate are so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, as they haue not leisure to satisfie all.</p>

                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:1813:128"/>
If hee goes for some particular affaire, hee must stay as little as may be vpon the way, as well to preuent the aduice, which might be giuen of the particular sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of his Embassie; the answere whereof hee should find ready, hauing by his stay giuen them leisure, either to illude it, or to crosse it: As for that according to the quallitie of the businesse, hee might ariue so late, as they would mocke at him. As <hi>Tiberius</hi> did of the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours which ariued to condole the death of his Children se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The same reason requires, that they should demand audience as soone as they can, vnlesse he finds the Court in mourning, or in open Warre, or some other accident of importance which serues for an excuse. He shall from the beginning shew his grauitie, oftentation or pride in his Countenance or traine his courtesie and affability, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an honest carriage and modesty; hisexpence according to the places where hee is. The Northerne people desire a Table well garnished: <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> looke more to followers and attendants, and to that which serues for shew; In the Leuant the greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is in presents: But aboue all hee must regulate his expences according to his entertainement, and the meanes hee hath to spend. For it is vnseemely to liue of borrowing in a strange Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The manner of treating is also diuers. In <hi>Germany</hi> &amp; <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> they must haue more money then words, more good cheere there then Art: In other Estates honor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, and Orations, are better receiued; and in others the consideration of Religion hath more force.

In such occasions he must march himselfe discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and waigh his words: And the countenane in this doth sometime impart more then the thing it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Aboue all things hee must not treate with any other Prince, of that which concernes his Commission, but with him to whom he is sent. This was the answere of the Embassadours of <hi>Florence,</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millian,</hi> to whom they had beene sent, he hauing appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to conferre with the Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> who should giue them an answere for him: But they refused to doe it, as a thing exceeding their Commission. And although his instructions ought to be as ample as may be: Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires being subiect to change, in a shorter time, then there is betwixt his parting &amp; arriuall, the Embassadour must, as they say, make Warre by the eye: as if hee had beene commanded to vse mild words, and yet finds it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to speake boldly or to change, or omitt something mentioned in his Commission, he must gouerne himselfe with great circumspection.

                  <p>There are certaine things that are subiect to disauow; as proud &amp; insolent words, which an Embassadour might haue vsed; or threats and practises which he attempts in the Estate where he resides, if it be without command:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1813:129"/>
And therefore he must containe hinselfe, within the termes of his charge and the modestie that is required. It is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting he should maintaine the Dignity of his Mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in popular Estates, he must assist all dyets meetings and assemblies: Or if he sees that this may breed some contempt, hee should send some one of his. Besides money, which discouers the secrets of Princes, the entertainment of his Table is ofsome force. And although that all the intelligences which come from this sort of people which follow Tables, be not alwaies current; Yet sometimes he shall meete with good ones. Wherefore he must waigh them, and attend the progresse and issue before hee Iudge of them; and obserue not onely what is sayd, but what is done. He must for this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect write often, and to many parts, to the end he may be the better aduertised; and neuer respect the charge which cannot be better imployed.</p>
                  <p>He must visit the principall Councellors, the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Estate, and amongst others him, who hath the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of Forraigne affaires; he shall doe the like to those which are in credit and fauour with the Prince, although but of meane condition; applying himselfe in some sort to the custome, and manners of the Countrey, and how others haue done before him. Hee shall informe himselfe discreetly of the present Estate of the Court; and how euery Man stands in authority; wherein this authority consists, eyther in reputation and honour, or in effect and contention, euery one according to his rancke and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, winning vnto him if he may, the domestiques and fauorities of those which haue authority. Hauing newes from all parts, he shall still find occasions to discourse and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1813:129"/>
parley with the Princes and great men, with pleasing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, to be merry with them; or if they be otherwise, and concerne them, to condole, or to aduise them to preuent it.</p>
                  <p>He must visite the Embassadours and Agents of other Princes and Common-weales, which reside in the same Court; but soberly, lest he giue them occasion of iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie. Hee must be wary not to discouer himselfe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto them, whatsouer they be; but rather seeke to draw from them, then to leaue any thing of his owne, to the end he may alwayes be the first to send the aduice and pleasing newes. And if the affaires which he pursues, succeedes not according to his desire, hee shall make no shew of it, nor seeme to haue any distrust or bad o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Prince and others, with whom hee negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates. When he shall be intreated to doe them any cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, he shall study to value it at as high a rate as may be; yet he must doe it speedily and freely, letting them know, that he desires aboue all things to giue them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and satisfaction. He shall commend and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the persons, the meanes, the greatnesse, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the Lawes, the manner of liuing, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer concernes the Nation; yet with such modesty and discretion, as there may be no shew of flattery. He shall likewise extoll the affaires of his Master with the like modesty and dexterity, to the end they may not grow iealous of him. When he shall finde some stop in that which he desires to doe, hee shall not insist too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly vpon it, although he had an apparent reason: But he shall with dexterity approue the reasons in part, and by other meanes seeke to attaine his Designe. When it shall be needefull to doe or say any thing contrary to their will or liking, he shall excuse it in such sort, as they shall conceiue that it proceeds not from the Embassadour, but from such as command him, and that hee is sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And if he findes that by one meanes he cannot obtaine what he desires, hee shall leaue the businesse for a time, and referre it to some other occasion, which he shall finde they desire of him, or shall haue neede of something; and then with dexterity he shall renew his demand, and so perswade them with grace and mildnesse. When he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Intreating and contracting, he must cause the treaty to be set downe in plaine termes, not am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous nor captious, according to the termes and clauses of precedent treaties. It is certaine that refusing flatly, or making a business full of difficulties, they offend him whom they refuse: Therefore an Embassadour not able to grant that which they demand of him, he must eyther giue them other Counsell and direction, to attaine to that which they desire; or he shall testifie his good-will by other gracious effects, and honest speeches which may palliate the deniall. An honest man, (such as he ought to be that executes this charge,) must not be found a Lyer, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in matters of importance; for that there is nothing doth make him lose his credit more. He must therefore be wary not to deliuer doubtfull things for certaine, nor trust wholy to the word and report of others: But hee must alledge his Authour, or else say, that he had learned it from a good place, when he shall not dare to name the person. He shall doe the like for things which concerne
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1813:130"/>
his Master, the which he must deliuer on his behalfe. When they are such as there is no great certainty, or else may receiue a change, he must deliuer them with all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and stayednesse, lest he be reproached that they are circumuented by this meanes. And if it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that he could not well excuse a contrariety, yet he must couer and disguise it with some pretext, in regard of his Master by all meanes possible; and for himselfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, purging and iustifying himselfe, that he had neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intent to doe a bad office, nor to make a bad report, nor to be authour and instrument of deceit. The which must take place, when he is constrained either through the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of affaires, or by the commandement of his Master, to deliuer one thing for another. The which hee may not doe often, lest he lose all his credit. But it sometimes falls out, an Embassadour lies without thinking of it: For that when one Prince meanes to deceiue another, he first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues the Embassadour whom hee sends, to the end that deliuering that which he holds to be his Masters intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his reasons may be more forcible, assuring that which he speaks more boldly, hauing lesse intention and assurance of that which is dissembled. Wherein the Embassadour is not onely excusable, but worthy of pitty, in that they are distrustfull of him, and meane to make him carry the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to serue as an instrument of deceipt. Moreouer he must not rely too much on those with whom he nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates, neither yet wholly despaire for those things which happen; for that affaires change easily, and affections like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise according to occurrents: And many times that which seemed impossible at one time, growes easie afterwards; and so the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But one of the principall points whereof and Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour takes care, is to maintaine the ranke and dignitie of his Master, especially with the Embassadours of other Princes. For Princes doe not subsist, but by the greatnes and opinion they haue of them: It argues a conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt

                     </gap>: And if the Prince with whom he remaines, fauours him that makes the attempt, after that he hath made instance to be maintayned in his ranke, he ought to retire. And for this point, it is vsually obserued in many places among Embassadours, that they which come first, goe to visite those which came last, although that the first commer goe before them in ranke.</p>

The principall is, that by the Law of Nations, they are inuiolable, that is to say, in all freedome and safety: But it is in their Countrey to whom they are sent. For that if they passe through the Countrey of one that is Enemy to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, although allied to the Prince to whom they are sent, yet it would be necessary to take this pasport, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in that regard respected as an Embassadour, if he practiseth any thing against the Estate, or the Princes person with whom he resides: For hee cannot defend himselfe by the Law of Nations. And wee must not doubt but hauing violated his Faith first, wherein the Law of Nations doth chiefly consist, but the Prince neare whom he remaines, and against whom he hath attempted, may cause him to be punished. Yet for that it may be that the commandement to attempt, proceedes from the Master, and that punishing the Embassadour, it were to fall vpon the stone, and not on the Arme that cast it. Some Princes haue vsed it more discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, content<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Moreouer, if the Embassadour commits any priuate outrage against one of the Princes Subiects with whom he resides, vnlesse it be to defend the dignity of his charge,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1813:131"/>
or of his Master, many haue held him iustifiable before the Prince where he liues. For there is a great difference betwixt the Dignity and Authority of a Prince, in the Countrey of another Soueraigne. Hee may well retaine his Dignity, but not his Authority. But the most safe and the more seemely were before he doe reason to the party, to demand it from his Master, who in that case would not deny it him so soone as in matters of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and it is a meanes to free the Prince from slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Iniustice towards the Ministers of another Prince.</p>
                  <p>As for his Domestickes, there is no doubt but they may be punished if they doe ill. And if they or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hauing sayled, retire into the Embassadors house, he may be summoned to yeeld them, and to suffer Iustice to search his house: Otherwise after this deniall the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice may doe it, for that the house of an Embassadour ought not to serue for a retreat and Sanctuary to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Yet this search may not be done by simple S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in stead of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the Domestickes of an Embassadour, after they haue made their processe vnto condemnation, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Ciuill party to be satisfied, some haue pardoned them in his fauour whose Subiects they are, sending them backe with the processe. Or if there be no such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence betwixt the two Princes, as the one will not be beholding to his cópanion, they may procure some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ally vnder-hand, to make the demand: To whom the Prisoners being deliuered, he may send them to the Prince whose Subiects they are.</p>

                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:1813:132"/>Some Embassadours haue perswaded themselues, that they had all iurisdiction ouer their Domestickes, euen to put some to death.

For the Master that neither would nor could breake, would seeme offended at such a report, if the Estate of his affaires will not suffer him to demand satisfaction: And on the other side sometimes, in taking exception at an iniury, he seemes to confesse it. But if the Embassadour findes it more expedient to conceale the words spoken by the Prince with whom he resides; he shall let him know, how much his Master would hold himselfe wronged, if they were related vnto him: But that knowing the good which growes to both the Estates, by the Friendship in which the two Princes haue liued, he had rather therein fayle of his duty, in not making this report, then to be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1813:132"/>
of trouble, and breach for a word spoken in choller.</p>
                  <p>It is to no purpose to say, that in doing this, it were to shew himselfe wiser then his Master; or that he must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer all, and conceale nothing. For that which offends Princes, and inuites them to resentment, is not so much the offence in it selfe, as the opinion they haue, that the world knowes they haue beene wronged; and if they doe not seeke some reuenge, they should make a breach in their reputations, and inuite others to affront and contemne them. So as the wrong being not published and knowne to all Men, and the Embassadour making it knowne that for the good of peace, he would conceale it from his Master, it doth no way touch the reputation of the Prince, who otherwise being held to be couragious, they would alwayes beleeue, that if the report had beene made vnto him, he would not haue endured it without reuenge: There are many things which Princes are glad to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed; but those principally, for the which they cannot prouide, without greatly incommadating their affaires, these ought to be dissembled and concealed from them.</p>
                  <p>As for dispatches,<note place="margin">Of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches.</note> it is certaine that they seldome know what an Embassadour doth in his charge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, but by that which he writes. He must therefore shew himselfe by his dispatches, which must be graue, short, close couched, and mingled sometimes according to the Subiects, with passages of Sentences, yet seldome: And to be the more intelligible, some hold it fit that he should articulate euery priuate action apart, not troubling himselfe with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and bond of clauses in diuers affaires, and he must acknowledge in all his letters, the reception of those to the which he makes answer. If he enforced to write ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny letters vpon the same subiect, and to the same place, as it happens vsually, he shall doe well to diuersifie the terms and stile as much as may be, to the end they may not bee like vnto a Notaries Indenture, and that they which haue receiued the like letters, comming to conferre them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1813:133"/>
may not thinke that he hath intreated them equally; euery man esteeming of himselfe not onely better then he is, but also more then his companion.</p>
                  <p>He must haue a care not to write any thing to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for true, concerning those with whom hee negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, if he hath no testimony by Letters, or that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it from those in whom his master hath confidence, the which he ought to name: For that the change which may happen in a businesse, might cause a reproach and bad conceit of the minister, with his Master, either of lightnesse, or of little fore-sight. He shall be alwayes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed to doe more then to write, and to giue them good hope when he shall see day, before he giue them assurance and certainty of the businesse. As for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the Embassador, as we haue said before, besides the Secretary of Estate, who is to receiue his Dispatches, he must haue some one which may giue him aduice of that which passeth.

                  <head>CHAP. 2. Of the parts necessary for a Prince to purchase the Loue of the People.</head>
                  <p>BVt to treate in generall of the parts necessary for a Prince to purchase this good-will, wee will reduce them to three, Mildnesse, Bounty, and Iustice.</p>
                  <p>From Mildnesse growes the peace of the Estate, the fidellity of the Subiects, and the Establishment of affaires,<note place="margin">Effects of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in a Prince.</note> there being nothing that doth more force the people to honour their Lord, then the naturall mildnesse which he shewes, and practiseth to their good. Rygour makes him to be feared, and consequently not beloued, and this feare and cold Friendship lasts no longer, then the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of feare continues. But mildnesse gouerned with discretion, remaines in the heart, and produceth its effect, whilest that Men which haue receiued pleasure and profit liue. This mildnesse is practised by the Prince principally, in three points. The first, is to pardon offences, but not those of the Estate; and to pardon those, who being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered can hurt no more, and by vsing clemency vnto them, may get some reputation; but not to those who may mutine, and who by no meanes cannot be perswaded to submit themselues to reason: Mildnesse to such is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to all others. It is cruelty I say to pardon a wicked Man, if by the impunity which doth follow, we bee forced afterwards to dipp our hands deeper in blood.</p>
                  <p>It is a stupid bounty, and a simplicity without discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to pardon all, and to suffer all. The excesse of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, conuerts it selfe into a soft and effeminate nature: And if this bounty be not mingled with rigour, and facility
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1813:135"/>
with authority; it is meere carelesnesse blamable in a Prince, for that in suffering one fault, it soone drawes after it another. Clemency is comendable towards an Enemy deiected and humbled: But whilest hee wauers and stands in tearmes against vs; it is weakenesse, amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and feare, not to dare to resent it, hee must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vse mildnesse with discretion, yet in such sort, as they may alwayes find the Prince more inclined to mildnesse then seuerity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">To cherrish great Men.</note>The second point, when they discouer mildnesse, is cheifly to cherrish great Men, and the cheife of the Estate, and according to occasions, others: For that euery Man esteeming himselfe of more worth then he is, they grow easily discontented if they make no reckoning of them. The third point, by the which he which commands may testifie his mildnesse, is in shewing himselfe indulgent in things, wherein the people take delight; Prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that they fly excesse and disorder. For by this meanes they mollisie the sauagenesse of the Subiect, they diuert him from vndertaking; and make euery one more ioyfull in his vocation. Yet hee must not suffer himselfe to be carried away with this indulgence, as through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and the little care hee had to prouide for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; but with a designe and discretion restr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tiue in his time. For this effect he must also prouide, (as we will shewe hereafter) for the abundance of Victualls and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, to the end that he may thereby testifie the care he hath of his people, and by this care the affection he beares them. For if the people should fall into necessity, or into a dearth of Victualls, this mildnesse and indulgence would proue vnprofitable; and the Prince would loose much of the Loue of his Subiects: there being nothing that doth so much discontent them, as such discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; especially when it growes eyther through the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoles of the Prince, or the excesse of custome.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 3. Of the liberality of the Prince.</head>
                  <p>LIberallity is of two sorts,<note place="margin">Two sorts of liberality.</note> the one practised to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of priuate persons; and the other to the profit and aduantage of the Publique. The one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well husbanded, serues to purchase Loue to the Prince. For although hee cannot extend his bounty to all in particular, for that it would bee impossible his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes should suffice: Yet a liberall Prince is beloued of euery man; For that euery man hopes to taste of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to his degree, making him his Friend; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the facility of giuing ruines the Estate sooner, then too great sparing. But no Man enters into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how much sparing is necessary for a Prince, for the generall good of his Estate: For that the number of those is small which doth in particular to hinder that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs in generall to all. And yet as excesse is blameable in all actions, so it is most preiudiciall to the Estate in this: And we haue seene in our time,<note place="margin">The excesse of liberality in a Prince most hurtfull to the Estate.</note> that moderate giuing hath beene a weake meanes to purchase the Subiects loue to the Prince: For it reiects more then it gaines; and if it be imployed without respect of merit, it proues a shame to him that receiues it, and is receiued without grace.</p>
                  <p>The Subiects of a Prince excessiue in gifts, makes them excessiue in expences, and importune in demands. They gouerne themselues not according vnto reason but to cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome: That which is receiued is no more accounted of: They loue not liberality but for the future. Wherefore the more a Prince doth exhaust himselfe in giuing, the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1813:136"/>
pouerty exactions and hatred in like manner. For the number of those from whom he takes by exaction, being greater then the Friendship of those to whom he giues; the Prince is in danger not to command long. If then he be reduced to one of these extremities, it were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the Prince to bee poore and not hated of his Subiects, then to be hated and rich. For although that for a time he may force obedience, yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cannot be dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And although that he which spares, seemes in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shewe to doe good to few, yet not exacting from the Subiect hee doth good to all, whereas a prodigall Prince doth vsually good but to few.</p>
                  <p>We must therefore be carefull to vse this vertue well, thereby to purchase loue. For although that the gifts and benefits, be in some sort in the liberty and free-will of him that giues: yet it hath certaine distinctions and lawes which restraine it, and especially in that which concernes the Prince;<note place="margin">Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons necessary in liberality.</note> who being but a simple dispencer of the Publique Treasure, he ought not to imploy it without hope of some profit to the Publique. Wherefore hee must consider what he giues, to whom, and when. For it is not needfull to giue to all that demands; as if the demander and des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ruer were one and the same thing: Likewise betwixt those which haue deserued, he may not giue to all that begg, for it would be found that they which haue least deserued, haue tasted of his liberality, and not the rest.</p>
                  <p>And as the payment of a Bond ought to goe before li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality; otherwise it would be iniustice to giue, at the charges of those to whom we are indebted: So Merit must be recompenced, before we doe good to him that hath not deserued: And before Merits, seruices ought to march; and before seruices, debts and Bonds ought to be discharged. It is the Law of Iustice, not to doe wrong to one, to gratifie another, The which is very ill obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the most part of Princes, who therein follow the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1813:136"/>
nature of other Princes, which is, rather to doe that which proceeds from their owne will, then what is commanded them by Iustice, or that whereunto they are bound: For that in the first they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themselues Superiours, and in the second In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours; the recompence shewing the merit and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of him to whom it is giuen.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the benefit or liberality of the Prince, proceeds eyther from the acknowledgment of seruice,<note place="margin">Diuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Concerning the first two sorts of bounty, they are necessary, as well for the satisfaction of those which receiue them,<note place="margin">Of the liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is vsed for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of seruice and merit.</note> as for the contentment of the Generall, who by the example would bee inuited to conforme their actions to the good of the Estate. For the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a benefit is no lesse esteemed, then if the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality proceeded from a free will: For that the good and pleasure which they doe, proceedes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times from the abundance of wealth, and the great power which hee hath that giues, as well as from good-will: But acknowledgement cannot come but from the desire hee had to doe good, so as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to giue and doe good, be more to be desired, yet the content which they feele, is peraduenture more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable, as proceeding only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a francke &amp; free courage.</p>
                  <p>And it is that whereof among priuate persons wee haue experience, that the benefit which comes from a bond or debt, is more pleasing then that which comes vnto vs from the free-will of another: For that in this consists the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the giuer, who chargeth ys with a bond which binds vs; and which in some doth rather ingender hatred then Friendship; especially if the benefit exceeds all Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     </gap>r, besides the pleasure to receiue the benefit, we receiue content to see that we acknowledge the former good which we haue done them.</p>

                  <p>A Prince may easily iudge by himselfe what may be the deliberations of all others of his condition. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is the part and reason which preuailes, and makes the resolutions, bend to that side where it shewes it selfe: And therefore he must neither trust to Friendship, alliance, league, nor any other Bond, if there be no interest.</p>
                  <p>A Prince must oppose himselfe against a mischiefe in its breeding, and resolutely: For that disorders grow, and fortifie the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>selues in such manner with time, as they surpasse our forces. But when the mischiefe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the forces of the Prince, then he shall doe wel to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it, for that with time matters may change: &amp; he that hath time, as they say hath life. Hee may not consent t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He must not thinke in his resolutions to be able to auoide all inconueniences: For that cannot bee. There is no generation of things in this world, how good soeuer, but a corruption hath gone before it. But he must weigh the inconueniences, and choose the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein there are least, and most easie to preuent. He may not imbrace many Enterprizes at once: For hee that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1813:146"/>
imbraces too much, gripes not fast: But hee must assure his Estate before hee attempts a Warre of a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
                  <p>Hee may not quarrell with one more powerfull then himselfe, but dissemble the iniuries of the mighty, and the offences which cannot be punished. To yeeld som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to time, and rough encounters is Wisedome: And in a strong storme to strike faile, and to accommodate himselfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus the Prince shall increase the courage of his Men, and make himselfe fearefull to his Enemies: It being not Wisedome to commit himselfe to hazard and Fortune, for a light matter.</p>
                  <p>The Prince may not make any suddaine change, for that it cannot be done without violence; and violence doth seldome producean effect that is durable. Being ready for the execution of an Enterprize, he may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For that they which esteeme themselues capable of a greater matter, then that which is committed vnto them, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, and contemne it; and they which are vncapable, and cannot discharge the place, disgrace and are preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to those that imploy them.</p>
                  <p>If his Estate be great, to discharge himselfe of some hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, hee may entertaine a Warre with some of his Neighbours: Yet hee may not continue it so long, as hee shall make his Enemy too Warrelike: But shall make a peace with him, although he himselfe were the stronger. For by this meanes hee shall giue a Law to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and may preserue his aduantages, and then begin Warre with another: He shall make himselfe powerfull and fearefull to all, being still Armed, and hauing Men inured to Warre. This is the <hi>Turkes</hi> vse with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who hath setled himselfe in his conquests by this meanes: It being a great indiscretion in a Prince, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to make a peace, vntill hee can make no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. For then all the conditions are to his disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: And admit hee would not continue the Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some one of his Neighbours; Yet hee may not wholely relinquish Armes; for that a disarmed peace is weake.</p>
                  <p>But he must haue a speciall care not to attempt a War against his subiects; and if he be prest to it, let it bee with great aduantage, and end it speedily: For the more the Warre continues, the more his subiects are incensed and estranged from him; so as they can neither obey him, nor afterwards trust in their Prince. Wherefore he must not oppose himselfe directly against a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: For admit hee should preuaile (the which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1813:147"/>
vnto good Marriners, hee shall take aside wind, when as that in the Pope is contrary; and shall make shew to giue that, which hee cannot hinder nor take from them. But aboue all hee must bee warie in diuisions of his Estate, not to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Enterprizes wherein cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is necessary, must be performed with Celeritie, the which will giue vs the aduantage which wee want, and which wee cannot haue by our owne forces. Celeritie strikes suddainely; and against force if wee haue time, wee may fortifie our selues with that which is necessary to resist.</p>
                  <p>The one puts an Enemy in disorder, and the other breaks him: And it is more easy to disorder him and then breake him; then to breake those at the first charge, that are in order. Yet there are certaine enterprizes, in the which wee must vse time and patience, not rash violence; for that delay weakens with time and occasion; and it is more easie to weaken then quite ouerthrow a businesse, then to force it suddenly.</p>
                  <p>Aboue all things the Prince must study to know the oportunity of occasions, for his enterprizes and affayres; which is no other thing but an encounter of many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, which makes that easy which before see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med eifficult.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1813:152"/>
eyther by forraigne force and violence, or by the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and disorder that is with it; but more rarely by the first alone then by the last: And we haue seldeme seene any Estate ruined by forraigne force, which was not first corrupted within it.</p>
                  <p>Yet let vs speake something of the ordinary meanes, by the which wee may preuent a forraigne force.<note place="margin">A remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of strangers.</note> Eyther the Prince that is assailed by this force, is equall in power to him that assailes him, and in all meanes and necessary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages for his defence: Or else he is weaker either in meanes or for that hee hath not his forces ready to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. If hee be equall, he may fore-see his enemies des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe: And if hee hath any iust and tollerable pretext to make an offensiue Warre, he must not stand vpon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Among Princes which make Warre, he that layes the cloth (as the prouerbe sayes) payes the reckoning. For, besides that his countrey is ruined as welby his owne Army, as by that of his Enemies, the amazement is greater among his Subiects; And hee will not dare to hazard a Battaile, which would endanger his whole Fortune, for that loosing it, he shall not onely loose his men but also his Countrey: Whereas his Enemy may aduenture it with farre more aduantage, his Estate beiug secure, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer happens he can loose but men.</p>
                  <p>But if the Prince be weaker then his Enemy which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades him, he must procure him some greater Enemy, or many which may effect that which he cannot doe alone. He must likewise practise factions and diuisions with his Enemy, and get intelligence with some one of his prime Councellors or great Men, and with those that haue most authority and credit with his Enemy; to the end they may diswade him from this Warre, or diuert it, or make it vnprofitable, in slackning the executions, or giuing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his designes, to the end hee may oppose himselfe in time.</p>
                  <p>But if the practises be such, as they may breed a feare
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1813:153"/>
in his Enemy of a reuolt, Treason, Sedition, or a ciuill war; they will be much better and of greater force. Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue Leagues with his Neighbours, or with the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his Enemy, may be of great vse, who may grow iealous of his power. For the feare which his Enemy might haue, that inuading one, all the rest may goe to Armes, would retaine him.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, the Prince must keepe good guards vpon all the principall passages of his Estate, and place strong Garrissons in his Forts, who may stay the Enemy, and by a long siege cause him to loose much time, and many men; and by this meanes consume his prouisions, and waste his Army, whereby he may bee the better able to encounter him; And if he be able to raise an Army, he must choose a strong place at the entry of his Countrey, and lodge it in such sort, as he may bee neither forced to fight nor to dislodge, to the end he may hinder his Enemy from pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on. But hauing neither forces' nor forts vppon the passage of this quality; or the Enemies forces being such, as they are not to bee stayed by this meanes: Some in this case haue themselues wasted their owne Countrey, on that side where the Enemy was to enter, causing all to retire into the heart of the Estate, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him not onely of all prouision of Victualls, but also of other commodities, Mills, Ouens, Lodgings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployments, whereof an Army is seldome wholy furnished. The first against the <hi>Polonians,</hi> and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond against the <hi>Turkes</hi> forces, haue assured their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes for a time, in laying a great part of the confines waste. And the <hi>Muscouite</hi> being in a Countrey which doth abound in Wood, shut himselfe vp in a short time; So as <hi>Steuen</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> meaning to passe into <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couie,</hi> was forced to spend much time in cutting downe the Woods to make a passage for his Army.</p>
                  <p>And although that he which is assailed be the weaker, yet there hath beene some, which haue carried the Warre

Boniface,</hi> Earle of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>segus,</hi> did the like, in the yeare 822. to retire the <hi>Sarasins</hi> out of <hi>Sicily.</hi> The which succeeded the more happily, for that the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> the <hi>Affricans,</hi> who were the inuaders, hauing not fore-seene this policy, had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for their Countries. And it is a generall rule, that we must assaile an Enemy where he least suspects.</p>
                  <p>But if the Enemy be so powerfull, and hath such an aduantage ouer vs, as there is no meanes to resist him, rather then to lose all, it were better to yeeld something: And if he may be freed for ready money, in making as they say a Bridge of Gold to his Enemy, he shall escape good cheape. The which hath beene happily practised by the <hi>Florentins, Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Genois,</hi> or else he must seeke the protection of some Prince that is neare or farre off, yet so as he may be relieued in time, or the Enemies Estate annoy'd. So the <hi>Capouans</hi> finding themselues prest by the <hi>Samnites,</hi> put themselues vnder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Genois</hi> were sometimes protected by the <hi>French,</hi> and sometimes by the Dukes of <hi>Millan.</hi> Pope <hi>Iulio</hi> the second, made vse of another policy, to diuert the <hi>French</hi> from the Siege of <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> selling it to the Emperour, with hope after the Warre to redeeme it againe for money: So as the <hi>French</hi> hauing no will to breake with the Emperour, gaue ouer their Enterprize.</p>
                  <p>There haue beene some Princes, who finding no meanes to resist, haue made choice rather to yeeld to Fortune, and to abandon their Countrey, then to see it ruined; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that the affaires changing, their Subiects not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruined, would cal them back more willingly then if they had bin chased away by an open rebellion, or that growing

                  <p>But for that they seeke to surprize him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they meane to assai'e by force, and to attaine vnto it, they deuise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretexts to arme, to the end they may circumuent their Neighbour: And in like manner, when as two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull Neighbours make Warre together, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards come to conclude a Peace, eyther of them seekes to free himselfe of his Souldiers, at the cost of some one of his Neighbours: The Prince which shall finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to haue such bad Neighbours, must presently arme, and stand continually vppon his guard whilest his Neighboursare in Armes.</p>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1813:154"/>
The treason of Townes, strong places. or Armies: The Rebellion of Subiects against the Prince; and the Diuision into factions and parties. But for that these causes grow from a precedent corruption in the Estate, being but the effects of remote causes; we must seeke the mischiefe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off to prouide a Remedy. The causes which produce these effects,<note place="margin">Of the remote causes which ruine Estates.</note> proceede either from the defect of the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, or of the Magistrates, and others which haue the chiefe charges in the gouernment of the Estate; or through the defect of other Subiects, which are conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either in generall vnder the name of people, or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely by the reason of their subiection; Some being borne subiects to the Prince to whom they obey; others are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects by conquest, that is to say, borne vnder another Prince, but haue beene since conquered by him to whom they obey, or else they are considered according to their condition, quality, and power, which they haue to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Estate.</p>

vnusuall, and that in punishing diuers for one fact, there must be an equality of punishments obserued. But if by the death of one alone he may preserue the rest, he ought to doe it. And if there be many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for the defects which ingender the Subiects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Prince, there are diuers sorts.<note place="margin">Of the Princes defects which cause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note> Some grow from weaknesse of age; as Minority or a decrepit age.

                  <p>The principall remedy is, not to shewe himselfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all occasions, whereas these defects may bee more visible. <hi>Tyberius</hi> finding himselfe not so affab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe defects, abuses, and disorders of those which haue any charge and gouernment in the Estate, the which may further its ruine, are of two sorts.

And if it may be he must so worke vnderhand, as he may be required and solicited to prouide for it; besides that it will make his designe easie, all the honour will be due to him. And if there be any enuy, he may easily discharge himselfe vpon those which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him. But if the Prince doubting the euent of a necessary reformation, desires to make it rather by some one of his Ministers, then to ingage himselfe: In this case some haue aduised rather to take but one, to whom he may giue all authority, then many. For although it seemes more conuenient, that this reformation should be countenanced by many, to the end it might carry the greater waight, and be the better receiued: yet the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of opinions that is in many heads diuersly interessed, be it for themselues, or for their Friends and Kinsfolkes, in this reformation; the length there will bee in making them resolue; the difficulty in this plurality to make them keepe s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the preseruation of the order established, must be left to

                  <p>Peace and abundance, are the things which should giue a people the greatest subiect of content, and containe them, for that they cannot change this condition without impayring. But the one in the end makes them idle; and idlenesse being tedious vnto them, they imploy their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to thinke ill; and which is worse, to doe mischeife. The other makes them stately, proud, and vntractable; who like vnto pampered Iades, kicke many times at their Masters that haue fed them. But in danger and feare, they are tractable and easie to mannage, louing after their owne pleasure, and fearing at the discretion of another, and neuer iudging but by passion.

They vsually slander the actions of the Prince and his Gouernours, and complaine; Yet they are easie to reduce, when they see themselues forced to obey, and that they haue no head nor any seeds of diuision. They hope more then they ought, and indure lesse then they should. They attribute to want of will and iudgment, that which proceeds from the want of power and meanes.</p>
                  <p>They are desirous of innouations, and easie to moue vpon the first wind; Credulous, increasing reports and newes, and publishing vsually that which is most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; they follow the multitude, not knowing why; full of Enuy, Suspition, and distrust: ingratfull for the benefits they haue receiued, and reuengfull of iniuries, yea of another mans; little carefull of the Estate, and louing nothing but an vnrestrayned liberty, whereof they are soone weary: finally doing nothing by election, but all by hazard.</p>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:1813:161"/>
forced to put his Sonne to death, for some iealousie hee had conceiued of him; yet this is not ordinary. And the Kings entertaine themselues with their kinsmen, making much of them, and intreating them courteously, yet not trusting them with all their forces, which may giue them meanes to attempt, nor yet crushing nor disgracing them, to the end they may not dispaire: And by this honest and courteous course, they take from them both the meanes and desire to doe euill.</p>
                  <p>They which are great in meanes and Reuenewes, are the sinewes and strength of an Estate, whom they may not in any case ruine, as some Ministers of Tyranny haue conceiued, but they must bee preserued to maintaine the Estate. And those Estates where there bee not any, are exposed in Prey to the first losse of a Battaile: For that hauing no Man that hath credit to draw them againe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, being vnfurnished of support and councell, they presently resolue to yeild vpon the first amazement. The which hath beene often seene in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Contrariwise those Estates which haue beene powerfull in Nobility, although they haue beene often ouerthrowne, yet they haue easily recouered themselues. <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with those of <hi>Tartary</hi> and the <hi>Turkes,</hi> haue sometimes beene opprest and brought low: But by the meanes of the Nobility, who haue more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and conduct to maintaine the Estate then the people, they haue alwayes recouered themselues.</p>
                  <p>And to say that such kind of people may trouble the Prince, this may sometimes happen, if the Prince bee a Tyrant, which seekes to oppresse them, or wants coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell &amp; courag: As they whom the <hi>Carliens,</hi> and <hi>Capets,</hi> caused to retire from the gouernment of the Estate. But neuer an able and sufficient Prince, who knew how to make vse of Men of this condition, ran any bad fortune with them. The meanes to make profitable vse of them, is to countenance them with Maiestie, to doe for them in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1813:161"/>
occasions which may be offered; to imploy them neare his person with honour and magnificence, rather then to commit his forces and all his authority into their hands: And they which shall be suspected of lightnesse and inconstancy, to cause them to be accompanied by men which may watch and obserue their actions. This is the Councell (as they write) which the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift gaue vnto the deceased <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>An Iniury is of three sorts, for either it concerns life, honour or goodes; and they which haue beene thrust on through feare of their liues, haue most commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed in their enterprize: for the despaire wherein they are, makes them to hazard their liues more freely, to saue it by the losse of the Princes, who seekes to take away

theirs, running no worse fortune in this hazard then to loose that which could not otherwise preserue: and therefore a Prince should not reduce any man, be he great or small in that extremity.

                  <p>As for the ambition of great men and fauourites, it doth produce more conspiracies then iniuries, for that the weake although they haue receiued an iniury from the Prince, they cannot hurt him for want of comodity and support; But great men who haue both the one and the other, and ambition withall, which is sometimes no lesse violent then reuenge, giues them more meanes to preuaile in such designes: yet there are seldome such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, but when as the Prince hath suffred some one to grow to that power, that hee wants nothing but the Crowne.</p>

The second defect is, that many times the Executioners heart failes him, either by an amazement which seizeth on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing the Prince to looke on him, and to obserue his countenance; or his courage failes him and grows milde by the good countenance he shews him.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore many Princes suffering all men to approach neare vnto them, doe not forbeare to obserue such as are vnknowne vnto them: So as he which hath a will to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, is easily discouered in lifting vp his Armes, or in approaching too neare vnto him; and his constant looke would be sufficient to make him grow into distru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The third errour is the little discretion of him that attempts, as he that meant to kill <hi>Commodus,</hi> ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the Ampitheater; before he gaue the blow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cry out, behold what the Senate sends thee.

                  <p>The manner of passing before Princes, although it seemes to be practised onely for honour, yet it was bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to <hi>Pandolpho</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Syenna,</hi> against whom <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio Belanty,</hi> his Sonne in-lawe, had laid an ambush in his house, by the which <hi>Pandolph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The fourth Errour is a false imagination, or an accident not foreseene. They which had resolued to kill <hi>Caesar,</hi> seeing <hi>Popilius</hi> one of their companions to discourse long with him, they had a conceipt that he spake of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; which made them resolue to aduance their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, feareing that in staying longer they should bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the report of another, or by coniecture. Report pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from the little fidelity, or from the little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of those to whom the Treason is imparted. This little faith is vsually found among men: For such a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse cannot be communicated but to him that is a deare friend to the vndertaker, or to one that is discontented with the Prince, against whom they conspire. To find such a Friend that will willingly expose his life to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant danger, it is very difficult: And admit you finde him, yet you cannot be assured of his Courage, although you haue tryed him in other affaires.

For many times it may be done vnsitly: And instead of amazing the confederates which are not yet discouered, you shall thrust them on to effect their designe. Sometimes they shall incense and inuite others to make attempts, in stead of diuerting them by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the first. The Prince being aduertised of some Enterprize against his person, before he publish it or seeke to punish it, he must seeke to discouer it with all the particularities and circumstances, if it be possible, measuring the condition of the conspirators with his owne. If the Conspirators be strong, he must resolue vpon some other pretext to make himselfe the stronger; and in the meane time he must dissemble, bestowing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and gifts vpon the Conspirators, left that finding themselues discouered, they attempt not openly.</p>

So as hoping they should alwayes haue time to execute their designes, they deferr'd it.

Wherefore a Prince that wil haue time to discouer or punish a Treason, hee must cause the conspirators to haue an opinion to finde a more fit occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to execute their designes: And he must not be rash in such things, if the danger be not apparant in staying. For the punishment is made for two principall ends. The first is to free himselfe of such dangerous persons; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to terrife others by the example of punishment, from attempting the like. Whereas by haste the Prince not onely looses the fruits of the punishment; but also he hazards his person.</p>
                  <p>And although that punishments seeme necessary; yet if the subiect or the condition of the businesse be such, as mildnesse and clemency may bring more reputation and safety to the Prince, then the impunity of the danger, he shall doe well to shew it in such an action. <hi>Augustus</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>Cunia</hi> three times, and by the last assured his life more then he had done by the punishment of all others, whom he had caused to be executed for the like attempts.

And it is of no force to say, that if they which are to depend not wholy vpon him that is to command them, he cannot answere for that which they giue him incharge. For if the Prince trusts him, hee must likewise trust; and watching ouer the forces, aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him if they doe not as they ought, and doe not obey that which is commanded them according to the duty of his charge.</p>
                  <p>Some in like manner (as I haue formerly sayd) haue

                  <p>COnspiracies and Treasons are most commonly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and hidden, and are plotted by few men, the which makes them more difficult to discouer, and more easie to punish. Contrariwise Rebellions and Factions are made more openly; but as they cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted without great numbers, so they are with more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty pacified and punished; and doe more vsually draw after them the ruine of the Estate then the former. But to know how a Prince ought to gouerne himselfe in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, he must consider whether he be stronger or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then the Rebells; and he must hold himselfe the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, although they were equall in forces; for that he may not hazard his authority vpon a doubtfull euent, as it is

ordinary among equals. If hee bee the stronger, hee must preuent it in the beginning speedily and secretly; cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Heads and chiefe Commanders, before they know they are taken; and then present himselfe with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to suppresse it, to the end he may amaze the Rebels: And if he be farre from the place where the Rebellion is made, he must approach; as the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift did, who passed from <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the rebellion of the <hi>Gantois,</hi> the which succeeded happily. For to abandon the place where the Rebellion begins, or to retire farre from it is held a feare, the which blemish and impaire the credit &amp; authority of the Prince, and encourage the heads of the party, and makes the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more bold and insolent. But if he findes not himselfe the stronger, and to haue some great aduantage; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out retiring himselfe too farre from the place where the Rebellion is made, he must make shew to haue a will to yeeld to that which the people desire of him, to giue them time to grow cold; especially if they haue no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of credit and authority.</p>

And yet in such occurrents he may so carry himselfe, and vse such dexterity, that accommodating

himselfe mildly to the peoples inclination, he shall seeme to grant that willingly which they extort from him by force; being necessary that the Prince to maintaine his authority, make shewe to will and desire that which hee cannot hinder, and so to apply his will to his power. And to the end he may make it knowne that it is a thing which he desires, he must seeke to draw some apparant aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for his greatnesse: There being few actions in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, from which the Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperours although they be powerfull, haue beene many times constrayned to yeeld some of their Ministers to the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> to be put to death: The which a well aduised Prince should neuer doe, if his Ministers had not otherwise highly offended; but seeing himselfe reduced to this extremity, he should giue them meanes to escape, yet dissembling that it is with his consent. For besides that it were a cruell Iniustice, to deliuer an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man into the hands of a furious multitude, the shame will redowne vpon him, with a disdaine, and a distrust of all others, whom hee should call to serue him, who will rather gouerne themselues, according to the will of those which had credit with the people, then to his desire. But if the Ministers are found to haue carried themselues ill, the Prince may take this occasion to cause them to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by Iustice, to pacifie a popular mutinie: Although it were more discreetly done to preuent it, then to stay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee were vrged to doe that by force, which for his owne good he should haue formerly done.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 19. Of Factions and of the meanes to hinder the effects.</head>
                  <p>THere remaineth now to speake of Factions, for the last and most ordinary causes for the ruine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states. They are seldome framed among the people, vnlesse great men be of the party: For they grow eyther from the priuate quarrells of great men, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque the people on their sides; or from the subiect of some reformation; or for the gouernment of publique affaires. If they grow from particular quarells, the Prince must speedily force them to referre the cause to his Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or to Arbitrators, without making shewe to fauour the one more then the other. This was that which King <hi>Francis</hi> the first did, in the suit depending betwixt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Lonyse</hi> his Mother and <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who reuolted vpon this subiect.</p>
                  <p>But if the controuersie cannot be reconciled, for that the proofes faile on the one side, although that by strong presumptions, the fact be in some sort apparent; or if it concernes the honour of one of the parties in the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the business: the Prince must separate them, imploying them out of his Estate in some honourable charges, the one farre from the other; And hee must Entertayne them thus diuided, vntill that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their credit bee diminished with the people, or that time hath made them forget, or at the least tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per their hatred. If (as it happens often) to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate quarrells of great Men, they adde some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique pretext, as of reformation, Liberty or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: The Prince not able to hinder the course of these factions, hee must ioyne with the stronger to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:1813:174"/>
ruine the weaker: Wherein hauing once preuailed, he must free himselfe by diuers meanes (yet lawfull) of the cheife Commanders with whom hee had ioyned, eyther imploying them out of the Estate, or causing them to bee punished for their priuate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
                  <p>But if the Prince comes not in time to ruine the one nor the other, for that they are equall, and that his Counterpease cannot waigh downe the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; hee must attend, that by the Euent of some misfortune to the one, they may find the weaknesse of that side, to ruine him wholy. Yet if in this case the heads of the Factions, and not the Prince, bee to reape the Honour and fruits of the Victory of one of the two partyes; the Prince shall doe more wisely to ballance the one with the other, and to make himselfe rather an Arbitrator or a Iudge of their pretentions, then a party: For that hee should make himselfe to those, against whom hee should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himselfe: and should not thereby gayne any Authority or credit amongst those, whose party hee should imbrace, into the which hee should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the partizans, but to countenance their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, and not for any affection they beare him, hauing already ingaged themselues to him, who had first aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his standard, and had presented himselfe vnto them to bee their Leader, and to assist them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes; And they will attribute to the credit of their Commander, that which the Prince should afterwards doe for them.</p>
                  <p>The principall Remedy must bee vsed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: For that when as the parties are once fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the Prince must rather study how hee may liue in this corruption of State, then to thinke of the meanes how to take it away. For if eyther of the parties haue an aduantage, hee will not abandon his Armes, vntill
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1813:175"/>
he haue ruined his opposite: wherein the Prince shall haue a double losse; the one is he shall lose a great part of his Subiects; the other is, that the head of the faction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortified with credit, he may cause him to lose the rest, and vsurpe his Estate. But if both parties be equall, they will containe themselues through the feare they haue one of another. And the Prince hath no other remedy, then to breed a iealousie and distrust among the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of one and the same party, making many equall in in honour and dignity, to the end they may not agree to obey any other Head then the Prince; or aduancing some of those which obey the Heads of parties, to greater dignities then their Generals, to the end they may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to obey them. This must be practised with such as haue many followers.</p>

                  <p>We will therefore conclude, that in euery Election the first consideration must be, to labour for the exclusion of Competitors; being certaine that many will sooner agree for the exclusion of one, then they will for the Election of another; and yet ingaging them by this meanes to offend the Competitors, you bind them to thinke no more of them.

                  <p>BVt the most ordinary meanes to enlarge an Estate, is by Conquest: And to attaine vnto it you must know how to attempt it, to make warre and to auoide it.<note place="margin">Of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of Warre.</note> For the Enterprize of warre, you must fly two things: Iniustice and rashnesse. To the end the Warre may bee iust, he that vndertakes it must be a Soueraigne, and the cause and end must be iust. The iust causes to make War are our owne defence, and that of our Friends:<note place="margin">The iust causes of a Warre.</note> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of our iniuries and theirs: The iust pretentions we may haue to an Estate, and our Diuines adde not only the defence of our Religion, but its aduancement and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by the way of Armes, and some the extirpation and rooting out of a contrary: But others hold that Warre is a bad meanes to plant piety.</p>

                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:1813:182"/>
As for rashnesse he must likewise auoide it: and for this effect before he resolue to warre,<note place="margin">A Warre must be vndertaken with discretion, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ashly.</note> he must see eyther some apparent profit, or that he is forced by some great necessity, but aboue all things before he vndertakes it, he must assure his Estate both within and without. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in giuing contentment to his subiects, iustifying his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Armes, and making them to allow of it, to the end that if neede be, they may assist him: without in renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Leagues with such as may assist vs, or annoy our Enemies, or with those that may succour them, diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them from their Friendship. They must also resolue, whether is most profitable, either to make warre by Sea, or by Land, or by both, and in what place. Wherein although there be no generall Rule, yet it would be of great aduantage to strike rather at the head, then at the armes or legges; and at the place where the Head of the State remaines, then at any part more remote. As likewise he must consider the place where the Enemy feares most to be inuaded. The which the <hi>French</hi> vnto this day, (in the Warres which they haue had with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) haue little obserued. For by many examples it may be verified, that the thing which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue feared most, was left the <hi>French</hi> should inuade him by <hi>Spaine.</hi> King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> although he were inuaded by the County of <hi>Rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the same Author writes, that the said King hauing taken <hi>Nauarre,</hi> more by the amazement which the <hi>English</hi> forces gaue, then by his owne, he would proceede no farther; holding it no discretion to begin a Warre on the other side of the Mountaines with the <hi>French</hi> King, least hee should remaine in the subiection of the people and great men of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who being armed within the Countrey, might haue sought to aduance their owne Estate: And therefore
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:1813:182"/>
seeing the forces of <hi>France</hi> turne towards <hi>Italy,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ee dismist his Army which was vpon the frontier of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> without inuading <hi>France</hi> as hee had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to his Colleagues, being vnited for the defence of <hi>Italy</hi> against King <hi>Francis</hi> the first.</p>
                  <p>It serues for no purpose to pretend to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the bad successe of the voyages of <hi>Perpignean</hi> and <hi>Nauarre</hi> by the <hi>French</hi>: For in effect there is no History which doth not attribute that misfortune to the want of fore-sight and negligence of our Kings, and to the bad conduct of their Ministers: For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit they should not finde victuals sufficient in <hi>Spaine</hi> to entertaine their Army, yet <hi>France</hi> which ioynes to this Frontier, is not so needy, nor so farre off, but by Sea or Land they might be easily relieued, and <hi>Spaine</hi> on that side being more barren, it is certaine that the want will be greater for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> then for the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to returne to generall considerations, they must fore-see and prouide for all the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may happen in such an Enterprize, waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exactly, and comparing our forces with those of the Enemy. And for that a Prince doth seldome conquer by force onely, hee must obserue if there be in the Estate which he meanes to inuade, any of those defects which is sayd might serue for the ruine of Estates, to the end he may make vse of them.</p>

                  <p>But the consideration a Prince ought to haue in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, is that hee make his profit of it; it many times falling out, that if an Estate newly conquered, be not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned with great discretion and Iudgment, it doth rather weaken, then make the new conquerour more powerfull, especially if this encrease, ministers matter of iealousie to the Neighbour Princes: For thence grow many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes and Leagues against him. Thus drawing into consideration the aduantages of a conquest, he must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise haue a care of the meanes to maintaine and preserue it, whereof we haue formerly spoken.</p>
