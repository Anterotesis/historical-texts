            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Lord Del—r's Speech.</head>
            <p>THE occaſion of this, is to give you my Thoughts upon the preſent juncture, which concerns not only you, but every Proteſtant, and Free-born man of <hi>England,</hi> I am confident, that wiſhes well to the Proteſtant Religion and his Country; and I am perſwaded, that every man of you thinks both in danger, and now to lye at ſtake. I am alſo perſwaded, that every man of you will rejoyce to ſee Religion and Property ſettled; if ſo, then I am not miſtaken in my Conjectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you. Can you ever hope for a better occaſion to root out POPERY and SLAVERY, than by joyning with the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> whoſe Propoſals contain and ſpeak the deſires of every man that loves his Religion and Liberty? And in ſaying this, I will invite you to nothing but what I will do my ſelf; and I will not deſire any of you to go any further than I will move my ſelf; neither will I put you upon any danger where I will not take ſhare in it. I propoſe this to you, not as you are my Tenants, but as my Friends, and as you are <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> No man can love fighting for its own ſake, nor find any Pleaſure in Danger. And you may imagine, I would be very glad to ſpend the reſt of my days in Peace, I having had ſo great a ſhare in Troubles; but I ſee all lyes at ſtake, I am to chooſe whether I will be a <hi>Slave</hi> and a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and a <hi>Freeman,</hi> and therefore the Caſe being thus, I ſhall think my ſelf falſe to my Country, if I ſit ſtill at this time. I am of Opinion, that when the Nation is deliver'd, it muſt be by force or by miracle; it would be too great a preſumption to expect the latter, and therefore our Deliverance muſt be by force, and I hope this is the time for it; a price is now put into our hands, and if it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry for want of Aſſiſtance, our blood is upon our own heads; and he that is paſſive at this time, may very well expect that God will mock when the fear of Afflictions comes upon him, which he thought to avoid by being indifferent. If the K. prevails, farewel Liberty of Conſcience, which has hitherto been allowed, not for the ſake of the Proteſtants, but in order to ſettle Popery. You may ſee what to expect if he get the better; and he hath lately given you, of this Town, a taſte of the Method whereby he will maintain his Army. And you may ſee of what ſort of people he intends his Army to conſiſt, and if you have not a mind to ſerve ſuch Maſters, then ſtand not by and ſee your Country-men periſh, when they are endeavouring to defend you. I promiſe this on my Word and Honour, to every Tenant that goes along with me, That if he fall, I will make his Leaſe as good to his Family, as it was when he went from home. The thing then which I deſire, and your Country does expect from you, is this, That every Man that hath a tollerable Horſe, or can procure one, will meet me on <hi>Boden</hi>-Downs, to morrow, where I Randezvouze: But if any of you is rendred unable by reaſon of Age, or any other juſt Excuſe, then that he would mount a fitter Perſon, and put five Pounds in his Pocket. Thoſe that have not, nor cannot procure Horſe, let them ſtay at home, and aſſiſt with their Purſes, and ſend it to me with a particular of every mans Contribution. I impoſe on no man, but let him lay his hand on his Heart, and conſider what he is willing to give to recover his Religion and Liberty; and to ſuch I promiſe, and to all that go along with me, that if we prevail, I will be as Induſtrious to have him recompenced for his Charge and Hazard, as I will be to ſeek it for my ſelf. This Advice I give to all that ſtay behind, That when you hear the Papiſts have committed any Out-rage, or any Riſing, that you will get together; for it is better to meet your Danger than expect it. I have no more to ſay, but that I am willing to loſe my Life in the Cauſe, if God ſee it good, for I was never unwilling to dye for my Religion and Country.</p>
