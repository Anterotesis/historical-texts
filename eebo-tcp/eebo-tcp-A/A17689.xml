            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Herein onely is the difference, that, in so much as they were men desirous of honour, they coueted to atteyne to an exquisite finenes of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge, that they might thereby boste out the excellencie of theyr witte.

The second is: that there shoulde be prescribed vnto vs a rule, whiche may not suffre vs, in the seekyng &amp; desiryng of ryghtuousnes, to be deceyued.

we haue in other places spoken our mynde before. But yet some we wyl here touch briefly.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we heare mention of the ioynynge of god and vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we oughte to remembre, that holines ought to be the cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plinge or knyttynge together of hym &amp; vs. Not, because we, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe worthines of our owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines maye atteyne to haue fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowshippe wyth hym, when ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muste cleaue fyrst vnto

            <p>Therupon followeth also thys other thynge that we seeke not the thynges which be ours, but whiche are, accordyng to the Lordes wyl, and make for the settynge furth of his glory.

For he that hath learned to beholde God in the doinge of al thynge, therwythal turneth away from

al vayne thynges. Thys is that deniynge of oure selues, whiche Christe, assone as he had called his disciples, wyth so greate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence taught them: the whiche after it hath once taken place in the hert: firste leaueth no place either for pryde, or disdayne, or braggynge: and after that, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for couetousnes, nor vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lustes, nor lechery, nor wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton delicates, nor for other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, whiche come of the loue to oure owne selues.

wol frely, or for naught, exercise goodnes amonge men. For who so euer hath not bene of thys minde, thei haue folowed vertue for prayse sake.

            <p>Furthermore thys deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of oure selfe hath respecte partlie vnto men, and partly or rather chieflie vnto God, for when the scripture byddeth vs so to behaue our selues amonge men, that we geue honoure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them before oure selues: and that wyth greate faythfulnes,


<pb facs="tcp:11383:23"/>
we bestowe oure selues al toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon doinge good to them: it geueth those co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes whiche oure mynde can not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, excepte it firste lacke his owne natural wysedom. For euerie man thynketh, through the blyndnes wherewyth we al runne headlyng into the loue of oure owne selues, that he hath a iust cause to auaunce hym selfe, and to dispise al other in respect of hym selfe. If God haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs any thynge whiche is not to be repented of, we puttynge our delectation therin, by and by are high mynded, and do not onely swel, but also wel nigh bruste for pryde. The vices wherwith we abound, those we both diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hide frome other men, and in flatterynge of our selues, recken them lyghte and smal, yea and other whyleste delyght in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as

though they were vertues. And if we see the same giftes in other men, whiche we wondre at or be in loue wyth in oure selues, yea let them be greater then oure owne: yet, lest we should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned to take them for oure betters, those gyftes we do tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe malice make worse and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish: but if there be anie faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in them, then being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, wyth rigorousnesse and bitter tauntynge, to harken and spye them out, we wyll malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously make, of ant egges, ant hylles, and sette out the matter at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ryseth thys lordly presumption wyth euery one of vs, that as being by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law exempt, eueri one would aboue the reste excell or be taken higher. There is no man elles but eyther wythout cause we fierflie defye hym or elles at the

In deede pore men geue place to the rych, the comminaltie to the nobilitie, the seruauntes to the maisters, and, the vnlearned to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But for all that, there is no man, who inwardly and wythin his brest, nourisheth not some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opinion of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie. Thus eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in flattering of him selfe, doeth execute or beare a certeine kyngdome in his herte. And at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to muche to him selfe, that he may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better stand in his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceite, he taketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym authoritie to iudge other mens wittes &amp; maners: but if it come so far furth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei once co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend or be at wordes, then their poyson breaketh out.

               <pb facs="tcp:11383:25"/>But howe manye be there, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be once pricte or stirred vp, vse such maner of moderacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or humblenes? And there is no other remedy but that this most noysome pestilence of blind loue and of loue to oure selues, muste be plucked vp, out of the bottom of oure hertes, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as also by the doctryne of the scripture, it is puld vp. For, this we be taught, that the giftes, whiche god hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, we ought to remembre not to be oure goods, but the fre giftes of god, of the which, if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be proud, they therby vtter theyr vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfulnes. Furthermore by the continuall considerynge of oure synnes, we calle our selues backe vnto lowlines of herte. Thus there shal nothynge reste in vs wherefore we shoulde swel for anger or pride, but ther shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be greate cause, why we shoulde

throwe downe oure selues or beare our selues low.

For it were a parte of great wyckednes, to take awaye from them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, whyche oure Lorde hath vouchsaued to geue them. But at their vices, we are taughte to winke, not that through flatterie we should nourish or maintaine them: but that we should not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of them, speake reproche of those persons, vnto whome we ought to beare frendshippe and honoure. Thus shall it come to passe that with whom so euer we haue to do, we shall beare oure selues not onely lowly &amp; gently: but also familiarly &amp; fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwyse, vnto true meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

And there could be deuised no rule more sure, nor any exhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacion for the keaping of it more strong, then wher we be taught, all gyftes and qualities whiche we are indued wyth, to be sente vs of God or put of truste into our handes, on thys condicion, that thei should be bestowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our neyghbours profit, yea &amp; the scripture yet goeth further, whyle it compareth the gyftes, whyche euery man hath, vnto the powers or qualities whyche the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers in a mans bodye are indued wyth. Neuer a member hath hys powre, for hym selfe a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lone, neyther applieth it to hys owne priuate vse: but powreth it furth vpon his felow membres, and taketh no profit therby, but that, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth forth, for the comon commoditie of the whole bodye besydes.

what so euer he can do: he oweth that habilitie to hys bretherne: prouiding no other wise priuatly for hym selfe, but that his mynd neuertheles, is bente vnto the comon edifiyng or mayntaining of the congregation.

and therefore that our eyes ought to be lyfte vp vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where we loke to haue a crowne. ☞For thys we must reken: the minde neuer to be ernestely lyfte vp vnto the desier and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placion of the lyfe to come, except it be fyrst taught to dispise or set light by thys prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lyfe.

not onely death, but also that we are mortall.

Cor. vii</note> they that haue wyues, as though they had none: they that bie, as though they bought not:


<pb facs="tcp:11383:78"/>
as Paule teacheth. Agayne that they learne to beare as quietly, and patiently, pouertie: as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratly prosperitie. He that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth vnto the, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest vse thys worlde, as though thou dyddest not vse it, not only cutteth of glotony the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratnes and excessiuenes: &amp; in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, buildinges, &amp; raymet, ouer much delicates, desire of honour &amp; fame, prid, hautenes of minde, &amp; frowardnes: but also all loue and affections, whiche shoulde other leade away or let the from thynkynge on the heauenly lyfe, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the desire of garnishing of thy soule. It was truly spoken of Cato longe ago, that to be much careful for clothes, is to be muche careles for vertue. And it is an olde prouerbe: that who so euer is much occupyed in caring for the body, for the moste parte,


<pb facs="tcp:11383:78"/>
careth lytle or nothynge, for the soule. Therefore admit that the libertie of the fayethfull in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde thynges oughte not to be driuen vnto a sure and stedfaste rule: yet it is subiecte vnto thys lawe, that they shoulde make li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues: and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all desire of mynde, applye them selues, to cut of all preparacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of superfluous store of apparel: and muche more to a voyd to muche abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>daunce of it. And let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gently take hede, lest of aydes, or healpes, or futheraunces, they make vnto them selues hurtes, and hynderaunces. Another rule shalbe that they whose sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce is sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and poore, learne pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, lest they be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> immoderate desire of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Which rule who so kepeth, hath not alitle proffited in the scole of our lord: as on the other


<pb facs="tcp:11383:79"/>
side he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> scarsly haue, wherby to proue hym selfe christes disciple, who hath not, in this part, at the lest way, somwhat profited. For besides that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many other vices accompenye the desire of earthye thynges: he that vnpatientlye beareth penury, vttereth for the moste parte, in prosperitie the contrarie dissease: I meane this, he that is ashamed of a pore gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, wyll brag of a costlie: and he that is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with meane fare, shalbe vnquieted thorough desire of better or deintier, and wyl also without measure, abuse those delicates, if they happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym: and he that hardly, and wyth an vnquiet mynde, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a priuate &amp; lowe state, if he shal ryse vnto honour, he wil not absteyne from pryde &amp; disdayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes. Therfore let al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue not a feyned desire of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines


<pb facs="tcp:11383:79"/>
and of true honourynge of God, labour to atteine vnto this poynte that they maye learne by the Apostles example, to be full and to be hungrye, to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie and to suffer penury. Fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thermore the scripture hath yet the thirde rule, whereby it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth the vse of earthy thinges: wherof somwhat is spoken, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we dyd entreate of the preceptes of charitie. For the scripture hath iudged that al those earthy thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are geuen to vs of the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of God, and ordeyned for oure profite: and that they are as thynges lefte wyth vs of truste: wherof hereafter we must make a reckenynge. So therefore we muste bestowe them, that thys saiynge maye alwaye sounde in our eares: come make accompte of thy baylywyke. Therewythal remembre who wyl require such


<pb facs="tcp:11383:80"/>
accompte of the. Euen he, who, as he hath verie highly praysed abstinence, temperaunce, libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and gentlenes: so he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth excesse of meates and sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie, pryde, bragging, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: who alloweth no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing of goodes but that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whiche is ioyned wyth chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: who also hath already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned, with his owne mouth, al suche ryches as draw a mans herte from purenes, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or dulleth the mynde wyth darckenes.</p>
            <p>Finally thys is also a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thynge: that oure Lorde commaundeth euery one of vs, in all our deedes, to loke well to our owne vocation. For he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth wyth howe great vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes mannes witte boyleth vp: wyth howe maskyng lyghtnes, it is caryed hither and thither:


<pb facs="tcp:11383:80"/>
yea, and howe gredy his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions desire is to embrace and get many thinges at once. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore leste through oure folishnes and gredy rashnes, all thynges should be ministerd wythout or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, he hath appoynted vnto all men thetr offices by distinct and seuerall kyndes of lyfe. And lest any man shoulde rashly go past his limittes he hath named such kyndes of lyuynge, our vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Therfore mannes kinde of lyuynge is, as a standynge ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto hym of our Lorde: lest at all aduentures, he shoulde be dryuen aboute, durynge all the course of his lyfe. And thys di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, or seperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or marke, is so necessarie: that all oure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and doinges, are estemed before our Lorde, by it. Yea and that farre otherwyse often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, then the iudgemente of


<pb facs="tcp:11383:81"/>
mans reason, and philosophers opinions do weigh the thinge. There is nothynge counted a more noble deede, after the myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of philosophers, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer thy natyue countrey of a tyraunt. But for all that, by the voice of oure Lorde, the priuate parson, is openly condempned, whiche violently layeth hande on a tyraunt. But I wyll not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vpon rehersing of examples. It is ynough, if we shal knowe, that the vocation of our Lorde, (or whereunto oure Lorde hath called vs) is the beginnyng and foundation of doing wel in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter: to the whiche, he that referreth not hym selfe: shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer holde the right waye in offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He maye perchaunce, some<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyme do somthynge worthie of prayse in the outwarde shewe: but the same, howe so euer it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare


<pb facs="tcp:11383:81"/>
in the syght of men, shall, before the throne and maiestie of God, be reiected: and also ther shall be no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient agrement, in the partes of the lyfe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. Therefore, then shall thy lyfe be well led: when it shal be directed vnto thys marke. And hereupon shall growe an excellent consolation: I meane that there shall be none, so foule and vile a worcke, if thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe thy vocation in the same, which before God shal not shine bryght, and be counted very pretious in his syghte. To whom be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng prayse. Amen.</p>
