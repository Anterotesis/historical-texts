            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Bookſeller deſiring me to give him ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to it, I thought meet firſt to make up the <hi>exciting</hi> part in the ſame ſtyle, and then to add a Directory for the practice of judicious Believers.</p>
            <p n="2">

I have choſen this text, which is a deſcription of faith, that the opening of it may help us for the opening of our hearts, and reſolving the great queſtion, on which our endleſs life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
            <p>To be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and to be a <hi>Believer</hi> in Chriſt, are words in Scripture of the ſame ſignification. If you have not <hi>faith,</hi> you are not <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> This faith hath various offices and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59417:12"/>
objects. By it we are <hi>juſtified, ſanctified</hi> and <hi>ſaved.</hi> We are <hi>juſtified,</hi> not by believing <hi>that we are juſtified,</hi> but by believing that <hi>we may be juſtified.</hi> Not by <hi>receiving juſtification imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> but by <hi>receiving Chriſt for our juſtification:</hi> not by <hi>meer accepting the pardon in it ſelf,</hi> but by firſt <hi>receiving him that procureth and beſtoweth it,</hi> on his terms: Not by meer accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>health,</hi> but by receiving the <hi>Phyſician</hi> and his <hi>remedies, for health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith is the practical Believing in God as promiſing, and Chriſt as procuring juſtification and ſalvation.</hi> Or, <hi>the practical belief and acceptance of life, as procured by Chriſt, and promiſed by God in the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The everlaſting fruition of God in Heaven, is the ultimate object. No man believeth in Chriſt as Chriſt, that believeth not in him for eternal life. As faith looks at Chriſt as the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means,</hi> and at the <hi>divine benignity</hi> as the <hi>fountain,</hi> and at his <hi>veracity</hi> as the <hi>foundation</hi> or <hi>formal object,</hi> and at the <hi>promiſe,</hi> as the <hi>true ſignification of his will</hi>; ſo doth it <hi>ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> look at our <hi>ſalvation,</hi> (begun on earth, and perfected in Heaven) as the end, for which it looketh at the reſt.</p>
            <p>No wonder therefore if the holy Ghoſt here ſpeaking of the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> do principally inſiſt on that part of its deſcription, which is taken from this final object.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt himſelf in his <hi>Humiliation</hi> was <hi>rejected</hi> by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and a <hi>ſtumbling ſtone</hi> to the <hi>Jews, deſpiſed and not eſteemed,</hi> Iſa. 53.2, 3. <hi>having made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> Phil. 2 7. So <hi>faith in Chriſt</hi> as <hi>incarnate</hi> and <hi>crucified,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and counted <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> by the world. But as Chriſt in his <hi>glory,</hi> and the <hi>glory of believers,</hi> ſhall force them to an aweful admiration; ſo <hi>faith</hi> it ſelf as exerciſed on that <hi>glory,</hi> is more <hi>glorious</hi> in the eyes of all. Believers are never ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced by the world, as when they converſe in Heaven, and the <hi>Spirit of Glory reſteth on them,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.14.</p>
            <p>How faith by beholding this glorious end, doth move all the faculties of the ſoul, and ſubdue the inclinations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the fleſh, and make the greateſt ſufferings tollerable, is the work of the holy Ghoſt in this Chapter to demonſtrate, which beginning with the deſcription, proceeds to the proof by a cloud of witneſſes. There are two ſorts of <hi>perſons</hi> (and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59417:12"/>
imployments) in the world, for whom there are two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>ends</hi> hereafter. One ſort ſubject their <hi>reaſon</hi> to their <hi>ſenſual</hi> or <hi>carnal intereſt.</hi> The other ſubject their <hi>ſenſes</hi> to their <hi>reaſon,</hi> cleared, conducted and elevated by <hi>faith.</hi> Things preſent or poſſeſſed, are the riches of the ſenſual, and the byas of their hearts and lives: Things <hi>abſent</hi> but <hi>hoped</hi> for, are the riches of Believers, which actuate their chief en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>
            <p>This is the ſenſe of the text which I have read to you; which ſetting <hi>things hoped for,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>things preſent,</hi> and things <hi>unſeen,</hi> to thoſe that <hi>ſenſe</hi> doth apprehend, aſſureth us that faith (which fixeth on the firſt) doth give to its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a <hi>ſubſiſtence, preſence</hi> and <hi>evidence,</hi> that is, it <hi>ſeeth that which ſupplieth the want of preſence and viſibility.</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is that which <hi>quoad effectum</hi> is <hi>equal</hi> to a <hi>preſent ſubſiſtence.</hi> And the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>evidence</hi> is ſomewhat which <hi>quoad effectum</hi> is <hi>equal to viſibility.</hi> As if he had ſaid, [<hi>Though the glory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Believers, and expected by them, be yet to come, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hoped for, and be yet unſeen and only believed, yet is the ſound believer as truly affected with it, and acted by its attractive force, as if it were preſent and before his eyes</hi>] as a man is by an inheritance, or eſtate in reverſion, or out of ſight, if well ſecured, and not only by that which is preſent to his view. The <hi>Syriack Interpreter</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> gives us a true expoſition of the words, <hi>viz. [Faith is a certainty of thoſe things that are in hope, as if they did already actually exiſt, and the revelation of thoſe things that are not ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or you may take the ſenſe in this Propoſition, which I am next to open further, and apply, <hi>viz. [That the nature and uſe of faith is to be as it were inſtead of preſence, poſſeſſion and ſight: or to make the things that will be, as if they were already in exiſtence; and the things unſeen which God revealeth, as if our bodily eyes beheld them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Not that faith doth <hi>really change</hi> its object. 2. Nor doth it give the ſame <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>apprehenſions</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> as the <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>preſent</hi> things would do. But 1. Things inviſible are the objects of our faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And Faith is <hi>effectual inſtead of ſight</hi> to all theſe uſes: 1. The <hi>apprehenſion</hi> is as <hi>infallible,</hi> becauſe of the objective

certainty, (though not ſo ſatisfactory to our imperfect ſouls) as if the things themſelves were <hi>ſeen.</hi> 2.

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall in juſtification of the work of Faith, acquaint you briefly with 1. That in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it: 2. And that in the <hi>cauſing</hi> of it, which advanceth it, to be an <hi>infallible knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Believer <hi>knows</hi> (as ſure as he knows there is a God) that God is <hi>true,</hi> and his Word is <hi>true,</hi> it being <hi>impoſſible for God to lie,</hi> H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>b. 6.18. <hi>God that cannot lie hath promiſed,</hi> Titus 1.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He <hi>knows</hi> that the holy Scripture is the Word of God; by his Image which it beareth, and the many evidences of Divinity which it containeth, and the many Miracles (cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly proved) which Chriſt, and his Spirit in his ſervants, wrought to confirm the truth. 3. And therefore he knoweth aſſuredly the concluſion, that all this Word of God is true.</p>
            <p>And for the ſurer effecting of this knowledge, God doth not only ſet before us the aſcertaining Evidence of his own
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59417:13"/>
veracity, and the Scriptures Divinity; but moreover, 1. He <hi>giveth us to believe,</hi> Phil. 1.29. 2 Pet. 1.3. For it <hi>is not of our ſelves, but is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8. <hi>Faith</hi> is one of the <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22. By the <hi>drawing of the Father,</hi> we <hi>come to the Son.</hi> And he that hath <hi>knowledge given</hi> from Heaven, will certainly <hi>know</hi>: and he that hath <hi>Faith given</hi> him from Heaven, will certainly <hi>believe.</hi> The heavenly Light will diſſipate our darkneſs, and infallibly illuminate. Whileſt God ſets before us the glaſs of the Goſpel in which the things <hi>inviſible</hi> are revealed, and alſo gives us <hi>eye ſight</hi> to behold them, Believers muſt needs be a heavenly people, as walking in that light which proceedeth from, and leadeth to the celeſtial ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Light.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And that <hi>Faith</hi> may be ſo powerful as to ſerve inſtead of <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>preſence, Believers have the Spirit of Chriſt within them,</hi> to excite and actuate it, and help them againſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to unbelief, and to work in them all other graces that concur to promote the works of Faith; and to mortifie thoſe ſins that hinder our believing, and are contrary to a heavenly life: So that as the exerciſe of our ſight, and taſte, and hearing, and feeling, is cauſed by our natural life; ſo the exerciſe of Faith and Hope, and Love, upon things unſeen, is cauſed by the holy Spirit, which is the principle of our new life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We have received the Spirit, that we might know the things that are given us of God.</hi>] This <hi>Spirit of God</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with <hi>God,</hi> with his veracity and his Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.30. <hi>We know him that hath ſaid, I will never fail thee, nor forſake thee.</hi>] This <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> acquainteth us with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and with his grace and will. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. This <hi>heavenly Spirit</hi> acquainteth us with <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſo that [<hi>We know that when Chriſt appeareth, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. And <hi>we know that he was manifeſted to take away ſin,</hi>] 1 Joh. 3.5. And will perfect his work, and preſent us ſpotleſs to his Father, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26, 27. This <hi>heavenly Spirit</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the Saints with ſuch <hi>heavenly diſpoſitions</hi> and deſires, as much facilitate the work of Faith. It bringeth us to a <hi>heavenly converſation</hi>; and maketh us live as <hi>fellow-citizens of the Saints,</hi> and <hi>in the houſhold of God,</hi> Phil. 3.20. Eph. 2.19. It is within us a <hi>Spirit of ſupplication,</hi> breathing heaven-ward, with <hi>ſighs and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59417:14"/>
groans which cannot be expreſſed</hi>; and as God <hi>knoweth the meaning of the Spirit,</hi> ſo the <hi>Spirit knows the mind of God,</hi> Rom. 8.37. 1 Cor. 2.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And the work of Faith is much promoted by the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual experiences</hi> of Believers. When they find a conſiderable part of the holy Scriptures verified on themſelves, it much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth their Faith as to the whole. They are <hi>really poſſeſſed</hi> of that heavenly diſpoſition, called, <hi>The Divine Nature,</hi> and have felt the power of the Word upon their hearts, renewing them to the Image of God, mortifying their moſt dear and ſtrong corruptions, ſhewing them a greater beauty and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs in the Objects of Faith, than is to be found in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things: They have found many of the Promiſes made good upon themſelves, in the anſwers of prayers, and in great deliverances, which ſtrongly perſwadeth them to believe the reſt that are yet to be accompliſhed. And <hi>experience</hi> is a very <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>ſatisfying</hi> way of conviction. He that <hi>feeleth,</hi> as it were, the firſt fruits, the earneſt, and the beginnings of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven already in his ſoul, will more eaſily and aſſuredly believe that there is a Heaven hereafter. [<hi>We know that the Son of God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> come, and hath given us an underſtanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt: This is the true God and eternal life,</hi>] 1 Joh. 5.20. [<hi>He that believeth on the Son hath the witneſs in himſelf,</hi> Verſ. 10.] There is ſo great a <hi>likeneſs</hi> of the holy and <hi>heavenly nature</hi> in the Saints, to the <hi>heavenly life</hi> that God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that makes it the more eaſily believed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And it exceedingly helpeth our Belief of the life that's yet unſeen, to find that <hi>Nature</hi> affordeth us undeniable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove a future Happineſs and Miſery, Reward and Puniſhment, in the general; yea and in ſpecial, that the <hi>Love and Fruition of God</hi> is this Reward; and that the effects of his <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> are this Puniſhment: Nothing more clear and certain than that <hi>there is a God,</hi> (He muſt be a <hi>fool</hi> indeed that dare deny it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1.) as alſo that this God is the Creatour of the rational nature, and hath the abſolute right of Soveraign Government: and therefore that the rational Creature oweth him the moſt full and abſolute obedience, and deſerveth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment if he diſobey. And it's moſt clear that infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59417:14"/>
ſhould be loved above all finite imperfect created good: And it's clear that the rational nature is ſo formed, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>hopes and fears</hi> of another life, the world neither <hi>is,</hi> nor ever <hi>was,</hi> nor (by ordinary viſible means) can be well governed; (ſuppoſing God to work on man according to his nature.) And it is moſt certain that it conſiſteth not with infinite wiſdom, power and goodneſs, to be put to rule the world in all ages, by fraud and falſhood. And it is certain that Heathens do for the moſt part through the world, by the light of nature, acknowledge a life of joy, or miſery to come: And the moſt hardened Atheiſts, or Infidels muſt confeſs, that [<hi>for ought they know there may be ſuch a life:</hi>] it being impoſſible they ſhould know or prove the contrary.

               <p n="3">3. A Believer is one that <hi>judgeth of the man by his inviſible inſide,</hi> and not by outward appearances with a fleſhly worldly judgement.

And therefore it is that he pittieth the ungodly, when they pitty not themſelves, and ſpeaks to them oft with a tender heart in compaſſion of their miſery, and perhaps weeps over them (as <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.18, 19.) when he cannot prevail; when they weep not for themſelves, but hate his love, and ſcorn his pitty, and bid him keep his lamentations for himſelf; becauſe they ſee not what he ſees.</p>

He judgeth of men as he perceiveth them to have more or leſs of Chriſt. The worth of a man is not obvious to the ſenſe. You ſee his <hi>ſtature, complexion</hi> and his <hi>cloths</hi>; but as you ſee not his <hi>learning</hi> or <hi>skill</hi> in any Art whatſoever, ſo you ſee not his <hi>grace</hi> and heavenly mind.

And therefore in the eyes of a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, <hi>a vile perſon is contemned; but he honoureth thoſe that fear the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 15.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A true Believer doth <hi>ſeek a happineſs which he never ſaw, and that with greater eſtimation and reſolution, than he ſeeks the moſt excellent things that he hath ſeen.</hi> In all his prayers, his labours, and his ſufferings, it is an <hi>unſeen Glory</hi> that he ſeeks: he <hi>ſeeth</hi> not the Glory of God, nor the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Redeemer, nor the world of Angels, and perfected ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the juſt: but he <hi>knoweth</hi> by faith, that ſuch a God, ſuch a Glory, ſuch a world as this <hi>there is,</hi> as certain as if his eyes had ſeen it. And therefore he provides, he lives, he hopes, he waits, for this <hi>unſeen</hi> ſtate of ſpiritual bliſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all the wealth and glory, that ſight can reach in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon thereof. He believeth what he <hi>ſhall ſee</hi>; and therefore ſtrives that he <hi>may</hi> ſee it. It's ſomething above the Sun, and all that mortal eyes can ſee, which is the <hi>end,</hi> the <hi>hope,</hi> the

                  <hi>portion</hi> of a believer, without which all is nothing to him; and for which he trades and travels here, as worldlings do for worldly things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.20, 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A true Believer <hi>doth all his life prepare for a day that is yet to come,</hi> and for an <hi>account</hi> of all the paſſages of his life, though he hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore he lives as one that is haſting to the preſence of his Judge; and he contriveth his affairs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth of his worldly riches, as one that looks to hear of it again, and as one that remembreth the <hi>Judge is at the door,</hi> James 5.9. He rather asketh, [what life, what words, what actions, what way of uſing my eſtate and intereſt, will be ſweeteſt to me in the review, and will be beſt at laſt when I muſt accordingly receive my doom?] than [what is moſt pleaſant to my fleſh? and what will ingratiate me moſt with men? and what will accommodate me beſt at preſent? and ſet me higheſt in the world?] And therefore it is, that he pittieth the ungodly even in the height of their proſperity; and is ſo earneſt (though it offend them) to procure their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, as knowing that how ſecure ſoever they are now, they <hi>muſt give an account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.5. and that then the caſe will be altered with the preſumptuous world.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, A true believer is <hi>careful to prevent a threatned miſery which he never felt</hi>; and is awakened by holy fear to <hi>flye from the wrath to come,</hi> and is induſtrious to eſcape that <hi>place of torment</hi> which he never ſaw, as if he had ſeen it with his eyes. When he heareth but the <hi>ſound of the trumpet,</hi> he <hi>takes warning</hi> that <hi>he may ſave his ſoul,</hi> Ezek. 33.4. The evils that are <hi>here felt</hi> and <hi>ſeen,</hi> are not ſo dreadful to him, as thoſe that he <hi>never ſaw or felt.</hi> He is not ſo careful and reſolute, to avoid the ruine of his eſtate or name, or to avoid the plague, or ſword, or famine, or the ſcorching flames, or death, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he is to avoid the endleſs torments, which are threatned by the righteous God. It is a greater miſery in his eſteem, to be <hi>really undone for ever,</hi> than <hi>ſeemingly only for a time,</hi> and to be caſt off by God, than by all the world; and to <hi>lie</hi> in Hell, than to ſuffer any temporal calamity. And therefore he fears it more, and doth more to avoid it; and is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59417:18"/>
more caſt down by the fears of Gods diſpleaſure, than by the feelings of theſe preſent ſufferings. As <hi>Noah</hi> did for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from the threatned deluge, ſo doth the true Believer for his preſervation from everlaſting wrath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. [<hi>By faith Noah being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark, to the ſaving of his houſe, by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is by faith.] God firſt giveth warning of the flood: Noah</hi> believeth it: not with a <hi>lifeleſs,</hi> but a <hi>working faith:</hi> that firſt moved in him a ſelf-preſerving <hi>fear:</hi> This <hi>fear</hi> moveth <hi>Noah</hi> to obey the Lord in the uſe of means, and to prepare the Ark; and all this was, to ſave himſelf and his houſe from a flood, that was as yet unſeen, and of which in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there was no appearance. Thus doth God warn the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful world, of the day of judgement, and the fire that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable; and <hi>true believers</hi> take his <hi>warning</hi>; and <hi>believing</hi> that which they <hi>cannot ſee,</hi> by <hi>fear</hi> they are <hi>moved</hi> to flye to Chriſt, and uſe his means to ſcape the threatned calamity. By this they become the <hi>heirs of that Righteouſneſs which is by faith, and condemn</hi> the unbelieving careleſs <hi>world,</hi> that take not the warning, and uſe not the remedy.</p>
               <p>By this time you may ſee that the Life of Faith is quite another thing, than the <hi>lifeleſs opinion</hi> of multitudes that call themſelves <hi>believers.</hi> To ſay [<hi>I believe there is a God, a Chriſt, a Heaven, a Hell,</hi>] is as eaſie as it is common. But the <hi>faith</hi> of the ungodly is but an uneffectual dream. To dream that you are fighting, wins no victories: To dream that you are eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gets no ſtrength. To dream that you are running, rid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> no ground: To dream that you are plowing, or ſowing, or reaping, procureth but a fruitleſs harveſt. And to dream that you are Princes, may conſiſt with beggery. If you do any more than <hi>dream</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> how is it that you ſtir not, and make it not appear by the diligence of your lives, and the fervour of your duties, and the ſeriouſneſs of your endeavours, that ſuch wonderful unexpreſſible over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering things, are indeed the matters of your belief? As you love your ſouls, take heed leſt you take an <hi>image of faith</hi> to be the thing it ſelf. <hi>Faith</hi> ſets on work the powers of the ſoul, for the obtaining of that joy, and the eſcaping of that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59417:19"/>
miſery which you believe. But the <hi>image</hi> of faith in ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, neither <hi>warms</hi> nor <hi>works:</hi> it conquereth no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; it ſtirs not up to faithful duty.

This image of faith annihilateth the moſt potent objects, as to any due impreſſion on the ſoul. God is as no God, and Heaven as no H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If fire and ſword be there, an image fears them not. You may perceive by the ſenſeleſs neglectful car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of ungodly men, that they <hi>ſee</hi> not by faith the God that they ſhould love and fear; the Heaven that they ſhould ſeek and wait for; or the Hell that they ſhould with all poſſible care avoid. He is indeed the true Believer that (allowing the difference of degrees) doth pray as if he ſaw the Lord; and ſpeak and live as alwaies in his preſence; and redeem his time as if he were to die to morrow, or as one that ſeeth death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ready to lay hands upon him; that begs and cries to God in prayer, as one that <hi>foreſeeth</hi> the day of judgement; and the endleſs joy or miſery that followeth: that beſtirreth him for everlaſting life, as one that <hi>ſeeth</hi> Heaven and Hell, by the eye of faith. Faith is a ſerious apprehenſion, and cauſeth a ſerious converſation: for it is inſtead of <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all this you may eaſily and certainly infer, 1. That <hi>true faith</hi> is a Jewel, rare and precious: and not ſo common as nominal careleſs Chriſtians think. What ſay they, <hi>Are we not all believers? will you make Infidels of all that are not Saints? are none Chriſtians, but thoſe that live ſo ſtrictly?</hi> Anſwer, I know they are not <hi>Infidels by profeſſion:</hi> but what they are indeed, and what God will take them for, you may ſoon perceive, by comparing the deſcription of faith, with the inſcription legible on their <hi>lives.</hi> It's common to ſay, <hi>I do believe:</hi> but is it common to find men, <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>live</hi> as thoſe that do believe indeed? It is both in works of <hi>charity</hi> and of <hi>piety,</hi> that a <hi>living faith</hi> will ſhew it ſelf. I will not therefore contend about the name: If you are <hi>ungodly, unjuſt,</hi> or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59417:19"/>
                  <hi>uncharitable,</hi> and yet will call your ſelves <hi>Believers,</hi> you may keep the <hi>name,</hi> and ſee whether it will ſave you. Have you forgotten how this caſe is determined by the holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>James</hi> 2.14, &amp;c. <hi>What doth it profit my Brethren, if a man ſay, he hath faith, and hath not works? Can faith ſave him? Faith if it hath not works is dead, being alone. Thou believeſt that there is one God: thou doſt well: the Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> If <hi>ſuch a belief</hi> be it, that thou glorieſt in, it's not denyed thee! <hi>But wilt thou know, oh vain man, that faith without works is dead?</hi> &amp;c. Is there <hi>life</hi> where there is no <hi>motion?</hi> Had you that <hi>Faith</hi> that is inſtead of <hi>ſight,</hi> it would make you more <hi>ſolicitous</hi> for the <hi>things unſeen,</hi> than you are for the <hi>viſible trifles</hi> of this world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And hence you may obſerve, that <hi>moſt true Believers are weak in Faith.</hi> Alas, how far do we all fall ſhort of the love, and zeal, and care, and diligence, which we ſhould have if we had but <hi>once beheld</hi> the things which we do <hi>believe?</hi> Alas, how dead are our affections? how flat are our duties? how cold, and how ſlow are our endeavours? how unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable are our lives, in compariſon of what <hi>one hours ſight of Heaven and Hell</hi> would make them be? O what a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſe would it be, if I might but joyn in prayer, praiſe, and holy conference one day or hour, with a perſon that had <hi>ſeen the Lord,</hi> and <hi>been</hi> in Heaven, and born a part in the Angelical Praiſes! Were our Congregations compoſed of ſuch perſons, what manner of worſhip would they perform to God? How unlike would their heavenly raviſhing expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be to theſe our ſleepy heartleſs duties? Were Heaven open to the view of all this Congregation while I am ſpeaking to you, or when we are ſpeaking in prayer and praiſe to God, imagine your ſelves what a change it would make upon the beſt of us in our ſervices! What apprehenſions, what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, what reſolutions it would raiſe! and what a poſture it would caſt us all into! And do we not all profeſs to <hi>believe</hi> theſe things, as revealed from Heaven by the infallible God? Do we not ſay, that ſuch a Divine Revelation is as ſure as if the things were in themſelves laid open to our ſight? Why then are we no more affected with them? Why are we no more tranſported by them? Why do they no more command

If you ſaw a mans action in eating and drinking, and ſee not the meat and drink it ſelf, would you not think him mad? If you heard men laugh, and hear not ſo much as the voice of him that gives the jeaſt, would you not imagine them to be brain-ſick? If you ſee men dance, and hear not the muſick; if you ſee a Labourer threſhing, or reaping, or mowing, and ſee no corn or graſs before him; if you ſee a Souldier fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his life, and ſee no enemy that he ſpends his ſtroaks upon, will you not take all theſe for men diſtracted? Why this is the caſe between you and the true Believers. You ſee them reverently worſhip God, but you ſee not the Majeſty which they worſhip, as they do: You ſee them as buſie for the ſaving of their ſouls, as if an hundred lives lay on it; but you ſee not the Hell from which they fly, nor the Heaven they ſeek: and therefore you marvel why they make ſo

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Worſhip God as Believers; ſerve him with reverence and godly fear, for our God is a conſuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12.28, 29. A <hi>ſeeing faith,</hi> if well excited, would kindle love, deſire, fear, and all praying graces. No man prayes well, that doth not well know what he prayes for. When it comes to <hi>ſeeing,</hi> all men can cry loud, and pray when praying will do no good. They will not then ſpeak ſleepily, or by rote, <hi>Fides intuendo, amorem recipit, amorem ſuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>tat: Cor flagrans amore deſideria, gemitus, orationes ſpirat.</hi> Faith is the burning-glaſs which beholding God, receiveth the beams of his communicated love, and inflameth the heart with love to him again; which mounteth up by groans and prayers, till it reach its original, and love for ever reſt in love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Deſire and uſe the creature as Believers.</hi> Interpret all things as they receive their meaning, from the things <hi>unſeen:</hi> underſtand them in no other ſenſe. It's only <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>life to come</hi> that can tell you what's good or bad for you in the world. And therefore the ungodly that cannot go to <hi>Heaven</hi> for <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> are carryed about by meer deceits. Take heed <hi>what</hi> you love: and take heed <hi>of that</hi> you love. God is very jealous of our love: He ſheds abroad his own love in our hearts, that our hearts may be fruitful in love to him, which is his chief delight. By love he commandeth love; that we may ſuitably move toward him, and center in him. He communicateth ſo <hi>much</hi> for the procuring of a <hi>little,</hi> that we ſhould endeavour to give him <hi>all that little,</hi> and ſhed none of it inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately upon the creature by the way. Nothing is <hi>great,</hi> or
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59417:45"/>
greatly to be admired, while the great God is in ſight. And it is unſuitable for <hi>little things,</hi> to have <hi>great affections</hi>; and for low matters to have a high eſteem. It is the corruption and folly of the mind, and the deluſion of the affections to exalt a Shrub above a Cedar, and magnifie a Mole-hill above a Mountain; to embrace a ſhadow or <hi>ſpectrum</hi> of felicity, which vaniſheth into <hi>Nothing,</hi> when you bring in the light. The creature is <hi>nihil &amp; nullipotens: Nothing</hi> ſhould have no intereſt in us, and be able to do <hi>Nothing</hi> with us (as to the motions that are under the dominion of the will.) God is <hi>All</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:</hi> And he that is <hi>All,</hi> ſhould have <hi>All,</hi> and command <hi>All:</hi> And the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> ſhould do <hi>All things</hi> with us, by his <hi>Intereſt</hi> in <hi>Morals</hi>; as he <hi>will do</hi> by his <hi>force</hi> in <hi>Naturals.</hi> I deny not but we may <hi>love a friend:</hi> One ſoul in two bodies will have one mind, and will, and love. But as it is not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of my <hi>friend,</hi> that I love or converſe with principally, but the ſoul; (and therefore ſhould have no mind of the caſe, the corps, the empty neſt, if the bird were flown) ſo is it not the perſon, but Chriſt in him, or that of God which appeareth on him, that muſt be the principal object of our love. The man is <hi>mutable,</hi> and muſt be loved, as <hi>Plato</hi> did commend his friend to <hi>Dionyſius: Haec tibi ſcribo de homine, viz. animante naturâ mutabili:</hi> and therefore muſt be loved with a reſerve. But God is unchangeable, and muſt be abſolutely and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably loved. That life is beſt that's likeſt Heaven: There God will be All; and yet even there, it will be no diſhonour or diſpleaſure to the Deity, that the glorified humanity of Chriſt, and the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and our holy ſociety, are loved more dearly than we can love any creature here on earth: So here, God taketh not that affection as ſtoln from <hi>him,</hi> that's given to his ſervants for his ſake, but accepts it as ſent <hi>to him by them.</hi> Let the creature have it, ſo God have it finally in and by the creature; and then it is not ſo properly the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that hath it, as God. If you <hi>chuſe,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> your friends for God, you will <hi>uſe</hi> them for God: not flattering them, or deſiring to be flattered by them; but to kindle in each other the holy flame which will aſpire and mount, and know no bounds, till it reach the boundleſs element of love. You will not value them as friends, <hi>qui omnia dicta &amp; facta veſtra
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59417:45"/>
laudant, ſed qui errata &amp; delicta amice reprehendunt:</hi> Not them that <hi>call</hi> you good; but them that would <hi>make</hi> you <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And you will let them know, as <hi>Phocian</hi> did <hi>Antipater,</hi> that they can never uſe you, <hi>&amp; amici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>It's hard to love the imperfect creature, without miſtakes, and inordinacy in our love: And therefore uſually where we love moſt, we ſin moſt; and our ſin finds us out; and then we ſuffer moſt: and too much affection is the forerunner of much affliction; which will be much prevented, if <hi>Faith</hi> might be the <hi>guide</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Love might be made <hi>Divine</hi>; and all to be referred to the things unſeen, and animated by them. Love where you can never love too much; where you are ſure to have no diſappointments; where there is no unkindneſs to ecclipſe or interrupt; where the only errour is, that God hath not all; and the only grief, that we love no more.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially in the midſt of your entiſing pleaſures, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing employments and profits in the world, foreſee the end; do all in <hi>Faith,</hi> which telleth you, [<hi>The time is ſhort; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth therefore, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this world, as through they uſed it not (or not abuſing it:) for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.29, 30.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Imploy your time as becomes Believers.</hi> Faith only can acquaint you, what an unconceivable weight doth lye upon this inch of haſty <hi>time.</hi> As you behave your ſelves for a few daies, it muſt go with you in joy or miſery for ever: You have your appointed time, for your appointed work.

it valued by all at <hi>laſt?</hi> And how baſely is it eſteemed <hi>new</hi> by the moſt? Now it is no more worth with them, than to be ſold for unneceſſary ſports, and eaſe, and waſted in idleneſs and vain delights: But <hi>then</hi>; when it's gone, and all's too late, how loud would they cry, if cryes could call back <hi>Time</hi> again! O then what a mercy would it ſeem, if God would try them once again! and truſt them but with another life, or with <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s fifteen years! or but with fifteen daies, or hours, upon ſuch terms of grace, as they held that life which they abuſed! It amazeth me to obſerve the lamentable ſtupidity of the world, how hard they beg for time when they think it is near an end! and how careleſly they let it ſlide away, when they have ſtrength and faculties to improve it! They are grievouſly afraid leſt death deprive them of it; and yet they are not afraid to deprive themſelves of the uſe and fruit of it, and to caſt it away as contemptuouſly, as if it were an uſeleſs thing. I ſeldom come near a dying man, but I hear him complain of the loſs of <hi>Time,</hi> and wiſh it were to ſpend again, that it might be better valued and uſed. And yet the <hi>living</hi> will not be warned. O value <hi>Time,</hi> as wiſe men, while you have it; and not as miſerable fools, when it is gone! If our Lord ſaid, <hi>I muſt do the work of him that ſent me while it is day; for the night cometh when no man can work,</hi> Joh. 9.4. What need then have ſuch as we to be doing, and make much of time? O let not company, mirth or buſineſs, make you forget the work of <hi>Time</hi>!

And Satan hath ſtill the bellows in his hand: He knoweth that if he can corrupt or win the Commander, he can rout the Army, and ruine them with the greateſt eaſe. It hath been Satans grand deſign, ſince the Chriſtian name was known on earth, to advance the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> intereſt of men againſt the intereſt of Chriſt; and to entangle the Rulers of the world in ſome cauſe, that Chriſt, and his Word, and Servants cannot favour, and ſo to make them believe that there is a neceſſity on them to watch againſt, and ſubdue the intereſt of Chriſt. As if it were neceſſary that the ſhore be brought to the boat, and not the boat to the ſhore: And that the Phyſician be brought to the Patients mind, or elſe deſtroyed or uſed as his enemy. I am afraid to ſpeak out the terrible words of God in Scripture, that are againſt ſuch perſons, leſt you ſhould miſunderſtand me, and think I miſapply them. But Chriſt feareth no man, and hath not ſpoken his Word in vain; and his Meſſengers muſt be faithful; for he will bear them out; and preventive cautions are eaſier and ſafer than reprehenſive corraſives. I will but refer you to the texts, that you may peruſe them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.44. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.40, 45. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.4, 5. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15, 16. Read them with fear as the Words of God. Bleſſed are thoſe Rulers and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth, that perceive and eſcape this pernicious ſnare of the grand deceiver; that with all his ſubtilty and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, endeavoureth to breed quarrels, and ſow diſſentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the univerſal King.</p>

                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59417:50"/>The more God giveth to the carnal and unwiſe, the more they think themſelves engaged againſt him; becauſe by his commands he ſeems to take it from them again, by croſſing the fleſh, which would uſe it only to fulfil its luſts. Like a Dog that fawneth on you till he have his bone; and then ſnarleth at you, leſt you take it from him; and will fly in your face if you offer to meddle with it. Men readily confeſs that they have their wealth <hi>from God</hi>; becauſe it cannot be denyed, and becauſe they would uſe the name of God, as a cover to hide their covetouſneſs, and unlawful waies of getting: But if you judge by their <hi>uſage</hi> of it, and their returns to God; you would think that they believed, that they had nothing at all from God, but ſome injuries; and that all their benefits and good were from themſelves. The Turkiſh and Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Emperour will ſay, that all his grandeur and power is from God; that by making it moſt Divine, he may procure the more reverence and obedience to himſelf: But when he hath ſaid ſo for his own intereſt, he uſeth the ſame power <hi>againſt God and his intereſt</hi>; to the baniſhing of his Word and holy Worſhip, and the forbidding the preaching of the Goſpel of ſalvation; and to the cheriſhing of tyranny, pride and luſt: As if God had armed them againſt himſelf, and made his <hi>Officers</hi> to be his enemies; and gave them power that they might powerfully hinder mens ſalvation, and made great, to be great oppreſſors.</p>
                  <p>As a <hi>believing Paſtor</hi> is a <hi>Prieſt</hi> that ſtandeth between God and the people, to mediate under the great Mediatour; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God his Word and Ordinances, and deliver them to the flocks; and to offer up ſupplications in their names to God: So <hi>believing Governours</hi> of civil Societies or Families, receive from God a power to rule the ſubjects for their good, and they uſe it to make the ſubjects good, that God may be pleaſed and honoured by all! And the obedience which they require, is ſuch as may be given <hi>to God in them.</hi> They take power from God to uſe it for God, and are ſo much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the greateſt of ambitious carnal Princes, as the pleaſing and honouring of God, is a more excellent deſign and work, than the gratifying of fleſhly luſt, and the advancement of a lump of clay. The Kingdoms of the world would all be

uſed as the Kingdoms of the Lord, if the everlaſting Kingdom were well believed. The families of men would be ſanctified as Churches unto God, if the eternal houſe not made with hands, were truly taken for their home, and their trade were to lay up a treaſure in Heaven. In Cities and Countries Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren would dwell in holy peace, and all concur in honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, if once they were made fellow Citizens with the Saints, and their Burgeſhip and converſation were in Heaven, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21.</p>

And your victory it ſelf muſt be by Faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. If Satan tell the fleſh of the preferment, riches, or the pleaſures of luſt, anſwer him with a <hi>believing foreſight</hi> of Gods <hi>Judgement,</hi> and the <hi>life</hi> to come. Never look on the baits of ſin alone, but ſtill look at once on God and on Eternity: As a juſt Judge will hear both parties ſpeak, or ſee their evidences before he will determine: So tell the Tempter, that as you have heard what fleſhly allurements can ſay, you will ſee alſo what the Word of God ſaith, and take a view of Heaven and Hell, and then you will anſwer him.</p>

If they could but diſcover more clearly and certainly, the principles, and elements, and forms of Beings; the nature of ſpirits; the cauſes of motion; the nature and cauſe of light and heat; the order, courſe and harmony of the univerſal ſyſteme of the world; what joyful acclamations would this produce, in the literal ſtudious ſort of men! what joy then ſhould it be to us, to know by Faith the God that made us; the Creation of the world, the Laws and Promiſes of our Creatour, the Myſteries of Redemption and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the frame of the new Creature, the entertainment of the ſpirits of the juſt with Chriſt, the Judgement which all the world muſt undergo, the work and company which we ſhall have hereafter, and the endleſs joyes which all the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſhall poſſeſs in the ſight and Love of God for ever? How bleſſed an invention would it be, if all the world could be brought again to the uſe of one univerſal language?

Go forth then in triumph, and not with terrour, O my ſoul! The prize is won: Poſſeſs the things which thou haſt ſo long prayed for, and ſought! Make haſte and enter into thy Maſters joy!

Sit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of God! And receive that which Chriſt in his Covenant did promiſe to give thee at the laſt. Go boldly to that bleſſed God, with whom thou haſt ſo powerful a Mediatour; and to the Throne of whoſe grace, thou haſt had ſo oft and ſweet acceſs. If Heaven be thy fear or ſorrow, what can

If grace have taught thee long ago, to prefer the heavenly and durable felicity; refuſe it not now when thou art ſo near the port! if it have taught thee long ago, to be as a ſtranger in this <hi>Sodom,</hi> and to renounce this ſinful world and fleſh; linger not now as unwilling to depart; repent not of thy choice, when all that the world can do for thee is paſt, repent not of thy warfare, when thou haſt got the victory; nor of thy voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, when thou art paſt the ſtorms and waves, and ready to land at the haven of felicity.</hi>

Such a death doth not uſe to be the period of a fleſhly worldly life; nor of a careleſs, dull and negligent life. Nature, which brought us into the world, without our forecaſt or care, will turn us out of the world without it: But it will not give us a joyful paſſage, nor bring us to a <hi>better</hi> world without it. It coſteth worldlings no ſmall care to <hi>die</hi> in an <hi>honourable</hi> or <hi>plentiful eſtate,</hi> (that they may fall from an higher place than others, and may have ſomething to make death more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and unwelcome to them, and may have a greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to make at Judgement; and that their paſſage to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven may be as a Camels through a Needle.) And may a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving joyful death be expected, without the preparations of <hi>exerciſe</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> in a <hi>believing life?</hi> Nature is ſo much afraid of dying, and an <hi>incorporated ſoul</hi> is ſo incarcerated in <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and ſo hardly riſeth to ſerious and ſatisfying apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the unſeen world, that even true Believers, do find it a work of no ſmall difficulty, to deſire to depart, and be with Chriſt, and to die in the joyful hopes of faith. A little <hi>abatement</hi> of the <hi>terrours</hi> of death, a little <hi>ſupporting hope and peace,</hi> is all that the greater part of them attain, inſtead of the fervent deſires, and triumphant joyes, which the lively belief of endleſs glory ſhould produce. O therefore make it the work of your lives! of all your lives! your greateſt work; your conſtant work, to live by faith; that the faith which hath

               <p>WHen you have thus ſeen what evidence there is of GOD, and his Government, and of a life of reward and puniſhment hereafter, and of the natural obligations which lie on man to a <hi>holy, juſt,</hi> and <hi>ſober life</hi>; and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved ſtate of the world, which goeth ſo contrary to ſuch undoubted duty; and how certain all this is even by natural revelation; proceed next to conſider what <hi>ſupernatural reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> God hath added, both to confirm you in the <hi>ſame</hi> Truths, and to make known <hi>ſuch other,</hi> as were neceſſary for mankind to know. Where I muſt firſt direct you in the <hi>true Method of Enquiry,</hi> and then ſet before you the <hi>things themſelves,</hi> which you are to know.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Think not that every unprepared mind is immediately ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Truth</hi> (either <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>any other,</hi> except the firſt principles which are <hi>nota per ſe,</hi> or are next to ſenſe.) All truth requireth a <hi>capacity,</hi> and due <hi>preparation</hi> of the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient: The plaineſt principles of any Art or Science, are not underſtood by novices at the firſt fight or hearing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were vain to imagine that things of the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in hiſtory, or profundity in doctrine, can be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended at the firſt attempt, by a diſuſed and unfurniſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. There muſt be at leaſt, as much <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>ſtudy,</hi> and <hi>help</hi> ſuppoſed and uſed, to the full diſcerning of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of faith, as are allowed to the attainment of common Sciences. Though grace, in leſs time, may give men ſo much light as is neceſſary to ſalvation; yet he that will be able to defend the Truth, and anſwer Objections, and attain eſtabliſhing ſatisfaction in his own mind, muſt (ordinarily) have proportionable <hi>helps,</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>ſtudyes</hi>; unleſs he look to be taught by miracles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Remember that <hi>it is a practical and heavenly doctrine
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59417:57"/>
which you are to learn:</hi> It is the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>loving God,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy in his love. And therefore a <hi>worldly, ſenſual, vicious</hi> ſoul, muſt needs be under very great diſadvantage for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of ſuch a <hi>kind</hi> of Truths. Do not therefore impute that to the <hi>doubtfulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which is but the effect of the <hi>enmity</hi> and <hi>incapacity</hi> of your minds: How can he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently relliſh the ſpiritual and heavenly doctrine of the Goſpel, who is drowned in the love and care of contrary things? Such men receive not the things of the Spirit: They ſeem to them both <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> and <hi>undeſirable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Think not that the hiſtory of things done ſo long ago, and ſo far off, ſhould have no more obſcurities, nor be liable to any more Objections, than of that which was done in the time and Country where you live.</hi> Nor yet that things done in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of others,</hi> and words ſpoken in their hearing only, ſhould be known to you otherwiſe than by <hi>hiſtorical evidence,</hi> (unleſs every Revelation to others, muſt have a new Revelation to bring it to each individual perſon in the world.) And think not that he who is a ſtranger to all other helps of Church-hiſtory, ſhould be as well able to underſtand the Scripture-hiſtory, as thoſe that have thoſe other helps.</p>

The miracles which were wrought to confirm our hiſtory, are brought to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only by <hi>other hiſtory.</hi> The Doctrines which are evident in nature, have further evidence of ſupernatural revelation, only to help us whoſe natural fight is much obſcured. But it is the <hi>ſupernatural Doctrines, Precepts</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> which of themſelves require ſupernatural revelation, to make them credible to man.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Miſtake not the true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and End of the holy Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Think not that the Goſpel as written was the firſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive</hi> or <hi>Governing Law</hi> of Chriſt, for the Chriſtian Churches. The Churches were <hi>conſtituted,</hi> and the <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of it ſettled, and exerciſed very many years together, before any part of the New Teſtament was written to them; much more before the writing of the whole. The Apoſtles had long before taught them what was commanded them by Chriſt; and had ſettled them in the order appointed by the Holy Ghoſt: And therefore you are not to look for the firſt determination of ſuch doctrines or orders in the Scripture as made thereby; but only for the <hi>Records</hi> of what was done and eſtabliſhed before: For the Apoſtles being to leave the world, did know the ſlipperineſs of the memory of man, and the danger of changing and corrupting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine and Orders, if there were not left a ſure record of it: And therefore they did that for the ſake of poſterity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>You muſt not think that all is eſſential to the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is contained in the holy Scriptures:</hi> Nor that they are only the adequate form or record of that which is ſtrictly and primarily called our <hi>Religion,</hi> or Chriſtianity. For there are divers particular Books of the New Teſtament, which contain much more than is eſſential to Chriſtianity: And many appurtenances, and hiſtories, and genealogies, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are there recorded, which are indeed ſubſervient helps to our Religion; but are not ſtrictly our Religion it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As the uſe of the Scripture muſt thus be judged of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59417:58"/>
according to the purpoſe of the holy Spirit; ſo the <hi>Perfection of the Scripture muſt be judged of, in relation to its intended uſe.</hi> It was not written to be a ſyſteme of <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> nor <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>; nor to decide grammatical Controverſies about words; but to record in apt expreſſions the things which God would have men to know, in order to their <hi>faith,</hi> their <hi>duty,</hi> and their <hi>happineſs.</hi> And in this reſpect it is a perfect word. But you muſt not imagine that it is ſo far the word of God himſelf, as if God had ſhewed in it his fulleſt skill, and made it as perfect in every reſpect, both phraſe and order, as God could do. And if you meet in it with ſeveral words, which you think are leſs grammatical, logical, or rhetorical, than many other men could ſpeak, and which really ſavour of ſome humane imperfection, remember that this is not at all dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to Chriſtianity; but rather tendeth to the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our faith: For the Scriptures are perfect to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended uſe: And God did purpoſely chuſe men of imperfect Oratory, to be his Apoſtles, that his Kingdom might not be in <hi>word,</hi> but in <hi>power</hi>; and that our faith might not be built upon the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and oratory of man, but on the ſupernatural operations of the Almighty God: As <hi>David</hi>'s ſling and ſtone muſt kill <hi>Goliah:</hi> So unlearned men, that cannot out-wit the world to deceive them, ſhall by the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them. Looking for that in the Scripture, which God never intended it for, doth tempt the unskilful into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Therefore you muſt be ſure to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which is the <hi>vital part</hi> or <hi>kernel</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> from all the <hi>reſt</hi>: And to get well planted in your mind, the ſumm of that Religion it ſelf. And that is briefly contained in the two Sacraments, and more <hi>largely</hi> in the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> the ſummaryes of our <hi>Belief, Deſire</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> And then wonder no more that the other parts of Scripture, have ſome things of leſs moment, than that a man hath fingers, nails and hair, as well as a ſtomach, heart and head.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Diſtinguiſh therefore between the <hi>Method</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Method</hi> of the <hi>particular Books</hi> of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. The <hi>Books</hi> were written on ſeveral occaſions, and in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59417:58"/>
ſeveral <hi>Methods</hi>; and though that method of them all, be perfect, in order to their proper end; yet is it not neceſſary that there be in the <hi>Method</hi> no <hi>humane imperfection,</hi> or that one or all of them, be written in that method which is uſually moſt logical, and beſt. But the <hi>frame</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> contained in thoſe Books, is compoſed in the moſt perfect method in the world. And thoſe <hi>ſyſtemes</hi> of <hi>Theology</hi> which endeavour to open this method to you, do not <hi>feign</hi> it, or make it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but only attempt the explication of what they find in the holy Scriptures, Synthetically or Analytically: (Though indeed all attempts have yet fallen ſhort of any full explication of this divine and perfect harmony.)</p>
               <p n="11">11. Therefore the <hi>true Order of ſettling your faith, is not firſt to require a proof that all the Scriptures is the Word of God; but firſt to prove the marrow of them,</hi> which is <hi>properly called the Chriſtian Religion, and then to proceed to ſtrengthen your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular belief of the reſt.</hi> The contrary opinion, which hath obtained with many in this Age, hath greatly hindered the faith of the unskilful: And it came from a prepoſterous care of the honour of the Scriptures, through an exceſſive oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Papiſts who undervalue them. For hence it comes to paſs, that every <hi>ſeeming contradiction,</hi> or inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in any Book of Scripture, in Chronology or any other reſpect, is thought to be a ſufficient cauſe, to make the whole cauſe of Chriſtianity as difficult as that particular text is: And ſo all thoſe Readers, who meet with great or inſeparable difficulties, in their daily reading of the Scriptures, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by expoſed to equal temptations, to damning infidelity it ſelf: So that if the Tempter draw any man to doubt of the ſtanding ſtill of the Sun in the time of <hi>Joſhua</hi>; of the life of <hi>Jonas</hi> in the belly of the Whale; or any other ſuch paſſage in any one Book of the Scriptures, he muſt equally doubt of all his Religion.</p>
               <p>But this was not the ancient method of faith: It was many years after Chriſts reſurrection, before any one Book of the New Teſtament was written; and almoſt an Age before it was finiſhed: And all that time the Chriſtian Churches had the <hi>ſame Faith and Religion</hi> as we have now; and the ſame <hi>foundation</hi> of it: That is, the Goſpel preached to them by the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59417:59"/>
Apoſtles: But what they delivered to them by word of mouth, is now delivered to us in their writings, with all the appurtenances and circumſtances, which every Chriſtian did not then hear of. And there were many Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, which the Old Teſtament did not at all make known: (As that <hi>this Jeſus</hi> is the Chriſt; that he <hi>was born</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and is actually crucified, riſen and aſcended, &amp;c.) And the method of the Apoſtles was, to teach the people, the <hi>ſumm of Chriſtianity</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, 4, &amp;c. and <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2.) and to bring them to the <hi>belief of that,</hi> and then <hi>baptize</hi> them, before they <hi>wrote</hi> any thing to them, or taught them the reſt which is now in the holy Scriptures; They were firſt to <hi>Diſciple the Nations and baptize them,</hi> and then to <hi>teach</hi> them to <hi>obſerve all things whatever Chriſt commanded:</hi> And the main bulk of the Scriptures is made up of this laſt, and of the main ſubſervient hiſtories and helps.</p>
               <p>And accordingly it was the cuſtom of all the Primitive Churches, and ancient Doctors, to teach the people firſt the Creed and ſumm of Chriſtianity, and to make them Chriſtians before they taught them ſo much as to know what Books the Canonical Scriptures did contain: For they had the ſumm of Chriſtianity it ſelf delivered down collaterally by the two hands of tradition. 1. By the continuation of Baptiſm, and publick Church-profeſſions, was delivered the Creed or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by it ſelf: And 2. By the holy Scriptures, where it was delivered with all the reſt; and from whence every novice was not put to gather it of himſelf; but had it collected to his hand by the Churches.</p>
               <p>And you may ſee in the writings of all the ancient defenders of Chriſtianity <hi>(Juſtin, Athenagoras, Talianus, Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus, Arnobius, Theoph. Antioch. Lactantius, Tertullian, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſebius, Auguſtine, &amp;c.)</hi> that they uſed the method which I now direct you to.</p>
               <p>And if you conſider it well, you will find that the miracles of Chriſt himſelf, and all thoſe of his Apoſtles after him, were wrought for the confirmation of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,</hi> and moſtly before the particular Epiſtles or Books were written; and therefore were only remotely and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially for the confirmation of thoſe Books as ſuch: as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59417:59"/>
they proved that the Writers of them were guided by the infallible Spirit, in all the proper work of their office; of which the writing of the Scriptures was a part.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore ſettle your belief of Chriſtianity it ſelf; that is, of ſo much as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> containeth, or importeth: This is more eaſily proved, than the truth of every word in the Scriptures; becauſe there are controverſies about the Canon, and the various readings, and ſuch like: And this is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral method, which Chriſt and his Spirit have directed us to, and the Apoſtles and the ancient Churches uſed. And when this is firſt ſoundly proved to you, then you cannot juſtly take any textual difficulties, to be ſufficient cauſe of raiſing difficulties to your faith in the eſſentials: But you may quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go on in the ſtrength of faith, to clear up all thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties by degrees.</p>
               <p>I know you will meet with ſome who think very highly of their own miſtakes, and whoſe unskilfulneſs in theſe things is joyned with an equal meaſure of ſelf conceitedneſs, who will tell you that this method ſmells of an undervaluing of the Scripture: But I would adviſe you not to depart from the way of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles and Churches, nor to caſt your ſelves upon cauſeleſs hinderances, in ſo high a matter as <hi>Saving Faith</hi> is, upon the reverence of the words of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted factious wrangler, nor to eſcape the fangs of cenſorious ignorance. We cannot better juſtifie the holy Scriptures in the <hi>true Method,</hi> than they can in their <hi>falſe one:</hi> And can better build up, when we have laid the right foundation, than they can who begin in the middle, and omit the foundation, and call the ſuperſtructure by that name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suſpect not all Church-hiſtory or Tradition, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme oppoſition to the Papiſts, who cry up a private un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Tradition of their own. They tell us of Apoſtolical Traditions, which their own faction only are the keep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs of; and of which no true hiſtorical evidence is produced: And this they call the Tradition of the Church: But we have another ſort of Tradition, which muſt not be neglected or rejected, unleſs we will deny humanity, and reject Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Our <hi>Traditio tradens,</hi> or <hi>active Tradition,</hi> is primarily nothing but the certain hiſtory or uſage of the univerſal
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59417:60"/>
Chriſtian Church; as Baptiſm, the Lords day, the Miniſtry, the Church Aſſemblies, and the daily Church exerciſes; which are certain proofs what Religion was then received by them. And 2. The Scriptures themſelves. Our <hi>Traditio tradita</hi> is nothing elſe but theſe two conjunctly: 1. The Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, even the <hi>Faith</hi> then profeſſed, and the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> then exerciſed. 2. The <hi>Books</hi> themſelves, of the holy Scriptures, which contain all this, with much more. But we are ſo far from thinking that Apoſtolical Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is a ſupplement to the Scriptures, as being larger than them, that we believe the Scriptures to be much larger than ſuch Tradition; and that we have no certainty by any other than Scriptural Tradition, of any more than the common matters of Chriſtianity, which all the Churches are agreed in. But he that will not believe the moſt univerſal practice and hiſtory of the Church or world in a matter of fact, muſt in reaſon much leſs believe his eye-ſight.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>When you have ſoundly proved your foundation, take not every difficult objection which you cannot anſwer, to be a ſufficient cauſe of doubting:</hi> For if the fundamentals be proved truths, you may truſt to that proof, and be ſure that there are waies of ſolving the ſeeming inconſiſtent points, though you are not yet acquainted with them. There are few Truths ſo clear, which a ſophiſter may not clog with difficulties: And there is ſcarce any man that hath ſo comprehenſive a knowledge of the moſt certain Truths, as to be able to anſwer all that can be ſaid againſt it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Come not to this ſtudy in a melancholy or diſtracted frame of mind:</hi> For in ſuch a caſe you are (ordinarily) incapable of ſo great a work, as the tryal of the grounds of Faith: And therefore muſt live upon the ground-work before laid, and wait for a fitter time to clear it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>When new doubts ariſe, mark whether they proceed not from the advantage which the tempter findeth in your minds, rather than from the difficulty of the thing it ſelf:</hi> And whether you have not formerly had good ſatisfaction againſt the ſame doubts which now perplex you: If ſo, ſuffer not every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure of your minds, to become a means of unbelief: And ſuffer not Satan to command you to diſpute your faith
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59417:60"/>
at his pleaſure: For if he may chuſe the time, he may chuſe the ſucceſs. Many a man hath caſt up a large account well, or written a learned Treatiſe or Poſition well, who cannot clear up all objected difficulties on a ſudden, nor without Books tell you all that he before wrote; eſpecially if he be half drunk or ſleepy, or in the midſt of other thoughts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="15">15. When you are once perſwaded of the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and the holy Scriptures, <hi>think not that you need not ſtudy it any more, becauſe you do already confidently believe it:</hi> For if your faith be not built on ſuch cogent evidence as will warrant the concluſion (whether it be at the preſent ſound or not) you know not what change aſſaults may make upon you (as we have known them do on ſome ancient eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the ſtricteſt Godlineſs, who have turned from Chriſt, and the belief of immortality.)</p>
               <p>Take heed how you underſtand the common ſaying of the Schools, that <hi>Faith differeth from Knowledge, in that it hath not Evidence:</hi> It hath not <hi>evidence of ſenſe</hi> indeed; nor the immediate evidence of things inviſible, as in <hi>themſelves</hi>; but as they are the concluſions which follow the principles which are in themſelves more evident. It is evident that God is true; and we can prove by good evidence, that the Chriſtian Verity is his Revelation: And therefore it is evident (though not immediately in it ſelf) that the matter of that word or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is true. And as Mr. <hi>Rich. Hooker</hi> truly ſaith [No man indeed believeth beyond the degree of evidence of truth which appeareth to him, how confidently ſoever they may talk.] I remember that our excellent <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> anſwered me to this caſe, as out of <hi>Ariminenſis,</hi> that [faith hath <hi>evidence of Credibility, and ſcience hath evidence of Certainty.</hi>] But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly an evidence of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> is evidence of <hi>Certainty.</hi> And all evidence of <hi>Divine Credibility,</hi> is evidence of <hi>Certainty</hi>; though of <hi>humane faith and credibility,</hi> the caſe be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Yea, <hi>think not that you have done the ſettling of your faith, when once you have found out the ſoundeſt evidences, and are able to anſwer all Objections:</hi> For you muſt <hi>grow</hi> ſtill in the fuller diſcerning and digeſting the ſame evidences which you have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59417:61"/>
diſcerned: For you may hold them ſo looſely, that they may be eaſily wreſted from you: And you may ſee them with ſo clear and full a knowledge, as ſhall ſtabliſh your mind againſt all ordinary cauſes of mutation. It is one kind (or degree rather) of knowledge of the ſame things, which the Pupil, and another which the Doctor hath. I am ſure the knowledge which I have now of the evidences of the Chriſtian Verity, is much different from what I had thirty years ago, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I could ſay neer as much as now; and uſed the ſame Arguments.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Conſider <hi>well the great contentions of Philoſophers; and the great uncertainty of moſt of thoſe Nations, to which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels would reduce our faith, or which they would make the teſt by which to try it.</hi> They judge Chriſtianity uncertain, becauſe it agreeth not with their uncertainties, or certain errours.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Enſlave not your Reaſon to the objects of ſenſe:</hi> While we are in the body, our ſouls are ſo impriſoned in fleſh, and have ſo much to do with worldly things, that moſt men by averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſuſe, can hardly at all employ their minds about any higher things than ſenſitive; nor go any further than ſenſe conduceth them.

               <p>THeſe things in the <hi>Order</hi> of your enquiry being preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, proceed to the conſideration of the Evidences them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which fully prove the Chriſtian Verity: And here (omitting the preparatory conſiderations recited at large in my [<hi>Reaſons</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi>] I ſhall only ſet before you the <hi>grand Evidence it ſelf,</hi> with a brief recital of ſome of thoſe means, which bring it down to our notice in theſe times.</p>
               <p>The great infallible witneſs of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> is the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>: Or that divine operation of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which infallibly proveth the <hi>atteſtation</hi> of <hi>God himſelf,</hi> as <hi>intereſting</hi> him in it, as the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we know the Coin of a <hi>Prince</hi> by his <hi>image</hi> and <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> and know his acts by his publick proper <hi>Seal</hi>: And as we know that God is the Creatour of the world, by the <hi>Seal</hi> of his likeneſs which is upon it: Or as we know the Father of a <hi>child,</hi> when he is ſo like him, as no other could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get: So know we <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to be of <hi>God,</hi> by his unimitable <hi>image</hi> or <hi>impreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Power, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> are the eſſentiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we call the <hi>Nature</hi> of God: Theſe in their <hi>proper form,</hi> and <hi>tranſcendent perfection,</hi> are <hi>incommunicable:</hi> But when they produce an effect on the creature, which for the reſemblance may analogically be called by the ſame names; the <hi>names</hi> are logically <hi>communicable,</hi> though the thing it ſelf (which is the Divine Eſſence or Perfections) be ſtill <hi>incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable:</hi> But when they only produce effects more heterogeneal or equivocal, then we call thoſe effects only the <hi>footſteps</hi> or <hi>demonſtrations</hi> of their cauſe. So <hi>GOD,</hi> whoſe <hi>Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in it ſelf is <hi>incommunicable,</hi> hath produced <hi>intellectual natures,</hi> which are ſo like him, that their likeneſs is called his <hi>Image</hi>; and analogically (yet equivocally) the created faculties of their <hi>Power, Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>; are called

Even ſo the perſon and doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Chriſtian Religion objectively</hi> conſidered, hath ſo much of the <hi>Image,</hi> and ſo much of the <hi>demonſtrative impreſſions</hi> of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, as may fully aſſure us that he himſelf is the approving cauſe.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Sun</hi> hath a double <hi>Light, Lux &amp; Lumen,</hi> its <hi>eſſential Light</hi> in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and its <hi>emitted beams,</hi> or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <hi>Light</hi>; ſo the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> of God, by which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> are demonſtrated, are partly that which is <hi>eſſential, conſtitutive,</hi> and <hi>inherent,</hi> and partly that which is <hi>ſent</hi> and <hi>communicated</hi> from him to others.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there is the moſt excellent Image of God. 1. Wonderful <hi>Power,</hi> by which he wrought miracles, and commanded Sea and Land, Men and Devils, and raiſed the dead, and raiſed himſelf; and is now the glorious Lord of all things. 2. Wonderful <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> by which he formed his Laws, and Kingdom, and by which he knew the hearts of men, and prophecied of things to come. 3. Moſt wonderful <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> by which he healed all diſeaſes, and by which he ſaved miſerable ſouls, and procured our happineſs at ſo dear a rate.</p>
               <p>But as the <hi>eſſential Light</hi> of the Sun, is too glorious to be well obſerved by us; but the <hi>emitted Light</hi> is it which doth affect our eyes, and is the immediate object of our ſight; at leaſt that we can beſt endure and uſe; ſo the <hi>Eſſential Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, are not ſo immediately and ordinarily fit for our obſervation and uſe, as the <hi>leſſer communicated beams,</hi> which he ſent forth. And theſe are either ſuch as were the

immediate effects of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in Chriſt himſelf, or his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal operations, or elſe the effects of his Spirit in <hi>others:</hi> And that is either ſuch as went <hi>before him,</hi> or ſuch as were <hi>preſent with him,</hi> or ſuch as <hi>followed after him:</hi> Even as the <hi>emitted Light</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> is either that which is next to its <hi>Eſſence</hi>; or that which ſtreameth further to other creatures: And this laſt is either that which it ſendeth to us before its own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing or riſing, or that which accompanieth its appearing, or that which leaveth behind it as it ſetteth or paſſeth away; ſo muſt we diſtinguiſh in the preſent caſe.</p>

Omnipotency, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and the three perſons in the Trinity, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi>; and the three Cauſalities of God, as the <hi>Efficient, Directive</hi> and <hi>final Cauſe, (of whom,</hi> and <hi>through whom,</hi> and <hi>to whom are all things</hi>) ſhould have three moſt eminent <hi>ſpecimina</hi> or <hi>impreſſions</hi> in the world, or three moſt conſpicuous works to declare and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them; <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Eſpecially when man had fallen by ſin from the Love of God, to the Love of his carnal ſelf, and of the creature; and when he was fallen under vindictive Juſtice, and was conſcious of the diſpleaſure of his Maker, and had made himſelf an heir of Hell: And when mans nature can ſo hardly love one that in Juſtice ſtandeth engaged or reſolved to damn him, forſake him, and hate him: How wiſely is it ordered that he that would recover him to his Love, ſhould firſt declare his Love to the offender in the fulleſt ſort, and ſhould reconcile himſelf unto him, and ſhew his readineſs to forgive him, and to ſave him, yea to be his felicity and his chiefeſt good: That ſo the Remedy may be anſwerable to the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> and to the <hi>duty.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. And yet how meet was it, that while we live in ſuch a dark material world, in a body of corruptible fleſh, among enemies and ſnares, our duty ſhould have ſomewhat of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vigilancy, and therefore of <hi>fear</hi> and godly ſorrow to teach us to relliſh grace the more: And that our condition ſhould have in it much of neceſſity and trouble, to drive us homeward to God, who is our reſt. And how aptly doth the very permiſſion of ſin it ſelf, ſubſerve this end?</p>
               <p n="6">6. How wiſely is it thus contrived, that <hi>Glory</hi> at laſt ſhould be better relliſhed, and that <hi>man</hi> who hath the <hi>Joy</hi> ſhould give <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi>; and be bound to this by a double obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. How aptly is this remedying deſign, and all the work of mans Redemption, and all the Precepts of the Goſpel, built upon, or planted into the Law of <hi>natural perfection: Faith</hi> being but the means to recover <hi>Love</hi>; and <hi>Grace</hi> being to <hi>Nature,</hi> but as <hi>Medicine</hi> is to the <hi>Body</hi>; and being to <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as <hi>Medicine</hi> is to <hi>Health:</hi> So that as a man that was never taught to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> or to <hi>go,</hi> or to do any <hi>work,</hi> or to know any ſcience, or <hi>trade,</hi> or <hi>buſineſs,</hi> which muſt be known acquiſitively, is a miſerable man, as wanting all that which ſhould help him to <hi>uſe</hi> his natural powers to their proper ends; ſo it is much more with him that hath <hi>Nature</hi> without <hi>Grace,</hi> which muſt <hi>heal</hi> it, and uſe it to its proper ends.</p>
               <p n="8">8. So that it appeareth, that as the <hi>Love of Perfection</hi> is fitly called the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> becauſe it is agreeable to man in his <hi>Natural ſtate of Innocency</hi>; ſo the <hi>Law of Grace</hi> may be now called, the <hi>Law of depraved Nature,</hi> becauſe it is as ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>lapſed man.</hi> And when our pravity is undeniable, how credible ſhould it be, that we have ſuch a Law?</p>
               <p n="9">9. And there is nothing in the Goſpel, either unſuitable to the firſt Law of Nature, or contradictory to it, or yet of any alien nature; but only that which hath the moſt excellent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to ſubſerve it: <hi>Giving the Glory to God in the higheſt,</hi> by reſtoring <hi>Peace unto the Earth, and Goodneſs towards men.</hi>

And when the <hi>Divine Monarchy</hi> is apt in the order of Government, to communicate ſome <hi>Image</hi> of it ſelf to the <hi>Creature,</hi> as well as the <hi>Divine Perfections</hi> have communicated their <hi>Image</hi> to the <hi>Creatures</hi> in their <hi>Natures</hi> or <hi>Beings,</hi> how wiſely it is ordered, that mankind ſhould have <hi>one univerſal Vicarious Head</hi> or <hi>Monarch?</hi> There is great reaſon to believe that there is <hi>Monarchy</hi> among <hi>Angels:</hi> And in the world it moſt apparently excelleth all other forms of Government, in order to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>Glory:</hi> and if it be apter than ſome others to degenerate into <hi>oppreſſing Tyranny,</hi> that is only cauſed by the great corruption of humane Nature: and therefore if we have a <hi>Head</hi> who hath no ſuch corruption, there is no place for that objection. And as it is not credible that God would make no communication of this Image of his Dominions in the world; ſo it is certain, that beſides the Lord Jeſus, the world hath no other Univerſal Head (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Pope may pretend, to be an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Vicarious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, under the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Vicarious Monarch.</hi>) Kingdoms have their Monarchs ſubordinate to Chriſt; but the <hi>world</hi> hath none but Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And how meet was it that he who was the Monarch or Deputy of God, ſhould be alſo the <hi>Mediatour</hi>! and that a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted ſinner dwelling in clay, ſhould not come <hi>immediately</hi> to God, but by a <hi>Reconciler,</hi> who is <hi>worthy</hi> to prevail.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And when we had loſt the <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> and of the <hi>world</hi> to come, and of the <hi>way</hi> thereto; yea and of our <hi>ſelves</hi> too, and our own immortality of ſoul; how meet was it that a <hi>ſure Revelation</hi> ſhould ſettle us; that we might know what to <hi>ſeek,</hi> and whither to return, and by what way! ſeeing <hi>Light</hi> muſt be the guide of our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> And who could ſo infallibly and ſatisfactorily do this, as a Teacher ſent from God, of perfecteſt knowledge and veracity.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And when God intended the free forgiveneſs of our ſins, how meet was it that he who would be the Mediatour of our pardon, ſhould yield to thoſe terms, which are conſiſtent with the ends of Government, and expoſe not the wiſdom, and veracity, and juſtice, and the Laws of God to the worlds contempt: If no mark of odiouſneſs ſhould be put upon ſin, nor any demonſtration of Juſtice been made, the Devil would
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59417:64"/>
have triumphed, and ſaid, Did not I ſay truer than God? when he told you of <hi>dying,</hi> and I told you that you ſhould not die? And if the grand penalty had been remitted to the world, for four thouſand years together ſucceſſively, without any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient demonſtration of Gods Juſtice undertaken, why ſhould any ſinner have feared Hell to the worlds end? If you ſay, that <hi>Repentance alone</hi> might be ſufficient, I anſwer, 1. That is no vindication of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of the Law-maker. 2. Who ſhould <hi>bring</hi> a ſinner to <hi>Repentance,</hi> whoſe heart is corrupted with the love of ſin? 3. It would hinder <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> if men knew that God can forgive all the world upon bare <hi>Repentance,</hi> without any reparation of the breaches made by ſin, in the order of the world. For if he that threatneth future miſery or death for ſin, can abſolutely diſpenſe with that commination, they may think that he may do ſo as eaſily by his threatning of death to the <hi>impenitent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ſay, that <hi>Threatnings</hi> in a Law, are not <hi>falſe,</hi> when they are not fulfilled, becauſe they ſpeak not <hi>de event<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Or if any ſhall think, that all this proveth not a <hi>demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> on the Redeemer to be abſolutely neceſſary, but that God could have pardoned the penitent without it; it is nevertheleſs manifeſt, that this was a very wiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous way: As he that cannot prove that God could not have illuminated, and moved, and quickened the inferiour ſenſitives without the Sun, may yet prove that the Sun is a noble creature, in whoſe operations Gods Wiſdom, and Power, and Goodneſs do appear.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And how agreeable is this doctrine of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the common doctrine of <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> which hath been received throughout almoſt all the world! And who can imagine any other original of that practice, ſo early and ſo univerſally obtaining, than either divine revelation, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what even in nature, which beareth witneſs to the neceſſity

                  </gap>is, ſhould be <hi>Man,</hi> and yet <hi>more than Man,</hi> even God? That the Monarch of Mankind, and the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and the Teacher of Man, and the Sacrifice for ſin, ſhould not be only of another kind; but that he be one that is fit to be familiar with man, and to be intereſted naturally in <hi>his</hi> concerns; and one that is by <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>nearneſs</hi> capable of theſe undertakings and relations? And yet that he be ſo high and near the <hi>Father,</hi> as may put a ſufficient value on his works, and make him moſt meet to mediate for us?</p>
               <p n="16">16. How wiſely is it ordered, that with a perfect doctrine, we ſhould have the pattern of a <hi>perfect life,</hi> as knowing how agreeable the way of imitation is to our natures and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities?</p>
               <p n="17">17. And as a <hi>pattern</hi> of <hi>all other</hi> vertue is ſtill before us; ſo how fit was it, eſpecially that we ſhould have a lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to teach us to <hi>contemn this deceitful world,</hi> and to ſet little comparatively, by reputation, wealth, preheminence, grandeur, pleaſures, yea and life it ſelf, which are the things which all that periſh prefer before God and immortality?</p>
               <p n="18">18. And how needful is it that they that muſt be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with renewed faults, ſhould have a daily remedy and refuge, and a plaiſter for their wounds; and a more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able name than their own to plead with God for pardon?</p>
               <p n="19">19. How meet was it that our Saviour ſhould riſe from the <hi>dead</hi> (and conſequently that he ſhould die) to ſhew us, that his Sacrifice was accepted, and that there is indeed another life for man; and that death and the grave ſhall not ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us?</p>
               <p n="20">20. And how meet was it that our Saviour ſhould aſcend into Heaven, and therein our natures be glorified with God; that he might have all power to finiſh the work of mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his poſſeſſion might be a pledge of our future poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion?</p>
               <p n="21">21. Moſt wiſely alſo is it ordered of God, that man might not be left under the Covenant of Works, or of entire nature, which after it was broken, could never juſtifie him, and which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59417:65"/>
was now unſuitable to his lapſed ſtate, and that God ſhould make a New Covenant with him as his <hi>Redeemer,</hi> as he made the firſt as his Creatour: and that an Act of general pardon and oblivion, might ſecure us of forgiveneſs and everlaſting life: And that as we had a Rule to live by for preventing ſin and miſery, we might have a Rule for our duty in order to our recovery.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And what more convenient conditions could this Covenant have had, than [<hi>a believing and thankful Acceptance of the mercy, and a penitent and obedient following of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer unto everlaſting life?</hi>]</p>
               <p n="23">23. And how convenient is it; that when our King is to depart from earth, and keep his reſidence in the Court of Heaven, he ſhould appoint his Officers to manage the humane part of his remaining work on earth? And that ſome ſhould do the extraordinary work, in laying the foundation, and leaving a certain Rule and Order to the reſt, and that the reſt ſhould proceed to build hereupon; and that the wiſeſt and the beſt of men, ſhould be the Teachers and Guides of the reſt unto the end.</p>
               <p n="24">24. And how neceſſary was it that our Sun in glory ſhould continually ſend down his beams and influence on the earth? even the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> to be his conſtant <hi>Agent</hi> here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and to plead his cauſe, and do his work on the hearts of men? and that the Apoſtles, who were to found the Church, ſhould have that Spirit, in ſo conſpicuous a degree, and for ſuch various works of <hi>Wonder</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> as might ſuffice to <hi>confirm</hi> their teſtimony to the world: And that all others as well as they to the end, ſhould have the Spirit for thoſe works of <hi>Love and Renovation,</hi> which are neceſſary to their <hi>own obedience</hi> and <hi>ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. How wiſely it is ordered, that he who is <hi>our King,</hi> is <hi>Lord of all,</hi> and able to defend his Church, and to repreſs his proudeſt enemies.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And alſo that he ſhould be our <hi>final Judge,</hi> who was our <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and made and ſealed that Covenant of Grace by which we muſt be judged: That Judgement may not be over dreadful, but rather deſirable to his faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who ſhall openly be juſtified by him before all.</p>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59417:66"/>27. How wiſely hath God ordered it, that when death is naturally ſo terrible to man, we ſhould have a Saviour that went that way before us, and was once dead, but now liveth, and is where we muſt be, and hath the keyes of death and Heaven; that we may boldly go forth as to his preſence, and to the innumerable perfected ſpirits of the juſt, and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ſouls to the hands of our Redeemer, and our Head.</p>
               <p n="28">28.

               <p n="5">5. But nothing of all theſe predictions doth ſhine ſo clearly to our ſelves, as thoſe great Promiſes of Chriſt, which are fulfilled to our ſelves, in all generations. Even the Promiſes and Prophetical deſcriptions of the great work of Converſion, Regeneration or Sanctification upon mens ſouls, which is wrought in all Ages, juſt according to the delineations of it in the world: All the humblings, the repentings, the deſires, the faith, the joyes, the prayers, and the anſwers of them, which were foretold, and was found in the firſt Believers, are

               <p>To which may be added, all the Prophecies of the extent of the Church; of the converſion of the Kingdoms of the world to Chriſt; and of the oppoſitions of the ungodly fort thereto; and of the perſecutions of the followers of Chriſt, which are all fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>WISDOM</hi> of God alſo is clearly manifeſted in the concatenation or harmony of all theſe Revelations: Not only that there is no real contradiction between them, but that they all conjunctly compoſe one entire frame: As the age of man goeth on from infancy to maturity, and nature fitteth her endowments and proviſions accordingly to each degree; ſo hath the Church proceeded from its infancy, and ſo have the Revelations of God been ſuited to its ſeveral times: Chriſt who was promiſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Fathers before <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the firſt two thouſand years, and ſignified by their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; was more fully revealed for the next two thouſand years, by <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt in a typical Goſpel (the adumbration of the grace to come) and then by the Prophets, (eſpecially <hi>Iſaiah, Micah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Malachi</hi>) in plainer predictions. And then came <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> the fore-runner, and Chriſt the Meſſiah, and the Spirit upon the Apoſtles, and finiſhed the Revelation: So that it may appear to be all one frame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and indicted by one Spirit. And the <hi>effects</hi> of it have been according to theſe degrees of the Revelation.</p>
               <p>And the end of the world (whether at the end of the laſt two thouſand years, or when elſe God pleaſeth) will ſhortly ſhew the unbelieving themſelves, that the period ſhall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill what is yet unfulfilled to the leaſt jot and tittle.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. The Image of Gods Goodneſs.</head>
               <p n="2">II. THE ſecond part of Gods Image on our <hi>Religion,</hi> is that of his matchleſs <hi>GOODNESS.</hi> The whole ſyſteme of it is, the harmonious expreſſion of <hi>GODS HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINESS</hi> and <hi>LOVE.</hi> The particulars I muſt but name, leſt I be too long.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59417:67"/>1. The <hi>Author</hi> of it, Jeſus Chriſt, was perfectly <hi>Good</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; being <hi>God</hi> and man; ſinleſs in nature, and in life; <hi>living,</hi> and <hi>dying,</hi> and <hi>riſing to do good</hi>; and making it his <hi>office</hi> and his work, even in Heaven, to do mankind the greateſt good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Matter</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion, is <hi>GOD</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the infinite Good. The uſe of it is, to teach men to <hi>know God,</hi> and to bring us to him. To which end it maketh a fuller diſcovery of his bleſſed nature, attributes and works, than is any where elſe to be found in this world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The utmoſt <hi>End</hi> of it is the higheſt imaginable; the pleaſing and glorifying of God: For he that is the Beginning of all, muſt needs be the End of all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It leadeth man to the higheſt ſtate of felicity for himſelf (which is an <hi>End</hi> conjunct in ſubordination to the <hi>higheſt.</hi>) There can be no greater happineſs imaginable, than the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion directeth us to attain.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It placeth our happineſs ſo certainly and clearly in that which is happineſs indeed, that it directeth mans intentions, and deſires, and leaveth them no longer to the old variety of opinions about the chiefeſt good: Nature perfected, and working by its perfecteſt acts upon the moſt perfect object, and receiving the moſt full communications from him, and this for ever, muſt needs be the moſt perfect felicity of man. To have all our faculties fully perfect, and to live for ever in the perfect light and love of God, and to be accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of him; this is the end of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To <hi>this end,</hi> the whole deſign of the Chriſtian Religion is to <hi>make man good,</hi> and to cure him of <hi>all evil,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him juſtly for that bleſſed ſtate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To <hi>that end</hi> the great work of Jeſus Chriſt is, to ſend down the <hi>ſanctifying Spirit of God,</hi> to make men new creatures, and to regenerate them to the Nature of God himſelf, and to a heavenly mind and life: That they may not only have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which are good, but the <hi>power</hi> of God to <hi>make</hi> them <hi>good,</hi> and a heavenly principle to fit them for Heaven.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To <hi>that end,</hi> the principal means is, the fulleſt revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the love of God to man, that ever was made, and more than is any where elſe revealed. All the deſign of Chriſtianity
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59417:68"/>
is but to ſhew God to man, in the fulleſt proſpect of his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and unmeaſurable <hi>Love,</hi> that ſo he may appear more <hi>ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to us; and may be more <hi>beloved</hi> by us; that <hi>Loving Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> may make us <hi>good,</hi> and make us <hi>happy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. To encourage us to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> God doth in the Goſpel give us the pardon of all our ſins, as ſoon as ever we turn to him by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance:</hi> Though we have deſerved Hell, he declareth that he will forgive us that deſert. If we had come to Hell before we had been redeemed, I think we ſhould have taken that Religion to be <hi>good</hi> indeed, which would have brought us the tydings of forgiveneſs, and ſhewed us ſo ready a way to eſcape.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And this <hi>mercy</hi> is given by an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Covenant,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to all, without exception: And the <hi>Conditions</hi> are ſo reaſonable, that no one can have any juſt pretence againſt them. It is but to accept the <hi>mercy offered</hi> with a <hi>believing thankfull mind,</hi> as a condemned man would do a pardon. And what can be more ſuitable to our miſerable ſtate?</p>
               <p n="11">11. And to bring us to all this, and make us <hi>holy,</hi> Chriſt hath given us a moſt <hi>holy</hi> word and doctrine: perfectly holy in its <hi>precepts,</hi> and in its <hi>prohibitions,</hi> and all the ſubſervient hiſtories and narratives: And he hath added the perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of his <hi>holy life,</hi> that our <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> might agree.</p>
               <p n="12">12. So <hi>good</hi> is this word, that it calleth us to the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and maketh <hi>Perfection</hi> it ſelf our <hi>duty</hi>; that our <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> may agree; and we may not have <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> to be <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>miſerable</hi>; but may be every way <hi>bound</hi> to our <hi>own felicity:</hi> And yet ſo <hi>good</hi> is this Covenant of Grace, that it taketh not advantage of our infirmities to ruine us, but noteth them to <hi>humble</hi> us, in order to our cure: And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> accepteth <hi>ſincerity,</hi> though it command <hi>perfection.</hi> And Chriſt looketh not at our failings, as a ſevere Judge, but as a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and a tender Father.</p>
               <p n="13">13. So <hi>good</hi> is our Religion, that the great thing which it requireth of us, is to prefer the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> before the leſſer, and not to be like children who take it for their riches to fill their pin-box; or like fooliſh Merchants, who had rather trade for truth, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59417:68"/>
meat, and drink, and luſt, and ſports, and wealth, and worldly honours; that the <hi>Love</hi> of God, and the felicity of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> in <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> may be preferred before the pleaſure of a Swine. And is not that <hi>good,</hi> which calleth us up to the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> and will not <hi>allow us</hi> to be ſuch enemies to our ſelves, as to take up with the leſſer?</p>
               <p n="14">14. Yea, when we <hi>have moſt,</hi> it ſtill engageth us to ſeek <hi>more:</hi> And will not allow us to take up with a <hi>low degree of grace,</hi> or with a <hi>little meaſure</hi> of the <hi>greateſt good:</hi> But to ſhew that God would have us to be ſtill <hi>better,</hi> and to have <hi>more,</hi> it is made our duty ſtill to <hi>ask more,</hi> and ſtill to <hi>preſs higher,</hi> and labour to be better. <hi>Asking</hi> in prayer is made our daily work; and Gods giving, and our receiving may be our daily bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The mercies here provided for us, extend both to <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body:</hi> For though we may not prefer the leſs before the greater; yet we ſhall have it in its place: If we ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and its righteouſneſs, and labour firſt for the food which never periſheth, all other things ſhall be added to us: We ſhall have then to do us good, but not to do us hurt. For godlineſs is profitable to all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. &amp; 6.6.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And the <hi>future perfect Goodneſs,</hi> may invite us to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent imperfect Goodneſs,</hi> the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel do ſecond the Precepts, with the ſtrongeſt motives in the world: ſo that everlaſting bleſſedneſs and joy, is made the reward of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſincerity, in faith, love, and obedience. And if Heaven it ſelf be not a reward ſufficient to invite men to be <hi>good,</hi> there is <hi>none ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. Yea the <hi>penalties</hi> and <hi>ſeverities</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion, do ſhew the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of it. When God doth therefore threaten Hell to ſave men from it, and to draw them up to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Goſpel: Threatned evil of puniſhment, is but to keep them from the evil of ſin, and to make men better: And he that will teſtifie his hatred of ſinful evil to the higheſt, doth ſhew himſelf the greateſt enemy of it, and the greateſt lover of good; and he that ſetteth the ſharpeſt hedge before us, and the terrible warnings to keep us from damnation,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59417:69"/>
doth ſhew himſelf moſt willing to ſave us.</p>
               <p n="18">18. So <hi>good</hi> is Chriſtianity, that it turneth all <hi>our afflictions unto good</hi>: It aſſureth us that they are ſent as needful medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, however merited by our ſin: And it directeth us how to bear them eaſily, and to make them ſweet, and ſafe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and to turn them to our increaſe of holineſs, and to the furtherance of our greateſt good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1, to 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p n="19">19. It alſo ſtabliſheth a <hi>perpetual office,</hi> even the ſacred <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> for the fuller and ſurer communication of all this good forementioned. In which obſerve theſe particulars, which ſhew the greatneſs of this benefit. 1. The <hi>perſons</hi> called to it, muſt (by Chriſts appointment) be the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> of men that can be had. 2. The <hi>number</hi> of them is to be ſuited to the number of the people, ſo that <hi>none</hi> may be without the benefit. 3. Their <hi>work</hi> is, to declare all this foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Goodneſs and Love of God to man, and to offer them all this grace and mercy; and to teach them to be holy and happy, and to ſet before them the everlaſting joyes. 4. The <hi>manner</hi> of their doing it muſt be with <hi>humility,</hi> as the ſervants of all; with tender <hi>love,</hi> as Fathers of the flock; with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and skill, leſt their work be fruſtrate; with the greateſt importunity, even compelling them to come in, as men that are loth to take any denyal; and with patient enduring all oppoſitions, as thoſe that had rather ſuffer any thing, than the peoples ſouls ſhall be unhealed, and be damned; and they muſt conrinue to the end, as thoſe that will never give up a ſoul as deſperate and loſt, while there is any hope: And all this muſt be ſeconded with their own example of holineſs, temperance and love, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="20">20. So <hi>good</hi> is our Religion, that nothing but <hi>doing good</hi> is the work in which it doth employ us. Beſides all the good of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> it requireth us to live in love to others, and to do all the <hi>good</hi> in the world that we are able, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. &amp; 6.1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9.

                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59417:69"/>21. So <hi>good</hi> is Chriſtianity, that it favoureth not any one ſin, but is the greateſt condemner of them all. It is all for <hi>knowledge</hi> againſt hurtful <hi>ignorance</hi>; it is all for <hi>humility</hi> againſt all <hi>pride</hi>; for <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> againſt all <hi>injurious ſelfiſhneſs</hi>; for <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality,</hi> and the dominion of true Reaſon, againſt <hi>ſenſuality</hi> and the dominion of the fleſh; for <hi>heavenlineſs</hi> againſt a worldly mind; for <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> againſt all <hi>hypocriſie</hi> and <hi>deceit</hi>; for <hi>love</hi> againſt <hi>malice</hi>; for <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> againſt <hi>diviſions</hi> and <hi>contentions</hi>; for <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>lenity</hi> in ſuperiours, and <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> in inferiours; for faithfulneſs in all relations: Its precepts extend to <hi>ſecret</hi> as well as <hi>open</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; to the <hi>deſires</hi> and <hi>thoughts,</hi> as well as to the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>deeds:</hi> It alloweth not a <hi>thought,</hi> or <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>action,</hi> which is ungodly, intemperate, rebellious, injurious, unchaſte, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous or uncharitable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="22">22. All the <hi>troubleſome</hi> part of our Religion, is but our warfare againſt evil; againſt <hi>ſin,</hi> and the temptations which would make us ſinful: And it muſt needs be <hi>good,</hi> if all the conflicting part of it be only againſt evil, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17, 21, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. &amp; 7. &amp; 8.1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13.</p>

               <p n="3">III. THE third part of Gods <hi>Image</hi> and ſuperſcription on the Chriſtian Religion, is his <hi>POWER:</hi> And as mans own corruption lyeth more in the want of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> than of <hi>Power</hi>; therefore he is leſs capable of diſcerning <hi>God,</hi> in the impreſſions of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> than of his <hi>Power:</hi> ſeeing therefore he is here moſt capable of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> and acknowledging the hand of God, I ſhall open this alſo in the ſeveral parts, in ſome degree.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the hiſtory of the <hi>Creation,</hi> the Omnipotency of God is abundantly ſet forth; which is proved true, both by the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59417:71"/>
agreeableneſs of the hiſtory to the effects, and by much ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent evidence of the Writers Veracity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame may be ſaid of Gods drowning the old world, and the preſerving of <hi>Noah</hi> and his family in the Ark.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And of the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with fire from Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The many miracles done by <hi>Moſes</hi> upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and in the opening of the Red Sea, and in the feeding of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs, and keeping their cloths from wearing for forty years; and the pillar which went before them as a fire by night, and a cloud by day, for ſo long time; and the darkneſs, and thunder, and trembling of the Mount at the giving of the Law; with the reſt of the Miracles then done, not in a corner, or before a few, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the people; who were perſwaded to receive and obey the <hi>Law,</hi> by the reaſon of theſe motives which their eyes had ſeen: And if all this had been falſe; if no plagues had been ſhewed on <hi>Egypt</hi>; if no Red Sea had opened; if no Pillar had gone before them; if no ſuch terrible ſights and ſounds at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> had prepared them for the Law; ſuch reaſons would have been ſo unfit to have perſwaded them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that they would rather with any reaſonable creatures, have procured ſcorn.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew poſterity, that the hiſtory of all this was not forged, or to be ſuſpected; 1. They had the Law it ſelf then delivered in two Tables of ſtone to be ſtill ſeen. 2. They had a pot of Manna ſtill preſerved. 3. They had the miracle-working Rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> kept likewiſe as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 4. They had an Ark of purpoſe to keep theſe in, and that in the moſt inviolable place of worſhip. 5. They had the braz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n Serpent (till <hi>Hezekiah</hi> broke it) ſtill to be ſeen. 6. They had the ſong of their deliverance at the Red Sea for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued uſe. 7. They had ſet feaſts to keep the chief of all theſe things in remembrance. They had the feaſt of <hi>unleavened</hi> bread, which all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to obſerve for ſeven daies, to keep the remembrance of their paſſing out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in ſo great haſte, that they could not ſtay to knead up, and make their bread, but took it as in meal or unready dough. They had the feaſt of the Paſſeover, when every family was to eat of the Paſchal
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59417:71"/>
Lamb, and the door poſts to be ſprinkled with the blood, to keep in remembrance the night when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> firſt born were deſtroyed, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> all preſerved. And if theſe had been inſtituted at that time, upon a pretended occaſion which they knew to be untrue, they would rather have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided than obſerved them. If they had been afterwards inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in another generation which knew not the ſtory, the beginning would have been known, and the fiction of the name and inſtitution of <hi>Moſes</hi> would have been apparent to all; and the inſtitution would not have been found in the ſame Law, which was given by <hi>Moſes:</hi> And it could not have been ſo expreſly ſaid, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did all obſerve theſe feaſts and ſolemnities from the very time of their deliverance, but in thoſe times when the forgery <hi>began,</hi> all would have known it to be falſe. 8. And they had many other words and ceremonies among them, and even in Gods Publick Worſhip, which were all uſed to keep up the memory of theſe things. 9. And they had an office of Prieſthood conſtantly among them, which ſaw to the execution and preſervation of all theſe. 10. And they had a form of civil Policy then eſtabliſhed, and and the Rulers were to preſerve the memory of theſe things, and the practice of this Law, and to learn it themſelves, and govern by it: ſo that the very form of the Common-wealth, and the order of it, was a commemoration hereof: And the Parents were to teach and tell their children all theſe things, and to expound all theſe Solemnities, Laws and Ceremonies to them: ſo that the frame of Church, and State, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, was a preſervative hereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But, to paſs by all the reſt in the Old Teſtament, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi> of Chriſt was ſuch a work of <hi>Omnipotent Love,</hi> as ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>not by us be comprehended. That <hi>God</hi> ſhould be united to humanity in perſon! that humanity ſhould thus be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into union with the Deity! and Man be ſet above the Angels! that a Virgin ſhould conceive! that men from the Eaſt ſhould be led thither to worſhip an Infant by the conduct of a Star (which <hi>Caeſarius</hi> thinketh was one of thoſe Angels or Spirits which are called a <hi>flame</hi> of fire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.4.) That Angels from Heaven ſhould declare his nativity to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and celebrate it with their praiſes: that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:59417:72"/>
ſhould be ſo called to be his forerunner, and <hi>Elizabeth, Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> ſhould ſo propheſie of him: That the Spirit ſhould be ſeen deſcending on him at his Baptiſm, and the voice be heard from Heaven, which owned him: that he ſhould faſt forty daies and nights; and that he ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured before his three Diſciples on the Mount, and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ſeen with him in that glory; and the voice from Heaven again bear witneſs to him: Theſe, and many ſuch like were the atteſtations of <hi>Divine Omnipotency</hi> to the truth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To theſe may be next joyned, the whole courſe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles performed by Chriſt, in healing the ſick, and raiſing the dead; and in many other miraculous acts, which are moſt of the ſubſtance of the Goſpel-hiſtory, and which I have recited together in my <hi>Reaſons of the Chriſtian Religion</hi>; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And to theſe may be added, the <hi>Power</hi> which was given over all the creatures, to Chriſt our Mediatour. All power in Heaven and Earth was given him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. &amp; 13.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22, 23. He was made Head over all things to the Church, and all principalities and powers were put under him! And this was not barely aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, but demonſtrated. He ſhewed his power over the Devils in caſting them out: and his power over Angels by their attendance: and his power of life and death, by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dead: and his power over all diſeaſes, by healing them: and his power over the winds and waters, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing them: and his power over our food and natures, by turning water into wine, and by feeding many thouſands mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly: yea and his power over them into whoſe hands he was reſolved to yield himſelf, by reſtraining them till his hour was come, and by making them all fall to the ground at his name: and his power over Sun, and Heaven, and Earth, by the darkening of the Sun, and the trembling of the Earth, and the rending of the Rocks, and of the Vail of the Temple, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.45, 51. And his power over the dead, by the riſing of the bodies of many, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52. And his power over the Saints in Heaven, by the attendance of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> and his power to forgive ſins, by taking away the penal maladies;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59417:72"/>
and his power to change hearts, and ſave ſouls, by cauſing his Diſciples to leave all and follow him at a word; and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> to receive him, and believe; and the thief on the croſs to be converted, and to enter that day into Paradiſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And his own Reſurrection is an undoubted atteſtation of Divine Omnipotency. If God gave him ſuch a victory over death, and raiſed him to life when men had killed him, and rolled a ſtone upon his Sepulchre, and ſealed and guarded it, there needeth no further evidence of the <hi>Power</hi> of God impreſſing and atteſting the Chriſtian Religion, than that which aſcertaineth to us the truth of Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> For <hi>he was declared to be the Son of God by POWER, by reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1.4.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And his bodily appearance to his congregated Diſciples when the doors were ſhut; his miracle at their fiſhing, his walking on the Sea, his vaniſhing out of their ſight, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. when he had diſcourſed with the two Diſciples, his opening their hearts to underſtand his Word, &amp;c. do all ſhew this part of Gods Image on our Religion, even his <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. And ſo doth his bodily aſcending into Heaven before the face of his Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But eſpecially the ſending down the Holy Ghoſt upon his Diſciples according as he promiſed: To cauſe them that were before ſo low in knowledge, to be ſuddenly inſpired with <hi>languages,</hi> and with the <hi>full underſtanding</hi> of his <hi>own will,</hi> and with unanimity and concord herein; this made his Diſciples the living monuments and effects of his own Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And accordingly all the miracles which they did by this power, recorded partly in the Acts of the Apoſtles, (or rather, the <hi>Acts of Paul,</hi> by <hi>Luke</hi> who was his companion;) which you may there read (and no doubt but other Apoſtles in their meaſures did the like as <hi>Paul,</hi> though they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded; for they had all the <hi>ſame Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>) This is another impreſſion of <hi>POWER.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Whereto muſt be added the great and wonderful gifts of communicating the ſame Spirit (or doing that upon which <hi>God</hi> would give it) to thoſe converted Believers on whom they laid their hands (which <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would fain have
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59417:73"/>
bought with money, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.) To enable them to ſpeak with tongues, to heal diſeaſes, to propheſie, &amp;c. as they themſelves had done, which is a great atteſtation of <hi>Omnipotency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. And the lamentable deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans, foretold by Chriſt,</hi> was an atteſtation of Gods <hi>POWER</hi> in the revenge or puniſhment of their unbelief, and putting Chriſt to death.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And ſo was the great <hi>fortitude</hi> and <hi>conſtancy</hi> of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who underwent all perſecutions ſo joyfully as they did for the ſake of Chriſt; which was the effect of the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating Power of the Almighty.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And ſo was the Power which the Apoſtles had to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute preſent judgements upon the enemies of the Goſpel, (as <hi>Elimas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi>) and on the abuſers of Religion (as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra</hi>) and on many whom they excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and delivered up to Satan.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The ſame evidence is found in Chriſts Legiſlation, as an univerſal Soveraign making Laws for <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> for all the world: Taking down the Laws of the Jewiſh Polity and Ceremonies, which God by <hi>Moſes</hi> had for a time ſet up: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Miniſters to proclaim his Laws to all the world, and Princes and people to obey them: And by theſe Laws, conferring on Believers no leſs than forgiveneſs and ſalvation, and binding over the impenitent to everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But the great and continued impreſs of Gods <hi>Power,</hi> is that which together with his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> is made and ſhewed in the conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſion of mens ſouls to God by Chriſt. You may here firſt conſider the <hi>numbers</hi> which were ſuddenly converted by the preaching of the Apoſtles at the firſt. And in how little time there were Churches planted abroad the world: And then, how the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was brought in, and ſubdued to Chriſt, and Crowns and Scepters reſigned to him; and all this according to his own prediction, that when he was lifted up, he would draw all men to him; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the predictions of his Prophets. But that which I would eſpecially open, is, the <hi>POWER</hi> which is manifeſted in the work of the Spirit on the ſouls of men, both then and to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:59417:73"/>Hitherto what I have mentioned belonging to the Scripture it ſelf; it is to be taken as part of our <hi>Religion objectively</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: But that which followeth is the <hi>effect</hi> of that, even our <hi>Religion ſubjectively</hi> conſidered: To obſerve how God maketh men <hi>Believers,</hi> and by <hi>believing ſanctifieth</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>lives,</hi> is a great motive to further our <hi>own believing.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the work, 1. As it is in it ſelf, 2. As it is oppoſed by all its enemies, and you may ſee that it is the work of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of it, is Gods own Image. It is the raiſing up of our ſtupid faculties to be <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>active</hi> to thoſe holy uſes, to which they were become as <hi>dead</hi> by ſin. To cauſe in an unlearned perſon, a firmer and more diſtinct belief of the unſeen world, than the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Philoſophers can attain to by all their natural contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: To bring up a ſoul to place its happineſs on things ſo high, and far from ſenſe! To cauſe him who naturally is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> to deny himſelf, and devote himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to God; to love him, to truſt him, and to live to him! To raiſe an earthly mind to Heaven, that our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hope may be daily there! To overcome our pride, and ſenſuality, and bring our ſenſes in ſubjection unto reaſon, and to keep a holy government in our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and over our paſſions, words and deeds; And to live in continual preparation for death, as the only time of our true felicity: And to ſuffer any loſs or pain for the ſafe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this! All this is the work of the <hi>POWER</hi> of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which will the more appear when we conſider, what is done againſt it within us and without us! what <hi>privative</hi> and <hi>poſitive</hi> averſeneſs we have to it, till God do ſend down that <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> into our ſouls, which is indeed his Image! How violently our fleſhly ſenſe and appetite, ſtrive againſt the reſtraints of God, and would hurry us contrary to the motions of grace! How importunately Satan joyneth with his ſuggeſtions! What baits the world doth ſtill ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, to <hi>divert</hi> us, and <hi>pervert</hi> us! And how many inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of its <hi>flattery,</hi> or its <hi>cruelty,</hi> are ſtill at work, to ſtop us, or to turn us back! to invite our affections down to

               <p>And if we think this an eaſie work, becauſe it is alſo <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</hi> do but obſerve how hardly it goeth on, till the <hi>POWER</hi> of God by grace accompliſh it! what a deal of pains may the beſt and wiſeſt Parents take with a graceleſs child, and all in vain! what labours the worthieſt Miniſters loſe on graceleſs people! and how blind, and dead, and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a thing, the graceleſs heart is, to any thing that is holy, even when reaſon it ſelf cannot gainſay it! And God is pleaſed oft-times to weary out Parents, and Maſters, and Miniſters, with ſuch unteachable and ſtony hearts, to make them know what naturally they are themſelves, to bring them to the more lively acknowledgement of the <hi>POWER</hi> which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to renew and ſave a ſoul. But having ſpoken at large of this in the formentioned Treatiſe, I ſhall take up with theſe brief intimations.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And the <hi>preſervation</hi> of that Grace in the ſoul which is once given us, is alſo an effect of the <hi>POWER</hi> of God.

mutable; and he that is poſſeſſed once with the deſires of things ſpiritual and eternal, would quickly loſe thoſe deſires, and turn to preſent things again, (which are ſtill before him, while higher things are beyond our ſenſe) if the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> of the divine life, did not preſerve the ſpark which is kindled in us. Though the doctrine of <hi>Perſeverance</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted in the Chriſtian Church, yet experience aſſureth us of that which all parties are agreed in: Some hold that all true Chriſtians perſevere; and ſome hold that all <hi>confirmed</hi> Chriſtians perſevere (that is, thoſe who come to a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grace) but thoſe that think otherwiſe do yet all grant, that if any fall away, it is comparatively but a very few, of thoſe who are ſincere. When <hi>none</hi> would perſevere if <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi> did not preſerve them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Laſtly, The <hi>POWER</hi> of God alſo doth conſequently own the Chriſtian Religion, by the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in this malicious and oppoſing world (as well as by the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> in the ſoul) which will be the more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent if you obſerve, 1. That the <hi>number</hi> of true Chriſtians is ſtill very ſmall in compariſon of the wicked. 2. That all wicked men are naturally (by the corruption of nature) their enemies; becauſe the precepts and practice of Chriſtianity are utterly againſt their carnal minds and intereſts. 3. That the doctrine and practice of Chriſtianity is ſtill galling them, and exciting and ſublimating this enmity into rage: And God doth by perſecutions ordinarily tell us to our ſmart, that all this is true. 4. That all carnal men are exceeding hardly moved from their own way. 5. That the Government of the Earth is commonly in their hand, becauſe of their numbers, and their wealth. For it is commonly the rich that rule; and the rich are uſually bad; ſo that the godly Chriſtians are in their power. 6. That all the Hypocrites that are among our ſelves, have the ſame ſinful nature and enmity againſt holineſs, and are uſually as bitter againſt the power and practice of their own profeſſion, as open Infidels are. 7.

world. 8. And as it is a Religion which muſt be <hi>taught</hi> us; ſo it requireth or conſiſteth in ſo much <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>willingneſs,</hi> and <hi>fortitude</hi> of mind, that few are naturally apt to receive it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>badneſs,</hi> and <hi>feebleneſs</hi> of mind are ſo common in the world. And as we ſee that <hi>Learning</hi> will never be common but in the poſſeſſion of a very few, becauſe a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ingenuity</hi> is neceſſary thereto, which few are born with; ſo would it be with Chriſtianity, if Divine <hi>Power</hi> maintained it not. 9. And it is a Religion which requireth much time and contemplation, in the learning and in the practiſing of it: whereas the world are taken up with ſo much buſineſs for the body, and are ſo ſlothful to thoſe exerciſes of the mind, which bring them no preſent ſenſible commodity, that this alſo would quickly wear it out. 10. And then the terms of it being ſo contrary to all mens fleſhly intereſt and ſenſe, in <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> and <hi>forſaking</hi> all for Chriſt; and in mortifying the moſt beloved ſins, and the world putting us to it ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by perſecution; this alſo would deter the moſt, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out the reſt, if the <hi>Power</hi> of God did not uphold them. That which is done by <hi>exceeding induſtry,</hi> againſt the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and intereſt of <hi>nature,</hi> will have no conſiderable number of practiſers. As we ſee in horſes and dogs which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable with great labour, of being taught extraordinary things in the ſemblance of reaſon: And yet becauſe it muſt coſt ſo much labour, there is but one in a Country that is brought to it. But (though the truly religious are but few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the wicked, yet) godly perſons are not <hi>ſo few</hi> as they would be, if it were the work of induſtry alone. God maketh it as a new nature to them; and (which is very much to be obſerved) the main change is oft-times wrought in an hour, and that after all exhortations, and the labours of Parents and Teachers have failed, and left the ſinner as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hopeleſs.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you 1.

               <head>CHAP. VII. The means of making known all this infallibly to us.</head>
               <p>I Suppoſe the evidence of divine atteſtation is ſo clear in this <hi>Image of God</hi> on the Chriſtian <hi>Religion,</hi> which I have been opening, that few can doubt of it, who are ſatisfied of the <hi>hiſtorical</hi> truth of the facts; and therefore this is next to be conſidered, <hi>How the certain knowledge of all theſe things cometh down to us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt queſtion is, whether this <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be the impreſs of Gods <hi>WISDOM,</hi> and his <hi>GOODNESS</hi> and <hi>POWER,</hi> ſuppoſing the truth of the hiſtorical part? This is it which I think that few reaſonable perſons wil deny: For the doctrine is legible, and ſheweth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But the next queſtion is it, which I am now to reſolve, <hi>How we ſhall know that this Doctrine was indeed delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and theſe things done by them, which the Scriptures mention?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here the firſt queſtion ſhall be, <hi>How the Apoſtles, and all other the firſt witneſſes, knew it themſelves?</hi> For it is by every reaſonable man to be ſuppoſed, that they who were <hi>preſent,</hi> and we who are 1668 years diſtance, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the knowledge of the matters of fact, in the very ſame manner. It is certain that their knowledge was by their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon:</hi> They <hi>ſaw</hi> Chriſt and his miracles: They <hi>heard</hi> his words: They <hi>ſaw</hi> him <hi>riſen</hi> from the <hi>dead:</hi> They diſcourſed with him, and eat and drunk with him: They ſaw him aſcending up bodily to Heaven. They need no other Revelation to tell them what they <hi>ſaw,</hi> and <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>felt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you had asked them then, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w know you that all theſe things were ſaid and done?</hi> they would have anſwered you, <hi>Becauſe we ſaw and heard them.</hi> But <hi>we</hi> were not then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: <hi>we</hi> did not <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> what <hi>they</hi> did: Nor did we ſee or hear <hi>them,</hi> who were the eye-witneſſes. And therefore as their <hi>ſenſes</hi> told it them; ſo the natural way for our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, muſt be by <hi>derivation from their ſenſe to ours:</hi> For when
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59417:76"/>
                  <hi>they themſelves</hi> received it in a way ſo <hi>natural,</hi> (though not without the help of Gods Spirit, in the <hi>remembring, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>atteſting</hi> it) <hi>we</hi> that can leſs pretend to <hi>inſpiration,</hi> or <hi>immediate revelation,</hi> have ſmall reaſon to think that we muſt know the <hi>ſame facts,</hi> by either of thoſe <hi>ſupernatural</hi> waies. Nor can our knowledge of a <hi>hiſtory,</hi> carryed down through ſo many ages, be ſo clearly ſatisfactory to our ſelves, as <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> was to them. And yet we have a <hi>certainty,</hi> not only <hi>infallible</hi>; but ſo far <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> as is ſufficient to warrant all our <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> for the reward which Chriſt hath ſet before us.</p>
               <p>Let us next then enquire, <hi>How did the firſt Churches know that the Apoſtles and other Preachers of the Goſpel did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in the matter of fact?</hi> I anſwer, They had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of aſſurance or knowledge in this part of their belief. 1. They had the moſt <hi>credible humane teſtimony</hi> of men that were not like to deceive them. But this was not infallible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They had in their teſtimony the <hi>evidence</hi> of a <hi>natural certainty:</hi> It being <hi>naturally impoſſible,</hi> that ſo many perſons ſhould agree together to deceive the world, in ſuch matters of fact, at ſo dear a rate, in the very place and age when the things were pretended to be done and ſaid, when any one might have preſently evinced the falſhood, if they had been lyars, about the twice feeding of many thouſands miraculouſly, and the raiſing of the dead, and many other publick miracles, and the darkneſs at his death, and the rending of the Rocks and Vail of the Temple, and the Earth-quake, and the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt upon themſelves; with many the like they would have been detected and confuted to their confuſion: And we ſhould have read what Apologies they made againſt ſuch detections and confutations! And ſome of them (at leaſt at their death) would have been forced by conſcience, to confeſs the plot.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But to leave no room for doubting, God gave thoſe firſt Churches, the addition of his own <hi>ſupernatural atteſtation,</hi> by the ſame threefold impreſs of his Image before deſcribed: 1. In the holy <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> which was in their doctrine. 2. In the holy Love, and Piety, and Purity, which was conſpicuous in their <hi>doctrine,</hi> and in their <hi>lives.</hi> 3. And in the evidences
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59417:76"/>
of divine <hi>Power,</hi> in the many gifts, and wonders and miracles which they wrought and manifeſted. And theſe things ſeem a <hi>fuller</hi> teſtimony than the miracles of Chriſt himſelf. For Chriſts miracles were the deeds of <hi>one alone</hi>; and his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was witneſſed but by twelve choſen witneſſes, and about five hundred other perſons; and he converſed with them but forty daies, and that by <hi>times:</hi> But the miracles of the Diſciples were wrought by <hi>many,</hi> and before many thouſands, at ſeveral times, and in many Countreys, and for many and many years together; and in the <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> of many of the Churches: So that theſe firſt <hi>Churches</hi> had <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> to aſſure them of the <hi>divine miraculous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation</hi> of the truth of <hi>their teſtimony,</hi> who told them of the doctrines, miracles, and reſurrection of Chriſt: And all this from Chriſts ſolemn promiſe and gift, <hi>John.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do, ſhall he do alſo; and greater works than theſe ſhall he do, becauſe I go to the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it be demanded, How did the <hi>next Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>ſecond age,</hi> receive all this from the <hi>firſt Churches,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from the Apoſtles? I anſwer, by the <hi>ſame evidence,</hi> and with <hi>ſome advantages.</hi> For 1. They had the <hi>credible hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> teſtimony of all their Paſtors, Neighbours, Parents, who told them but what they <hi>ſaw and heard.</hi> 2. They had a greater evidence of <hi>natural infallible certainty:</hi> For 1. The doctrine was now delivered to them in the records of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and ſo leſs liable to the miſreports of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, forgetful or erroneous. 2. The reporters were now <hi>more numerous,</hi> and the miracles reported more numerous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. 3. They were perſons now diſperſed over much of the world, and could not poſſibly agree together to deceive. 4. The deceit would now have been yet more eaſily detected and abhorred.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But beſides this, they had alſo the <hi>ſupernatural teſtimony of God</hi>: For the Apoſtles converts received the ſame ſpirit as they had themſelves: And though the miracles of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were not ſo numerous as thoſe of the Apoſtles; yet the perſons were many thouſands more that wrought them: All this is aſſerted in the Scripture it ſelf; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3, 4.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59417:77"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. &amp; 12. and many places: And he that ſhould have told them falſly that they <hi>themſelves</hi> had the ſpirit of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts and miracles, would hardly have been believed by them. And all this alſo the following Ages have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aſſerted unto us.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then which remaineth is, <hi>How we receive all this infallibly from the ſubſequent Ages or Churches to this day?</hi> The anſwer to which is, <hi>ſtill by the ſame way,</hi> with <hi>yet greater advantages in ſome reſpects,</hi> though <hi>leſs</hi> in others. As 1. We have the humane teſtimony of all our anceſtors, and of many of our enemies. 2. We have greater evidence of <hi>natural cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> that they could not poſſibly meet or plot together to deceive us. 3. We have ſtill the <hi>ſupernatural divine atteſtation</hi> (though rarely of miracles, yet) of thoſe more neceſſary and noble operations of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the ſanctification of all true Believers; which Spirit accompanieth and worketh by the doctrine which from our anceſtors we have received.</p>
               <p>More diſtinctly obſerve all theſe conjunct means of our full reception of our Religion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The very <hi>Being of the Chriſtians and Churches,</hi> is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to us that they believed and received this Religion. For what maketh them Chriſtians and Churches but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is a notable tradition of it. For all that ever were <hi>made Chriſtians, have been baptized:</hi> And <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is nothing but the ſolemn initiation of perſons into this Religion, by a vowed conſent to it, as ſummarily there expreſſed in the Chriſtian Covenant. And this was uſed to be openly done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The uſe of the <hi>Creed,</hi> which at Baptiſm and other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſeaſons, was alwaies wont to be profeſſed, (together with the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Decalogue</hi>; the ſummaries of our <hi>faith, deſire</hi> and <hi>practice</hi>) is another notable tradition; by which this Religion hath been ſent down to following Ages: For though perhaps all the terms of the Creed were not ſo early as ſome think, thus conſtantly uſed; yet all the ſenſe and ſubſtance of it was.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> or <hi>Records</hi> of this Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining integrally all the doctrine, and all the neceſſary matter
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59417:77"/>
of fact, is the moſt compleat way of tradition: And it will appear to you in what further ſhall be ſaid, that we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proof, that theſe Scriptures are the ſame, which the firſt Churches did receive; what ever inconſiderable errours may be crept into any Copies, by the unavoidable overſight of the Scribes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>conſtant uſe</hi> of the <hi>ſacred Aſſemblies,</hi> hath been ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means of ſure tradition: For we have infallible proof of the ſucceſſive continuation of ſuch Aſſemblies; and that their uſe was ſtill, the ſolemn profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, and worſhipping God according to it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And the conſtant uſe of <hi>Reading the Scriptures in thoſe Aſſemblies,</hi> is another full hiſtorical tradition: For that which is conſtantly and publickly read, as the doctrine of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, cannot be changed, without the notice of all the Church, and without an impoſſible combination of all the Churches in the world.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And it ſecureth the tradition that <hi>one ſet day</hi> hath been kept for this <hi>publick exerciſe of Religion,</hi> from the very firſt; even the <hi>Lords day</hi> (beſides all occaſional times) The day it ſelf being appointed to celebrate the memorial of Chriſts Reſurrection, is a moſt currant hiſtory of it; as the feaſt of unleavened bread, and the Paſſeover was of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>Egypt.</hi> And the exerciſes ſtill performed on that day, do make the tradition more compleat.</p>
               <p>And becauſe ſome few Sabbatarians among our ſelves do keep the old Sabbath only, and call ſtill for <hi>Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ure proof</hi> for the inſtitution of the Lords day; let me briefly tell them, that which is enough to evince their errour. 1. That the Apoſtles were <hi>Officers immediately commiſſioned by Chriſt,</hi> to diſciple the Nations, and to teach them all that <hi>Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> and ſo to <hi>ſettle Orders</hi> in the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20, 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Chriſt <hi>promiſed and gave</hi> them his Spirit <hi>infallibly</hi> to guide them in the performance of this commiſſion (though not to make them perfectly impeccable) <hi>John</hi> 16.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>de facto</hi> the Apoſtles appointed the uſe of the Lords day for the Church Aſſemblies: This being all that is left to be proved, and this being matter of fact, which
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59417:78"/>
requireth no other kind of proof but <hi>hiſtory,</hi> part of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of it is in the Scripture, and the reſt in the hiſtory of all following Ages. In the Scripture it ſelf it is evident, that the Churches and the Apoſtles <hi>uſed this day</hi> accordingly: And it hath moſt infallible hiſtory (impoſſible to be falſe) that the Churches have uſed it ever to this day, as that which they found practiſed in their times by their appointment: And this is not a bare <hi>narrative,</hi> but an uninterrupted matter of publick fact and practice: So univerſal, that I remember not in all my reading, that ever one enemy queſtioned it, or ever one Chriſtian, or Heretick denyed, or once ſcrupled it. So that they who tell us that all this is yet but humane teſtimony, do ſhew their egregious inconſiderations, that know not that ſuch humane teſtimony or hiſtory in a matter of publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fact, may be moſt certain, and all that the nature of the caſe will allow a ſober perſon to require. And they might as well reject the Canon of the Scriptures, becauſe humane teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is it which in point of fact doth certifie us, that theſe are the very unaltered Canonical Books, which were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at firſt to the Churches: Yea they may reject all the ſtore of hiſtorical tradition of Chriſtianity it ſelf, which I am here reciting to the ſhame of their underſtandings.</p>
               <p>And conſider alſo, that the <hi>Lords day</hi> was ſettled, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſed in ſolemn worſhip by the Churches, many and many years before any part of the New Teſtament was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and above threeſcore years before it was finiſhed. And when the Churches had ſo many years been in publick poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, who would require that the Scriptures ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, make a Law to inſtitute that which was inſtituted ſo long ago.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, that it might have <hi>declared</hi> the inſtitution, I anſwer, ſo it hath, as I have ſhewed; there needing no other declaration, but 1. Chriſts commiſſion to the Apoſtles to order the Church, and declare his commands. 2. And his <hi>promiſe</hi> of infallible guidance therein. 3. And the hiſtory of the Churches order and practice, to ſhew <hi>de facto,</hi> what they did: And that hiſtory need not be written in Scripture for the Churches that then were; no more than we need a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Heaven to tell us thas the Lords day is kept in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59417:78"/>
                  <hi>England:</hi> And ſure the <hi>next Age</hi> needed no ſupernatural te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of it: and therefore neither do we: But yet it is <hi>occaſionally</hi> oft intimated or expreſſed in the Scripture, though on the by, as that which was no further neceſſary.</p>
               <p>So that I may well conclude, that we have better hiſtorical evidence that the Lords day was <hi>actually</hi> obſerved by the Churches, for their publick worſhip and profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, than we have that ever there was ſuch a man as <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour in <hi>England,</hi> yea or King <hi>James</hi>; much more than that there was a <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Cicero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Moreover, the very <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Paſtors of the Church,</hi> and their continuance from the beginning to this day, is a great part of the certain tradition of this Religion. For it is moſt certain, that the Churches were conſtituted, and the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies held, and the worſhip performed with them, and by their conduct, and not without: And it is certain by infallible hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, that their office hath been ſtill the ſame, even to teach men this Chriſtian Religion, and to guide them in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, and to read the ſame Scriptures as the word of truth, and to explain it to the people. And therefore as the Judicatures and Offices of the Judges is a certain proof that there have been thoſe Laws by which they judge (eſpecially if they had been alſo the weekly publick Readers and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders of them) and ſo much more is it in our caſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And the <hi>conſtant uſe of the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt,</hi> hath according to his appointment, been an infallible tradition of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and a means to keep him in remembrance in the Churches. For when <hi>all the Churches in the world</hi> have made this <hi>Sacramental Commemoration,</hi> and renewed covenanting with Chriſt as <hi>dead and riſen,</hi> to be their conſtant publick practice here, is a tradition of that faith and Covenant which cannot be counterfeit or falſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To this we may add, the <hi>conſtant uſe of Diſcipline</hi> in theſe Churches: it having been their conſtant law and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to enquire into the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> of the members, and to cenſure or caſt out thoſe that impenitently violated their Religion: which ſheweth, that <hi>de facto</hi> that Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was then received; and is a means of delivering it down to us. Under which we may mention 1. Their Synods
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59417:79"/>
and Officers. 2. And their Canons by which this Diſcipline was exerciſed.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Another tradition hath been the <hi>publiſhed confeſſions</hi> of their Faith and R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on in thoſe <hi>Apologies,</hi> which <hi>perſecutions</hi> and calumnies have cauſed them to write.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And another is, all thoſe <hi>publiſhed Confutations</hi> of the many <hi>hereſies,</hi> which in every age have riſen up; and all the controverſies which the Churches have had with them, and among themſelves.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And another is, all the <hi>Treatiſes, Sermons,</hi> and other <hi>inſtructing writings</hi> of the Paſtors of thoſe times.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And another way of tradition hath been by the <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and ſufferings of Confeſſors and Martyrs,</hi> who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured either torments or death, in the defence and owning of this Religion: In all which waies of tradition, the <hi>doctrine</hi> and the <hi>matter</hi> were joyntly atteſted by them. For the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of Chriſt (which is part of the matter of fact) was one of the Articles of their Creed, which they ſuffered for: And all of them received the holy Scriptures, which declare the Apoſtles miracles; and they received their faith, as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by thoſe Apoſtles, with the confirmation of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: So that when they profeſſed to believe the doctrine, they eſpecially profeſſed to believe the <hi>hiſtory</hi> of the life and death of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles: And the Religion which they ſuffered for, and daily profeſſed, contained both: And the hiſtorical Books called <hi>the Goſpels,</hi> were the chief part of the Scripture which they called, The Word of God, and the Records of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. To this I may add, that all the ordinary <hi>prayers and praiſes</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> did continue the <hi>recital</hi> of much of <hi>this hiſtory,</hi> and of the <hi>Apoſtles names and acts,</hi> and were compoſed much in <hi>Scripture phraſe,</hi> which preſerved the memory, and profeſſed the belief of all thoſe things.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And the <hi>feſtivals</hi> or <hi>other dayes,</hi> which were kept in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable commemoration of <hi>thoſe Apoſtles and Martyrs,</hi> was another way of keeping theſe things in memory: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were well done or not, is not my preſent enquiry (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I may ſay, I cannot accuſe it of any ſin, till it come to over-doing, and aſcribing too much to them.) But certainly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59417:79"/>
it was a way of tranſmitting the memory of thoſe things to poſterity.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Another hath been by the conſtant <hi>commemoration</hi> of the <hi>great works of Chriſt,</hi> by the <hi>dayes or ſeaſons of the year,</hi> which were annually obſerved: How far here alſo the Church did well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ill, I now meddle not: But doubtleſs the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of anniverſary ſolemnities for their commemoration, was a way of preſerving the memory of the acts themſelves to poſterity. How long the day of Chriſts Nativity hath been celebrated, I know not: Reading what <hi>Selden</hi> hath ſaid on one ſide; and on the other finding no currant Author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it (that I have read) before <hi>Nazianzene</hi>: and finding by <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that the Churches of the Eaſt, till his time had differed from the Weſtern Churches, as far as the ſixth of <hi>January</hi> is from the 25 of <hi>December.</hi> But that is of leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe <hi>Chriſts birth</hi> is a thing unqueſtioned in it ſelf. But we find that the time of his faſting forty daies, the time of his Paſſion, and of his Reſurrection, and the giving of the Holy Ghoſt, were long before kept in memory, by ſome kind of obſervation by fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts or feſtivals: And though there was a controverſie about the due ſeaſon of the ſucceſſive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Eaſter, yet that ſignified no uncertainty of the firſt day, or the ſeaſon of the year. And though at firſt it was but few daies that were kept in faſting at that ſeaſon, yet they were enough to commemorate both the forty daies faſting, and the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And the <hi>hiſtories of the Heathens</hi> and enemies of the Church, do alſo declare how long Chriſtianity continued, and what they were, and what they ſuffered who were called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; ſuch as <hi>Plinies, Celſus, Porphyry, Plotinus, Lucian, Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="19">19. And the <hi>conſtant inſtruction</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> by their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> which is <hi>Family-tradition,</hi> hath been a very great means alſo of this commemoration. For it cannot be (though ſome be negligent) but that multitudes in all times would teach their children, what the Chriſtian Religion was, as to its <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and its <hi>hiſtory.</hi> And the practice of <hi>catechizing,</hi> and teaching children the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and the Scriptures, the more ſecured this tradition in families.</p>

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:59417:80"/>20. Laſtly, A ſucceſſion of the <hi>ſame Spirit,</hi> which was in the Apoſtles, and of much of the <hi>ſame works,</hi> which were done by them, was ſuch a way of aſſuring us of the truth of their <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>hiſtory,</hi> as a ſucceſſion of poſterity tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that our progenitors were <hi>men.</hi> The ſame ſpirit of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in a great degree continued after them to this day. And all wrought by their doctrine: and very credible hiſtory aſſureth us, that many miracles alſo were done, in many ages after them; though not ſo many as by them: <hi>Euſebius, Cyprian, Auguſtine, Victor, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>licenſis, Sulpitius, Severus,</hi> and many others, ſhew us ſo much as may make the belief of the Apoſtles the more eaſie.</p>
               <p>And indeed, the <hi>Image of Gods WISDOM, GOODNESS and POWER on the ſouls of all true Chriſtians in the world, ſucceſſively to this day, conſidered in it ſelf, and in its agreement with the ſame Image in the holy Scriptures, which do imprint it, and in its agreement or ſameneſs as found in all Ages, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Perſons,</hi> is ſuch a ſtanding perpetual evidence that the Chriſtian Religion is <hi>Divine,</hi> that (being ſtill at hand) it ſhould be exceeding ſatisfactory to a conſiderate Believer, againſt all doubts and temptations to unbelief. And were it not leſt, I ſhould inſtead of an <hi>Index,</hi> give you too large a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of what I have more fully written in my foreſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I would here ſtay yet to ſhew you how <hi>impoſſible</hi> it is that this Spirit of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which we feel in us, and ſee by the effects in others, even in every true Believer, ſhould be cauſed by a word of falſhood, which he abhorreth, and as the Juſt Ruler of the world, would be obliged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only here deſire you by the way to note that when I have all this while ſhewed you that the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> is the great witneſs of the truth of Chriſtianity, that it is, this ſpirit of <hi>Wiſdom, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> in the Prophets, in Chriſt, in the Apoſtles, and in all Chriſtians, expreſſed in the <hi>doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>practices</hi> aforeſaid, which I mean; as being principally the <hi>Evidences,</hi> or <hi>objective</hi> witneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſecondarily, being in all true Believers, their teacher, or illuminater and ſanctifier, <hi>efficiently</hi> to cauſe them to <hi>perceive</hi> the aforeſaid <hi>objective Evidences</hi> in its cogent undeniable
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59417:80"/>
power. And thus the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is the promiſed <hi>Agent</hi> or <hi>Advocate</hi> of Chriſt; to do his work in his bodily abſence in the world: And that in this ſenſe it is, that we <hi>Believe</hi> in the <hi>HOLY GHOST,</hi> and are baptized into his Name; and not only as he is the third perſon in the Eternal Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is to be lamented exceedingly, 1. That any Orthodox Teachers ſhould recite over many of theſe parts of the witneſs of the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> and when they have done, tell us, that yet all theſe are not ſufficient to convince us without the teſtimony of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> As if all this <hi>were none of the teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi>; and as if they would <hi>perſwade</hi> us and our enemies, that the teſtimony which muſt ſatisfie us, is only ſome <hi>inward impreſs</hi> of this <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> on the mind, by way of inſpiration, [<hi>The Scriptures are the Word of God, and true.</hi>] Overlooking the great witneſs of the Spirit, which is his ſpecial work, and which our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm relateth to, and feigning ſome extraordinary new thing as the only teſtimony.</p>
               <p>And it is to be lamented, that Papiſts, and quarrelling Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries ſhould take this occaſion to reproach us as Infidels, that have no true grounded faith in Chriſt; as telling us that we reſolve it all into a <hi>private inward</hi> pretended witneſs of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> And then they ask us, who can know that witneſs but our ſelves? and how can we preach the Goſpel to others, if the only cogent argument of faith be incommunicable, or ſuch as we cannot prove? Though both the <hi>Believing ſoul</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> be the Kingdom of the Prince of <hi>Light,</hi> yet O what wrong hath the Prince of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> done, by the mixtures of darkneſs in them both!</p>
               <p>So much for the firſt Direction for the <hi>ſtrengthening of Faith,</hi> which is, by diſcerning the Evidences of Truth in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

               <p>I Shall be more brief in the reſt of the Directions, for the <hi>increaſe of Faith</hi>: and they are theſe.</p>
               <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Compare the Chriſtian Religion with all other in the world: And ſeeing it is certain that ſome way or other God hath revealed, to guide man in his duty, unto his end, and it is no other; you will ſee that it muſt needs be this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The way of the Heatheniſh Idolaters cannot be it: The <hi>principles</hi> and the <hi>effects</hi> of their Religion, may eaſily ſatisfie you of this. The only true God would not command Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, nor befriend ſuch ignorance, errour and wickedneſs as doth conſtitute their Religion, and are produced by it, as its genuine fruits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The way of Judaiſm cannot be it: For it doth but lead us up to Chriſtianity, and bear witneſs to Chriſt, and of it ſelf, is evidently inſufficient; its multitude of ceremonies being but the pictures and alphabet of that truth which Jeſus Chriſt hath brought to light, and which hath evidence, which to us is more convincing, than that of the Jewiſh Law,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Mahometane deluſion is ſo groſs, that it ſeemeth vain to ſay any more againſt it, than it ſaith it ſelf; unleſs it be to thoſe who are bred up in ſuch darkneſs, as to hear of nothing elſe, and never to ſee the Sun which ſhineth on the Chriſtian world; and withall are under the terrour of the ſword, which is the ſtrongeſt reaſon of that barbarous Sect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And to think that the <hi>Atheiſme</hi> of Infidels is the way, (who hold only the five Articles of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God, the duty of obedience, the immortality of the ſoul, the life of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butior, and the neceſſity of Repentance</hi>) is but to go againſt the light. For 1. It is a denyal of that abundant evidence of the truth of the Chriſtian Faith, which cannot by any ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be confuted. 2. It is evidently too narrow for mans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and leaveth our miſery without a ſufficient remedy. 3. Its incluſions and excluſions are contradictory: It aſſerteth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59417:81"/>
the neceſſity of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and yet excludeth the neceſſary means (the revealed Light, and Love, and Power) by which both <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> muſt be had. It excludeth <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Spirit, and yet requireth that which none but Chriſt and his Spirit can effect. 4. It propoſeth a way as the only Religion, which few ever went from the beginning (as to the <hi>excluſions.</hi>) As if that were Gods only way to Heaven, which ſcarce any viſible ſocieties of men, can be proved to have practiſed to this day.</p>
               <p>Which of all theſe Religions have the moſt wiſe, and holy, and heavenly, and mortified, and righteous, and ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to profeſs it: and the greateſt numbers of ſuch? If you will judge of the medicine by the effects, and take him for the beſt Phyſician, who doth the greateſt cures upon the ſouls, you will ſoon conclude that Chriſt is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh to the Father but by him,</hi> John 14.6.</p>
               <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Think how impoſſible it is that any but God ſhould be the Author of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. No <hi>good man</hi> could be guilty of ſo horrid a crime as to forge a volume of deluſions, and put Gods Name to it; to cheat the world ſo blaſphemouſly and hypocritically, and to draw them into a life of trouble to promote it. Much leſs could ſo great a number of <hi>good men</hi> do this, as the ſucceſs of ſuch a cheat (were it poſſible) would require. There is no man that can believe it to be a deceit, but muſt needs believe, as we do of Mahomet, that the Author was one of the worſt men that ever lived in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No <hi>bad man</hi> could lay ſo excellent a deſign, and frame a Doctrine and Law ſo <hi>holy,</hi> ſo <hi>ſelf denying,</hi> ſo <hi>merciful,</hi> ſo <hi>juſt,</hi> ſo <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> ſo <hi>heavenly,</hi> and ſo concordant in it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor carry on ſo high and divine an undertaking for ſo divine and excellent an end: No bad man could ſo univerſally condemn all <hi>badneſs,</hi> and preſcribe ſuch powerful remedies againſt it, and ſo effectually cure and conquer it in ſo conſiderable a part of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it be below any <hi>good man,</hi> to be guilty of ſuch a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59417:82"/>
forgery as aforeſaid, we can much leſs ſuſpect that any good <hi>Angel</hi> could be guilty of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if no <hi>bad man</hi> could do ſo <hi>much good,</hi> we can much leſs imagine that any Devil or bad ſpirit could be the author of it. The Devil who is the <hi>worſt</hi> in evil, could never ſo much contradict his nature, and overthrow his own Kingdom, and ſay ſo much evil of himſelf, and do ſo much againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and do ſo much for the ſanctifying and ſaving of the world: He that doth ſo much to draw men to ſin and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, would never do ſo much to deſtroy their ſin. And we plainly feel within our ſelves, that the ſpirit or party which draweth us to ſin, doth reſiſt the Spirit which draweth us to believe and obey the Goſpel; and that theſe two maintain a war within us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And if you ſhould ſay, that the <hi>good</hi> which is in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, is cauſed by God, and the evil of it by the Father of ſin,</hi> I anſwer, either it is <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe:</hi> If it be <hi>true,</hi> it is ſo <hi>good,</hi> that the Devil can never poſſibly be a contributor to it: Nay, it cannot then be ſuſpected juſtly of any evil. But if it be <hi>falſe,</hi> it is then ſo <hi>bad,</hi> that God cannot be any otherwiſe the Author of it, than as he is the Author of any common natural Verity which it may take in and abuſe; or as his general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe extendeth to the whole Creation. But it is ſomewhat in Chriſtianity, which it hath more than other Religions have, which muſt make it more pure, and more powerful and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, than any other Religions have been. Therefore it muſt be more than common natural truths: even the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of thoſe natural truths, with the ſupernatural reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of it, and the addition of a ſpirit of <hi>power, and light, and love,</hi> to procure the ſucceſs. And God cannot be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of any ſuch contexture, or additions, if it be falſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If it be ſaid, that <hi>men that had ſome good, and ſome bad in them, did contrive it (ſuch</hi> as thoſe Fanaticks, or Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, who have pious notions and words, with pride and ſelf-exalting minds) I anſwer, The <hi>good</hi> is ſo great which is found in Chriſtianity, that it is not poſſible that a <hi>bad man</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much leſs an <hi>extreamly bad man,</hi> could be the Author of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of the plot would be ſo great if it were <hi>falſe,</hi> that it is not poſſible that any but an <hi>extreamly bad man</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59417:82"/>
could be guilty of it: Much leſs that a <hi>multitude</hi> ſhould be ſound at once ſo <hi>extreamly good</hi> as to promote it, even with their greateſt labour and ſuffering, and alſo ſo <hi>extreamly bad</hi> as to joyn together in the plot to cheat the world, in a matter of ſuch high importance. Such <hi>exceeding good and evil,</hi> cannot conſiſt in any one perſon, much leſs in <hi>ſo many</hi> as muſt do ſuch a thing. And if ſuch a heated brain ſick perſon as <hi>Hacket, Nailer, David, George,</hi> or <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> ſhould cry up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon prophetical and pious pretences, their madneſs hath ſtill appeared, in the mixture of their impious doctrines and practices: And if any would and could be ſo wicked, God never would or did aſſiſt them, by an age of numerous open miracles, nor lend them his Omnipotency to deceive the world; but left them to the ſhame of their proud attempts, and made their folly known to all.</p>
               <p>Direct. 4. <hi>Study all the Evidences of the Chriſtian Verity, till their ſenſe, and weight, and order, be throughly digeſted, underſtood and remembred by you; and be as plain and familiar to you, as the leſſon which you have moſt thoroughly learned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not once or twice reading, or hearing, or thinking on ſuch a great and difficult matter, that will make it your own, for the ſtabliſhing of your faith. He that will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the art of a Sea-man, a Souldier, a Muſician, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, &amp;c. ſo as to <hi>practiſe</hi> it; muſt ſtudy it hard, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it clearly, and comprehenſively, and have all the whole frame of it printed on his mind; and not only here and there a ſcrap. Faith is a practical knowledge: We muſt have the heart and life directed and commanded by it: We muſt <hi>live by it,</hi> both in the intention of our <hi>end,</hi> and in the <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of all the means: Whileſt the Goſpel, and the Reaſons of our Religion, are <hi>ſtrange</hi> to people, like a leſſon but half learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who can expect that they ſhould be ſettled againſt all temptations which aſſault their faith, and able to confute the tempter? We lay together the proofs of our Religion, and you read them twice or thrice, and then think that if after that you have any doubting, the fault is in the want of evidence, and not in your want of underſtanding: But the life of faith
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59417:83"/>
muſt coſt you more labour than ſo; ſtudy it till you clearly underſtand it, and remember the whole method of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence together, and have it all as at your fingers ends, and then you may have a <hi>confirmed faith to live by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Direct. 5. <hi>When you know what are the ſoreſt temptations to unbelief, get all thoſe ſpecial arguments and proviſions into your minds, which are neceſſary againſt thoſe particular temptations. And do not ſtrengthen your own temptations by your imprudent entertaining them.</hi>

When your minds are taken up with worldly buſineſs, or other thoughts have carryed them away, let not Satan then ſurprize you, and ſay, Come now and queſtion thy Religion: You could not reſolve a queſtion in Philoſophy, nor caſt up any long account, on ſuch a ſudden, with an unprepared mind. When the Evidences of your faith are out of mind, ſtay till you can have leiſure to ſet your ſelves to the buſineſs, with that ſtudiouſneſs, and thoſe helps, which ſo great a matter doth require. 2. When ſickneſs or melancholy doth weaken your underſtandings, you are then unfit for ſuch a work.

               <p>For he that deſireth ſatisfaction in his doubts, to no better end, than to pleaſe his mind by knowing, and to free it from the diſquiet of uncertainty, hath an end ſo low in all his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that he cannot expect that God and his grace ſhould be called down, to ſerve ſuch a low and baſe deſign. That faith which is not employed in <hi>beholding the love of God in the face of Chriſt,</hi> on purpoſe to increaſe and <hi>exerciſe our love,</hi> is not indeed the true Chriſtian Faith, but a <hi>dead opinion.</hi> And he that hath never ſo weak a faith, and uſeth it to this end, to <hi>know Gods amiableneſs,</hi> and to <hi>love him,</hi> doth take the moſt certain way for the confirmation of his faith. For <hi>Love</hi> is the cloſeſt adherence of the ſoul to God, and therefore will ſet it in the cleareſt light, and will teach it by the ſweet convincing way of <hi>experience</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual taſte. Believing</hi> alone is like the knowledge of our meat by <hi>ſeeing</hi> it: And <hi>Love</hi> is as the knowledge of our meat by <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>digeſting</hi> it. And he that hath <hi>taſted</hi> that it is ſweet, hath a ſtronger kind of perſwaſion that it is ſweet, than he that only ſeeth it; and will much more tenaciouſly hold his apprehenſion: It is more poſſible to diſpute him out of his belief, who <hi>only ſeeth,</hi> than him that alſo <hi>taſteth</hi> and <hi>concocteth.</hi> A Parent and child will not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe any falſe reports of one another, as ſtrangers or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will; becauſe <hi>Love</hi> is a powerful reſiſter of ſuch hard conceits.

               <p>And <hi>Love</hi> keepeth us under the fulleſt influences of <hi>Gods Love</hi>; and therefore in the reception of that grace which will increaſe our faith: For <hi>Love</hi> is that act which the ancient Doctors were wont to call, the <hi>principle of merit,</hi> or <hi>firſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious act</hi> of the ſoul; and which we call, the principle of <hi>rewardable acts.</hi> God beginneth and loveth us firſt, partly with a <hi>Love of complacency,</hi> only as <hi>his creatures,</hi> and alſo as

                  <hi>in eſſe cognito,</hi> he foreſeeth how amiable his grace will make us; and partly with a <hi>Love of benevolence,</hi> intending to give us that grace which ſhall make us really the objects of his further Love: And having received this grace, it cauſeth us to love God: And when we <hi>love God,</hi> we are really the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his complacential Love; and when we perceive this, it ſtill increaſeth our Love: And thus the mutual Love of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> is the true perpetual motion, which hath an everlaſting cauſe, and therefore muſt have an everlaſting duration. And ſo the faith which hath once kindled Love, even ſincere Love to God in Chriſt, hath taken <hi>rooting</hi> in the <hi>heart,</hi> and lyeth deeper than the <hi>head,</hi> and will hold faſt, and increaſe as Love increaſeth.</p>
               <p>And this is the true reaſon of the ſtedfaſtneſs and happineſs of many weak unlearned Chriſtians, who have not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conceptions and reaſonings of learned men; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their <hi>Faith</hi> is turned into <hi>Love,</hi> their <hi>Love</hi> doth help to <hi>confirm</hi> their <hi>Faith:</hi> And as they <hi>love</hi> more <hi>heartily</hi>; ſo they <hi>believe</hi> more <hi>ſtedfaſtly,</hi> and perſeveringly, than many who can ſay more for their faith.

Therefore the Holy Ghoſt doth ſet before us that cloud of witneſſes, and catalogue of Martyrs, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that <hi>example</hi> may help us, and we may ſee with how good company we go, in the life of Faith, <hi>Paul</hi> had well ſtudied the example of Chriſt, when he <hi>took pleaſure in infirmities,</hi> and gloryed only in the Croſs, to be baſe and afflicted in this world, for the

hopes of endleſs glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. &amp; 12.5 9, 10. And when he could ſay, <hi>I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord; for whom I have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt — that I may know him, and the power of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his death,</hi> Phil. 3.8, 9, 10. No man will well mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate in the life of Faith, but he that followeth the <hi>Captain of his ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 2.10. who <hi>for the bringing of many Sons to glory</hi> (even thoſe whom <hi>he is not aſhamed to call his Brethren) was made perfect,</hi> (as to perfection of <hi>action</hi> or <hi>performance</hi>) by <hi>ſuffering</hi>: thereby to ſhew us, how little the beſt of theſe viſible and ſenſible corporeal things, are to be valued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the things inviſible: and therefore as the <hi>General</hi> and the ſouldiers make up one army, and militate in one <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>; ſo <hi>he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one,</hi> Heb. 2.10, 11, 12. Though that which is called <hi>the life of Faith in us,</hi> deſerved a higher title in Chriſt, and <hi>his</hi> faith in his Father, and <hi>ours,</hi> do much differ, and he had not many of the <hi>objects, acts</hi> and <hi>uſes</hi> of Faith, as we have who are ſinners; yet in this we muſt follow him as our great example, in valuing things inviſible, and vilifying things vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in compariſon of them. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith [<hi>I am crucified with Chriſt: Nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20.</p>
               <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Remember therefore that God and Heaven, the unſeen things are the final object of true Faith: and that the final object is the nobleſt; and that the principal uſe of Faith, is to carry up the whole heart and life from things viſible and temporal, to things inviſible and eternal; and not only to comfort us in the aſſurance of our own forgiveneſs and ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an exceeding common and dangerous deceit, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look both this principal object and principal uſe of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith. 1. Many think of no other object of it, but the death and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the <hi>pardon of ſin,</hi> and the <hi>promiſe</hi> of that pardon: And <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> they look at as the objects of ſome other common kind of Faith. 2. And
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59417:88"/>
they think of little other <hi>uſe</hi> of it, than to comfort them againſt the guilt of ſin, with the aſſurance of their Juſtification. But the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> work of Faith is, that which is about its <hi>final object</hi>; to carry up the ſoul to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> where the world, and things ſenſible, are the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> and God, and things inviſible, the <hi>terminus ad quem:</hi> And thus it is put in contradiſtinction to <hi>living by fight,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 7. And thus mortification is made one part of this great effect, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. throughout, and many other places: and thus it is that <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. doth ſet before us thoſe numerous examples of a life of Faith, as it was expreſſed in valuing things unſeen, upon the belief of the Word of God, and the vilifying of things ſeen which ſtand againſt them. And thus Chriſt tryed the Rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.22. whether he would be his Diſciple, by calling him to <hi>ſell all, and give to the po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth the life of Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. by the contempt of the world, and ſuffering afflictions for the hopes of Heaven: [<hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal.</hi>] Our <hi>Faith</hi> is our victory over the world, even in the very <hi>nature</hi> of it, and not only in the remote effect; for its <hi>aſpect</hi> and believing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to God and the things unſeen, and a proportionable <hi>receſs</hi> from the things which <hi>are ſeen,</hi> is one and the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul, denominated variouſly from its various re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> and <hi>à quo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Direct. 6. <hi>Remember, that as God to be believed in, is the principal and final object of Faith; ſo the kindling of love to God in the ſoul, is the principal uſe and effect of Faith: And to live by Faith, is but to love (obey and ſuffer) by Faith. Faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Love,</hi> is the deſcription of our Chriſtianity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. As Chriſt is the <hi>Way to the Father,</hi> Joh. 14.6. and came into the world to recover Apoſtate man to God, to <hi>love</hi> him, and be beloved by him; ſo the true uſe of <hi>Faith</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59417:89"/>
to be as it were the bellows to kindle <hi>love</hi>; or the <hi>burning-glaſs</hi> as it were of the ſoul, to receive the beams of the Love of God, as they ſhine upon us in Jeſus Chriſt, and thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our hearts in love to God again. Therefore if you would live by Faith indeed, begin here, and firſt receive the deepeſt apprehenſions of that Love of the Father; <hi>Who ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life</hi>: And by theſe apprehenſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns, ſtir up your hearts to the Love of God; and make this very endeavour the work and buſineſs of your lives.</p>
               <p>Oh that miſtaken Chriſtians would be rectified in this point! how much would it tend to their <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>their peace?</hi> You think of almoſt nothing of the life of Faith; but how to believe that you have a ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt, and ſhall be ſaved by him: But you have firſt <hi>another work</hi> to do: You muſt firſt believe that <hi>common Love and Grace</hi> before mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20.14, 15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. And you muſt believe your <hi>own intereſt in this</hi>; that is, that God hath by Chriſt, made to all, and therefore unto you, an act of oblivion, and free deed of gift, that you ſhall have Chriſt, and pardon, and eternal life, if you will believingly accept the gift, and will not finally reject it. And the belief of <hi>this,</hi> even of this <hi>common Love and Grace,</hi> muſt firſt perſwade your hearts accordingly to accept the offer, (and then you have a ſpecial intereſt) and withall, at the ſame time, muſt kindle in your ſouls a thankful love to the Lord and fountain of this grace: and if you were ſo ingenuous as to begin here, and firſt uſe your <hi>Faith</hi> upon the foreſaid common gift of Chriſt, for the kindling of love to God within you, and would account this the work which Faith hath every day to do; you would then find that in the very exciting and exerciſe of this holy Love, your aſſurance of your own ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt, would be ſooner and more comfortably brought about, than by ſearching to find either <hi>evidence of pardon</hi> before you find your <hi>love to God</hi>; or to <hi>find</hi> your <hi>love to God,</hi> before you have <hi>laboured to get and exerciſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I tell you, they are dangerous deceivers of your ſouls, that ſhall contradict this obvious truth; that the true method and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59417:89"/>
motive of mans <hi>firſt ſpecial love to God,</hi> muſt not be by <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving firſt Gods ſpecial love to us</hi>; but by believing his more <hi>common love and mercy</hi> in the general act and offer of grace before mentioned. For he that believeth <hi>Gods ſpecial love to him,</hi> and his ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt, before <hi>he</hi> hath any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love to God, doth ſinfully <hi>preſume,</hi> and not <hi>believe.</hi> For if by <hi>Gods ſpecial love,</hi> you mean his love of <hi>complacency</hi> to you, as a living member of Chriſt; to believe this before you love God truly, is to believe a dangerous lie: and if you mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Gods <hi>love of benevolence,</hi> by which he decreeth to make you the objects of his foreſaid complacency, and to ſanctifie and ſave you; to believe this before you truly love God, is to believe that which is utterly unknown to you, and may be falſe for ought you know, but is not at all revealed by God, and therefore is not the object of Faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore if you cannot have true aſſurance or perſwaſion of your ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt, and of your juſtification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have a ſpecial love to God, then this ſpecial love muſt be kindled (I ſay not by a <hi>common Faith,</hi> but) by a <hi>true Faith</hi> in the <hi>General Love and Promiſe</hi> mentioned before.</p>
               <p>Nay, you muſt not only <hi>have</hi> firſt this <hi>ſpecial love</hi>; but alſo muſt have ſo much <hi>knowledge,</hi> that indeed you have it, as you will have knowledge of your ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt, and the love of God: for no act of Faith will truly evidence ſpecial grace, which is not immediately and intimately accompanied with true love to God our Father and Redeemer, and the ultimate object of our Faith: Nor can you any further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or prove, the ſincerity of your Faith it ſelf, than you diſcern in or with it, the Love here mentioned. For Faith is not only an act of the Intellect, but of the Will alſo: And there is no volition or conſent to this or any <hi>offered good,</hi> which hath not in it the true nature of Love: and the intention of <hi>the end,</hi> being in order of nature, before our choice or <hi>uſe</hi> of means; the intending of God as our end, cannot come behind that act of Faith, which is about Chriſt as the choſen <hi>means</hi> or <hi>way</hi> to God.</p>
               <p>Therefore make this your great and principal uſe of your Faith, to receive all the expreſſions of Gods Love in Chriſt, and thereby to kindle in you a love to God; that firſt the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59417:90"/>
ſpecial true belief of Gods more common love and grace, may kindle in you a ſpecial love, and then the ſenſe of this may aſſure you of your ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt; and then the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of that ſpecial intereſt, may increaſe your love to a much higher degree: And thus live by Faith in the work of Love.</p>
               <p>Direct. 7. <hi>That you may underſtand what that Faith is which you muſt live by, take in all the parts (at leaſt that are eſſential to it) in your deſcription; and take not ſome parcels of it for the Chriſtian Faith; nor think no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though unlearned perſons may <hi>have and uſe Repentance, Faith,</hi> and other graces, who cannot define them; yet they do truly (though not perfectly) know the <hi>thing it ſelf,</hi> though they know not the terms of a juſt definition: and all defect of knowing the true nature of Faith, will be ſome hinderance to us in uſing it.</p>

And if ſo, whether the parts of every letter alſo do not conſtitute an individual act; and where we ſhall here

And muſt all theſe trifles be conſidered in our Faith? <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting</hi> to the <hi>truths</hi> is not <hi>one</hi> Faith (unleſs when ſeparated from the reſt) and <hi>conſenting</hi> to the <hi>good,</hi> another act: Nor is it one Faith to believe the promiſe, and another to believe the pardon of ſin, and another to believe ſalvation, and another to believe in God, and another to believe in Jeſus Chriſt; nor one to believe in Chriſt as our Ranſom, and another as our Interceſſor, and another as our Teacher, and another as our King, and another to believe in the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. I deny not but ſome one of theſe may be ſeparated from the reſt, and being ſo ſeparated may be called <hi>Faith</hi>; but not the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> but only a material parcel of it, which is like the limb of a man, or of a tree, which cut off from the reſt, is dead, and ceaſeth when ſeparated to be a part, any otherwiſe than Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical (a part of the deſcription.)</p>
               <p>The Faith which hath the promiſe of ſalvation, and which you muſt live by, hath 1. <hi>God</hi> for the <hi>Principal Revealer,</hi> and his <hi>Veracity</hi> for its formal object. 2.

               <p>Learn this definition, and underſtand it throughly, and it may prove a more ſolid uſeful knowledge (to have the true nature of Faith or Chriſtianity thus methodically printed on your minds) than to read over a thouſand volumes in a rambling and confuſed way of knowledge.</p>
               <p>If any quarrel at this definition, becauſe the foundation is not firſt ſet down, I only tell him that no Logicians do judge of the Logical order of words by the meer priority and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of place.

There is firſt in the mind of man a conception of the <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> (by thoſe words or

Now many have the conception of the <hi>matter,</hi> long before they have the <hi>verbum mentis,</hi> or logical notions of it: And many have the <hi>verbum mentis,</hi> who by a heſitant tongue are hindered from oral expreſſions; and in both, there are divers degrees of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs and clearneſs.</p>

Seeing therefore this is the principal part of <hi>Faith</hi> (to <hi>know God, and live upon him, and to him</hi>) I ſhall give you many (though brief) Directions in it.</p>

               <p>The great argument from the <hi>Effect</hi> to the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable. All the <hi>cauſed</hi> and derived <hi>Beings</hi> in the world, muſt needs have a firſt Being for their cauſe: All <hi>Action, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection</hi> and <hi>Volition</hi>; all <hi>Power, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which is cauſed by another, doth prove that the cauſe can have <hi>no leſs</hi> than the total effect hath. To ſee the <hi>world,</hi> and to know what a <hi>man</hi> is, and yet to deny that there is a God, is to be mad. He that will not know that which all the world doth more plainly preach, than words can poſſibly expreſs, and will not know the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of his own <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>faculties,</hi> doth declare himſelf uncapable of teaching, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. &amp; 49.12, 20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2, 3.

to begin at the top, and to lay the foundation laſt, and reduce things certain to things uncertain. And it is no wiſelier done of Atheiſts, who argue from their apprehenſions of other things, againſt the Beings or Perfections of God. As when they ſay, [<hi>There is much evil in the world permitted by God; and there is death, and many tormenting pains befall even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent bruits; and there are wars and confuſions, and ignorance and wickedneſs, have dominion in the earth: Therefore God is not perfectly good; nor perfectly wiſe, and juſt, and powerful in his government of the world.</hi>] The errour in the method of arguing here, helpeth to continue their blindneſs. That <hi>God is perfectly good,</hi> is <hi>prius cognitum:</hi> Nothing is more certain than that he, who is the cauſe of all the derived <hi>goodneſs</hi> in the whole Univerſe, muſt have as much or more than all himſelf: Seeing therefore that Heaven and Earth, and all things, bear ſo evident a witneſs to <hi>this truth,</hi> this is the <hi>foundation,</hi> and <hi>firſt</hi> to be laid, and never more queſtioned, nor any argument brought againſt it. For all that poſſibly can be ſaid againſt it; muſt be <hi>à minus notis,</hi> from that which is more obſcure. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that it is moſt certain by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> that calamities and evils are in the world; and no leſs certain that there is a <hi>God,</hi> who is moſt perfectly good; it muſt needs follow that theſe two are perfectly conſiſtent; and that ſome other cauſe of evil muſt be found out, than any imperfection in the chief good. But as to the <hi>Being</hi> of things, and <hi>Order</hi> in the world, it followeth not that <hi>They</hi> muſt be as <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it was his will to imprint ſuch meaſures of his own likeneſs and excellencies upon the creatures, and with ſuch variety, as his wiſdom ſaw fitteſt; the reaſons of which are beyond our ſearch: The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Agency, as it is in him the Agent, is perfect: But the <hi>effect</hi> hath thoſe meaſures of goodneſs which he was freely pleaſed to communicate.</p>

do therefore debaſe God, and deifie his creature, who make the creature the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>it ſelf</hi>; and not <hi>God</hi> the ultimate end of the creature.

And that no mixt bodies which do <hi>oriri &amp; interire,</hi> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and corrupted, were from eternity; and conſequently, that this preſent ſyſteme called the <hi>world,</hi> which is within our ſight, was not from eternity: But that as ſpring and fall doth revive the plants, and end their tranſitory life; ſo it hath been with theſe particular ſyſtemes; the ſimpler and nobler parts of the Univerſe continuing the ſame. And they held that the <hi>world is next to infinitely good</hi>; and as good as it is poſſible to be without being <hi>God</hi>; and that for God to produce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, or an infinite good, is a contradiction: And that all the baſer, and pained, and miſerable parts of the world, are <hi>beſt reſpectively to the perfection of the whole,</hi> though not beſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59417:104"/>
in and to themſelves; (As every nuck and pin in a watch is neceſſary as well as the chief parts.) And that all things ſet together, it is beſt that all things <hi>be</hi> as they <hi>are,</hi> and will be: But of this the infinite Wiſdom, who ſeeth not only ſome little parts, but the whole Univerſe at one perfect view, is the fitteſt Judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the generality of Divines do hold the contrary, and ſay, that it is natural to God to be the Alſufficient pregnant good; not only <hi>able</hi> to communicate goodneſs, but <hi>inclined</hi> to it, as far as his perfection doth require; but not inclined to communicate in a way of natural conſtant neceſſity, as the Sun ſhineth, but in a way of <hi>liberty, when,</hi> and in <hi>what degrees</hi> he <hi>pleaſeth</hi>; which <hi>pleaſure</hi> is guided by his <hi>infinite <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> which no mortal man can comprehend; and therefore muſt not ask any further reaſon of the firſt reaſon and <hi>will</hi>; but ſtop here, and be ſatisfied to find that it is indeed <hi>Gods Will</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which cauſeth all things <hi>when</hi> and <hi>what</hi> they are, and not otherwiſe. And that God hath not made the Univerſe as good in it ſelf, as by his abſolute Power he could have made it: But that it is <hi>beſt</hi> to be as it is and will be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is moſt ſuitable to his perfect <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> And this anſwer ſeemeth moſt agreeable to Gods Word.</p>
               <p>And as you muſt ſee that your thoughts of Gods <hi>Goodneſs</hi> be not falſe; ſo alſo that they be not diminutive and low. As no knowledge is more uſeful and neceſſary to us; ſo nothing is more wonderfully revealed by God, than is his <hi>amiable Goodneſs:</hi> For this end he ſent his Son into fleſh, to declare his Love to the forelorn world, and to call them to behold it, and admire it, <hi>John</hi> 1 8, 9, 10. &amp; 3.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. And as Chriſt is the chief glaſs of the Fathers Love, on this ſide Heaven; ſo it is the chief part of the office of <hi>Faith,</hi> to ſee Gods Love and Goodneſs in the face of Chriſt: Let him not reveal his Love in vain, at ſo dear a rate, and in a way of ſuch wonderful condeſcenſion: Think of his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> as equal to his <hi>greatneſs</hi>: And as you ſee his <hi>greatneſs</hi> in the frame of the world; ſo his <hi>goodneſs</hi> in the wonderful work of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation: Let <hi>Faith beholding God in Chriſt,</hi> and daily thus gazing on his <hi>goodneſs, or rather taſting it, and feaſting on it,</hi> be the very ſumm of all your Religion and

               <p>Even ſuch revelations of Gods goodneſs and fidelity as are made in <hi>Nature,</hi> or the works of Creation, are ſometimes in Scriptures made the objects of faith.

Whereas it is the Love of God, which is the original of our Redemption, and it was Gods loving the world, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to give his Son to be their Redeemer, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>And God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing to them their treſpaſſes,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. And therefore we ſtill read of Chriſts <hi>reconciling man to God,</hi> and not the phraſe of his <hi>reconciling God to man:</hi> Not but that both are truly wrought by Chriſts mediation; (For the Scripture frequently ſpeaketh of Gods <hi>hating</hi> the workers of iniquity, and of his <hi>vindictive Juſtice,</hi> and of that <hi>propitiating</hi> and <hi>attonement,</hi> which ſignifieth the ſame thing:) But the reaſon is, becauſe the enmity began on mans part, and not on Gods, by mans forſaking God, and turning his love from him to the creature, and not by Gods forſaking man; and the change of mans ſtate and heart towards God, by true reconciliation, will make him again capable of peace with God; and as ſoon as man is made an <hi>object</hi> fit for the complacency of God, it cannot be but that God will again take complacency in him; ſo that the <hi>real change</hi> muſt be only on man; and then that <hi>relative</hi> or <hi>denominative</hi> change which muſt be on God, will thence immediately reſult.</p>
               <p>Some alſo there be who gather from Chriſts death, that God deſired the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt as <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him <hi>in it ſelf</hi>; as if he made a bargain with Chriſt to ſell ſo much <hi>mercy</hi> to man, for ſo much <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> of Chriſt; and as if he ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the blood of the innocent, that he would the willinglyer <hi>do good to us,</hi> if he might firſt <hi>forſake</hi> and <hi>crucifie</hi> Chriſt. But this is to contradict Chriſts buſineſs in the world, as if he who came from Heaven to declare <hi>Gods Love,</hi> had come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to delight in doing hurt; and as if he who came
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59417:109"/>
to demonſtrate Gods Juſtice, had come to ſhew, that he had rather puniſh the innocent, than the guilty: But the caſe is quite otherwiſe: God doth not delight in mans ſufferings as ſuch; no not of the guilty, much leſs of the innocent: He deſired not Chriſts <hi>ſuffering</hi> for <hi>it ſelf:</hi> But as it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient <hi>means,</hi> to demonſtrate his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and to vindicate the honour of his <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> and to be a warning to ſinners, not to ſin preſumptuouſly; and yet to declare to them the greatneſs of his <hi>Love.</hi>

The preparation which Chriſt hath made for our pardon, is in it ſelf ſufficient, yea and effectual as to that end which he would have it attain before our believing: But our <hi>actual pardon</hi> is no ſuch end: Nor can ſin be <hi>forgiven</hi> before it be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>; becauſe it is <hi>no ſin.</hi> Chriſt never intended to <hi>juſtifie</hi> or <hi>ſanctifie us perfectly</hi> at the firſt (whatſoever many ſay to the contrary, becauſe they underſtand not what they ſay) but to carry on <hi>both</hi> proportionably and by degrees, that we may have daily uſe for his daily mediation, and may daily pray, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes.</hi> There is <hi>no guilt</hi> on them that are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo far as they <hi>walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit</hi>; nor no proper <hi>condemnation</hi> by <hi>ſentence</hi> or <hi>execution</hi> at all; becauſe their pardon is renewed by Chriſt, as they renew their ſins of infirmity: but not becauſe he <hi>preventeth</hi> their <hi>need</hi> of any further pardon.</p>

               <p>Remember therefore that we live in Chriſt, and <hi>that the life which we now live is by the faith of the Son of God, who hath loved us, and given himſelf for us,</hi> Gal. 2.20.

               <p>THis is not the leaſt part of the life of Faith. If the Spirit give us <hi>Faith it ſelf,</hi> then Faith hath certainly its proper work to do towards that Spirit which giveth it: And if the Spirit be the worker of all other grace, and Faith be the means on our part, then Faith hath ſomewhat to do with the Holy Ghoſt herein. The beſt way that I can take in helping you to <hi>believe aright in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> will be by opening the true ſenſe of this great Article of our Faith to you, that by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the matter aright, you may know what you are here both to <hi>do,</hi> and to <hi>expect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Direct. 1. <hi>The name of the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of God, is uſed in Scripture for the third perſon in the Trinity as conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and as the third perfective principle of operation; and moſt uſually as operating</hi> ad extra, <hi>by communication.</hi> And therefore many <hi>Fathers,</hi> and ancient Divines and Schoolmen, ſay. <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt, the third perſon and principle is THE LOVE OF GOD; which as it is Gods Love of himſelf, is a conſtitutive
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59417:115"/>
perſon or principle in the Trinity; but as it is pregnant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive, it is the third principle of operation</hi> ad extra; and ſo that it is taken uſually, for the <hi>pregnant, operative Love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus they ſuppoſe that the Divine <hi>POWER, INTEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECT</hi> and <hi>WILL</hi> (or <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>) are the three <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive perſons in themſelves,</hi> and the <hi>three principles</hi> of <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ad extra. To this purpoſe writeth <hi>Origen, Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Richardus</hi> the Schoolman; but plainlier and fullier <hi>Damaſcene</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Edmundus Cantuarienſis,</hi> and <hi>Potho Prumenſis</hi> cited by me in my <hi>Reaſons of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> page 372, 373, 374. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> only putteth <hi>Memory</hi> for <hi>Power,</hi> by which yet <hi>Campanella</hi> thinketh he meant <hi>Power, (Metaphyſ. par.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 88.) what <hi>Caeſarius</hi> and many other ſay <hi>de triplici lumine,</hi> I paſs by: The <hi>Lux Radii &amp; Lumen,</hi> are thought a fit ſimilitude by many. But the <hi>Motion, Light</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> is a plain impreſſion of the Trinity on that noble ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire. That holy man <hi>Ephraem Syrus</hi> in his Teſtament uſeth the phraſe (in his adjuration of his Diſciples, and the proteſtation of his own ſtedfaſtneſs in the doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> againſt all Hereſies) [<hi>By that three-named fire of the moſt holy Trinity</hi>] (or <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> as another Copy hath it) [<hi>And by that infinite and ſole, one Power of God; and by thoſe three ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences of the intelligible (or intellectual) fire.</hi>] And as it is a moſt great and certain truth, that this ſacred Trinity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Principles,</hi> have made their impreſs communicatively up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>frame of nature,</hi> and moſt evidently on the <hi>nobleſt parts,</hi> which are in excellency neareſt their Creatour; ſo it is evident that in the creatures <hi>LOVE</hi> is the <hi>pregnant communicative principle</hi>: So is <hi>Natural Love</hi> in <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>friendly Love</hi> in benefiting others; and <hi>ſpiritual Love,</hi> in propagating know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and grace, for the winning of ſouls.</p>

               <p>Direct. 2. <hi>The more excellent meaſure of the Spirit given by Chriſt after his aſcenſion to the Goſpel Church, is to be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that which was before communicated; and this Spirit

               </p>
               <p>Without the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> as the <hi>perfective principle, nature</hi> would not have been nature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. All things would not have been <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>very good,</hi> but by the communication of <hi>goodneſs:</hi> And without ſomewhat of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> there would be no <hi>Moral Goodneſs</hi> in any of mankind: And without ſome <hi>ſpecial operations</hi> of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>godly</hi> before Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fleſh, would not have been <hi>godly,</hi> nor in any preſent capacity of glory: Therefore there was ſome gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit before.</p>
               <p>But yet there was an <hi>eminent</hi> gift of the <hi>Spirit</hi> proper to the Goſpel times, which the former ages did not know; which is ſo much above the former gift, that it is ſufficient to prove the <hi>Verity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. There was uſe for the ſpeciall atteſtation of the Father by way of <hi>Power,</hi> by Miracles, and his Reſurrection to own his Son. 2. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of God incarnate, muſt needs bring a ſpecial meaſure of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to his Diſciples; and therefore give a greater meaſure of the Spirit for <hi>illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 3. The deſign of Redemption being the revelation of the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and the recovery of our <hi>Love to him,</hi> there muſt needs be a ſpecial meaſure of the <hi>Spirit of Love</hi> ſhed abroad upon our hearts. And in all theſe three reſpects, the Spirit was accordingly communicated.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Was it not the Spirit of Chriſt which was in the Prophets, and in all the godly before Chriſts coming?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt is either that meaſure of the Spirit, which was given after the firſt Covenant of Grace, as it differeth from the ſtate of man in <hi>innocency,</hi> and from the ſtate of man in his Apoſtacy and condemnation: And thus it was the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> which was then given, ſo far as it was the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Grace of Chriſt,</hi> by which men were then ſaved. But there was a <hi>fuller Covenant</hi> to be made after his coming, and a <hi>fuller meaſure of Grace</hi> to be given, and a <hi>full atteſtation</hi> of God for the eſtabliſhment and promulgation of this Covenant: And accordingly a fuller and ſpecial gift of the Spirit.

               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Was it before neceſſary to have an explicite belief in the Holy Ghoſt as the third perſon in the bleſſed Trinity, and as the third principle of the divine operations, and were the faithful then in Covenant with him?</hi>

               <p>Direct. 23. <hi>The way of trying the ſpirits, is to try all their uncertain ſuggeſtions, by the Rule of the certain Truths already revealed in Nature, and in the holy Scriptures: And to try them by the Scriptures, is but to try the ſpirits, by the Spirit: the doubtfull ſpirit, by the undoubted Spirit, which indited and ſealed the Scriptures more fully, than can be expected in any after reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.21. Iſa. 8.16, 20. 2 Pet. 1.19. John 5.39. Acts 17.11. The Spirit of God is never contrary to it ſelf: Therefore nothing can be from that Spirit, which is contrary to the Scriptures which the Spirit indited.</p>

               <p>Faith in Chriſt doth two waies help us to the Spirit: 1. As it is that <hi>Condition</hi> upon which he hath promiſed it, to whom it belongeth to give us the Spirit. 2. As it is that act of the ſoul which is fitted in the <hi>nature</hi> of it, to the work of the Spirit: That is, as it is the ſerious contemplation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs and Love of God, moſt brightly ſhining to us in the face of the Redeemer: and as it is a ſerious contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that heavenly glory procured by Chriſt, which is the fulleſt expreſſion of the Love of God: and ſo is fitteſt to kindle that Love to God in the ſoul, which is the work of the Spirit.

               </p>
               <p>This is a great point of Chriſtian wiſdom: The help of the Spirit is not at our command: take it while you have it. Uſe wind and tide before they ceaſe. God will not be a ſervant to our ſlothfulneſs and negligence. As he that will not come to the Church at the hour when the Miniſter of Chriſt is there, but ſay, I will come another time, will have none of his teaching there; ſo he that will not take the <hi>Spirits time,</hi> but ſay, I am not now at leiſure, may be left without its help, and taught by ſad experience to know, that it is fitter for man to wait on God, than for God to wait on man. More may be done and got at one hour, than at another, when we have no ſuch help and motions.</p>
               <p>Direct. 28. <hi>Be much in the contemplation of the heavenly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for there are the higheſt objects, and the greateſt demonſtrations of Gods Love and Goodneſs; and therefore in ſuch thoughts we are moſt likely to meet with the Spirit with whoſe nature and deſign they are ſo agreeable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We fall in with the heavenly Spirit in his own way, when we ſet our ſelves to be moſt heavenly. Heavenly thoughts are the work which he would ſet you on; and the <hi>Love of God</hi> is the thing which he works you to thereby: And nothing will ſo powerfully inflame the ſoul with the Love of God, as to think that we ſhall live in his Love and Glory for ever more. Set your ſelves therefore to this work, and it will be a ſign that the Spirit ſets you on it; and you may be ſure that he will not be behind with you, in a work which both he and you muſt do. To this ſenſe the Apoſtle bids us, <hi>pray in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Jude 20. Becauſe though prayer muſt be from the Spirit, which is not in our power; yet when we ſet our ſelves to pray, it is both a <hi>ſign</hi> that the Spirit exciteth, and a certain proof that he will not be behind with us, but will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us his aſſiſtance.</p>

If he was ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after the Creation, to ſee them all good, that he appointed a Sabbath of Reſt, to celebrate the commemoration of it; how much more will it pleaſe him to ſee all reſtored by Jeſus Chriſt, and brought up to that perfection which <hi>Adam</hi> was but in the <hi>way</hi> to when he ſinned and fell ſhort of the Glory of God.

I have elſewhere ſhewed that the Government of the world is mainly ſteered by the hopes and fears of another life, and could not be otherwiſe, unleſs man be turned into far worſe than a beaſt.

Reaſon, but his <hi>Promiſes</hi> alſo. It is agreeable to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>Infinite Goodneſs</hi> to <hi>do good:</hi> And yet we ſee that he doth not do to all alike. He maketh not every creature an Angel, nor a man: How then ſhall we diſcern what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to do by his creatures, but by their ſeveral <hi>natures:</hi> The <hi>nature</hi> of every thing is fitted to its uſe. Seeing therefore God hath given man a <hi>nature</hi> capable of <hi>knowing, loving</hi> and <hi>enjoying</hi> him, we have reaſon to think he gave it not in vain. And we have reaſon to think that <hi>nature</hi> may be brought up to its own perfection; and that he never intended to imploy man all his daies on earth, in ſeeking an end which cannot be attained. And yet we ſee that ſome do unfit themſelves for this end, by turning from it, and following vanity: and that God requireth every man as a free Agent, to uſe his guidance and help aright, for his own preparation to felicity. Therefore reaſon may tell us, that thoſe who are ſo prepared by the neareſt capacity, and have a love to God, and a heavenly mind, ſhall enjoy the Glory which they are fitted for. And it helpeth much our belief of Gods Promiſe, to find that Reaſon thus diſcerneth the equity of it: Yea to find that a <hi>Cicero,</hi> a <hi>Seneca,</hi> a <hi>Socrates,</hi> a <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp;c. expected much the like feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to the juſt, which the Scripture promiſeth.</p>

               <p>Many do make promiſes to themſelves by miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and look that God ſhould fulfil them: and if any of them be not fulfilled, they are ready to ſuſpect the truth of God. And thus men become <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> to <hi>themſelves</hi> and others, and ſpeak words in the Name of the Lord, which he hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoken, and incur much of the guilt, which God oft chargeth on falſe Prophets, and ſuch as <hi>add</hi> to the Word of God.

And to our ſouls, which God doth promiſe to his own. And <hi>his Wiſdom,</hi> and not their partial conceits, ſhall be the Judge. <hi>Our Father knoweth what we need,</hi> and therefore we muſt caſt our care on him, and take not too <hi>particular</hi> nor anxious thoughts for our ſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24. to the end, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5 7.</p>

If it be meant of his <hi>Commanding Will,</hi> the event notoriouſly gainſayeth it: For it is moſt certain, that ſince the Church hath long prayed for the converſion of the Infidel world, and the reforming of the corrupted Churches, &amp;c. it is not yet done: And it is all Chriſtians duty, to pray for Kings, and all in Authority; and to ask that wiſdom and grace for them which God doth ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom give them. And all Parents who are bound to pray for grace for their children, do not ſpeed according to their prayers.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>That is becauſe that prayers for other men, ſuppoſe others to concur in the qualifying conditions as well as our ſelves: But the promiſe is meant only of whatſoever we ask for our ſelves as he commandeth, or for others who are prepared as he requireth.

It cannot be thought that our prayers for Infidels, who muſt have preparing grace before they can be prepared, ſhould be thus ſuſpended in their preparation of themſelves. 3. It maybe a duty to pray for many things for <hi>our ſelves</hi> too, which yet we ſhall not particularly receive:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59417:135"/>
As a Miniſter may pray for greater abilities for his work, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>We pray not as commanded for any ſuch things, if we pray not conditionally for them. Anſw.</hi> But ſtill the difficulty is, <hi>What is the condition to be inſerted?</hi> whether it be, <hi>If God will?</hi> Or, <hi>If it be for our good?</hi> Or, <hi>If it be for the univerſal good of the world?</hi> If it were the laſt, then we might be ſure of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men, when we ask it; and the ſecond cannot be the condition when we pray for others: and if it be the <hi>firſt,</hi> then it telleth us that the <hi>commanding Will of God</hi> is not it which is principally meant in the promiſe.</p>
               <p>In this difficulty we muſt conclude, that the text reſpecteth Gods Will comprehenſively in all theſe three forementioned reſpects; but <hi>primarily</hi> his <hi>promiſing Will</hi> in matters which fall under promiſe, and his <hi>decreeing Will</hi> in things which he hath thought meet to make no promiſe of: and then ſecondarily, his <hi>commanding Will</hi> to us; but this extendeth not only to <hi>prayer</hi> it ſelf, but alſo to the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> and to our <hi>conjunct</hi> and <hi>ſubſequent endeavours.</hi> And ſo this meeteth and cloſeth with the former <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> becauſe we do not pray according to his <hi>commanding Will, unleſs</hi> we do it with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his <hi>promiſing</hi> and <hi>decreeing Will.</hi> And ſo it is, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where only <hi>Gods decreeing Will</hi> is the meaſure of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be granted, the text intendeth not to us a particular aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the <hi>thing</hi>; but the comfort that <hi>we</hi> and our <hi>prayers</hi> are <hi>accepted,</hi> and they ſhall be granted if it be not ſuch a thing, as God in his wiſdom and eternal counſel, hath ſecretly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to do.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59417:135"/>
doth both confirm our Faith in general, which is a help to us in each particular caſe; and alſo it directeth us to Chriſt as the <hi>means,</hi> in whoſe name we are to ask all things of the Father; and aſſureth us, that it is for his ſake that God doth fulfil thoſe particular promiſes to us. 2. And <hi>prayer</hi> in his Name, is the condition, way or means of the fulfilling them.</p>
               <p>It is a very common errour among many praying perſons, to think that if they can but prove it their duty to ask ſuch a thing, this promiſe telleth them, that they ſhall have it: But you ſee there is more neceſſary to the underſtanding of it than ſo.</p>
               <p>Direct. 10. <hi>Think not that God prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This is a more common errour than the former: Many think that if the thing be but <hi>lawful</hi> which they pray for, much more if it be their <hi>duty</hi> to pray for it, then a <hi>particular belief that they ſhall receive it,</hi> is the condition of the promiſe, and therefore that they ſhall certainly receive it. As if they pray for the recovery of one that is ſick, or for the converſion of one that is unconverted, and can but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> that it ſhall be done, they think God is then obliged by promiſe to do it, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.23. <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible.</hi> And 11.23, 24. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay to this Mountain, Be thou removed, &amp;c. and ſhall not doubt in his heart, but believe, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſon of this was, becauſe they had a <hi>ſpecial promiſe</hi> of the gift of miracles, as is expreſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18. And even this text is ſuch a particular promiſe: For the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of miracles was then given to confirm the Goſpel, and gather the firſt Churches, and Faith was the condition of them: Or the Spirit, when ever he would work a miracle, would firſt work an extraordinary Faith to prepare for it. And yet if you examine well the particular texts, which ſpeak of this ſubject, you ſhall find that as it was the doubt of the <hi>divine Authority</hi> of Chriſts teſtimony, and of his <hi>own real power</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was the unbelief of thoſe times; ſo it was the <hi>belief</hi> of his <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which was the Faith required: and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59417:136"/>
this is oftener expreſſed than the belief of the <hi>event</hi>; and when the belief of the event is extolled, it is becauſe the belief of <hi>Chriſts Power</hi> is contained in it. [<hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible,</hi> Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that this text is no exception from the general Rule; but the meaning of it is, <hi>Whatſoever promiſed thing you ask, not doubting, ye ſhall receive it:</hi> Or doubt not of my enabling power, and you ſhall receive whatever you ask, which I have promiſed you; and miracles themſelves ſhall be done by you.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But what if they had only doubted of Chriſts Will? Anſw.</hi> If they had doubted of his <hi>will</hi> in caſes where he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>expreſt</hi> his <hi>will,</hi> they could not indeed have been certain of the event (for that is contrary to the doubt.) But they could not have charged Chriſt with any breach of promiſe; and therefore could not themſelves have been charged with any unbelief. (For it is no unbelief to doubt of that <hi>will</hi> which never was revealed.) But if they had doubted of his <hi>revealed will</hi> concerning the event, they had then charged him with <hi>falſhood,</hi> and had ſinned againſt him, as ill as thoſe who deny his power.</p>
               <p>And the large experience of this our age, confuteth this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid errour of a <hi>particular belief:</hi> For we have abundance of inſtances of good people who were thus miſtaken, and have ventured thereupon to conclude with confidence, that ſuch a ſick perſon ſhall be healed, and ſuch a thing ſhall come to paſs; when over and over the event hath proved contrary, and brought ſuch confidence into contempt, upon the failing of it.</p>

               <p>And it is moſt evident that the ſincere have been <hi>weak in faith,</hi> Luke 17.5. <hi>And the Apoſtles ſaid unto the Lord, Increaſe our faith,</hi> Mark 9.24. <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi> Luke 7.9. <hi>I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael.</hi> The <hi>weak faith</hi> was the more common.</p>

                  </gap>6. <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</hi> Mat. 14.31. <hi>Peter</hi> had a faith that could venture his life on the waters to come to Chriſt, as confident of a miracle upon his command: But yet it was not without fear, <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>When he ſaw the wind boiſterous, he was afraid</hi>; which cauſed Chriſt to ſay [<hi>O thou of little faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi>]</p>
               <p>And you cannot ſay that this is only a hinderance in the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying act,</hi> and not in the <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>principal act</hi> of faith: For <hi>Luke</hi> 24.21. we find ſome Diſciples at this paſs [<hi>But we truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it had been he, who ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi>] And <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. Chriſt ſaith to them <hi>O fools, and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken; ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his Glory?</hi> Luke 24.11. The words of them who told the Apoſtles, that Chriſt <hi>was riſen, ſeemed but as tales to them, and they believed them not.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 41. <hi>While they believed not for joy, and wondered, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59417:146"/>
fail extraordinarily in an hour of temptation, ſo far as to <hi>deny Chriſt,</hi> or ſhrink from him in this fear: ſo did <hi>Peter,</hi> and not only he, but <hi>all the Diſciples forſook him, and fled,</hi> Matth. 26 56.</p>
               <p>But yet he that <hi>according to the habituated ſtate of his ſoul, hath ſo much Faith, and Love, as will cauſe him to venture life and all, upon the truſt which he hath to the promiſes of the Goſpel, hath a true and ſaving fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And here I deſire all doubting Chriſtians, to lay by the common miſtake in the trying of their faith or truſt in Chriſt, and to go hereafter upon ſurer grounds. Many ſay, <hi>I cannot believe or truſt Chriſt for ſalvation, for I am full of doubts, and fears, and troubles; and ſurely this is not truſting God. Anſ.</hi> 1. The queſtion is not, whether you truſt him <hi>perfectly,</hi> ſo as to have no <hi>fears,</hi> no <hi>troubles,</hi> no <hi>doubts:</hi> but whether you <hi>truſt him ſincerely, ſo far as to venture all upon him in his way.</hi> If you can <hi>venture all on him,</hi> and <hi>let go all</hi> to follow him, your faith is true and ſaving.</p>
               <p>This would abundantly comfort many fearful troubled Chriſtians, if they did but underſtand it well: For many of them that thus fear, would as ſoon as any, forſake all for Chriſt, and let go all carnal pleaſures, and worldly things, or any wilful ſin whatſoever, rather than forſake him; and would not take to any other portion and felicity than God, nor any other way than Chriſt, and the Spirit of holineſs, for all the temptations in the world: And yet they fear becauſe they fear; and doubt more becauſe they doubt. Doubting ſoul, let this reſolve thee; ſuppoſe Chriſt and his way were like a Pilot with his Ship at Sea: Many more promiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey thee ſafely, and many perſwade thee not to venture, but ſtay at Land: But if thou haſt ſo much truſt as that thou wilt go, and put thy ſelf, and all that thou haſt into this Ship, and forſake all other, though thou go trembling all the way, and be afraid of every ſtorm, and tempeſt, and gulf; yet thou haſt true faith, though it be weak. If thy faith will but keep thee in the Ship with Chriſt, that thou neither turn back again to the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and world; nor yet take another Ship and Pilot, (as Mahometanes, and thoſe without the Church) undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Chriſt will bring thee ſafe to Land, though thy fear and diſtruſt be ſtill thy ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:59417:146"/>For the hypocrites caſe is alwaies ſome of theſe: 1. Some of them will only <hi>truſt</hi> God in ſome <hi>ſmaller matter,</hi> wherein their happineſs conſiſteth not: As a man will <hi>truſt</hi> one with ſome <hi>trifle</hi> which he doth not much regard, whom yet he thinks ſo ill of, that he cannot truſt him in a matter of weight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some of them will <hi>truſt God</hi> for the ſaving of their <hi>ſouls,</hi> and the <hi>life to come</hi> (or rather <hi>preſume</hi> on him, while they call it <hi>truſting him</hi>) but they will not truſt him with their <hi>bodies,</hi> their <hi>wealth,</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> and fleſhly <hi>pleaſures,</hi> or their <hi>lives.</hi> Theſe they are reſolved to ſhift for, and ſecure themſelves, as well as they can. For they know that for the world to come, they muſt be at Gods diſpoſal, and they have no way of their own to ſhift out of his hands: whether there be ſuch a life or no, they know not; but if there be, they will caſt their ſouls upon Gods mercy, when they have kept the world as long as they can, and have had all that it can do for them. But they will not loſe their preſent part, for ſuch uncertain hopes as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some of them will truſt him only in pretence and name, while it is the creature which they truſt indeed. Becauſe they have learned to ſay, that God is the diſpoſer of all, and only to be truſted, and all creatures are but uſed by his will; therefore they think that when they truſt the creature, it is but in ſubordination to God; though indeed they truſt not God at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some of them will truſt God and the creature joyntly; and as they ſerve God and Mammon, and think to make ſure of the proſperity of the body, and the ſalvation of the ſoul, without loſing either of them; ſo they truſt in both conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to make up their felicity. Some think when they read Chriſts words, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.24. <hi>How hard is it for them that truſt in Riches, to enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi>] that they are ſafe enough if that be all the danger; for they do not <hi>truſt in their riches,</hi> though they <hi>love them:</hi> He is a mad man they ſay, that will <hi>put his truſt</hi> in them. And yet Chriſt intimateth it as the true reaſon why <hi>few that have riches</hi> can be ſaved, becauſe there is <hi>few that have riches,</hi> who do not <hi>truſt in them:</hi> You know that <hi>riches</hi> will not ſave your ſouls; you know that they will not ſave you from the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve, you know that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59417:147"/>
they will not cure your diſeaſes, nor eaſe your pains: And therefore you do not <hi>truſt</hi> to riches, either to keep you from <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> or from <hi>dying,</hi> or from <hi>Hell</hi>: But yet you think that riches may help you to live in <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and in reputation with the world, and in plenty of all things, and to have your will, as long as health and life will laſt; and this you take to be the chiefeſt happineſs which a man can make ſure of: And for this you <hi>truſt</hi> them. The fool in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. who ſaid, <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry, thou haſt enough laid up for many years,</hi> did not truſt his riches to make him <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> nor to <hi>ſave his ſoul:</hi> But he <hi>truſted</hi> in them, as a proviſion which might ſuffice for many years, that he might <hi>eat, drink, and be merry, and take his eaſe</hi>; and this he loved better, and preferred before any pleaſures or happineſs which he hoped for in another world. And thus it is that all worldly hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites do <hi>truſt</hi> in riches: Yea the <hi>pooreſt</hi> do truſt in their little poor proviſions in this world, as ſeeming to them <hi>ſurer,</hi> and therefore <hi>better</hi> than any which they can expect hereafter. This is the way of <hi>truſting in uncertain riches, (viz.</hi> to be their ſureſt happineſs) inſtead of <hi>truſting in the living God,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17. &amp; 4.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.6. &amp; 52.7.</p>
               <p>But yet becauſe the hypocrite knoweth, that he cannot live here alwaies, but muſt die, and his riches muſt be parted with at laſt, and heareth of a life of glory afterwards, he would fain have his part in that too, when he can keep the world no longer: And ſo he taketh both together for his part and hope, <hi>viz.</hi> as much bodily happineſs as he can get in this world, and Heaven at laſt, when he muſt die: not knowing that God will be all our portion and felicity, or none; and that the world muſt be valued and uſed but for his ſake, and in ſubordination to him and a better world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet ſome hypocrites ſeem to go further (though they do not) for they will <hi>ſeem,</hi> even to <hi>themſelves,</hi> to <hi>reſign goods,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> and all things <hi>abſolutely</hi> to the will of God. But the reaſon is, becauſe they are ſecretly perſwaded in their hearts, that their reſignation ſhall no whit deprive them of them; and that God will never the more take it from them; but that they may poſſeſs as much preſent corporal felicity, in a life of Religion, as if they lived in the dangerous caſe of the ungodly:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59417:147"/>
or at leaſt, that they may keep ſo much, as not to be <hi>undone</hi> or left to any <hi>great ſufferings</hi> in the world; or at leaſt, their lives may not be called for. For they live in a time, when few ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for Chriſt; and therefore they ſee little cauſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if they had not this hope, they would never give up all to Chriſt. But like perſons that will be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to their Phyſician, they will offer a great deal, when they think he will not take it; but if they thought he would take all that is offered, they would offer leſs. Or as if a ſick perſon ſhould hear that ſuch a Phyſician will give him no very ſtrong or loathſome Phyſick; and therefore when the Phyſician telleth him [<hi>I will be none of your Phyſician unleſs you will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely promiſe to take every thing which I ſhall give you.</hi>] He promiſeth that <hi>he will</hi> do it; but it is only becauſe he <hi>ſuppoſeth</hi> that he will give him nothing which is <hi>troubleſome:</hi> And if he find his expectation croſt, he breaketh his promiſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith, <hi>If I had known that he would have uſed me thus, I would never have promiſed it him.</hi> So hypocrites by <hi>promiſe</hi> give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>abſolutely</hi> to God, and to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>wholly</hi> at his will, without excepting life it ſelf: But their <hi>hearts</hi> do ſecretly <hi>except</hi> it: For all this is becauſe they doubt not but they may ſave their earthly proſperity and lives, and be Chriſtians too: And if once Chriſt call them to ſuffer death for him, they ſhew then what was the meaning of their hearts.</p>
               <p>To reaſſume the former ſimilitude; <hi>If Chriſt on earth ſhould offer to convey you to a Kingdom at the Antipodes, where men live for ever in glorious holineſs, if you will but truſt him, and go in his Ship, and take him for your Pilot:</hi> Here one ſaith, I do not believe him that there is ſuch a place, and therefore I will not go (that is, the Infidel.) Another ſaith, I like my merry life at home, better than his <hi>glorious holineſs</hi> (that's the open <hi>worldling</hi> and <hi>prophane.</hi>) Another ſaith, <hi>I will live in my own Country, and on my own eſtate,</hi> as long as I can, and when I find that I am dying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and can ſtay here no longer, that I may be ſure to loſe nothing by him, I will take his offer. Another ſaith, I will go with him, but I will turn back again, if I find any dangerous ſtorms and gulfs in the paſſage. Another ſaith, I
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59417:148"/>
will take another Ship and Pilot along with me, leſt he ſhould fail me, that I may not be deceived. Another ſaith, I am told that the Seas are calm, and there is no danger in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and therefore I will abſolutely truſt him, and venture all; but when he meets with ſtorms and hideous waves, he ſaith, This is not as I expected, and ſo he turneth back again. But another (the true Chriſtian) ſaith, <hi>I will venture all, and wholly truſt him:</hi> And ſo, though he is oft afraid in dangers, when he ſeeth the devouring gulfs, yet not <hi>ſo fearful</hi> as to turn back, but on he goeth, come on it what will; becauſe he knoweth that the place which he goeth to is moſt deſirable, and mortality will ſoon end his old proſperity; and he hath great reaſon to believe his Pilot to be <hi>truſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all this you may ſee, how it cometh to paſs that Chriſt who promiſeth life to <hi>Believers,</hi> doth yet make <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> and <hi>forſaking all that we have, even life it ſelf,</hi> to be alſo neceſſary; and what relation <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> hath to <hi>faith, Luke</hi> 14.26, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Nearer by far than moſt conſider. You may ſee here the reaſon why Chriſt tryed the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.22. with <hi>ſelling all, and following him in hope of a reward in Heaven:</hi> And why he bid his Diciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.33. <hi>Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide your ſelves bags which wax not old, a treaſure in the Heavens which faileth not</hi>—And why the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were made a pattern of entire Chriſtianity, by <hi>ſelling</hi> all, and laying down at the Apoſtles feet; And <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi> were the inſtances of Hypocriſie, who ſecretly and lying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept back part: You ſee here how it comes to paſs, that all true Chriſtians muſt be heart-martyrs, or prepared to die for Chriſt and Heaven, rather than forſake him. You may plainly perceive that <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf is an <hi>Affiance</hi> or <hi>Truſting</hi> in <hi>God by Chriſt,</hi> even a <hi>Truſting in God in Heaven</hi> as our felicity, and in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Mediator</hi> and the <hi>Way</hi>; and that this <hi>Truſt</hi> is a <hi>venturing all upon him,</hi> and a <hi>forſaking all for God,</hi> and his <hi>promiſes in Chriſt.</hi> And that it is one and the ſame <hi>Motion</hi> which from the <hi>terminus à quo</hi> is called <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all</hi>; and from the <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> is <hi>called Truſt</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> They that are willing to ſee, may profit much by this obſervation; and they that are not may quarrel at it, and talk againſt that which their prejudice will not allow them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:59417:148"/>And by all this you may ſee alſo wherein the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of Faith conſiſteth: And that is 1. In ſo clear a <hi>ſight</hi> of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of truth as ſhall leave no conſiderable <hi>doubtings, Mat.</hi> 21.21. So <hi>Abraham ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief, but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In ſo <hi>confirmed a Reſolution</hi> to cleave to God and Chriſt alone, as leaveth no wavering, or looking back: that we may ſay groundedly with <hi>Peter,</hi> Though I die, I will not deny thee; which doubtleſs ſignified then ſome ſtrength of faith: And as <hi>Paul, I am ready not only to be bound, but to die for the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Acts 21.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In ſo ſtrong a <hi>fortitude</hi> of ſoul, as to <hi>venture and give up our ſelves, our lives, and all our comforts and hopes into the hand of Chriſt,</hi> without any <hi>trouble</hi> or ſinful <hi>fears,</hi> and to paſs through all difficulties and tryals in the way, without any diſtruſt or anxiety of mind. Theſe be the characters of a ſtrong and great degree of faith.</p>
               <p>And you may note how <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. deſcribeth <hi>Faith</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by this venturing and forſaking all upon the belief of God. As in <hi>Noah</hi>'s caſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. And in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s leaving his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, <hi>v.</hi> 8. And in his ſacrificing <hi>Iſaac, v.</hi> 17.

And in the Iſraelites venturing into the Red Sea, <hi>v.</hi> 29. And in <hi>Rebab</hi>'s hiding the ſpies, which muſt needs be her danger in her own Countrey. And in all thoſe, who <hi>by faith ſubdued Kingdoms, wrought Righteouſneſs, obtained Promiſes, ſtopped the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword; out of weakneſs were made ſtrong —O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hers were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurrection; and others had tryal of cruel mockings and ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; yea moreover of bonds and impriſonments; they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword; they wandered about in Sheep skins, and Goat skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy: They wandered in Deſarts and Mountains, and in Deus, and Caves of the earth.</hi> And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32, 33, &amp;c. They <hi>endured a great fight of affliction; partly whilſt they were made a gazing flock,

both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly whilſt they became companions of them that were ſo uſed — And took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods; knowing in themſelves that they had in Heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance. And thus, the juſt do live by faith; but if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him,</hi> ſaith the Lord. See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 36, 37 &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>Spirits</hi> deſcriptions of faith; but if you will rather take a whimſical ignorant mans deſcription, who can only toſs in his mouth the name of <hi>FREE GRACE,</hi> and knoweth not of what he ſpeaketh, or what he affirmeth, or what that name ſignifieth, which he cheateth his own ſoul with, inſtead of true <hi>Free Grace</hi> it ſelf, you muſt ſuffer the bitter fruits of your own deluſion. For my part I ſhall ſay thus much more, to tell you why I ſay ſo much, to help you to a right underſtanding of the nature of true Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you underſtand not truly what <hi>Faith</hi> is, you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what <hi>Religion</hi> it is that you profeſs: And ſo you call your ſelves Chriſtians, and know not what it is.

               <p n="3">3. It will damnably delude your ſouls, about your own ſtate, and draw you to think that you have ſaving Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have that fancy which you thought was it.

And another came with a [<hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi>] Luke 18.18. as if he would have been one of Chriſts Diſciples, and have done any thing for Heaven. (And it's like that he would have been a Chriſtian, if <hi>Free Grace</hi> had been as large,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59417:149"/>
and as little grace, as ſome now imagine.) But when he heard [<hi>Yet lackeſt thou one thing: ſell all that thou haſt, and diſtribute to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven: Come, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me] he was then very ſorrowful, for he was very rich,</hi> Luke 18.21, 22, 23. Thouſands cheat their ſouls with a conceit that they are Believers, becauſe they believe that they ſhall be ſaved by <hi>Free Grace,</hi> without the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> which Chriſt hath made neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>

               <p>Direct. 29. <hi>Take not all doubts and fears of your ſalvation, to be the proper effects and ſigns of unbelief: Seeing that in many they ariſe from the miſunderſtanding of the meaning of Gods Promiſe, and in more, from the doubtfulneſs of their own quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, rather than from any unbelief of the Promiſe, or diſtruſt of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ordinary with ignorant Chriſtians to ſay, that they cannot <hi>believe,</hi> becauſe they doubt of their own ſincerity and ſalvation: as thinking that it is the nature of true faith, to believe that they themſelves are juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved; and that to doubt of this, is to doubt of the Promiſes, becauſe they doubtingly apply it. Such diſtreſſes have falſe principles bought many to. But there are two other things beſides the weakneſs of faith, which are uſually the cauſes of all this. 1. Many miſtake the <hi>meaning</hi> of Chriſts Covenant, and think that it hath no univerſality in it; and that he died <hi>only</hi> for the Elect, and promiſeth pardon to none but the <hi>Elect</hi> (no not on the condition of believing.) And therefore thinking
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59417:150"/>
that they can have no aſſurance that they are <hi>Elect,</hi> they doubt of the concluſion.</p>
               <p>And many of them think that the Promiſe extendeth not to ſuch as they, becauſe of <hi>ſome ſin,</hi> or great unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they are guilty of.</p>
               <p>And others think that they have not that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> which are the <hi>condition</hi> of the promiſe of pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: And in ſome of theſe the thing it ſelf may be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, as to be indeed the matter of rational doubtfulneſs. And in others of them, the cauſe may be either a miſtake about the true nature and ſigns of Faith and Repentance; or elſe a timerous melancholy cauſeleſs ſuſpition of themſelves But which of all theſe ſoever be the cauſe, it is ſomething different from proper <hi>unbelief</hi> or <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of God. For he that miſtaketh the extent of the Promiſe, and thinketh that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to ſuch as he, would <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> it, if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it, that it extends to him as well as others. And he that doubteth of his own <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> may yet be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the truth of Gods Promiſe to all true penitent Believers.</p>
               <p>I mention this for the cure of two miſchiefs: The firſt is that of the <hi>preſumptuous Opinioniſt,</hi> who goeth to Hell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that he hath true ſaving faith, becauſe he confidently believeth, that he himſelf is pardoned, and ſhall be ſaved. The ſecond is that of the perplexed fearful Chriſtian, who thinks that all his uncertainty of his own <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and ſo of his ſalvation, is properly <hi>unbelief,</hi> and ſo concludeth that he cannot believe, and ſhall not be ſaved. Becauſe he knoweth not that faith is <hi>ſuch a belief and truſt in Chriſt, as will bring us abſolutely and unreſervedly to venture our all upon him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet I muſt tell all theſe perſons, that all this while it is ten to one, but there is really a great deal of <hi>unbelief</hi> in them which they know not: and that their belief of the truth of the immortality of the ſoul, and the life to come, and of the Goſpel it ſelf, is not ſo ſtrong and firm, as their <hi>never-doubting</hi> of it would intimate, or as ſome of their definitions of Faith, and their Book-opinions and Diſputes import. And it had been well for ſome of them, that
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59417:150"/>
they had <hi>doubted more,</hi> that they might have <hi>believed,</hi> and been <hi>ſettled better.</hi>

Now he that hath wrought this for the ſelf ſame thing is God; who alſo hath given to us the earneſt of the Spirit. Therefore we are alwaies confident, knowing that whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord.

               </p>
               <p>Note here 1. That I do not ſay, that <hi>all belief</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> of Gods threatnings is <hi>ſaving Faith.</hi> But 2.

               <p>For 1. It is evident that the ſame Goſpel which ſaith, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved</hi>; doth ſay, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Therefore the ſame faith believeth both, 2. It is plain that the ſame formal object of faith, which is <hi>Gods Veracity,</hi> will bring a man to believe one as well as the other, if he equally know it to be a divine revelation: He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that <hi>All that God ſaith is true:</hi> and then believeth that God ſaith that <hi>All true Believers ſhall be ſaved</hi>; muſt needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>this Promiſe is true.</hi> And he that underſtandeth that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59417:167"/>
thoughteſt I was ſuch a one as thy ſelf, &amp;c.</hi> And partly becauſe <hi>Gods Goodneſs</hi> being known to be his very eſſence, and all men being apt to judge of Goodneſs, by the meaſure of their own intereſt, it is far more obvious and facil to mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to conclude that <hi>ſome are ſaved,</hi> than that <hi>ſome are damned</hi>; and that the <hi>penitent believers are ſaved,</hi> than that the <hi>impenitent unbelievers are damned:</hi> We hear daily how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily almoſt all men are brought to believe that <hi>God is merciful</hi>; and how hard it is to perſwade them of his <hi>damning Juſtice</hi> and <hi>ſeverity.</hi> Therefore he that can do the <hi>harder,</hi> is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to do the <hi>eaſier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed it is meer ignorance of the true nature of faith, which maketh thoſe whom I am now deſcribing, to think that they do not believe Gods <hi>Promiſes,</hi> when they believe his <hi>Threatnings.</hi> They think that becauſe they believe not that they themſelves are <hi>pardoned, juſtified,</hi> and ſhall be ſaved, that therefore they believe not the promiſe of God: But this is not the reaſon; but it is becauſe you find not the <hi>condition</hi> of the promiſe yet in your ſelves, and therefore think that you have no part in the benefits: But its one thing to doubt of your own <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and another thing to doubt whether the promiſe of God be true. Suppoſe that the Law do pardon a fellon if he can <hi>read as a Clerk</hi>; and one that is a fellon be in doubt whether his reading will ſerve or not; this is not to deny belief to the pardoning act of the Law. Suppoſe one promiſe a yearly ſtipend to all that are of full one and twenty years of age, in the Town or Country: To doubt of my age, is not to doubt of the truth of the promiſe.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But do not Proteſtant Divines conclude againſt the Papiſts, that ſaving Faith muſt be a particular application of Chriſt and the Promiſe to ourſelves, and not only a general aſſent?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very true; and the cloſer that application is the better.

A belief that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of pardon to all believers, is ſo <hi>univerſal,</hi> as that it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth you</hi> as well as <hi>others,</hi> and promiſeth and offereth <hi>you</hi> pardon, and life, if you will believe in Chriſt. 2. And it is a

                  <hi>conſent</hi> or <hi>willingneſs</hi> of heart that <hi>Christ be yours,</hi> and <hi>you be his,</hi> to the ends propoſed in the Goſpel. 3. And it is a <hi>practical Truſt</hi> in his ſufficiency, as <hi>chuſing</hi> him for the <hi>only Mediatour,</hi> reſolving to venture your ſouls, and all your hopes upon him: Though yet through your ignorance of your ſelves, you may think that you <hi>do not this thing</hi> in ſincerity, which indeed you do, yea and much fear (through melancholy or temptation) that you never <hi>ſhall</hi> do it, and conſequently never ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>He that doubteth of his own ſalvation, not becauſe he doubteth of the truth of the Goſpel; but becauſe he doubteth of the ſincerity of his own heart, may be miſtaken in himſelf, but is not therefore an unbeliever (as is ſaid before.)</p>

Do you turn away from all other waies of felicity, and chuſe this alone, to venture all your hopes upon, and reſolve to ſeek for none but this; and to venture all on God and Chriſt, though yet you are uncertain of your ſincerity and ſalvation? why this makes up true ſaving faith.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There are moſt vehement controverſies to this day, about the <hi>Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs</hi>; in which I know not well which of the extreams are in the greater errour, thoſe that plead for it in the miſtaken ſenſe, or thoſe that plead againſt it in the ſober and right ſenſe: But I make no doubt but they are both of them <hi>damnable,</hi> as plainly ſubverting the foundation of our faith: And yet I do not think that they will prove <hi>actually damning</hi> to the Authors, becauſe I believe that they miſunderſtand their adverſaries, and do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand themſelves, and that they <hi>digeſt not,</hi> and <hi>practiſe not</hi> what they plead for, but digeſt and practiſe that truth which they doctrinally ſubvert, not knowing the contrariety; which if they knew they would renounce the errour, and not the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59417:170"/>
truth. And I think that many a one that <hi>thus</hi> contradicteth <hi>fundamentals,</hi> may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Some there be (beſides the Antinomians) that hold that Chriſt did <hi>perfectly obey</hi> and <hi>ſatisfie</hi> (not in the <hi>natural,</hi> but) in the <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>legal perſon</hi> of each ſinner that is elect (repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and bearing as many diſtinct perſons as are elect) ſo fully as that God doth repute every <hi>Elect</hi> perſon (or ſay others, every <hi>Believer</hi>) to be one that in Law ſenſe, did <hi>perfectly obey and ſatisfie Juſtice</hi> himſelf; and ſo imputeth Chriſts Righteouſneſs and ſatisfaction to us, as that which was <hi>reputatively</hi> or <hi>legally</hi> of our <hi>own performance,</hi> and ſo is <hi>ours,</hi> not only in its <hi>effects,</hi> but in <hi>it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others ſeeing the pernicious conſequences of this opinion, deny <hi>all imputed Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt to us, and write many reproachful volumes againſt it (as you may ſee in <hi>Thorndikes</hi> laſt works and Dr. <hi>Gell,</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> againſt the Aſſembly, and abundance more.)</p>
               <p>The truth is, Chriſt <hi>merited</hi> and <hi>ſatisfied</hi> for us in the <hi>perſon</hi> of a <hi>Mediator:</hi> But this <hi>Mediator</hi> was the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Root</hi> of all <hi>Believers,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the fountain of ſpiritual life; and the <hi>Surety</hi> of the New Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22, 45. and did all this in the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> and for the ſake and benefit of man; ſuffering, that we might not ſuffer dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but not obeying that we might not obey; but ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obeying that our ſinful imperfection of obedience might not be our ruine, and our perfect obedience might not be neceſſary to our own Juſtification or Salvation, but that God might for the ſake and merit of this his <hi>perfect obedience</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> forgive all our ſins, and adopt us for his Sons, and give us his holy Spirit, and glorifie us for ever; ſo that Chriſts Righteouſneſs, both <hi>obediential</hi> and <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> is ours in the <hi>effects</hi> of it in themſelves, and ours <hi>relatively for thoſe effects,</hi> ſo far as to be purpoſely given for us to that end; but not <hi>ours in it ſelf ſimply,</hi> or as if we were reputed the legal performers our ſelves, or might be ſaid in Law ſenſe, or by divine eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or imputation, to have our ſelves in and by Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law, and ſuffered for our not fulfilling it (which is a contradiction.)</p>
               <p>As he that both by a price, and by ſome meritorious act,

               <p>And becauſe Chriſt ſuffered what we ſhould have ſuffered (as to the <hi>value</hi>) to ſave us from ſuffering, and our ſins were the cauſe of our guilt of puniſhment, and ſo the remote cauſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt (his own ſponſion being the nearer cauſe) therefore it may be ſaid truly that Chriſt did not only ſuffer for our <hi>benefit,</hi> but in our <hi>ſtead</hi> or <hi>place</hi>; and in a larger and leſs ſtrict and proper ſenſe, that he <hi>ſuffered</hi> in the perſon of a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and as one to whom <hi>our ſins were imputed</hi>; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more but that he ſuffered as one that by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent undertook to ſuffer for the perſons of ſinners, and that as ſuch an <hi>undertaker</hi> only he ſuffered; and that thus our ſins were imputed to him (not <hi>in themſelves,</hi> as if he were in Law ſenſe the <hi>committer</hi> of them, or <hi>polluted</hi> by them, or by God <hi>eſteemed</hi> ſo to have been, but) as to the <hi>effects,</hi> that is, <hi>his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>; in that they were the <hi>occaſion,</hi> and the remote or <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed cauſe</hi> of his ſufferings; as his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is imputed to us, as the meritorious cauſe of our Pardon and Juſtification.</p>
               <p>But he could not be ſaid no not in ſo large a ſenſe as this, to have <hi>obeyed</hi> in our ſtead (conſidering it as <hi>obedience</hi> or <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but only <hi>as merit</hi>) becauſe he did it not that we might not obey, but that we might not <hi>ſuffer</hi> for <hi>diſobeying.</hi>

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59417:172"/>
of whom many were greater ſinners than you; and no one of them (ſave Chriſt) came thither by the way of innocency and legal Juſtification: There are no Saints in Heaven that were not redeemed from the captivity of the Devil, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the way of pardoning grace, and were not once the heirs of death, <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, &amp; 4.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe conſiderations truſt your ſelves confidently on the grace of Chriſt, and take all your ſins but as the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of his grace.</p>
               <p>Direct. 9. <hi>Remember that there is ſomewhat on your own parts to be done, for the continuing, as well as for the beginning of your Juſtification; yea ſomewhat more than for the beginning; even the faithful keeping of your baptiſmal Covenant, in the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of it; and alſo that you have continual need of Chriſt, to continue your Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many take <hi>Juſtification</hi> to be one <hi>inſtantanious</hi> act of God, which is never afterwards to be done: And ſo it is, if we mean only the firſt <hi>making of him righteous who was unrighteous:</hi> (As the firſt making of the world, and not the continuance of it, is called <hi>Creation:</hi>) but this is but about the <hi>name:</hi> For the <hi>thing it ſelf,</hi> no doubt but that <hi>Covenant</hi> which firſt juſtified us, doth <hi>continue</hi> to <hi>juſtifie</hi> us; and if the <hi>cauſe</hi> ſhould ceaſe, the <hi>effect</hi> would ceaſe. And he that requireth no <hi>actual obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> as the condition of our <hi>begun</hi> Juſtification, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire both the <hi>continuance of faith,</hi> and <hi>actual ſincere obedience,</hi> as the condition of <hi>continuing,</hi> or <hi>not loſing</hi> our Juſtification, (as <hi>Davenant, Bergius, Blank, &amp;c.</hi> have well opened, and I have elſewhere proved at large.) As <hi>Matrimony</hi> giveth title to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal priviledges to the wife; but <hi>conjugal fidelity</hi> and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the eſſentials of the contract is neceſſary to <hi>continue</hi> them. Therefore labour to keep up your faith, and to <hi>abide</hi> in Chriſt, and he in you, and to bring forth fruit, leſt ye be branches withered, and for the fire, <hi>John</hi> 15.2, 3, 7, 8, 9, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And upon the former miſapprehenſion, the ſame perſons do look upon all the faith which they exerciſe through their lives, after the firſt inſtantanious act, as no juſtifying faith at all (but only a faith of the ſame kind) but to what uſe they hardly know.

had no more uſe for him, either as to <hi>continue</hi> their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to forgive their after-ſins; when as our continued faith muſt be exerciſed all our lives on the ſame Chriſt, and truſt on the ſame Covenant, for the continuation and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that which was begun at the time of our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6.12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11, 12. &amp; 10.22, 23.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand that every ſin which you commit, hath need of a renewed pardon in Chriſt: and that he doth me prevent your neceſſity of ſuch pardon. And therefore you will have conſtant need of Chriſt, and muſt daily come to God for pardon by him; not only for the pardon of temporal chaſtiſements, but of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the ſenſe of this, I ſhall ſay more anon: the proof of it is in the fore recited <hi>Promiſes</hi>; and in all thoſe texts of Scripture which tell us that death is the wages of ſin, and call us to ask pardon, and tell us on what terms it may be had.</p>
               <p>Direct. 11. <hi>Yet do not think that every ſin doth put you into a ſtate of condemnation again, or nullifie your former Juſtification: For though the Law of nature is ſo far ſtill in force, as to make puniſhment by it your natural due; yet the Covenant of Grace is a continually pardoning act, and according to its proper terms, doth diſſolve the foreſaid obligation, and preſently remit the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and as its moral action is not interrupted; no more is our juſtified ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 8.1. John 3.16, 18. 1 John 5.11, 12. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and he is the Propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 John 2.1, 2. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, be is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſisn and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> If all need of pardon had been prevented by Chriſt, what uſe were there of his advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our future forgiveneſs?</p>
               <p>Direct. 12. <hi>Remember, that though unknown infirmities, and unavoidable ones, have an immediate pardon, becauſe the Believer hath an habitual Faith and Repentance; yet great and known ſins muſt have actual Repentance, before the pardon will be ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or perfect; though the perſon is not in the mean time an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate nor unjuſtified perſon.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:59417:173"/>1. That great and known ſins muſt have a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, appeareth, 1. In that it is utterly inconſiſtent with the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of <hi>habitual Repentance,</hi> not to be <hi>actual,</hi> when ſins are <hi>known,</hi> and come into our deliberate remembrance. 2. By all thoſe texts which require ſuch repentance, confeſſion and forſaking, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. &amp; 51. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Rev,</hi> 2.5, 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3, 5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.37. &amp; 11.4. Repentance conſiſteth chiefly in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking ſin; and if men <hi>forſake</hi> not ſuch known wilful ſins, they are wicked men, and therefore are not pardoned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That unavoidable frailties, and meer infirmities, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known faults, are pardoned immediately to them that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly godly, and have a general and implicit Repentance, is plain, becauſe elſe no man in the world could be ſaved; becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath ſuch infirmities and unknown ſins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet <hi>David</hi> himſelf is not put by his ſin into a meer graceleſs ſtate, and as a perſon that hath no former Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he prayeth God not to take his Spirit from him, and he was not deprived of the true love to God, which is the character of Gods children: But he had incurred heinous guilt, and put himſelf in the <hi>way towards</hi> utter damnation, and cauſed a neceſſity of a <hi>more particular deep Repentance</hi> before he could be <hi>fully pardoned,</hi> than elſe he needed.</p>
               <p>Before the world had a Saviour, we were all ſo far unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, that a <hi>ſatisfying Sacrifice</hi> was neceſſary to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But afterward, all men are ſo far pardoned, that only the <hi>Acceptance</hi> of what is purchaſed and freely (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally) given, is neceſſary to it. Before men are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> they are yet ſo far unpardoned, that (though <hi>no more Sacrifice</hi> be neceſſary, yet) a <hi>total converſion and renovation, by turning from a life of ſin to God by Faith in Chriſt,</hi> is neceſſary to their actual juſtification, and forgiveneſs. When a man is turned from a life of ſin to God, and liveth in the ſtate of grace, all his following ſins, which conſiſt with the loving of God and holineſs above the world and ſinful pleaſures, are ſo far forgiven immediately upon the committing, that they need neither <hi>another Sacrifice,</hi> nor another <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or <hi>Juſtification (quoad ſtatum)</hi> but only an acting of that <hi>Faith</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:59417:174"/>
and <hi>Repentance,</hi> which habitually he hath already. But the unknown errours and faults of ſuch godly perſons are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned even without that <hi>actual repentance:</hi> and infirmities, without forſaking of the ſin overcomingly in practice. And ſo every one liveth and dyeth, in ſome degree of ſinful defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs and omiſſion, of his love to God, and truſt, and hope, and zeal, and deſire, and love to men, and care of his duty, and watchfulneſs, and fervency in prayer, meditation, &amp;c. And in ſome degree of ſinful diſorder in our ill governed thoughts, and words, and affections, or paſſions, and actions: we are never ſinleſs till we die.</p>
               <p>Direct. 13. <hi>Remember that you muſt neither think that every ſin which is a cauſe of Repentance, is a ſufficient reaſon for you to doubt of your preſent ſtate of Juſtification; nor yet that no ſin can be ſo great as to be a neceſſary cauſe of doubting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>every</hi> ſin ſhould make us doubt of our Juſtification, then all men muſt alwaies doubt: And then it muſt be becauſe no ſin is conſiſtent with <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and the <hi>knowledge</hi> of ſincerity; which is apparently falſe.</p>
               <p>If no ſin ſhould cauſe our doubting, then there is no ſin which is not conſiſtent both with <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and with the <hi>knowledge</hi> of it; which is as falſe, and much more dangerous to hold. 1. There are many ſins that are utterly inconſiſtent with true godlineſs; otherwiſe the godly were ungodly, and as bad as others: And if you ſay that no godly man commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe, it is true; and therefore it is true that he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them, is not a godly man, or juſtified. And how ſhall a man know his godlineſs, but by his life as the product of his inward graces? It is arguing from an uncertainty againſt a certainty, to ſay, I am juſtified and godly, and therefore my wilful ſins of drunkenneſs, fornication, oppreſſion, lying, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:59417:174"/>
1 Cor. 6 9, 10. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.

               <p n="2">2. And there are many ſins which conſiſt with true grace, which will not conſiſt with the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of its ſincerity. And that 1. From the nature of the things; becauſe the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grace conjunct with, and clouded by the <hi>greateſt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſin which may conſiſt with it, is not diſcernable to to him that hath it: He that is ſo <hi>very near</hi> a ſtate of death, and ſo very <hi>like</hi> to an unjuſtified perſon, can never be ſure, in that caſe, that he is juſtified. 2. And alſo God in Wiſdom and Juſtice will have it ſo; that ſin may not be encouraged, nor preſumption cheriſhed, nor the comforts which are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of an obedient child, be caſt away on an uncapable child in his ſtubborn diſobedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. &amp; 32. &amp; 77.</p>
               <p>Therefore for a man that liveth in groſt ſin, to ſay that he is ſure that he is juſtified, and therefore no ſin ſhall make him queſtion it; is but to believe the Antinomian Devil transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf into an Angel of Light, and his Miniſters when they call themſelves the <hi>Miniſters of Righteouſneſs</hi>; and to deny be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the Spirit of Holineſs and Truth.

And we are now ſo fortified againſt the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Secinian</hi> extreams, and thoſe whom I am <hi>now</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting to <hi>live by Faith,</hi> are ſo ſettled againſt them, that I think it more neceſſary (having not leiſure for both, and having done it heretofore in my <hi>Confeſſion</hi>) to open at this time the method of falſe doctrine on the other extream, which for the moſt part is it which conſtituteth Antinomianiſm, though ſome of them are maintained by others.</p>
               <p>And I will firſt name each errour; and then with it, the contrary truth.</p>
               <p>Errour 1. <hi>Chriſts ſuffering was cauſed by the ſins of none, as the aſſumed meritorious cauſe, or as they uſually ſay, as imputed to him, or lying on him, ſave only of the Elect that ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. <hi>The ſins of fallen mankind in general, except thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of Grace, whoſe pardon is not offered in the conditional Covenant, did lye on Chriſt as the aſſumed cauſe of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See <hi>John</hi> 1.29. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.

               <p>Errour 2. <hi>Chriſt did both perfectly obey, and alſo make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for ſin by ſuffering, in the perſon of all the Elect in the ſenſe of the Law, or Gods account; ſo that his Righteouſneſs of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59417:176"/>
and perfect holineſs, and his ſatisfaction, is ſo imputed to us, as the proprietaries, as if we our ſelves had done it, and ſuffered it: not by an after donation in the effects, but by this ſtrict im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. <hi>The contrary Truth</hi> is at large opened <hi>before,</hi> and in <hi>my confeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſts ſatisfaction, and the merit of his whole obedience, is as effectual for our pardon, juſtification and ſalvation, as if Believers th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mſelves had performed it; and it is imputed to them, in that it was done for their ſakes, and ſuffered in their ſtead, and the fruits of it by a free Covenant or donation given them. But 1. God is not miſtaken, to judge that we obeyed or ſuffered when we did not. 2. God is no lyar, to <hi>ſay,</hi> we did it, when he knoweth that we did it not. 3. If we were <hi>not the actors</hi> and <hi>ſufferers,</hi> it is not <hi>poſſible</hi> that we ſhould be made the <hi>natural ſubjects</hi> of the <hi>Accidents</hi> of anothers body, by any putation, eſtimation or miſ-judging whatſoever; no nor by any <hi>donation</hi> neither. It is a contradiction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an impoſſibility that the ſame individual <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> of which Chriſts humane nature was the agent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo many hundred years ago, and have themſelves now no exiſtence, ſhould <hi>in themſelves,</hi> I ſay, <hi>in themſelves,</hi> be made yours now, and you be the ſubject of the ſame accidents. 4. Therefore they can no otherwiſe be given to us, but 1. By a <hi>true eſtimation</hi> of the <hi>reaſons</hi> why Chriſt underwent them, <hi>viz.</hi> for our ſakes as aforeſaid. 2. And by a <hi>donation</hi> of the <hi>effects</hi> or <hi>fruits</hi> of them, <hi>viz. pardoning,</hi> and <hi>juſtifying,</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> us by them (on the terms choſen by the Donor himſelf, and put into his Teſtament or Covenant) as certainly (but not in the ſame manner) as if we had done and ſuffered them our ſelves. 5. If Chriſt had ſuffered in <hi>our perſon</hi> reputatively in all reſpects, his ſufferings would not have redeemed us: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are finite worms, and our ſuffering for ſo ſhort a time, would not have been accepted inſtead of Hell ſufferings. But the perſon of the Mediator made them valuable. 6. God never made any ſuch Covenant with us [that he will juſtifie us, and uſe us juſt as he would have done, if we had our ſelves perfectly obeyed and ſatisfied.] They that take on them to ſhew ſuch a Promiſe, muſt ſee that no wiſe man examine it.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59417:176"/>
7. God hath both by his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and his <hi>Works,</hi> ever ſince <hi>confuted</hi> that opinion; and hath not <hi>dealt with us</hi> as he would have done, if we had been the reputed <hi>doers</hi> and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers</hi> of it all our ſelves. For he hath made <hi>conveyance</hi> of the <hi>Benefits,</hi> by a pardoning and juſtifying Law, or <hi>Promiſe</hi>; and he giveth us additional pardon of renewed ſins as we act them, and he addeth <hi>threatnings</hi> in his Law or Covenant; and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth <hi>penalties</hi>; yea ſome that are very grievous, even the with-holding of much of his Spirits help and grace; all which are inconſiſtent with that conceit; nor would he ſo have uſed us, if we had been perfectly innocent, and had fully ſatisfied for our ſins our ſelves. 8. All men would have had <hi>preſent poſſeſſion of Glory,</hi> if God had ſo reputed us the <hi>perfect meriters</hi> of it. For his Juſtice would no more have <hi>delayed</hi> our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than <hi>denyed</hi> it. 9. All that are ſaved would have <hi>equal degrees</hi> of <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>happineſs,</hi> as well as of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all would equally be reputed the perfect fulfillers of the Law. And as no penalty could ever be juſtly inflicted on them here; ſo no degree of glory could be denyed them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after for their ſin, or for want of perfect righteouſneſs. 10. The opinion of this kind of imputation, is a moſt evident contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in it ſelf. For he that is imputatively a <hi>ſatisfier for all his own ſin,</hi> is therein ſuppoſed to be a ſinner: And he that is imputatively a <hi>perfect innocent fulfiller of the Law,</hi> is thereby ſuppoſed to need no ſatisfaction to Juſtice for his ſin, as being imputatively no ſinner. 11. By this all Chriſts ſacrifice and ſatisfaction is made a work of needleſs ſupererrogation; yea unjuſt, or rather impoſſible. For if we perfectly obeyed in him, he could not ſuffer for our diſobedience. 12. Hereby pardon of ſin is utterly denyed: for he that is reputatively no ſinner, hath no ſin to pardon.</p>
               <p>If they ſay that God did firſt impute the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for ſin, then there was no room after for the imputation of perfect obedience. We cannot feign God to receive all the debt, or inflict all the penalty, and then to ſay, now I will eſteem thee one that never didſt deſerve it.</p>
               <p>If they ſay that he doth neither impute the <hi>obedience</hi> or the <hi>ſuffering</hi> to us ſimply, and to all effects, but <hi>in tantum ad hoc,</hi> or <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> only: ſo that we ſhall be pardoned for his
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59417:177"/>
ſuffering, and then judged worthy of Heaven for his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: this is but to come up towards the truth before you are aware, and to confeſs that neither of them is given us <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> but in the <hi>effects,</hi> as being it ſelf paid to God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thoſe effects.</p>
               <p>But withall, the matter muſt be vindicated from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found inventions, and it muſt be ſaid, that Chriſt dyed not only for our ſins of commiſſion, but of omiſſion alſo; and that he that is pardoned both his ſins of commiſſion and omiſſion, is free from the puniſhment both of ſenſe and loſs; yea and is reputed as one that never culpably omitted any duty; and conſequently fell ſhort of no reward by ſuch omiſſion: ſo that there remaineth no more neceſſity of Righteouſneſs in order to a reward where the pardon is perfect, ſave only (<hi>N. B.</hi>) to procure us that degree of reward which muſt be ſuperadded to what we forfeited by our ſin; and which we never by any culpable omiſſion deſerved to be denyed. And thus much we do not deny that ſomewhat (even Adoption) which is more than meer Pardon and Juſtification muſt confer on us. But withall, as we hold not that the Sun muſt bring light, and ſomewhat elſe muſt firſt baniſh darkneſs; that one thing muſt cure death, and another cauſe life; that ſatisfaction muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the pardon of ſins of omiſſion and commiſſion, as to the <hi>poenae damni &amp; ſenſus,</hi> and make us eſteemed and uſed as <hi>no ſinners,</hi> and then imputed obedience muſt give us right to that reward, which the <hi>poenae damni,</hi> deprived us of; ſo <hi>(N. B.)</hi> we maintain that <hi>Chriſts ſufferings</hi> have merited our eternal ſalvation, and our Juſtification and Adoption; and that his <hi>obedience</hi> hath merited our forgiveneſs of ſin: And that both go together, the merit of the one and of the other, to procure all that we receive, and that the effects are not parcelled out as they have deviſed: Though yet we believe that Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were paid to God, as for our ſins, to ſatisfie Juſtice, and that in the <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> it is firſt <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> and then and therefore <hi>meritorious,</hi> and in the active it is meerly <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. And the maintainers of the contrary opinion, beſides all the forementioned evils, could never agree how much of Chriſts Righteouſneſs muſt be in their ſenſe imputed: ſome
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59417:177"/>
holding only the paſſive; a ſecond ſort the active and paſſive; a third ſort, the habitual, active and paſſive; a fourth ſort, the divine, the habitual, the active and the paſſive.</p>
               <p>But of all theſe things there is ſo much written againſt them, by <hi>Cargius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus, Olevian, Piſcator, Paraeus, Scultetus, Alſtedius, Wendeline, Camero, Bradſhaw, Gataker,</hi> and many more, that I need not to add any more for confutation.</p>
               <p>Errour 3. <hi>That no one ſhall ſuffer whoſe ſins lay on Chriſt, and were ſuffered for by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. <hi>Many ſuch ſhall ſuffer the ſorer puniſhment, for ſinning againſt the Lord that bought them, and treading under foot the blood of the Covenant, wherewith they were ſo far ſanctified, as to be a people by their own Covenant ſeparated to God,</hi> Heb. 10.25, 26. Heb. 6.4, 5, 6. 2 Pet. 2.2. Heb. 4.1. &amp; 2.3. &amp; 12.29.</p>
               <p>Errour 4. <hi>That no godly man</hi> (ſay ſome (<hi>or Elect perſon, though ungodly</hi> (ſay others) <hi>is ever puniſhed by God, becauſe Chriſt ſuffered all their puniſhment himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. <hi>Every godly man is chaſtened of God, and all chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a fatherly correcting puniſhment: And many juſtified perſons are puniſhed to their final loſs, by the denyal of forfeited degrees of grace, and conſequently of glory,</hi> Heb. 12.7, 8, 9, 10. 1 Cor. 11.32. 1 Theſ. 5.19. Epheſ. 4.30. But ſad experience is too full a proof. See my <hi>Confeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Errour 5. <hi>That God were unjuſt if he laid any degree of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on thoſe that Chriſt died for; or</hi> (ſay others) <hi>on the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; becauſe he ſhould puniſh one ſin twice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. <hi>It is certain, that God puniſheth the Juſtified in ſome degree (much more the Elect before converſion) and it is certain that God is not unjuſt.</hi> Therefore it is certain that the ground of this accuſation is falſe; for it was not <hi>our deſerved puniſhment</hi> it ſelf, or the <hi>ſame which was due in the true ſenſe of the Law</hi> which Chriſt endured: but it was the puniſhment of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſponſor, which was the <hi>equivalens,</hi> and not the <hi>idem</hi> that was due; and did anſwer the <hi>ends</hi> of the Law, but not <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>meaning</hi> of the threatning; which threatned the <hi>ſinner</hi> himſelf, and not another for him: ſeeing then it was a <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> or <hi>ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> which God received for an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and propitiation, and not a <hi>ſolution</hi> or ſuffering of the ſinner himſelf in the ſenſe of the Law, the charge of injuſtice on God is groundleſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:59417:178"/>And no man can have more right to Chriſts ſufferings or benefits, than he himſelf is willing to give: And it is not his <hi>own will</hi> (into whoſe hands all power and judgement is committed) that we ſhould be ſubject to no puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſuffered for us.</p>
               <p>Errour 6. <hi>That the Elect are juſtified from eternity</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>or from Chriſts death before they were born</hi> (ſay others) <hi>or before they believed</hi> (ſay others.)</p>
               <p>Againſt this I have ſaid enough in many Volumes hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Errour 7. <hi>That Faith juſtifieth only in the Court of our own Conſciences, by making us to know that we were juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this alſo I have ſaid enough elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Errour 8. <hi>That ſins to come, not yet committed, are pardoned in our firſt Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. <hi>Sins to come are no ſins: and no ſins have no actual pardon: but only the certain remedy is provided, which will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their ſins as ſoon as they are capable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Errour 9. <hi>Juſtification is not a making us juſt, but a ſentence pronouncing us juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. <hi>Juſtification is a word of ſo many ſignifications, that he that doth not firſt tell what he meaneth by it, will not be capable of giving or receiving ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here once for all, I muſt intreat the Reader that loveth not confuſion and errour, to diſtinguiſh of theſe ſeveral ſorts of Juſtification, as the chief which we are to note.</p>
               <p>Juſtification is either <hi>publick</hi> by a Governour, or <hi>private</hi> by an equal or meer <hi>Diſcerner</hi>: Juſtification is by <hi>God,</hi> or by <hi>Man.</hi> Juſtification by God is either as he is <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and above <hi>Laws,</hi> or as he is <hi>Judge</hi> according to his Laws: In the firſt way <hi>God maketh us juſt; by his</hi> Act of Oblivion, or pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law, or Covenant of Grace. In the ſecond reſpect God doth two waies juſtifie and forgive: 1. As a determining Judge: 2. As the Executioner of his Judgement. In the former reſpect God doth two waies juſtifie us: 1. By <hi>eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us juſt.</hi> 2. By <hi>publick ſentencing us juſt.</hi> As <hi>Executioner,</hi> he <hi>uſeth</hi> us as <hi>juſt,</hi> and as ſo judged.</p>
               <p>I paſs by here purpoſely all Chriſts Juſtification of us by way
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59417:178"/>
of apology or plea; and all Juſtification by witneſſes and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, &amp;c. and all the <hi>conſtitutive cauſes</hi> of our Righteouſneſs, leſt I hinder them whom I would help, by uſing more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions than they are willing to learn. But theſe few are neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is one thing for God to <hi>make us</hi> Righteous, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving all our ſins of commiſſion and omiſſion, for the ſake of Chriſts ſatisfaction and obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is another thing for God to <hi>eſteem</hi> us to be ſo Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous when he hath firſt made us ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is another for God to <hi>ſentence</hi> us Righteous as the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Judge, by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it is another thing for God to take off all penalties and evils, and to give us all the good which belong to the Righteous; and ſo to execute his own Laws and Sentence. And he that will not diſtinguiſh of theſe ſenſes or ſorts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, ſhall not diſpute with me.</p>
               <p>And while I am upon this, I will give the Reader theſe two remarks and counſels. 1. That he will not in diſputing about Juſtification, with any ſect, begin the diſpute of the <hi>Thing,</hi> till he hath firſt determined and agreed of their ſenſe of the <hi>Word.</hi> And that he will not confound the Controverſies <hi>de nomine</hi> about the <hi>word,</hi> with thoſe <hi>de re,</hi> about the <hi>matter.</hi> And that he will remember in citing texts of Scripture, that <hi>Beza,</hi> and many of our beſt Expoſitors, do grant to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts (as I heard Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> alſo do) that ſome texts of Scripture do take the word [<hi>Juſtifie</hi>] as they do, for <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> conjunctly: As <hi>Titus</hi> 3.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. three famous texts; of which ſee <hi>Le Blank</hi> at large in his <hi>Theſ. de nom. Juſtific.</hi> If the controverſie be only of the ſenſe of a Text, handle it accordingly: If of the matter, turn it not to words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Note this Obſervation, that <hi>Sanctification it ſelf,</hi> or the <hi>giving</hi> us the Spirit, is a great act (though I ſay not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) of executive Juſtification. The with-holding of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the greateſt puniſhment inflicted in this life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>giving of the Spirit</hi> is the removal or executive remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the greateſt penalty: So that if pardon were only as Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> thought, a <hi>non-punire,</hi> a not puniſhing, then this were the moſt proper, as well as plenary pardon in this life. But
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59417:179"/>
the truth is, that our <hi>Pardon</hi> and Juſtification in <hi>Right</hi> goeth firſt, which God effecteth by his Covenant-gift: And then God <hi>eſteemeth</hi> us <hi>juſt</hi> or pardoned, when by pardon he hath made us juſt: and if there be any <hi>ſentence,</hi> or any thing equivalent before the day of Judgement or death, he next <hi>ſentenceth</hi> us Juſt; and laſtly, he <hi>uſeth</hi> us as <hi>juſt,</hi> that is, as <hi>pardoned</hi> (all ſins of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and commiſſion) which is by taking off all puniſhment both of <hi>pain</hi> (or <hi>ſenſe</hi>) and <hi>loſs</hi>; of which part the giving of his Spirit, is the <hi>chief</hi> act on this ſide our Glorification.</p>
               <p>Note therefore that thus far no Proteſtant can deny to the Papiſts, nor will do, that Sanctification and Juſtification are all one, that is, that God having pardoned us <hi>de jure,</hi> doth pardon us executively, by giving us his forfeited Spirit and Grace; and by all the communion which we have after with him, and the comfort which we have from him.</p>
               <p>And further let it be well noted, that the nature of this <hi>executive Pardon</hi> or <hi>Juſtification</hi> (of which read Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> at large) is far better known to us, than the nature of Gods <hi>ſentential Pardon</hi> and Juſtification: and therefore there is leſs controverſie about it. For what it is to <hi>forbear or take off a puniſhment,</hi> is eaſily underſtood: But though moſt Proteſtants ſay, that <hi>Juſtification</hi> is a <hi>ſentence of God,</hi> they are not agreed what that ſentence is. Some think (truly) that our firſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith is but a <hi>virtual ſentence</hi> of the Law of Grace, by which we muſt be judged. Others ſay that by a <hi>ſentence</hi> is meant Gods <hi>ſecret mental eſtimation:</hi> Others ſay, that as <hi>Angels</hi> are his executioners; ſo it is <hi>before them</hi> (where joy is ſaid to be for a ſinners converſion) <hi>Luke</hi> 15. that doth <hi>declare</hi> and <hi>ſentence</hi> us pardoned and juſt. Others think that there is no <hi>ſentence</hi> but Gods notification of pardon to our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi> or giving us the ſenſe or knowledge of it. Others think that there is no <hi>ſentence</hi> till <hi>death,</hi> or <hi>publick Judgment.</hi> Others ſay that <hi>God doth ſentence</hi> us juſt, though we know not <hi>where,</hi> nor <hi>how.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Lawſon</hi> noteth, that (as all confeſs that God hath no <hi>voice,</hi> but a <hi>created voice</hi>; and therefore uſeth not <hi>words</hi> as we; unleſs what Chriſt as man may do in that we know not; ſo) his <hi>ſentence</hi> is nothing but his <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> that he <hi>eſteemeth us pardoned and juſt</hi> in title, which is principally, if not only, by his <hi>execution,</hi> and taking off all
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59417:179"/>
penalties of ſenſe and loſs, and uſing us as pardoned in title: and ſo that the <hi>giving of his Spirit,</hi> is his <hi>very ſentence</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> in this life, as it is his <hi>declaration</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs executive pardon is the moſt perfect and compleat, as being the <hi>end</hi> and perfection of all the reſt.

And it is granted that God doth uſually give ſome notice of his pardon, at one time or other, more or leſs to a ſinners conſcience (though that is too late, too uncertain, too low, and too unequal, and too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant to be the great and famous <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Faith.</hi>) 5. And it is clear, that till death or Judgment, there is no ſuch ſolemn plenary <hi>judicial ſentence</hi> or declaration as there will be then. 6. And it is certain, that at death and judgment, Chriſt as <hi>Man,</hi> a creature, can <hi>ſpeak</hi> or expreſs himſelf, as the bleſſed creatures do to one another. 7 And its certain that God hath a way of expreſſing himſelf to creatures, which is beyond our preſent underſtandings: But we may conceive of it by the ſimilitude of <hi>Light,</hi> which in the ſame inſtant reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth millions of things to millions of perſons reſpectively.

(Though that is nothing to his <hi>preſent Juſtification</hi> of us by Faith, unleſs as he revealeth it to Angels.) 8. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that at the day of death and judgment, God will thus by an irreſiſtible light, lay open every man to himſelf, and to the world, which may be called his <hi>ſentence,</hi> differing from the execution; and that Chriſt in our nature will be our Judge, and may expreſs that ſentence as aforeſaid. 9. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Gods <hi>actual taking off puniſhment,</hi> and giving the bleſſing which ſin had deprived us of, is a <hi>declaration</hi> of his <hi>mind,</hi> which may be called, an <hi>executive ſentence,</hi> and might ſerve the turn if there were no more: And that in Scripture, the terms of [<hi>Gods judging the world</hi>] doth uſually ſignifie Gods <hi>executive Government,</hi> rewarding and <hi>puniſhing:</hi> And that God doth <hi>begin</hi> ſuch execution in this life: and that his giving the Spirit is thus his principal pardoning and juſtifying act; and yet that this is but part, and not the whole of our <hi>preſent</hi> executive pardon: and that glorification in this ſenſe is the higheſt and nobleſt Juſtification or Pardon; when God giveth us <hi>all</hi> that ſin had forfeited (But yet we deny not that Glorification is ſomewhat more than an executive pardon, ſo far as any <hi>more</hi> is then given us, than we did forfeit by our ſins.)</p>
               <p>I muſt deſire the Reader not to forget all this explication of the nature of Juſtification, becauſe it will be ſuppoſed to the underſtanding of all before and after.</p>
               <p>Errour 10. <hi>That the juſtified or regenerate never incur any guilt or obligation to any puniſhment, but only temporal corrections; and therefore need no pardon at all of any ſin, at leaſt, ſince rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as to the everlaſting puniſhment; becauſe Chriſt dyed to prevent that guilt, and conſequently the neceſſity of any ſuch pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. This is before explained. Chriſt died to procure us that pardoning Covenant, which (on its own terms) will pardon every ſin of the Juſtified when they are committed; but not to prevent the <hi>need</hi> of pardon. Otherwiſe Chriſt ſhould not <hi>ſatisfie</hi> for any ſins after regeneration, nor bear them in his ſufferings at all: For his ſatisfaction is a bearing of a puniſhment, which in its <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> is equivalent to our deſerved, or (<hi>to be deſerved</hi>) puniſhment. Now if we
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59417:180"/>
never do <hi>deſerve</hi> it, Chriſt cannot bear that in our ſtead, which we never deſerve: As the <hi>preventing</hi> of the <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>reatus culpae</hi> proveth that Chriſt never ſuffered for that ſin prevented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>terminus diminuens,</hi> and is no ſin; ſo is it in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the deſert of puniſhment. And as for <hi>Correction</hi> Chriſt doth inflict ſo much as is good for us; and therefore did not die to prevent it. But of this Controverſie I have ſaid more at large elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Errour 11. <hi>That Juſtification by Faith is perfect at the firſt inſtant; though Sanctification be imperfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. Againſt this Errour read Mr. <hi>George Hopkins</hi> book of <hi>ſalvation from ſin</hi>; ſhewing how <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> are equally carryed on.</p>
               <p>It is granted that at our firſt true faith, we are <hi>pardoned</hi> all the <hi>ſins</hi> that ever we committed before, as to the eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: And ſo we are converted from them all: But (as our Sanctification is imperfect, ſo) our Pardon is yet imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in <hi>many reſpects</hi>: For 1. We are ſtill liable to <hi>death,</hi> which is the wages of ſin, though it be ſo far conquered as not to hinder our ſalvation: <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> went to Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 12, 14, 17, 21. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16, 17, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 26. 2. We are ſtill liable to many penal chaſtiſements in this life; which though they do us good by accident, are yet the fruits of ſin, no father chaſtiſing a faultleſs child, but doing him good in another way. 3. There are many ſins yet left uncured, which though <hi>as ſins,</hi> they are our <hi>own only,</hi> yet as <hi>an evil not cured,</hi> are alſo penal: I am ſure that the <hi>not-giving</hi> of more of his Spirit and Grace is penal. Therefore till our grace be perfect, we are not perfectly delivered from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fruits of ſin, and therefore not perfectly juſtified and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. 4. That Pardon and Juſtification is not <hi>perfect,</hi> which hath ſo many conditions, and of ſuch a nature for its <hi>continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as ours now hath: As to ſay, you ſhall loſe your juſtified ſtate, unleſs you fight and overcome, in mortification, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, perſeverance. &amp;c.

               <p>Contr. To be juſtified by the Law of works, when we have once broken it, is a contradiction, and a <hi>natural</hi> impoſſibility; as it is to be at once a ſinner, and no ſinner.

               </p>
               <p>Of this I have written at large heretofore. An inſtrument properly ſo called, is an <hi>efficient cauſe:</hi> Faith is no efficient cauſe of our Juſtification; neither Gods inſtrument, nor ours: for we juſtifie not our ſelves inſtrumentally: The known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted inſtrument of our Juſtification, is Gods <hi>Covenant or deed of gift</hi>; which is his pardoning act: They that ſay it is not a <hi>Phyſical</hi> but a <hi>Moral</hi> inſtrument, either mean that its <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally called</hi> an <hi>inſtrument,</hi> that is, <hi>reputatively,</hi> and not <hi>really</hi>; or that it is indeed <hi>a moral inſtrument,</hi> that is, <hi>effecteth</hi> our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification morally.</hi> But the <hi>latter</hi> is falſe; for it effecteth it not at all: and the former is falſe: for as there is no <hi>reaſon</hi>; ſo there is no <hi>Scripture</hi> to prove that God reputeth it to be what it is not.</p>
               <p>All that remaineth to be ſaid is that indeed <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> is an act whoſe <hi>nature</hi> partly (that is, one act of it) conſiſteth in the <hi>Acceptance</hi> of Chriſt himſelf who is given to us for our Juſtification and Salvation, by a Covenant which maketh this <hi>believing-acceptance</hi> its <hi>condition.</hi> And ſo this <hi>accepting-act</hi> in the very <hi>eſſence</hi> of it, is ſuch as ſome call <hi>a receiving inſtrument</hi> (or a <hi>paſſive</hi>) which is indeed no <hi>inſtrument,</hi> but an act <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically</hi> called an <hi>inſtrument</hi> (And in diſputes metaphors muſt not be uſed without neceſſity; and to underſtand them <hi>properly</hi> is to <hi>erre.</hi>) So that ſuch an <hi>improper inſtrument</hi> of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification Faith is, as my <hi>truſting my Phyſician</hi> (and <hi>taking</hi> him for my Phyſician) is the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of my cure: And as my <hi>truſting my ſelf</hi> to the conduct of ſuch a <hi>Pilot,</hi> is the inſtrument of my ſafe voyage; or as my <hi>truſting</hi> my <hi>Tutor</hi> is the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of my <hi>learning</hi>; or rather as a womans <hi>marriage-conſent</hi> is the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:59417:184"/>
of all the wealth and honour which ſhe hath by her husband. Indeed <hi>marriage</hi> may be better called the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of it; that is, not her <hi>own conſent</hi> (which is properly the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving condition</hi>) but the <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>actual</hi> marriage by <hi>her husband:</hi> For <hi>he</hi> is the <hi>giver.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Covenant is Gods juſtifying inſtrument,</hi> as ſignifying his donative conſent; and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of it, by <hi>ſolemn inveſtiture</hi> or <hi>tradition</hi>; as the delivering of a <hi>Key,</hi> is the inſtrumental delivery of the houſe.</p>

               <p>And the Scripture never ſaith that <hi>Faith juſtifieth us,</hi> nor calleth it <hi>Juſtifying Faith</hi>; but that we are <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> and moſt commonly [<hi>of Faith</hi>] for the uſualleſt phraſe is <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>So that here is a double errour; 1. That Faith juſtifieth as a true and proper inſtrument: 2. And no o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Errour 21. <hi>That Faith cauſeth Juſtification, as it cauſeth Sanctification; as much and as properly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. Faith <hi>cauſeth</hi> not Juſtification at all, but only is the <hi>condition</hi> of it: But Faith <hi>cauſeth</hi> the <hi>acts</hi> of other graces by a proper efficiency; believing is a proper efficient cauſe of the wills volition, complacency, conſent, (though but a moral efficient, becauſe the liberty of the will forbiddeth the Intellect to move it <hi>per modum naturae.</hi>) And the wills conſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth other acts, and phyſically exciteth other graces: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to love, and deſire, and fear, and ſeek, and obey, are acts of our own ſouls, where one may properly cauſe another: But to <hi>juſtifie</hi> or <hi>pardon</hi> is an act of <hi>God:</hi> and therefore Faith equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procureth our <hi>right</hi> or <hi>title</hi> to Juſtification and to Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and <hi>Glorification</hi>; but it doth not equally <hi>effect</hi> them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and Spirit, perfecting holineſs, &amp;c.</hi> Not let us pardon and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie our ſelves. <hi>James</hi> 4.8. <hi>Cleanſe your hearts you ſinners, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 1. <hi>Waſh you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings</hi>; (not your guilt and puniſhment.)

                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:59417:185"/>Contr. The contrary is fully opened before, and proved at large elſewhere, and through the Scripture. Faith is (as <hi>Davenant</hi> well noteth) the act of the whole man: I was wont to ſay of <hi>both faculties,</hi> I now ſay of the <hi>three faculties</hi> which conſtitute the ſoul of man, the <hi>Poteſtative,</hi> the <hi>Intellective</hi> and the <hi>Volitive.</hi> And the <hi>Aſſent</hi> it ſelf is many acts (as acts are phyſically ſpecified by their objects) as is ſhewed. It is one <hi>moral act</hi> or work of the ſoul: Like truſting a man as my Phyſician, which is a fiducial conſent that he be my Phyſician, in order to the uſe of his remedies: O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Errour 24. <hi>That we are juſtified by Faith, not as it receiveth Chriſts perſon, but his benefits or righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contr. The contrary is before and after proved (and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> at large.) Indeed we receive not Chriſts perſon it ſelf <hi>phyſically</hi>; but his <hi>perſon</hi> in the <hi>office</hi> and <hi>relation</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi>; as we muſt chuſe what perſon ſhall be our <hi>Phyſician,</hi> before we take his medicines, or receive our health; but it is only a conſent that he and no other, be our Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, which we call the <hi>taking</hi> of his <hi>perſon.</hi> And ſo it is here.</p>
               <p>Errour 25. <hi>That it is one act of Faith which giveth us right to Chriſt, and another to his righteouſneſs, and another to his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and another to his Spirit, and another to Adoption, and to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp;c.</hi> and not the ſame.</p>
               <p>Contr. This is 1. <hi>Adding</hi> to the Word of God, and that in a matter near our chiefeſt comfort and ſafety. Prove it, or affirm it not. 2.

John 3.16, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Errour 26. <hi>That though the ſame Faith which juſtifieth doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him as a Teacher, as a King and Judge, &amp;c. yet it juſtifieth us only</hi> quatenus receptio juſtitiae, <hi>as it is the receiving of Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:59417:186"/>Contr. See in my Diſpute of Juſtification, my Confutation of this Aſſertion in Mr. <hi>Warner.</hi> Properly Faith juſtifieth not at all; but we are juſtified of or by it as a condition by the tenour of Gods deed of gift. And ſo far as it is the condition in that gift, ſo far we are juſtified by it. But it is one entire Faith in Chriſt, which is the condition, without ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; therefore we are ſo juſtified by it. 2. According to that Rule, there muſt be as many acts of Faith, as there are benefits to be received, and the title to be aſcribed to each one accordingly. 3. The <hi>natural relation</hi> of the <hi>act</hi> to the <hi>object,</hi> ſheweth no more but what the <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>eſſence</hi> of that Faith is, and not how we come to be juſtified by it. 4. The ſenſe containeth this falſe Propoſition [<hi>Haec fides qua talis,</hi> or <hi>quae fides juſtificat: Faith as Faith, or as this Faith in ſpecie,</hi> juſtifieth (which ſome call the (<hi>To credere</hi>) For it is the <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of Faith which they call its <hi>Reception</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> 5. The true paſſive Reception of Righteouſneſs and Pardon, is that of the <hi>perſon,</hi> as he is the <hi>terminus</hi> of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native or juſtifying act of the Covenant: <hi>To receive Pardon</hi> properly, is <hi>to be pardoned:</hi> But our <hi>Active Receiving</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> is but the <hi>condition</hi> of it; and there is no proof or reaſon that the condition ſhould be ſo parcelled. 6. Yet if by your <hi>quatenus</hi> you intend no more than the deſcription of the act of Faith as eſſentially related to its ſubſequent benefit, and not at all to ſpeak of its conditional neareſt intereſt in our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the matter were leſs. 7. But the truth is, that if we might diſtinguiſh where God doth not diſtinguiſh, it were much more rational to ſay, that <hi>taking Chriſt for a true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of God, and a Teacher, and Sanctifier, and King,</hi> hath a greater hand in our Juſtification, than taking him to juſtifie us (ſuppoſing that all be preſent.) Becauſe the common way and reaſon of conditions in Covenants is, that ſomewhat which the party is <hi>willing</hi> of, is promiſed upon condition of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he is <hi>unwilling</hi> of, that for the one he may be drawn to conſent unto the other: As if the Phyſician ſhould ſay [If you will take me for your Phyſician, and refuſe none of my medicines, I will undertake to cure you.] Here it is ſuppoſed that the Patient is <hi>willing</hi> of <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>not willing of the Medicines,</hi> but for healths ſake; and therefore conſenting
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59417:186"/>
to the <hi>Medicines</hi> (or receiving this man to be his Phyſician as a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And on the other ſide, the Scripture often ſaith, that <hi>Faith is imputed for Righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſhall be ſo to all that <hi>believe in God that raiſed Chriſt (Rom.</hi> 4.) And this theſe objectors pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily deny. But expounding Scripture amiſs, is a much cleanlier pretence for errour than a <hi>flat denyal</hi> of its truth.

               <p>The ſame God who hath given us a Saviour to ſatisfie legal Juſtice, and to merit our Juſtification againſt the charge that we are condemnable by the Law of Works; hath thought meet to convey our <hi>title</hi> to this Chriſt and Juſtification, by the Inſtrumentality of a new Covenant, Teſtament, or pardoning Act; in which (though he abſolutely give many antecedent

So that there is a condition to be performed by our ſelves (through grace) before we can have the Covenant right to Juſtification. Now when that is performed, Chriſt then is our only Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs (as aforeſaid) by which we muſt anſwer the charge of breaking the firſt Law, and being condemnable by it.

               <p>Contr. Then it is ſinful to perſwade a wicked man from his wickedneſs: <hi>Praying and obeying,</hi> is departing from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

We never exhort wicked men to pray with the tongue, without the <hi>deſire</hi> of the heart. <hi>Deſire</hi> is the ſoul of prayer, and words are but the body: We per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them not to diſſemble: But as <hi>Peter</hi> did <hi>Simon, Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for forgiveneſs.

The <hi>merit</hi> of the <hi>cauſe</hi> is a common phraſe among all Lawyers, when there is <hi>commutative</hi> meriting intended.

               <p>But to paſs from the word <hi>merit</hi> (which I had rather were quite diſuſed, becauſe the danger is greater than the benefit) the thing ſignified thus by it, is paſt all diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever duty God hath promiſed a <hi>Reward</hi> to, that <hi>duty</hi> or work

               <p>The word [<hi>Sanctified</hi>] doth ſignifie that which is <hi>ſeparated to God from common uſes.</hi>] And this <hi>ſeparation</hi> is either by <hi>God himſelf</hi> (as he hath ſanctified the Lords day, &amp;c.) or by <hi>mans

(And it is high ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge in themſelves, or any other, that ſhall alienate them unjuſtly from their ſacred calling and work.) Or <hi>of things</hi> to holy <hi>uſes</hi>; (as places and utenſils may be ſanctified: Or it may be a dedication of <hi>perſons</hi> to a <hi>holy ſtate, relation</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi>; as is that of every Chriſtian in his Baptiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is either an <hi>external dedication</hi>; and ſo all the baptized are <hi>ſanctified</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> or an <hi>internal Dedication,</hi> which if it be <hi>ſincere,</hi> it is <hi>both actual</hi> and <hi>habitual</hi>; when we both give up our ſelves to God in <hi>Covenant,</hi> and are alſo <hi>diſpoſed</hi> and <hi>inclined</hi> to him; and our hearts are ſet upon him; yea and the life alſo conſiſteth of the exerciſe of this <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> and performance of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. This is the Sanctification which here I ſpeak of. And ſo much for the name.</p>
               <p>The doctrinal Propoſitions neceſſary to be underſtood about it, are theſe (more largely and plainly laid down in my <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Chap.</hi> 3.)</p>
               <p>Prop. 1. <hi>So much of the appearance or Image of God as there is upon any creature, ſo much it is good and amiable to God and man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>God loveth us from eternity, and when we were his enemies; not becauſe we were good, but to make us better than we were.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Gods Love (and all Love) conſiſteth <hi>formally</hi> in <hi>complacency.</hi> God hath no complacency in any thing but in <hi>good</hi>; or according to the meaſure of its <hi>goodneſs:</hi> From eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity God <hi>foreſeeing</hi> the good which <hi>would</hi> be in us, loved us <hi>as good in eſſe cognito</hi>; and not as <hi>actually good,</hi> when we <hi>were not.</hi> When we were his <hi>enemies,</hi> he had a <hi>double love</hi> to us (or complacency) the one was for that <hi>natural good</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in us as we were <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>repairable,</hi> and <hi>capable</hi> of being made Saints. The other was for that <hi>foreſeen goodes in eſſe cognito,</hi> which he purpoſed in time to come, to put upon us. This <hi>complacency</hi> exceeded not at all the <hi>good</hi> which was the object of it: But with it was joyned a <hi>will and purpoſe</hi> to give us grace and glory hereafter; and thence it is called, <hi>A Love of Benevolence:</hi> Not but that <hi>complacency</hi> is the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59417:197"/>
of <hi>Love</hi>; and <hi>Benevolence,</hi> or a purpoſe to <hi>give</hi> benefits, is but the <hi>fruit</hi> of it. But if any will needs call the <hi>Benevolence</hi> alone by the name of <hi>Love,</hi> we deny not in that ſenſe that God loveth <hi>Saul</hi> a perſecutor, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle; in that his <hi>purpoſe to do him good</hi> is the ſame.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>God loveth us in Chriſt, and for his righteouſneſs, and not only for our own inherent holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The <hi>Benevolence</hi> of God is exerciſed towards us in and by Chriſt; and the <hi>fruits</hi> of his Love are <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> and the mercies given us <hi>with</hi> Chriſt, and <hi>by</hi> Chriſt. And our <hi>Pardon,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>Adoption,</hi> and <hi>Acceptance</hi> is by <hi>his</hi> meritorious righteouſneſs: And it is <hi>by him</hi> that we are poſſeſſed with Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> and renewed according to his Image, in Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs: And all this <hi>relative</hi> and <hi>inherent</hi> mercy we have as <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> related to him, without whom we have nothing: And thus it is that we are accepted and beloved in him, and for his righteouſneſs. But Chriſt did not <hi>die</hi> or <hi>merit</hi> to change Gods <hi>Nature,</hi> and make him more indifferent in his Love to the holy and the unholy, or equally to the more holy, and to the leſs holy. But his <hi>complacency</hi> is ſtill in no man further than he is made <hi>truly amiable</hi> in his <hi>real holineſs,</hi> and his <hi>relation</hi> to Chriſt, and to the Father. (The Doctrine of <hi>Imputation</hi> is opened before.) <hi>John</hi> 16.27. <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me, and believed, &amp;c.</hi> And 14.21. <hi>He that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father</hi>— As God loved us with the love of <hi>benevolence,</hi> and ſo much <hi>complacence</hi> as is before deſcribed <hi>before we loved him</hi> (1 John 4.10. Epheſ. 2.4.) ſo he <hi>now loveth us compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centially</hi> for his <hi>Image</hi> upon us, and ſo much of his <hi>grace</hi> as is found in us; and alſo for our <hi>relation</hi> to his Son, and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which we ſtand in by this grace: But as he loveth not <hi>Saul</hi> a perſecutor, under the notion of a <hi>fulfiller of his Law in Chriſt</hi>; ſo neither doth he love <hi>David</hi> in his ſin, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one that is <hi>without ſin,</hi> and perfect, as having fulfilled the Law in Chriſt: But ſo loveth him in Chriſt, as to <hi>pardon his ſin,</hi> and make him more lovely in himſelf, by <hi>creating a clean heart, and renewing a right ſpirit within him,</hi> for the ſake of the ſatisfaction and merits of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. Accordingly the greateſt uſe of Faith in Chriſt is to ſubſerve and kindle our Love to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 9. This it doth two ſpecial waies: 1. By procuring the pardon of ſin, which forfeited the grace of the Spirit; that ſo the Spirit may kindle the Love of God in us: 2.

God in Love; and Regeneration by the Spirit, is the Spirits begetting us to the Image and Nature of God our heavenly Father, in a heavenly Love to him: So that the Holy Ghoſt is given us to work in us a Love to God, which is our ſanctification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16.</p>

               </p>
               <p>All the Books of Philoſophers are ſapleſs and empty, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the teaching of Jeſus Chriſt; they are but enquiries into the <hi>nature</hi> of the creatures, and the loweſt things, moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to our happineſs or duty: Or if they riſe up to God, it is but with dark and unpractical conjectures, for the moſt part of them: and the reſt do but grope and fumble in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. And their learning is moſtly but uſeleſs ſpeculations, and ſtriving about words and <hi>ſciences</hi> falſly ſo called, which little tend to godly edifying. It is Chriſt who is <hi>made wiſdom</hi> to us, as being himſelf the <hi>wiſdom of God.</hi> If you knew but where to hear an Angel, you would all prefer him before <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Carteſius,</hi> or <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>; how much more the Son himſelf? He is the true Light, to lighten every man that will not ſerve the Prince of darkneſs. Chriſtians were firſt called <hi>Chriſts Diſciples</hi>

                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:59417:200"/>1. His Goſpel written is his Book which muſt be taught us. 2. His Miniſters office is to teach it us. 3. His Spirit is inwardly to illuminate us that we may underſtand it. And he that will deſpiſe or neglect either the <hi>Scripture, Miniſtry</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> is never like to learn of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Look on the Lord Jeſus, and the work of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by him, as the great deſigned Revelation of the Fathers Love and Goodneſs; even as the fabrick of the world is ſet up to be the Glaſs or Revelation (eminently) of his Greatneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore as you chuſe your Book for the ſake of the <hi>Science</hi> or ſubject which you would learn; ſo let this be the deſigned, ſtudied, conſtant uſe which you make of Chriſt, to ſee and admire in him the <hi>Fathers Love.</hi> When you read your <hi>Grammar,</hi> if one ask you, <hi>why?</hi> you will ſay it is to learn the <hi>language</hi> which it teacheth; and he that readeth <hi>Law-books,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or <hi>Medicine,</hi> it is to learn <hi>Law, Philoſophy</hi> or <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick:</hi> ſo whenever you read the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> meditate on Chriſt, or hear his Word; if you are askt <hi>why you do it?</hi> be able to ſay, <hi>I do it to learn the Love of God, which is no where elſe in the world to be learnt ſo well.</hi> No wonder if <hi>Hypocrites</hi> have learned to mortifie <hi>Scripture, Sermons, Prayers,</hi> and all other means of grace; yea all the world which ſhould teach them God; and to learn the <hi>letters,</hi> and not the ſenſe: But it is moſt pittiful that they ſhould thus mortifie <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> to them; and ſhould gaze on the glaſs, and never take much notice of the face even of the Love of God which he is ſet up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Think of the grand <hi>deſign</hi> it ſelf; the reconciling and ſaving of loſt mankind: Think of the <hi>gracious nature</hi> of Chriſt; of his wonderful <hi>condeſcention</hi> in his <hi>incarnation</hi> in his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> in his <hi>ſufferings</hi> and <hi>death</hi>; in his <hi>miracles</hi> and <hi>gifts:</hi> Think of his merciful <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi>; of all his <hi>benefits</hi> given to his Church; and all the <hi>priviledges</hi> of his Saints; of <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> of his <hi>Spirit</hi> of Holineſs, of <hi>preſervation</hi> and

And if the <hi>Faith</hi> which looketh on <hi>all theſe,</hi> cannot yet warm your hearts with love, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them in thankful obedience to your Redeemer, certainly it is no <hi>true</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>But you muſt not think <hi>narrowly</hi> and <hi>ſeldom</hi> of theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; not hearken to the Devil or the doctrine of any miſtaken Teachers, that would repreſent Gods Love as vailed or ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed; or ſhew you nothing but wrath and flames. That which Chriſt principally came to <hi>reveal,</hi> the Devil principally ſtriveth to <hi>conceal,</hi> even the <hi>Love of God to ſinners</hi>; that ſo that which Chriſt principally came to <hi>work</hi> in us, the Devil might principally labour to <hi>deſtroy</hi>; and that is, <hi>our love to him</hi> that hath ſo loved us.</p>
               <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Take heed of all the Antinomian Doctrines before recited, which, to extol the empty Name and Image of Free Grace, do deſtroy the true principles and motives of holineſs and obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Direct. 6. <hi>Exerciſe your Faith upon all the holy Scriptures, Precepts, Promiſes and Threatnings, and not on one of them alone.</hi> For when God hath appointed all conjunctly for this work, you are unlike to have his bleſſing, or the effect, if you will lay by moſt of his remedies.</p>
               <p>Direct. 7. <hi>Take not that for Holineſs and Good Works, which is no ſuch thing; but either mans inventions, or ſome common gifts of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It greatly deludeth the world, to take up a wrong deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or character of Holineſs in their minds. As 1.

They think their idle ceremonies are holineſs, and that their hurtful auſterities, and ſelf-afflictings (by riſing in the night, when they might pray as long before they go to bed) (and by whipping themſelves) to be very meritorious parts of Religion.

                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:59417:201"/>2. Others think that Holineſs conſiſteth much in being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, and in cenſuring the Pariſh-Churches and Miniſters as <hi>Null,</hi> and in withdrawing from their communion; and in avoiding forms of prayer, &amp;c.</p>

And others (or the ſame) think that more of it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the gifts of utterance, in praying, and preaching, than indeed it doth; and that thoſe only are godly, that can pray without book (in their families, or at other times) and that are moſt in private meetings; and none but they.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And ſome think that the greateſt parts of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> are the ſpirit of bondage to fear; and the ſhedding of tears for ſin; or finding that they were under terrour, before they had any ſpiritual peace and comfort; or being able to tell at what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or time, or in what order, and by what means they were converted.</p>
               <p>It is of exceeding great conſequence, to have a right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and to eſcape all falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits thereof.

To know God in Chriſt is life eternal, <hi>John</hi> 17.3.</p>
               <p>Direct. 9. <hi>Never ſeparate reward from duty, but in every religious or obedient action, ſtill ſee it as connext with Heaven.</hi> The <hi>means</hi> is no means but for the <hi>end</hi>; and muſt never be <hi>uſed</hi> but with ſpecial reſpect unto the end.

               <p>BEcauſe I find not this inſiſted on in any Writers for the peoples inſtruction, as it ought, I will not paſs over ſo needful a point without ſome further advertiſement about it. I will therefore ſhew you, 1. What is the <hi>compleatneſs</hi> and the <hi>harmony</hi> to be deſired: 2. What are our contrary defects and diſtempers: 3. What are the cauſes of them, and what muſt be the cure: 4. Some uſeful Inferences hence ariſing.</p>
               <p n="1">I. He that will be <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>entire,</hi> muſt have all theſe <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Duties following.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:59417:203"/>1. A <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>clear underſtanding</hi> of all the great, the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and practical matters of the ſacred Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. (And if he have the underſtanding of the Scripture languages, and the cuſtoms of thoſe times, and other ſuch helps, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scripture will be the more compleat, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.3. If he have not, he muſt make uſe of other mens.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſettled well grounded <hi>Belief</hi> of all Gods ſupernatural Revelations (as well as the knowledge of natural ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Experience</hi> to make this <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, powerful and firm. Eſpecially the experience of the Spirits effectual operations in our ſelves, by the means of this word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. &amp; 8.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The hiſtorical knowledge of the Scripture matters of fact, and how God in all ages (ſince Scripture times) hath fulfilled his Word, both promiſes and threatnings, and what Chriſt, and Satan, Grace and Sin, have been doing in the world. Therefore the Scripture is written ſo much by way of hiſtory; and therefore the Jews were ſo often charged to tell the hiſtory of Gods works to their children, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 6, 7, 11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.22. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.6, 21, 22. &amp; 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24, 27. Therefore the writing of Church-hiſtory is the duty of all ages, becauſe Gods <hi>Works</hi> are to be known, as well as his Word: And as it is your forefathers <hi>duty</hi> to write it, it is the childrens <hi>duty</hi> to learn it (or elſe the writing it would be vain.) He that knoweth not what ſtate the Church and world is in, and hath been in, in former ages, and what God hath been doing in the world, and how errour and ſin have been reſiſting him, and with what ſucceſs, doth want much to the <hi>compleating</hi> of his knowledge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And he muſt have <hi>prudence</hi> to diſcern particular caſes; and to conſider of all circumſtances, and to compare things with things, that he may diſcern his duty, and the ſeaſons and manner of it; and may know among inconſiſtent ſeeming duties, which is to be preferred; and when and what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances or <hi>accidents</hi> do make any thing a duty which elſe would be no duty or a ſin; and what <hi>accidents</hi> make that a ſin which without them would be a <hi>duty.</hi> This is the <hi>knowledge</hi> which muſt make a Chriſtian <hi>entire</hi> or compleat.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:59417:203"/>2. And in his Will there muſt be 1. A full <hi>reſignation</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the <hi>Will of God</hi> his <hi>Owner</hi>; and a full <hi>ſubjection</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Will of God</hi> his <hi>Governour</hi>; yielding <hi>readily,</hi> and <hi>conſtantly,</hi> and <hi>reſolut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly</hi> to the commands of God, as the Scholar obeyeth his Maſter, and as the ſecond wheel in the clock is moved by the firſt: And a cloſe <hi>adhering to God</hi> as his <hi>chief Good,</hi> by a <hi>Thankful Reception</hi> of his Benefits; and a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous ſeeking</hi> to enjoy, and <hi>glorifie</hi> him, and <hi>pleaſe</hi> his <hi>Will:</hi> In a word, <hi>loving</hi> him as God, and taking our chiefeſt compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in pleaſing him; in loving him, and being loved of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in the ſame will there muſt be a <hi>well regulated Love,</hi> to all <hi>Gods works,</hi> according as he is <hi>manifeſted</hi> or <hi>glorified</hi> in them: To the <hi>humanity</hi> of our <hi>Redeemer</hi>; to the <hi>glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as it is a created thing; to the <hi>bleſſed Angels,</hi> and <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits of the juſt,</hi> to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> on earth, to the <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> the <hi>Rulers,</hi> the <hi>holy Ordinances,</hi> to <hi>all mankind,</hi> even to our <hi>enemies</hi>; to our ſelves, our ſouls, our bodies, our relations, our eſtates, and mercies of every rank.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And herewithall muſt be a hatred of every ſin in our ſelves and others: Of former ſin, and preſent corruption, with a penitential diſplicence and grief; and of <hi>poſſible ſin,</hi> with a vigilancy and reſiſtance to avoid it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And in the <hi>Affections</hi> there muſt be a <hi>vivacity</hi> and <hi>ſober fervency,</hi> anſwering to all theſe motions of the <hi>Will</hi>; in Love, Delight, Deſire, Hope, Hatred, Sorrow, Averſation and Anger; the complexion of all which is godly Zeal.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the <hi>vital and executive Power</hi> of the ſoul, there muſt be a holy <hi>activity, promptitude</hi> and <hi>fortitude,</hi> to be up and doing, and to ſet the ſluggiſh faculties on work; and to bring all <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>volitions</hi> into <hi>practice,</hi> and to aſſault and conquer enemies and difficulties. There muſt be the <hi>Spirit of Power</hi> (though I know that word did <hi>chiefly</hi> then denote the Spirit of Miracles, yet not <hi>only</hi>) and of <hi>Love,</hi> and of a <hi>ſound mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In the <hi>outward members</hi> there muſt be by <hi>uſe</hi> a habit of <hi>ready</hi> obedient <hi>execution</hi> of the ſouls commands: As in the <hi>tongue</hi> a readineſs to <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>praiſe God,</hi> and declare his Word, and edifie others; and ſo in the reſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the <hi>ſenſes</hi> and <hi>appetite,</hi> there muſt by <hi>uſe</hi> be a habit
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59417:204"/>
of <hi>yielding obedience</hi> to Reaſon; that the ſenſes do not rebel and rage, and bear down the commands of the mind and will.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, In the <hi>Imagination</hi> there muſt be a <hi>clearneſs</hi> or <hi>purity</hi> from <hi>filthineſs, malice, covetouſneſs, pride</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi>; and there muſt be the impreſſions of things that are good and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and a ready obedience to the ſuperiour faculties, that it may be the inſtrument of holineſs, and not the ſhop of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſin, nor a wild, unruly, diſordered thing.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>harmony</hi> of all theſe muſt be as well obſerved as the matter: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be a juſt <hi>Order</hi> among them: every duty muſt keep its proper place and ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be a <hi>juſt proportion</hi> and degree: ſome graces muſt not wither, whilſt others alone are cheriſhed: nor ſome duties take up all our heart and time, whilſt others are almoſt laid by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There muſt be a <hi>juſt activity</hi> and <hi>exerciſe</hi> of every grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And a juſt <hi>conjunction</hi> and reſpect to one another, that every one be uſed ſo as to be a help to all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Order 1. Of <hi>Intellectual</hi> graces and <hi>duties,</hi> muſt be this. 1. In order of <hi>Time,</hi> the things which are <hi>ſenſible</hi> are known before the things which are beyond our <hi>ſight,</hi> and other <hi>ſenſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Beyond theſe the firſt thing known both for <hi>certainly</hi> and for <hi>excellency,</hi> is, that <hi>there is a God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This God is to be known as <hi>one</hi> Being in his three Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Principles, <hi>Vital Power, Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And theſe as in their <hi>Eſſential Perfections, Omnipotency, Wiſdom and Goodneſs</hi> (or <hi>Love.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="5">5. And alſo in his perfections called <hi>Modal</hi> and <hi>Negative,</hi> &amp;c. (as Immenſity, Eternity, Independancy, Immutability, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p n="6">6. God muſt be next known in his <hi>Three Perſonalities</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And theſe in their three <hi>Cauſalities; efficient, dirigent</hi> and <hi>final.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. And in their <hi>three great works, Creation, Redemption,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59417:204"/>
Sanctification</hi> (or <hi>Perfection</hi>) producing <hi>Nature, Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> or our <hi>Perſons, Medicine,</hi> and <hi>Health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. And God who created the world, is thereupon to be known in his <hi>Relations</hi> to it; as our <hi>Creator</hi> in Unity, and as our <hi>Owner, Ruler,</hi> and <hi>Chief Good</hi> (efficient, dirigent and final) in a <hi>Trinity</hi> of Relations. You muſt know how the Infinite <hi>Vital Power</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> created all things by the <hi>Infinite Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> or Son, and by the <hi>Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> (As the Son redeemed us as the eternal <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Word Incarnate,</hi> ſent by the eternal <hi>Vital-Power</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> to reveal and communicate the eternal <hi>Love</hi> in the Holy Ghoſt: And as the Holy Ghoſt doth <hi>ſanctifie</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> us, as proceeding and ſent from the Power of the Father, and the Wiſdom of the Son, to ſhed abroad the Love of God upon our hearts, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p n="10">10. Next to the knowledge of <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Creator,</hi> is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>World</hi> which he created, and eſpecially the <hi>Intectellual Creatures</hi>; Angels, or heavenly Spirits, and Men. Man is to be known in his perſon or <hi>conſtitution</hi> firſt, and afterward in his <hi>appointed courſe,</hi> and in his end and perfection.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In his conſtitution is to be conſidered, 1. His Being or eſſential parts: 2. His Rectitude or Qualities: 3. His Relations, 1. To his Creatour; And 2. To his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="12">12. His eſſential parts are his <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body:</hi> His <hi>ſoul</hi> is to be known in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>eſſential facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> (which is its <hi>natural</hi> Image of God.) Its <hi>eſſence</hi> is a <hi>Living Spirit:</hi> Its eſſential faculties are 1. A <hi>Vital Activity,</hi> or <hi>Power:</hi> 2. An <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> 3. A <hi>Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. His <hi>Rectitude,</hi> which is Gods <hi>Moral Image</hi> on him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth 1. In the <hi>promptitude and fortitude</hi> of his <hi>Active Power:</hi> 2. In the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> 3. In the <hi>Moral Goodneſs</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> which is its <hi>Inclination</hi> to its <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Readineſs</hi> for its <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Being created ſuch a creature, by a meer reſultancy from his Nature, and his Creator, he is related to him as his <hi>Creature</hi>; and in that Unity is the ſubſequent Trinity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: 1. As we are Gods Propriety, or his <hi>Own</hi>: 2. His <hi>Subjects:</hi> 3. His <hi>Beneficiaries</hi> and <hi>Lovers</hi>: all comprized in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59417:205"/>
the one title of his <hi>children.</hi> And at once with theſe Relations of man to God, it is that God is as before related to man, as his Creator, and as his <hi>Owner, Ruler, and Chief Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Man is alſo related to his fellow creatures, <hi>below him,</hi> 1. As their <hi>Owner,</hi> 2. Their <hi>Ruler,</hi> 3. Their <hi>End</hi> under God: which is Gods <hi>Dominative</hi> or <hi>Honorary Image</hi> upon man, and is called commonly our <hi>Dominion</hi> over the creatures: So that by <hi>meer Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Nature</hi> of the creatures there is conſtituted a <hi>ſtate of communion between God and Man,</hi> which is 1. A <hi>Dominion,</hi> 2. A <hi>Kingdom,</hi> 3. A <hi>Family</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</hi> And the <hi>whole</hi> is ſometime called by <hi>one</hi> of theſe names, and ſometime by the other, ſtill implying the reſt.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Gods <hi>Kingdom</hi> being thus <hi>conſtituted,</hi> his Attributes appropriate to theſe his Relations follow: 1. His <hi>Abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> as our <hi>Owner:</hi> 2. His <hi>Holineſs, Truth</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> as our <hi>Ruler:</hi> 3. And his Kindneſs, Benignity and Mercy as our <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Benefactor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. And then the <hi>Works</hi> of God as in theſe three Relations follow; which are 1. To <hi>Diſpoſe</hi> of us at his pleaſure as our <hi>Owner:</hi> 2. To <hi>govern</hi> us as our King: 3. To <hi>love us,</hi> and do us <hi>good,</hi> and make us perfectly happy as our Benefactor and our end.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And here more particularly is to be conſidered, 1. How God diſpoſed of <hi>Adam</hi> when he had new made him: 2. How he began his Government of him: And 3. What Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits he gave him, and what he further offered or promiſed him.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And as to the ſecond, we muſt 1. Conſider the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> part of Gods Government, which is <hi>Legiſlation</hi> and then (herafter) the <hi>conſequent</hi> part; which is 1. <hi>Judgment,</hi> 2. <hi>Execution.</hi> And Gods Legiſlation is 1. By <hi>making our Natures</hi> ſuch as compared with objects, <hi>Duty</hi> ſhall reſult from this <hi>Nature</hi> ſo related: 2. Or elſe by <hi>Precept</hi> or Revelation from himſelf, beſides our Natures. 1. The Law of Nature is fundamental and radical in our foreſaid Relations to God themſelves, in which it is made our natural duty, 1. To <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> our ſelves wholly to God, and his diſpoſal, as his own: 2. To obey his commands: 3. And to receive his mercies, and thankfully to return them, and to love him. But though
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59417:205"/>
(as Gods eſſential principles, and his foreſaid Relations, are admirably conjunct in their operations <hi>ad extra</hi>; ſo) our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <hi>obligations</hi> are conjunct, yet are they ſo far diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that we may ſay, that theſe which conjunctly make our <hi>Moral duty,</hi> yet are not all the reſults of our Relation to a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, as ſuch</hi>; but the ſecond only; and therefore that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is to be called the <hi>Radical Law</hi> in the ſtrict ſenſe, the other two being the <hi>Moral</hi> reſults of our <hi>Rectitude.</hi> The <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> in general, ariſing from our Natures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to our Creator, is the radical governing Law of God in us. But yet the ſame <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> and <hi>gratitude,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> which are primarily our <hi>duty</hi> from their proper foundations, are ſecondarily made alſo the matter of our <hi>ſubjective duty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are alſo commanded of God. 2. The <hi>particular</hi> Laws of Nature are 1. Of our particular duties to God; or of Piety: 2. Or of our duties to our ſelves and others: 1. Acts of Juſtice, 2. And of Charity. Theſe Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are 1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nalterable</hi>; and that is, where the nature of our perſons, and of the objects, which are the foundations of them are unalterable, or ſtill the ſame: 2. Or mutable, when the <hi>Nature</hi> of the things which are its foundation, is <hi>mutable.</hi> As it is the immutable Law of immutable nature, that we love God as God, and that we do all the good we can, &amp;c. becauſe the <hi>foundation</hi> of it is immutable: But <hi>e. g.</hi> the Law againſt Inceſt was mutable in nature: For nature bound <hi>Adams</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to marry each other; and nature bindeth us ſince (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) to the contrary: 2. The <hi>revealed</hi> Law to <hi>Adam</hi> was ſuperinduced. The parts of Gods <hi>Law</hi> muſt alſo here be conſidered. 1. The <hi>introductive Teaching</hi> part (for Gods teaching us, is part of his <hi>ruling</hi> us) and that is, Doctrines, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory and Prophecy. 2. The <hi>Imperative part,</hi> commands to <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> to do. 3. And the <hi>ſanctions</hi> or <hi>motive</hi> parts in Law and execution, which are 1. Promiſes of Beneficial Rewards: 2. Threatnings of hurtful penalties.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Gods <hi>Laws</hi> being thus deſcribed in <hi>general,</hi> and thoſe made to <hi>Adam</hi> thus in <hi>particular,</hi> the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is <hi>mans behaviour in breaking thoſe Laws</hi>; which muſt be conſidered in the <hi>Cauſes,</hi> and the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effects and conſequents.</p>
               <p n="21">
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:59417:206"/>21. And next muſt be conſidered Gods <hi>conſequent</hi> part of Government as to <hi>Adam, viz.</hi> his <hi>judging</hi> him according to his Law.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And here cometh in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> or the firſt edition of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> or Law of Grace; which muſt be opened in its parts, original and end.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And then muſt be conſidered Gods <hi>execution</hi> of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo far as he was unpardoned; and ſo upon the world, till the end.</p>
               <p n="24">24. And next muſt be conſidered Gods enlargements and explications of his Covenant of Grace, till Chriſts Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p n="25">25. And next, mens behaviour under that explained Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And Gods ſentence and execution upon them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Then we come to the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> and to explain the work of Redemption diſtinctly. And 1. Its <hi>Original,</hi> the God of <hi>Nature</hi> giving the world a Phyſician or a Saviour: 2. The <hi>Ends:</hi> 3. The conſtitutive Cauſes: Where 1. Of the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> in his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and in his perfections, both <hi>eſſential,</hi> and modal, and accidental.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And 2. Of the <hi>fundamental works</hi> of our <hi>Redemption</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Creation</hi> was to the firſt Adminiſtration) <hi>viz.</hi> (his firſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, Interpoſition,</hi> and <hi>Incarnation,</hi> being all preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.) 1. His perfect <hi>Reſignation</hi> of himſelf to his Father, and ſubmiſſion to his diſpoſing Will: 2. His perfect <hi>ſubjection</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to his Coverning Will: 3. His <hi>perfect Love</hi> to him: 4. And the <hi>ſuffering</hi> by which he expreſt all theſe. The three firſt <hi>meriting of themſelves</hi>; and the laſt <hi>meriting</hi> as a <hi>ſatisfactory Sacrifice,</hi> not for <hi>it ſelf,</hi> but for its uſefulneſs to its proper <hi>ends.</hi>

               <p n="29">29. From this <hi>Offering</hi> once made to God, Chriſt acquired the perfecter title of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> or <hi>Redeemer,</hi> or <hi>Mediatour,</hi> which one <hi>contained</hi> this Trinity alſo of Relations <hi>towards Man</hi>: 1. <hi>Their Owner:</hi> 2.

               <p n="31">31. The work of Redemption thus fundamentally wrought, doth not of it ſelf renew mans nature; and therefore putteth no Law of Nature into us of it ſelf, as the Creation did: And therefore we muſt next proceed to Chriſts <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of this office, according to theſe Relations; which is 1. By <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation</hi> or <hi>Donation</hi>; enacting the New Covenant (where this laſt and perfect edition of it is to be explained; the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive, the Promiſory and the Penal parts, with its effects, and its differences from the former Edition, and from the Law of Nature and of Works.</p>

               <p n="2">II. And as this is the <hi>Intellectual Order</hi> of knowledge; ſo the order which all things muſt lye in at our <hi>hearts and wills,</hi> is much more neceſſary to be obſerved: 1. That nothing but GOD be loved as the infinite ſimple good, totally with all the heart, and finally for <hi>himſelf:</hi> And that nothing at all be loved with any Love, which is not purely ſubordinate to the Love of God, or which cauſeth us to love him ever the leſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the bleſſed perſon of our <hi>Mediatour,</hi> as in the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature glorified,</hi> be loved above all creatures next to God: Becauſe there is moſt of the Divines Perfections appearing in him.</p>

               <p n="4">4. That the <hi>

               <p n="5">5. That <hi>particular Churches</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> be next loved; and where ever there is more of Gods <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> than in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> that our Love be more there, than on <hi>our ſelves.</hi>

               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="7">7. That we love our <hi>Chriſtian Relations</hi> with that double Love which is due to them as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi>; and love <hi>all Relations</hi> according to their <hi>places,</hi> with that kind of Love which is proper for them, as fitting us to all the duties which we muſt perform to them.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:59417:208"/>8. That we love all <hi>good Chriſtians</hi> as the ſanctified members of Chriſt, with a <hi>ſpecial Love</hi> according to the meaſure of Gods Image appearing on them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That we love every <hi>viſible Chriſtian</hi> (that we cannot prove hath unchriſtened himſelf by apoſtacy or ungodlineſs) with the <hi>ſpecial Love</hi> alſo belonging to <hi>true</hi> Chriſtians, becauſe he <hi>appeareth</hi> ſuch to us: But yet according to the <hi>meaſure</hi> of that <hi>appearance,</hi> as being more <hi>confident of ſome,</hi> and more <hi>doubtful</hi> of others.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That we love our intimate ſuitable <hi>friends</hi> that are <hi>godly</hi> with a double Love, as <hi>godly</hi> and as <hi>friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. That we love Neighbours and civil Relations, with a Love which is ſuitable to our duty towards them (to do to them, as we would have them do to us; which is partly meant by loving them as our ſelves.)</p>
               <p n="12">12. That we love all mankind, even <hi>Gods enemies,</hi> much more <hi>our own,</hi> as they are <hi>men</hi>; for the dignity of humane nature, and their <hi>capacity</hi> to become holy and truly amiable.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That all <hi>means</hi> be choſen according to the <hi>end</hi> (which is to be preferred before other ends) and their ſuitableneſs and fitneſs for that end (as they are to be preferred before other means.)</p>
               <p n="3">III. And the order of practice is, 1. That we be ſure to <hi>begin with God</hi> alone, and proceed to <hi>God in the creature, and end in God alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the principal thing to be known for finding out the true method of Divinity and Religion, that (as in the great frame of Nature; ſo) in the frame of <hi>Morality,</hi> the true motion is <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: From <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the efficient by God,</hi> the <hi>Dirigent to God,</hi> the <hi>final Cauſe</hi> of all; therefore as God is the firſt ſpring or cauſe of motion; ſo the <hi>creature</hi> is the <hi>Recipient firſt,</hi> and the <hi>Agent after,</hi> in returning all to God again.</p>
               <p>Therefore mark, that our <hi>receiving Graces</hi> are our <hi>firſt graces in exerciſe</hi>; and our <hi>receiving duties</hi> are our firſt <hi>duties</hi>; and then our <hi>returning graces</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> come next; in which we proceed from the <hi>leſſer</hi> to the <hi>greater,</hi> till we come up to <hi>God</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:59417:208"/>Therefore in point of practice, the firſt thing that we have to do, is to learn to <hi>know God</hi> himſelf as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>our God,</hi> and to live as <hi>from him,</hi> and <hi>upon him</hi> as our <hi>Benefactor,</hi> from our hearts confeſſing that we <hi>have nothing</hi> but from him, and ſhall never be at <hi>reſt</hi> but <hi>with him,</hi> and <hi>in him,</hi> as our <hi>ultimate end</hi>; and therefore to ſet our ſelves to <hi>ſeek him</hi> as our end accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; which is but to ſeek to <hi>love him,</hi> and be <hi>beloved</hi> by him, in the perfection of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The whole <hi>frame of means</hi> appointed by God for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of this <hi>end,</hi> muſt be <hi>taken together,</hi> and not broken aſunder; as they have all relation each to other. And 1. The <hi>whole frame of Nature</hi> muſt be looked on as the firſt great means appointed to man in innocency, for the preſervation and exerciſe of his holineſs and righteouſneſs: 2. And the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Law poſitive, as conjoyned unto this: 3. And the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> communicated only for ſuch a meer <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of <hi>neceſſary</hi> help, as God ſaw meet to one in that condition. And though theſe means (the <hi>Creatures, and the Spirit of the Creator in that degree</hi>) be not now <hi>ſufficient</hi> for lapſed man; yet they are ſtill to be looked on as delivered into the hand of Chriſt the Mediatour, to be uſed by him on his terms, and in order to his bleſſed ends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it is the <hi>frame</hi> of the <hi>recovering and perfecting</hi> means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we are now to uſe: And in this frame 1. Chriſt the Mediatour is the firſt and principal; and the Author of our Faith, or Religion; and therefore from his Name it is called <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> He is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow the <hi>firſt means</hi> uſed on <hi>Gods part</hi> for communicating mercy unto man; and the firſt in <hi>dignity</hi> to be <hi>received</hi> and uſed by <hi>man himſelf</hi>; but not the firſt in <hi>Time,</hi> becauſe the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>revealing him</hi> muſt go firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond <hi>means</hi> in <hi>dignity</hi> (under Chriſt) is the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> as ſent or given by the Redeemer: which <hi>Spirit</hi> being as the <hi>ſoul of outward means</hi> (which are as the <hi>body</hi>) is given variouſly in a <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> to the ſeveral ſorts of means (of which more anon.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>outward means</hi> for this Spirit to work by and with, have been in three degrees: 1. The <hi>loweſt</hi> degree, is the <hi>world</hi> or <hi>creatures</hi> (called <hi>The Book of Nature</hi>) alone: 2. The ſecond degree was the Law and Promiſes to the Jews and their fore-fathers
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59417:209"/>
(together with the Law of Nature.) 3. The third and higheſt degree of <hi>outward means,</hi> is the whole frame of <hi>Chriſtian Inſtitutions,</hi> adjoyned to the <hi>Book of Nature,</hi> and <hi>ſucceeding</hi> the foreſaid <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one of theſe hath a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> in its <hi>own kind,</hi> and to its proper uſe. 1. The Law of <hi>Nature</hi> is ſufficient <hi>in its own kind,</hi> to reveal a <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Eſſential Principles</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi>; and to teach man the neceſſity now of ſome ſupernatural <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> and <hi>Inſtitutions</hi>; and ſo to direct him to enquire after them (<hi>what</hi> and <hi>where</hi> they be.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Promiſes</hi> and Jewiſh Law (of Types, &amp;c.) was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in <hi>its own kind,</hi> to acquaint men that a <hi>Saviour muſt be ſent into the world,</hi> to reveal the Will of God more fully, and to be a ſacrifice for ſin, and to make reconciliation between God and man, and to give a greater meaſure of the Spirit, and to renew mens ſouls, and bring them to full perfection, and to the bleſſed fruition of God. The Jewiſh Scriptures teach them all this, though it tell them not many of the Articles of <hi>our</hi> Chriſtian Belief.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Chriſtian Goſpel is ſufficient <hi>in its own kind,</hi> to teach men firſt to <hi>believe aright,</hi> in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and then to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>live</hi> aright.</p>
               <p>When I ſay that each of theſe is ſufficient <hi>in its own kind,</hi> the meaning is, not that theſe outward means are of themſelves ſufficient without the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; for that were to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> not only <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> but <hi>in alieno vel in omni genere</hi>; not only for its <hi>own part and work</hi>; but for the <hi>Spirits part</hi> alſo: But other cauſes being ſuppoſed to concur, it is ſufficient for its own part: As my Pen is a ſufficient <hi>Pen,</hi> though it be not ſufficient to write without my hand.</p>
               <p>Now the meaſure of the Spirits concourſe with all theſe three degees of means is to be judged of by the <hi>nature</hi> of the means, and by <hi>Gods ends</hi> in appointing them, and by the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effects.</hi> And whereas the world is full of voluminous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about the doctrine of <hi>ſufficient</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> grace, I ſhall here add thus much in order to their agreement. 1. That certainly ſuch a thing there is, or hath been, as is called <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> not-effectual grace: By <hi>ſufficient</hi> they mean ſo much as giveth man all that <hi>Power</hi> which is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the commanded
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59417:209"/>
act (or forbearance) ſo that man <hi>could</hi> do it without any other grace or help from God (which ſuppoſeth that mans will in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, hath ſuch a vital, free, ſelf-determining power, that (ſometimes at leaſt) it can act, or not act, when ſuch bare power is given to it) and ſometimes doth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth not. But the word [<hi>neceſſary</hi>] is more proper than [<hi>ſufficient:</hi>] The latter being applicable to ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but [<hi>nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſary</hi>] ſignifieth that degree, without which the <hi>Act cannot</hi> be performed.</p>
               <p>That there is ſuch a thing, is evident in <hi>Adams</hi> caſe, who had that grace which was <hi>neceſſary</hi> to his forbearing the firſt ſin (or elſe farewell all Religion.) And there are few men will deny but that <hi>all men have</hi> ſtill ſuch a degree of help for <hi>many duties</hi> which they do not perform; and againſt <hi>many ſins</hi> which they do not forbear; (as to forbear an oath, or a lye, or a cup of drink, to go to Church when they go to an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, &amp;c.) Such a thing therefore there is, and ſuch a power mans will hath to do or not do, when ſuch a degree only of help is given.</p>
               <p>Therefore we have reaſon enough to ſuppoſe 1. That ſuch a <hi>degree</hi> of the <hi>Spirits help</hi> is given under the <hi>bare Teachings</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> or to them that have no <hi>outward light</hi> but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural revelation, as is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the foreſaid ends and uſes of that Light or Means, that is, to convince man that <hi>there is a God,</hi> and <hi>what he is,</hi> as aforeſaid, and that we are his <hi>ſubjects</hi> and <hi>ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>feſt love and ſervice,</hi> and to convince them of the need of ſome further <hi>ſupernatural revelation.</hi> Not that <hi>every</hi> one hath this meaſure of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> help; for ſome by abuſing the help which they have, to learn the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of Nature, or to practiſe it, do forfeit that help which ſhould bring them into <hi>Natures higher forms.</hi> But ſo much as I have mentioned of the help of the Spirit is given to thoſe that do not groſly forfeit it by abuſe, among the Pagans of the world: And ſo much multitudes have <hi>attained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſo much of the Spirit was given ordinarily to the Jews, as was ſufficient to have enabled them to believe in the Meſſiah to come, as aforeſaid; if they did not wilfully reject this help.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And ſo much ſeemeth to be given to <hi>many</hi> that hear
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59417:210"/>
the Goſpel, and never believe it; or that believe it not with a juſtifying Faith, is as ſufficient to have made them <hi>true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> as <hi>Adams</hi> was to have <hi>kept him from his fall.</hi> For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is certain that ſuch a <hi>ſufficient uneffectual grace there is,</hi> we have no reaſon to conceit that God doth any more deſert his own means <hi>now,</hi> than he did <hi>then</hi>; or that he maketh <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> a more <hi>impoſſible condition</hi> of Juſtification under the Goſpel, to them that are in the <hi>neereſt capacity of it</hi> (before effectual grace) than he made <hi>perfect obedience</hi> to be to <hi>Adam.</hi> The objections againſt this are to be anſwered in due place, and are already anſwered by the Dominicans at large.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>outward means</hi> of grace under Chriſt are <hi>all one frame,</hi> and muſt be uſed in <hi>harmony</hi> as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Witneſs and Preaching of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> was the firſt and chief part; together with their ſettling the Churches, and recording ſo much as is to be our ſtanding Rule in the holy Scriptures, which are now to us the chief part of this means.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next to the Scriptures, the <hi>Paſtoral Office</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi> to preſerve them, and teach them to us, is the next principal part of this frame of means. In which I comprehend <hi>all</hi> their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice [Preaching for converſion, baptizing, preaching for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and edification of the faithful, praying and praiſing God before the Church; adminiſtring the body and blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament of communion; and watching over all the flock, by perſonal inſtruction, admonition, reproofs, cenſures and abſolutions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next part (conjunct with this) is the communion of the faithful in the Churches.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next is our holy ſociety in Chriſtian families, and family-inſtructions, worſhip and juſt diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The next is our ſecret duties between God and us alone: As. 1. Reading, 2. Meditation, and ſelf examination, 3. Prayer and thankſgiving, and praiſe to God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The next part is our improvement of godly mens inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friendſhip, who may inſtruct, and warn, and reprove, and comfort us.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The next is the daily courſe of proſpering Providences and Mercies, which expreſs Gods Love, and call up ours;
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59417:210"/>
(as proviſions, protections, preſervations, deliverances, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p n="8">8. The next is Gods caſtigations (by what hand or means ſoever) which are to <hi>make us partakers of his holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The next is the examples of others; 1. Their graces and duties: 2. Their faults and falls: 3. Their mercies: And 4. Their ſufferings and corrections. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And laſtly, Our own conſtant watchfulneſs againſt temptations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtirring up Gods graces in our ſelves. Theſe are the frame of the means of Grace, and of our receiving duties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next in order to be conſidered, is the whole frame of our <hi>returning</hi> duties, in which we <hi>lay out</hi> the talents which we receive, which lye in the order following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we do what good we can to our own ſouls: that we firſt pluck the beam out of our own eyes, and ſet that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on work at home, which muſt go further: Therefore all the foregoing means were primarily for <hi>this effect</hi>; (though not chiefly and ultimately for this <hi>end.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next we muſt do good according to our power to our <hi>neer Relations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And next to our <hi>whole Families,</hi> and more remote Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And next, them to our Neighbours.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And next, to Strangers.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And laſtly, To Enemies, of our ſelves and Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But our <hi>greateſt</hi> duties muſt be for publick Societies, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. For the Common-wealth (both Governours and People,) 2. And for the Church.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And the next part (in intention and dignity) muſt be for the whole world (whoſe good by prayer and all juſt means we muſt endeavour.)</p>
               <p n="9">9. And the next for the honour of Jeſus Chriſt our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And the higheſt ultimate temination of our returning duties, is the pure Deity alone.</p>
               <p>For the further opening to you the Order of Chriſtian Practice, take theſe following Notes or Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:59417:211"/>1. Though receiving duties (ſuch as hearing, reading, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faith, &amp;c.) go firſt in order of nature and time, before <hi>expending,</hi> or <hi>returning</hi> duties, ſo that the motion is truly circular; yet we muſt not ſtay till we have <hi>received</hi> more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we make returns to God of that which we have already: But every degree of received grace, muſt preſently work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God our end: and as there is no intermiſſion between my moving of my hand and pen, and its writing upon this paper; ſo muſt there be no intermiſſion between <hi>Gods beams of Love</hi> and Mercy to us, and our <hi>reflexions of Love</hi> and Duty unto him. Even as ths <hi>veins</hi> and <hi>arteries</hi> in the body lye much together, and one doth often empty it ſelf into the other, for circulation, and not ſtay till the whole maſs hath run through all the veſſels of one ſort (veins or arteries) before any paſs into the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The internal <hi>returns</hi> of Love are much quicker than the return of outward fruits. The Love of God ſhed or ſtreamed forth upon the ſoul, doth <hi>preſently</hi> warm it to a return of <hi>Love:</hi> But it may be ſome <hi>time</hi> before that Love appear in any notable uſeful benefits to the world, or in any thing that much glorifieth God and our Profeſſion. Even as the heat of the Sun upon the earth or trees, is ſuddenly reflected; but doth not ſo ſuddenly bring forth herbs, and buds, and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, and ripe fruits.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All truly good works muſt have one conſtant Order of <hi>intention</hi> (which is before opened; <hi>God</hi> muſt be firſt intended, then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then the <hi>univerſal Church</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> &amp;c.) But in the order of <hi>operation</hi> and <hi>execution,</hi> there may be a great difference among our duties: As God appointeth us to lay out ſome one way, and ſome another. Yet ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as the <hi>emitted beams</hi> begin from God, and dart them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the ſoul of man; ſo the <hi>reflected beams</hi> begin upon, or from our <hi>hearts,</hi> and paſs toward God (though <hi>firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi> and intended) by ſeveral receptacles, before they bring us to the perfect fruition of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore the order of <hi>Loving</hi> (or complacency) and the order of <hi>doing good</hi> (or <hi>Benevolence</hi>) is not the ſame. We muſt <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>univerſal Church</hi> better than our <hi>ſelves:</hi> But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>do</hi> them ſincere <hi>ſervice,</hi> before we do good to our ſelves.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59417:211"/>
And our neereſt Relations muſt be preferred in acts of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence</hi> before many whom we muſt <hi>love</hi> more.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When two <hi>goods</hi> come together (either to be <hi>Received,</hi> or to be <hi>Done</hi>) the greater is ever to be preferred; and the <hi>chuſing</hi> or <hi>uſing</hi> of the leſſer at that time, is to be taken for a ſin. I lately read a denyal of this, in a ſuperficial ſatyre; but the thing it ſelf, if rightly underſtood, is paſt all doubt with a rational man. For 1. Elſe good is not to be <hi>choſen</hi> and <hi>done</hi> as <hi>good,</hi> if the <hi>beſt</hi> be not to be preferred. 2. Elſe almoſt all wicked omiſſions might be excuſed: I may be excuſed for not giving a poor man a ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lling (whatever his neceſſity be) becauſe I give him a farthing: No doubt but <hi>Dives, Luke</hi> 16. did good at ſuch a rate as this at leaſt: and elſe a man might be excuſed from ſaving a drowning man, if he ſave his horſe that while, &amp;c. <hi>A quatenus ad ſummum valet conſequentia,</hi> in the caſe of deſiring and doing good. But then mark the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing explications.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That is not alwaies to be accounted the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> which is ſo only in regard of the <hi>matter</hi> ſimply conſidered: But that is the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> which is ſo <hi>conſideratis conſideran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> all things conſidered and ſet together.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When God doth peremptorily tye me to one certain duty, without any diſpenſation or liberty of choice, that duty at that time is a <hi>greater good</hi> and duty, than many others which may be greater in their time and place. A duty <hi>materially</hi> leſſer, is <hi>formally</hi> (and by <hi>accident materially</hi>) greater in its proper ſeaſon. Reaping, and baking, and eating, are better than plowing, and weeding the Corn; as they are neerer to the end: But plowing, and weeding are better in their <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> To make pins or points, is not materially ſo good a work as to <hi>pray:</hi> But in its <hi>ſeaſon</hi> (as <hi>then done</hi>) it is <hi>better:</hi> And he that is of this trade, may not be praying when he ſhould be about his trade: Not that he is to prefer the <hi>matter of it,</hi> before praying; But <hi>praying</hi> is to keep its <hi>time,</hi> and may be a ſin when it is out of time. He that would come at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to diſturb his reſt, to preſent his ſervice to his Lord or King, would have little thanks for ſuch unſeaſonable ſervice.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He that is reſtrained by a lower calling, or any true
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59417:212"/>
reſtraining reaſons, from doing a good which is materially grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet doth that which is greateſt unto him. Ruling and Preaching are materially a greater good, than threſhing or digging; and yet to a man whoſe gifts and calling reſtrain him from the former to the latter, the latter is the greateſt good.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Good is not to be meaſured principally by the <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Benefit</hi> of our ſelves, or any creature; but by 1. The <hi>Will</hi> of God in his Laws: And 2. By the intereſt of his pleaſedneſs and glory: But <hi>ſecondarily, humane intereſt</hi> is the meaſure of it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It followeth not that becauſe the greateſt good is ever to be preferred, that therefore we muſt perplex and diſtract our ſelves, in caſes of difficulty, when the ballance ſeemeth equal: For either there <hi>is</hi> a <hi>difference,</hi> or there <hi>is none:</hi> And if <hi>any,</hi> it is <hi>diſcernable,</hi> or <hi>not.</hi> If there be <hi>no difference,</hi> there is room for <hi>taking one,</hi> but not for <hi>chuſing one</hi>: If there be no <hi>diſcernable</hi> difference, it is all one to us, as if there <hi>were none</hi> at all: If it be <hi>diſcernable</hi> by a due proportion of enquiry, we muſt labour to know it, and chuſe accordingly: If it be not <hi>diſcernable in ſuch time,</hi> and by <hi>ſuch meaſure of enquiry,</hi> as is <hi>our duty,</hi> we muſt ſtill take it as <hi>undiſcernable</hi> to us. If after <hi>juſt ſearch,</hi> the weakneſs of our own underſtandings leave us doubting, we muſt go according to the <hi>beſt underſtanding</hi> which we <hi>have,</hi> and chearfully go on in our duty, as well as we can know it, remembring that we have a gracious God and Covenant, which taketh not advantage of involuntary weakneſſes, but accepteth their endeavours, who ſincerely do their beſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Meer <hi>ſpiritual</hi> or <hi>mental</hi> duties require moſt labour of the <hi>mind</hi>; but <hi>corporal</hi> duties (ſuch as the labours of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) muſt have more labour of the <hi>body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. All <hi>corporal</hi> duties muſt be alſo <hi>ſpiritual</hi> (by doing them from a ſpiritual principle, to a ſpiritual end, in a ſpiritual manner:) But it is not neceſſary that every <hi>ſpiritual</hi> duty be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>corporal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. The duties immediately about <hi>God our end,</hi> are greater than thoſe about any of the <hi>means (caeteris paribus.)</hi> And yet thoſe that are about <hi>lower objects,</hi> may be greater by <hi>accident,</hi>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:59417:212"/>
and in their <hi>ſeaſon:</hi> As to be <hi>ſaving a mans life</hi> is then greater than to be exciting the mind to the acting of Divine <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Fear:</hi> But yet it is God the greateſt object then, which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>greatneſs</hi> upon the <hi>latter</hi> duty; both by <hi>commanding</hi> it, and ſo making it an act more <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him: and becauſe that the Love of God is ſuppoſed to be the concurring ſpring of that Love to man, which we ſhew in ſeeking their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Our great duty about God our ultimate end, can never be done too much, conſidered <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> and in reſpect to the <hi>ſoul only</hi>; we cannot ſo <hi>love God</hi> too much: And this <hi>Love</hi> ſo conſidered, hath no extream, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But yet even this may by <hi>accident,</hi> and in the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> be too <hi>much:</hi> As 1. In reſpect to the <hi>bodies</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; if a man ſhould ſo fear God, or ſo love him, as that the intenſeneſs of the act, did ſtir the paſſions, ſo much as to bring him to diſtraction, or to diſorder his mind, and make it unfit for that or any other duty: 2. Or if he ſhould be exciting the Love of God, when he ſhould be quenching a fire in the Town, or relieving the poor that are ready to periſh. But neither of theſe is properly called, <hi>A loving God too much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. The duties of the <hi>heart,</hi> are in themſelves greater and nobler than the actions of the outward man, of themſelves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly conſidered. Becauſe the ſoul is more noble than the body.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Yet <hi>outward duties</hi> are <hi>frequently,</hi> yea <hi>moſt frequently,</hi> greater than <hi>heart duties</hi> only; becauſe in the <hi>outward duty</hi> it is to be ſuppoſed that <hi>both parts</hi> concur (both <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body.</hi>) And the operations of <hi>both,</hi> is more than of <hi>one</hi> alone: and alſo becauſe the nobler ends are attained by both together more than by one only: For God is loved, and man is benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. As when the Sun ſhineth upon a tree, or on the earth, it is a more noble effect, to have a return of its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in ripe and pleaſant <hi>fruits,</hi> than in a meer ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of the heat alone.</p>
               <p n="18">18. All outward duties muſt begin at the heart, and it muſt animate them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they are valued in the ſight of God, no further than they come from a rectified will, even from the Love of God and Goodneſs: However without this, they
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59417:213"/>
are good works materially, in reſpect to the Receiver: He may do good to the Church, or Common-wealth, or Poor, who doth none to himſelf thereby.</p>
               <p n="19">19. As the motion is circular from God to man, and from man to God again (Mercies received; and Duties and Love returned) ſo is the motion circular between the <hi>heart</hi> and the <hi>outward man:</hi> The <hi>heart</hi> moving the <hi>tongue</hi> and <hi>hand, &amp;c.</hi> and theſe moving the <hi>heart</hi> again; (partly of their <hi>own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and partly by <hi>divine reward:</hi>) The <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> produceth holy <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>actions</hi>; and theſe again increaſe the Love which did produce them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. 2 <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>Jude</hi> 21.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The <hi>Judgment</hi> muſt be well informed before the <hi>Will</hi> reſolve.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Yet when God hath given us plain inſtruction, it is a ſin to cheriſh cauſleſs doubts and ſcruples.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And when we ſee our duty before us, it is not every ſcruple that will excuſe us from doing it: But, when we have <hi>more conviction</hi> that it is a <hi>duty,</hi> then that it is none, or that it is a ſin, we muſt do it, notwithſtanding thoſe miſtaking doubts. As if in Prayer or Alms-deeds you ſhould ſcruple the lawfulneſs of them, you ought not to forbear, till your ſcruples be reſolved, becauſe you ſo long neglect a duty: Elſe folly might juſtifie men in ungodlineſs and diſobedience.</p>
               <p n="23">23. But in things meerly indifferent, it is a ſin to do them doubtingly; becauſe you may be ſure it is no ſin to forbear them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="24">24. An erring Judgment intangleth a man in a neceſſity of ſinning (till it be reformed) whether he <hi>act</hi> or <hi>not</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to it. Therefore if an erring perſon ask, <hi>What am I bound to?</hi> the true anſwer is, to lay by your errour, or reform your Judgment firſt, and then to do accordingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if he ask an hundred times over [But what muſt I do in caſe I cannot change my Judgment?] the ſame anſwer muſt be given him, [<hi>God ſtill bindeth you to change your Judgment, and hath given you the neceſſary means of information; and therefore he will not take up with your ſuppoſition, that you cannot: His Law is a fixed Rule, which telleth you what you muſt believe, and chuſe, and do: And this Rule will not change, though you be blind, and ſay, I
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59417:213"/>
cannot change my mind. Your mind muſt come to the Rule, for the Rule will not come to your perverted mind: Say what you will, the Law of God will be ſtill the ſame, and will ſtill bind you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve according to its meaning.</hi>]</p>
               <p n="25">25. Yet ſuppoſing that a mans errour ſo entangleth him in a neceſſity of ſinning, it is a double ſin to prefer a <hi>greater</hi> ſin before a <hi>leſſer:</hi> For though no ſin is an object of our <hi>choice,</hi> yet the <hi>greater ſin</hi> is the object of our <hi>greater hatred</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal</hi>; and muſt be with the greater fear and care avoided.</p>
               <p n="26">26. An erring Conſcience then, is never the voice or meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of God, nor are we ever bound to follow it; becauſe it is neither our God, nor his Law, but only our own Judgment which ſhould <hi>diſcern</hi> his Law. And miſ-reading or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding the Law, will not make a <hi>bad</hi> cauſe <hi>good,</hi> though it may excuſe it from a greater degree of evil.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The judicious fixing of the <hi>Wills, Reſolutions,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the increaſing of its Love, or complacency and delight in good, is the chief thing to be done in all our duties, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart and life of all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26.12. &amp; 4.23. &amp; 7.3. &amp; 22.17. &amp; 3.1, 2, 3. &amp; 4.4, 21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4. &amp; 40.8. &amp; 119.16, 35, 70, 47. &amp; 1.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.14.</p>
               <p n="28">28. The grand motives to duty, muſt ever be before our eyes, and ſet upon our hearts, as the poiſe of all our motions and endeavours: (As the travelers home and buſineſs, is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in his mind, as the cauſe of every ſtep which he goeth.)</p>
               <p n="29">29. No price imaginable muſt ſeem great enough to hire us to commit the leaſt known ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. &amp; 14.26, 28, 33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.39<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 16.26.</p>
               <p n="30">30. The ſecond great means (next to the right forming of the heart) for the avoiding of ſin, is to get away from the <hi>temptations, baits</hi> and <hi>occaſions</hi> of it. And he that hath <hi>moſt grace,</hi> muſt take himſelf to be ſtill in great danger, while he is under <hi>ſtrong temptations</hi> and <hi>allurements,</hi> and when ſin is brought to his hands, and alluring objects are <hi>cloſe</hi> to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and ſenſes.</p>
               <p n="31">31. The keeping clean our <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and commanding our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> is the next great means for the avoiding ſin: and a polluted <hi>fantaſie,</hi> and ungoverned <hi>thoughts</hi> are the <hi>neſt</hi> where all iniquity is hatched, and the inſtruments that bring it forth into act.</p>
               <p n="32">
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:59417:214"/>32. The governing of the <hi>ſenſes</hi> is the firſt means to keep clean the <hi>Imagination.</hi> When <hi>Acha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſeeth</hi> the wedge of gold, he <hi>deſireth</hi> it, and then he <hi>taketh</hi> it. When men wilfully fill their eyes with the objects which entice them to luſt, to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, to wrath; the impreſſion is preſently made upon the fantaſie; and then the Devil hath abundance more power to renew ſuch imaginations a thouſand times, than if ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions had been never made. And it is a very hard thing to cleanſe the fantaſie which is once polluted.</p>
               <p n="33">33. And the next notable means of keeping out all evil <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and curing luſt and vanity of mind, is <hi>conſtant laborious diligence</hi> in a lawful calling, which ſhall allow the mind no leiſure for vain and ſinful thoughts; as the great nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſher of all foul and wicked thoughts, is <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and <hi>Vacancy,</hi> which inviteth the tempter, and giveth him time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p n="34">34.

               <p n="35">35. Affirmative Precepts, bind not to all times; that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no poſitive duty is a duty at all times. As to preach, to pray, to ſpeak of God, to think of holy things, &amp;c. it is not alwaies a ſin to intermit them.</p>
               <p n="36">36. All that God commandeth us to do, is both a <hi>Duty</hi> and a <hi>Means</hi>; it is called a <hi>Duty</hi> in relation to God the <hi>efficient</hi> Law-giver, firſt: and it is a <hi>Means</hi> next in relation to God the end, whoſe work is done, and whoſe will is <hi>pleaſed</hi> by it. And we muſt alwaies reſpect it in <hi>both</hi> theſe notions inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. No <hi>Duty</hi> is not a <hi>Means</hi>; and no <hi>true Means</hi> is not a <hi>Duty</hi>; but many ſeem to <hi>man</hi> to have the <hi>aptitude</hi> of a <hi>Means,</hi> which are no duty but a ſin; becauſe we ſee not all things, and therefore are apt to think that fit, which is pernicious.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Therefore nothing muſt be thought a true <hi>Means</hi> to any good end, which God forbiddeth: For God knoweth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we.</p>
               <p n="38">38. But we muſt ſee that the negative or prohibition be <hi>univerſal,</hi> or indeed extendeth to our particular caſe: and
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59417:214"/>
then (and not elſe) you may ſay that negatives bind to all times.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Nothing which is certainly deſtructive to the end, and contrary to the nature of a <hi>Means,</hi> is to be taken for a <hi>Duty.</hi> For it is certain that Gods Commands are for edification, and not for deſtruction, for good, and not for evil.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Yet that may tend to preſent inferiour hurt, which ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately tendeth to the greateſt good. Therefore it is not ſome preſent or inferiour incommodity that muſt cauſe us to reject ſuch a means of greater future good.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Whatſoever we are <hi>certain</hi> God <hi>commandeth,</hi> we may be certain is a proper <hi>Means,</hi> though we ſee not the aptitude, or may think it to be deſtructive; becauſe God knoweth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we: But then we muſt indeed be ſure that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in this caſe and place, and time, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p n="42">42. It is one of the moſt needful things to our innocency, to have Chriſtian wiſdom to compare the various accidents of thoſe <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>ſins</hi> which are ſuch by accident; and to judge which accidents do preponderate. For indeed the actions are very few which are abſolutely and ſimply <hi>duties</hi> or <hi>ſins</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered, without thoſe accidents which qualifie them to be ſuch: Accidental <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>ſins</hi> are the moſt numerous by far: And in many caſes the difficulty of comparing the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious accidents, and contrary motives, is not ſmall,</p>
               <p n="43">43. Therefore it is, that (as in Phyſick and Law Caſes, &amp;c. the common people have greateſt need of the advice of skilful Artiſts, to help them to judge of particular Caſes, taking in all the circumſtances, which their narrow underſtandings cannot comprehend; which is more of the uſe of Phyſicians and Lawyers, than to read a publick Lecture of Phyſick, or of Law, ſo) the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Church-Guides,</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> is of ſo great neceſſity to the people, in every <hi>particular Church:</hi> And that not only for publick Preaching, but alſo to be at hand, to help the people, who have recourſe unto them in all ſuch caſes, to know in particular what is <hi>duty,</hi> and what is <hi>ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="44">44. And therefore it is (beſides other reaſons) that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Biſhops or Paſtors of the Churches, muſt in all the proper parts of it, be done only by themſelves, or men in that
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59417:215"/>
Office, and not <hi>per alios, by men of another Office:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that bare <hi>titles</hi> or <hi>authority</hi> will not ſerve the turn, without proportionable or neceſſary abilities or gifts; becauſe the work is done by <hi>perſonal fitneſs</hi>; and caſes and difficulties can no more be reſolved, nor ſafe counſel given for the <hi>ſoul</hi> in matters of <hi>Morality,</hi> by men unable, than for the <hi>body</hi> or <hi>eſtate,</hi> in points of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or of <hi>Law.</hi> (As the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> in his Conſiderations of Eccleſiaſtical Government hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.)</p>
               <p n="45">45. In ſuch caſes where <hi>duty</hi> or <hi>ſin</hi> muſt be judged of by compared <hi>accidents</hi>; the nature of a <hi>Means,</hi> or the intereſt of the <hi>End,</hi> is the principal thing to be conſidered: And that which will <hi>evidently do more harm than good,</hi> is not to be judged a duty (in thoſe circumſtances) but a ſin: as if the queſtion were whether <hi>Preaching</hi> be at this <hi>time,</hi> in this <hi>place,</hi> to this <hi>number,</hi> to theſe <hi>individuals,</hi> a duty: If it appear to true Chriſtian prudence, that it would be like to do more <hi>hurt</hi> than <hi>good,</hi> it is a ſin at that time, and not a duty: and yet Preaching in due ſeaſon, as great a duty ſtill. So if the queſtion were, whether <hi>ſecret prayer</hi> be at this hour or day, a duty: If true reaſon tell you, that it is like to hinder, either family-prayer, or any other greater good, it is not at that time a duty: Or if the queſtion be, whether reproof or perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of a ſinner be now a duty: If true reaſon tell me, that it is like to do more harm than good, it is not a duty then, but accidentally a ſin: For we muſt not caſt pearls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Swine, nor give that which is holy unto Dogs, leſt they tread it under foot, or turn again and all to rend us. And there is a time when Preachers that are perſecuted in one City, muſt fly to another; and when they muſt ſhake off the duſt of their feet, for a witneſs againſt the diſobedient, and turn away from them. (The imprudent people can eaſily diſcern this when it is their own caſe, but not when it is the Preachers caſe; ſo powerful is ſelf-love and partiality) <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6, 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.14. &amp; 23.34. &amp; 10.23. The reaſon of all this is 1. Becauſe God appointeth all <hi>Means</hi> for the <hi>End</hi>: 2. And becauſe the Law by which in ſuch caſes we muſt be ruled, is only <hi>general</hi>; as, <hi>Let all things be done to edification</hi>; as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Fit all your actions, which I have not given you a particular peremptory

               <p n="47">47. Yet when the <hi>private</hi> neceſſity is more <hi>preſſing,</hi> and the publick may be omitted at that time with leſs detriment, the caſe doth alter. As alſo when that <hi>one</hi> that we do good to is <hi>more worth</hi> than the <hi>many,</hi> in order to the honour of God, or the <hi>more publick</hi> good of the whole ſociety: or when it is one that by ſpecial precept, we are obliged to prefer in our beneficence</p>

But what it is that is <hi>proper</hi> to each power, I ſhall tell them when I think they are willing to know, and it will do more good than harm to tell it them.</p>
               <p n="49">49. The <hi>ſupreme Magiſtrate</hi> is ever to be obeyed before his <hi>Inferiours:</hi> becauſe they have no power but from him; and therefore have none <hi>againſt him</hi> (unleſs he ſo give it them.)</p>

               <p n="51">51. No Humane Power can bind us to the deſtruction of the ſociety which it governeth; becauſe the publick or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, is the <hi>end</hi> of Government.</p>
               <p n="52">52. The Laws of Kings, and the Commands of Parents, Maſters and Paſtors (in caſes where they have true Authority) do bind the <hi>ſoul</hi> primarily, as well as the <hi>body,</hi> ſecondarily: But not as the <hi>primary,</hi> but the <hi>ſecondary bond.</hi> It is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pittiful thing, to read Divines upon this point [Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Laws of men do bind the conſcience?] what work they have made as in the dark, when the caſe is ſo very plain and eaſie? ſome are peremptory that they do not bind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and ſome that they do; and ſome calling their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries the Idolizers of men; and others again inſinuating that they we guilty of treaſon againſt Kings, who do gainſay

               <p n="1">1. The very phraſe of their queſtion is non-ſenſe, or very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. <hi>Conſcience</hi> is but a mans <hi>knowledge</hi> or judgment of himſelf as he is obliged to his duty and the effects; and conſequently, of the obligations, which lie upon him.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrange queſtion, whether I am bound in <hi>knowledge of my ſelf:</hi> But it were a reaſonable queſtion, whether I be bound to <hi>know</hi>; or whether I <hi>know</hi> that I am bound. It is the <hi>whole man,</hi> and moſt eminently the <hi>Will,</hi> which is bound by Laws, or any Moral Obligations. The <hi>man</hi> is bound.</p>
               <p>But if by <hi>conſcience,</hi> they mean the <hi>ſoul,</hi> it is a ridiculous queſtion: For no bonds can lie upon the body immediately, but Cords or Iron, or ſuch like materials. The <hi>ſoul</hi> is the firſt obliged, or elſe the man is not morally obliged at all.</p>
               <p>If the ſenſe of the queſtion be, whether it be a <hi>Divine</hi> or a <hi>Religious</hi> obligation, which mens commands do lay upon us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The anſwer is eaſie: 1.

That <hi>Mans Government is Gods inſtitution, and Men are Gods Officers</hi>; and therefore the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is <hi>Religious,</hi> and <hi>Inſtrumentally</hi> or <hi>Mediately Divine.</hi> Either mens Laws and Commands do bind us or not: If not, they are no Laws, nor authoritative Acts: If they do bind, either it is <hi>primarily</hi> by an authority <hi>originally</hi> in themſelves that made them (and then they are <hi>all gods:</hi> And then there is <hi>no God.</hi>) Or elſe it is by <hi>derived authority.</hi> If ſo, <hi>God muſt</hi> be the <hi>Original</hi> (or ſtill the <hi>Original</hi> muſt be <hi>God.</hi>) And then is the high way any plainer than the true anſwer of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Princes, Parents, &amp;c. have a governing or Law-giving power from God, in ſubordination to him; and that they are his Officers in governing: And that all thoſe Laws which he hath authorized them to make do bind the ſoul, that is, the man, immediately as <hi>humane,</hi> and <hi>inſtrumentally</hi> or mediately as <hi>Divine,</hi> or as the bonds of God. As my Covenant bind my ſelf to <hi>conſcience,</hi> (if you will ſo ſpeak, rather than that they bind my conſcience) ſo do men a Laws alſo bind me.

               <p n="53">53. To conclude theſe Rules, as the juſt impreſs of the

Spirit, and Image of God upon the ſoul, is Divine <hi>Life, Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> communicated from God by Jeſus Chriſt, by the holy Spirit, to work in us and by us for God (in the ſoul and in the world) and by Chriſt to bring us up at laſt, to the ſight and fruition of God himſelf; ſo this Trinity of Divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, muſt be inſeparably uſed, in all our internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duties towards God or men; and all that we do muſt be the work of <hi>Power</hi> and of <hi>Love,</hi> and of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> or a <hi>ſound mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Having been ſo large in opening the Order of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I muſt be briefer than our caſe requireth, in telling you our <hi>Diſorders,</hi> or contrary diſeaſe.

They find little <hi>melody</hi> in their Religion, becauſe there is little <hi>harmony</hi> in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, affections or converſations. If the diſplacing one wheel or pin in a clock, will ſo much fruſtrate the effect, it is a wonder that our tongues or lives do ever go true, which are moved by ſuch diſordered parts within: that were it not that the Spirit of grace doth keep an order where it is eſſential to our Religion (between the <hi>End</hi> and the <hi>Means,</hi> &amp;c.) we ſhould be but like the parts of a watch pulled in pieces, and put up together in a bag. But ſuch is Gods mercy, that the body may live when many ſmaller veins are obſtructed; ſo that the Maſter veſſels be kept clear.</p>
               <p n="1">I. There are ſo few Chriſtians that have a true <hi>method</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Divinity</hi> in their <hi>underſtandings,</hi> even in the great points which they <hi>know diſorderly,</hi> that it is no wonder if there be lamentable defectiveneſs and deformity, in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward duties, which ſhould be harmoniouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by the light of this harmonious truth. And no Divine in the world can give you a <hi>perfect Scheme</hi> of Divinity in all the parts; but he is the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> that cometh <hi>neereſt</hi> to it. Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Schemes and Tables you may ſee, and all pretending to exactneſs: But every one palpably defective and confuſed; even thoſe of the higheſt pretenders that ever I have ſeen. And one <hi>errour</hi> or <hi>diſorder</hi> uſually introduceth, in ſuch a Scheme, a

confuſion in all that followeth as dependant on it.</p>
               <p>Some confound Gods Attributes themſelves (nay who doth not:) They confound the <hi>Three great Eſſential Principles,</hi> with all the <hi>Attributes,</hi> by ſimilitude called <hi>Modal</hi> and <hi>Negative:</hi> and they uſe to name over Gods Attributes, like as they put their money or cheſs-men into a bag, without any method at all.</p>
               <p>Some confound Gods Primary Attributes of <hi>Being,</hi> with his <hi>Relations,</hi> which are ſubſequent to his <hi>Works,</hi> and with his <hi>Relation-Attributes.</hi>

               <p>Some confound his ſeveral <hi>Relations</hi> to <hi>man,</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and more do confound his <hi>Works,</hi> as they flow from theſe various Relations.</p>
               <p>The great works of the <hi>Creator, Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> and their ſeveral deſigns, ſignifications, and effects, are opened obſcurely and in much confuſion.</p>

               <p>And ſo are the Orders of his <hi>Precepts, Promiſes,</hi> and penal <hi>Threats,</hi> and the <hi>Conditions</hi> of his Promiſes: and the order of his Precepts among themſelves; and of his Promiſes as one reſpecteth another.</p>
               <p>And <hi>our Relations</hi> to God, and the ſeveral reſpective <hi>duties</hi> of thoſe Relations, are ordinarily much confounded.</p>
               <p>The work of the Holy Ghoſt (as we are baptized into the belief of him) is poorly, lamely and diſorderly opened, to the encouraging of the <hi>carnal</hi> on one hand, or the Enthuſiaſts on the other.</p>

becauſe they are things that all men know, and common unto you with the moſt of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In your love to the godly, and your charity, in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and in your daily prayers, what lameneſs and partiality is there? Thoſe that are <hi>neer</hi> you, and converſant with you, you remember; and perhaps thoſe in the Kingdom, or Countrey where you dwell: Or at leaſt thoſe of your own ſociety, opinions and party. But when it cometh to praying for the <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>all the Church abroad</hi>; and when it cometh to the loving of thoſe that <hi>differ</hi> from you, what partiality do you ſhew?</p>

Therefore the duties of inward <hi>ſelf-denial, humility, mortification,</hi> and <hi>heavenlineſs,</hi> are almoſt left out in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the moſt.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. I ſhall be brief alſo in telling you what Inferences to raiſe from hence for your inſtruction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You may learn hence how to anſwer the queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Gods Graces live and grow in an equal proportion in all true Believers. I need to give you no further proof of the negative, than I have laid down before: I once thought otherwiſe; and was wont to ſay, as it is commonly ſaid, that in the <hi>habit</hi> they are proportionable, but not in the <hi>act.</hi> But this was becauſe I underſtood not the difference between the <hi>particular habits,</hi> and the <hi>firſt radical</hi> power, inclination or
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:59417:223"/>
habit (which I name that the Reader may chuſe his title, that we may not quarrel about meer words.) The firſt <hi>Principle</hi> of Holineſs in us, is called in Scripture, <hi>The Spirit of Chriſt or of God:</hi> In the unity of this are three eſſential principles, <hi>Life, Light</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>; which are the immediate effects of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly or divine influx upon the three natural faculties of the ſoul, to rectifie them, <hi>viz.</hi> on the <hi>Vital Power,</hi> the <hi>Intellect</hi> and the <hi>Will:</hi> And are called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the Sunſhine in the room is called, the <hi>Sun:</hi> Now as the Sunſhine on the earth and plants, is all one in it ſelf as emitted from the Sun, <hi>Light, Heat</hi> and <hi>Moving</hi> force concurring, and yet is not <hi>equally ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,</hi> becauſe of the difference of <hi>Recipients</hi>; and yet every vegetative receiveth a real effect of the <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> at the leaſt; and ſenſitives alſo of the <hi>Light</hi>; but ſo that one may (by incapacity) have leſs of the <hi>heat,</hi> and another leſs of the <hi>motion,</hi> and another leſs of the <hi>Lght</hi>; ſo I conceive that <hi>Wiſdom, Love</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> (or <hi>Power</hi>) are given by the Spirit to every Chriſtian: But ſo that in the very firſt <hi>Principle</hi> or effect of the Spirit, one may have more <hi>Light,</hi> another more <hi>Love,</hi> and another more <hi>Life:</hi> Bus this it accidental from ſome obſtruction in the <hi>Receiver</hi>; otherwiſe the Spirit would be <hi>equally</hi> a <hi>Spirit of Power</hi> (or <hi>Life</hi>) and of <hi>Love,</hi> and of a <hi>ſound mind</hi> (or <hi>Light.</hi>)</p>
               <p>But beſides this <hi>New Moral Power,</hi> or <hi>Inclination,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Radical Habit,</hi> there are abundance of <hi>particular Habits</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> much more properly called <hi>Habits,</hi> and leſs properly called the Vital or Potential Principles of the New Creature: There is a <hi>particular Habit</hi> of <hi>Humility,</hi> and another of <hi>Peaceableneſs,</hi> of <hi>Gentleneſs,</hi> of <hi>Patience,</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>one another,</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>Word</hi> of God; and many habits of Love to ſeveral truths and duties: a habit of <hi>deſire,</hi> yea <hi>many,</hi> as there are many different objects deſired; there is a habit of praying, of meditating, of thankſgiving, of mercy, of chaſtity, of temperance, of diligence, &amp;c. The acts would not vary as they do, if there were not a variety and diſpoſition in theſe <hi>Habits</hi>; which appear to us only in <hi>their acts.</hi> We muſt go againſt Scripture, reaſon, and the manifold hourly experience of our ſelves, and all the Chriſtians in the world, if we will ſay that all theſe graces and duties are <hi>equal</hi> in the <hi>Habit</hi> in every Chriſtian. How impotent are ſome in bridling a paſſion, or
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59417:224"/>
bridling the tongue, or in controlling pride and ſelf-eſteem, or or in denying the particular deſires of their ſenſe, who yet are ready at many other duties, and eminent in them. Great knowledge is too oft with too little <hi>charity</hi> or zeal; and great zeal and diligence often with as little knowledge. And ſo in many other inſtances.</p>
               <p>So that if the <hi>Potentiality</hi> of the radical graces of <hi>Life, Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> be or were equal, yet certainly proper and <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar habits</hi> are not.</p>
               <p>But here note further, 1. That <hi>no grace</hi> is <hi>ſtrong</hi> where the <hi>radical graces, Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are weak: As no part of the <hi>body</hi> is ſtrong, where the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> are weak; (yea or the naturals, the ſtomach and liver.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtrength of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>principal</hi> means of ſtrengthening all other graces; and of right performing all other duties.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet are they not alone a <hi>ſufficient means,</hi> but other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> may be weak and neglected, where <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are ſtrong; through particular obſtructing cauſes. As ſome branches of the tree may periſh when the root is ſound; or ſome members may have an Atrophie, though the brain and heart be not diſeaſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the three Principles, <hi>Life, Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> do moſt rarely keep any diſproportion; and would never be diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable at all, if ſome things did not hinder the <hi>actings</hi> of one more than the other, or turn away the ſoul from the influences and impreſſions of the Spirit more as to one than to the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence you may learn, <hi>That the Image of God is much clearlier and perfectlier imprinted in the holy Scriptures, than in any of our hearts. And that our Religion objectively conſidered, is much more perfect, than ſubjectively in us.</hi> In Scripture, and in the true doctrinal method our Religion is <hi>entire, perfect</hi> and <hi>compleat.</hi> But in <hi>it,</hi> it is <hi>confuſed, lame</hi> and lamentably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. The Sectaries that here ſay, <hi>None of the Spirits works are imperfect,</hi> are not to be regarded: For ſo they may as well ſay, that there are none infants, diſeaſed, lame, diſtracted, poor, or monſters in the world; becauſe none of Gods works are imperfect. All that is in God is God, and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59417:224"/>
and all that is <hi>done</hi> by God is perfect as to <hi>his ends,</hi> and as it is a part in the frame of his own means to that end which man underſtandeth not: But many things are <hi>imperfect</hi> in the <hi>receiving ſubject.</hi> If not, why ſhould any man ever ſeek to be wiſer or better than he was in his infancy, or at the worſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore we here ſee that the <hi>Spirit in the Scripture is the Rule by which we muſt try the Spirit in our ſelves, or any other.</hi> The Fanaticks or Enthuſiaſts, who ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l againſt us, for trying the Spirit by the Scriptures, when as the Spirit was the Author of the Scriptures, do but rave in the dark, and know not what they ſay. For the Eſſence of the Spirit is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; and it is the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in both which we muſt compare: The Spirit is never contrary to it ſelf: And ſeeing it is the <hi>Sunſhine</hi> which we here call the <hi>Sun,</hi> the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is but, <hi>where</hi> it <hi>ſhineth</hi> moſt? whether in the Scripture, or in our hearts? The Spirit in the Apoſtles indited the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to be the Rule of our faith and life unto the end: The Spirit in us doth <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>help</hi> us to underſtand and to obey thoſe Scriptures. Was not the Spirit in a greater meaſure in the Apoſtles, than in us? Did it not work more compleatly, and unto more infallibility in their writing the Scriptures, than it doth in our <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and obeying them? Is not the ſeal perfect, when the impreſſion is oft imperfect? Doth not the Maſter write his Copy more perfectly, than his Scholars imitation is, though he teach him, yea and hold his hand? He that knoweth not the Religious diſtractions of this age, will blame me for troubling the Reader with the confutation of ſuch dreams: But ſo will not they that have ſeen and taſted their effects.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence we may learn that <hi>he that would know what the Chriſtian Religion is indeed</hi> (to the honour of God, or their own juſt information) <hi>muſt rather look into the Scripture to know it, than into Believers.</hi> For though in Believers it be more <hi>diſcernable in the kind</hi> (as mens lives are more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous than Laws and Precepts, and the impreſs than the ſeal, &amp;c.) yet it is in the Laws or Scriptures more <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> when in the <hi>beſt</hi> of Chriſtians (much more in the <hi>moſt</hi>) it is broken, maimed and confuſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This telleth us the reaſon why it is unſafe to make any
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:59417:225"/>
men (Popes, or Councils, or the holieſt Paſtors, or ſtricteſt people) the Rule either of our <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>lives.</hi> Becauſe they are all imperfect and diſcordant, when the Scripture is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant and compleat. He that is led by them, may erre, when as the Scripture hath no errour. And yet it is certain, that even the <hi>imperfect knowledge</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of faithful Paſtors and companions, is of great uſe to thoſe that are more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than they, to teach them the Scriptures, which are more perfect than they all.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence we ſee why it is, that Religion bringeth ſo much <hi>trouble,</hi> and ſo little comfort to the moſt, or too many that are in part Religious. Becauſe it is lame and confuſed in them. Is it any wonder that a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſplaced bone is painful? or that a diſordered body is ſick, and hath no great pleaſure in life? or that a diſordered or maimed watch or clock, doth not go right? O what a life of pleaſure ſhould we live, if we were but ſuch as the Scripture doth require! and the Religion in our hearts and lives were fully agreeable with the Religion deſcribed in the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And hence we ſee why moſt true Chriſtians are ſo <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous,</hi> and have alwaies ſomewhat to complain of and lament; which the ſenſleſs, or ſelf-juſtifying hypocrites overlook in themſelves. No wonder if ſuch diſeaſed ſouls complain.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And hence we ſee why there is ſuch <hi>diverſity</hi> and <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> among Believers, and ſuch abundance of Sects and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Contentions, and ſo little Unity, Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. And why all attempts for Unity take ſo little in the Church. Becauſe they have all ſuch weakneſs, and diſtempers, and lameneſs, and confuſedneſs, and great diſproportions in their Religion. Do you wonder why he liveth not in peace, and concord, and quietneſs with others, who hath no better agreement in himſelf? and no more compoſedneſs and true peace rt home? Mens grace and parts are much unequal.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And hence we ſee why there are ſo many <hi>ſcandals</hi> among Chriſtians, to the great diſhonour of true Chriſtianity, and the great hinderance of the converſion of the Infidel, Heathen and ungodly world: What wonder if ſome diſorder, falſhood, and confuſion appear without, in words and deeds, when there is ſo much ever dwelling in the mind?</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:59417:225"/>10. Laſtly, Hence we may learn what to expect from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, and what to look for alſo publickly, in the Church, and in the world. He that knoweth what <hi>man</hi> is, and what <hi>godly men</hi> are, but as well as I do, will hardly expect a concordant uniform building to be made of ſuch diſcordant and uneven materials; or that a ſet of ſtrings, which are all, or almoſt all out of tune, ſhould make any harmonious melody; or that a number of Infants ſhould conſtitute an Army of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men; or that a company that can ſcarce ſpell, or read, ſhould conſtitute a learned Academy. God muſt make a change upon individual perſons, if ever he will make a great change in the Church. They muſt be more <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> Chriſtians, who muſt make up that happy Church ſtate, and ſettle that amiable peace, and ſerve God in that concordant harmony as all of us deſire, and ſome expect.</p>

They are much in danger of thoſe ſins, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to which are <hi>neer,</hi> and <hi>importunate,</hi> and <hi>conſtant,</hi> and for which they have the greateſt <hi>opportunities:</hi> They have <hi>ſenſes</hi> and <hi>appetites</hi> as well as others: And if the bait be <hi>great,</hi> and

               <p n="2">2. They are in danger of thoſe ſins which they <hi>little think</hi> of; for it is a ſign that they are not forewarned and fortified; nor have they <hi>overcome that ſin</hi>; for victory here is never got at ſo cheap a rate: eſpecially as to <hi>inward ſins:</hi> If it have not coſt you many a groan, and many a daies diligence, to conquer <hi>ſelfiſhneſs, pride</hi> and <hi>appetite</hi>; it's twenty to one they are not conquered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are much in danger of thoſe ſins which they <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate,</hi> and count to be <hi>ſmaller</hi> than they are. For indeed their hearts are infected already, by thoſe falſe and favourable thoughts. And they are prepared to entertain a neerer fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with them. Men are eaſily tempted upon a danger which ſeemeth ſmall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are much in danger of thoſe ſins, which their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> and temperature of <hi>body</hi> doth encline them to; and therefore muſt here keep a double watch. No ſmall part of the puniſhment of our Original ſin (both as from <hi>Adam,</hi> and from our neereſt Parents) is found in the <hi>ill complexion</hi> of our bodies: The <hi>temperature</hi> of ſome inclineth them vehemently to <hi>paſſion</hi>; and of others unto <hi>luſt</hi>; and of others to <hi>ſloth</hi> and <hi>dulneſs</hi>: and of others to <hi>guloſity,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>grace</hi> doth not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately change this diſtemper of the complexion; but only watch over it, and keep it under, and abate it conſequently, by contrary actions, and mental diſpoſitions: Therefore we ſhall have here unceſſant work, while we are in the body. Though yet the power of grace by long and faithful uſe, will bring the very ſenſe, and imagination, and paſſions into ſo much calmneſs, as to be far leſs raging, and eaſily ruled: As a well ridden horſe will obey the Rider; and even dogs and other bruits will ſtrive but little againſt our government: And then our work will grow more eaſie: For as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Maxima pars libertatis eſt bene moratus venter: A good condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed belly is a great part of a mans liberty:</hi> meaning, an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned belly is a great part of mens ſlavery: And the ſame may be ſaid of all the ſenſes, fantaſie and paſſions in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective places.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are much in danger of the ſins which our <hi>callings,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:59417:228"/>
trades</hi> and <hi>worldly intereſt,</hi> do moſt and conſtantly tempt us to. Every man hath a <hi>carnal intereſt,</hi> which is his great temptation; and every wiſe man will know it, and there ſet a double watch. The carnal intereſt of a Preacher, is applauſe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment: The carnal intereſt of Rulers and great men, I ſhall paſs by; but they muſt not paſs it by themſelves. The carnal intereſt of Lawyers and Tradeſmen, is their gain, &amp;c. Here we muſt keep a conſtant watch.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We are much in danger of thoſe ſins, the <hi>matter</hi> of which is ſomewhat <hi>good</hi> or <hi>lawful,</hi> and the danger lyeth only in the <hi>manner, circumſtances</hi> or <hi>degree.</hi> For there the <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the <hi>matter,</hi> occaſioneth men to forget the <hi>accidental evil.</hi> The whole Kingdom feeleth the miſchief of this, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which I will now paſs by. If <hi>eating</hi> ſuch or ſuch a meat were not lawful it ſelf, men would not be ſo eaſily drawn to gluttony. If drinking wine were not a lawful thing, the paſſage to drunkenneſs were not ſo open: The apprehenſion that a luſory lot is a lawful thing (as Cards, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce, &amp;c.) doth occaſion the heinous ſin of time-waſting, and eſtate-waſting gameſters. If apparel were not lawful, exceſs would not be ſo eaſily endured. Yea the goodneſs of Gods own Worſhip, quieteth many in its great abuſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We are much in danger of thoſe ſins, which are not in any great <hi>diſgrace</hi> among thoſe perſons whom we <hi>moſt honour</hi> and eſteem. It is a great mercy to have ſin lie under a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon odium</hi> and diſgrace: As <hi>ſwearing</hi> and <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> and <hi>curſing,</hi> and <hi>fornication,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh errours,</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> is now amongſt the forwardeſt Profeſſors in <hi>England:</hi> For here conſcience is moſt <hi>awakened,</hi> and helped by the opinion of men; or if there be ſome carnal reſpect to our reputation in it ſometimes, yet it tendeth to ſuppreſs the ſin; And it is a great plague to live where any <hi>great</hi> ſin is in <hi>little</hi> diſgrace (as the prophanation of the Lords day in moſt of the Reformed Churches beyond <hi>Sea</hi>; and they ſay, tipling, if not drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Germany</hi>; and as <hi>backbiting</hi> and <hi>evil ſpeaking</hi> againſt thoſe that <hi>differ</hi> from them is among the Profeſſors in <hi>England,</hi> for too great a part; and alſo many ſuperſtitions of their own; and dividing principles and practices.)</p>
               <p n="8">8. But eſpecially if the <hi>greater number of godly people</hi> live in ſuch a ſin, then is the temptation great indeed; and it is but
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:59417:229"/>
few of the weaker ſort, that are not carryed down that ſtream. The <hi>Munſter</hi> caſe, and the Rebellion in which <hi>Munſter</hi> periſhed in <hi>Germany,</hi> and many other; but eſpecially abundance of <hi>Schiſms</hi> from the Apoſtles daies till now, are too great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of mens ſociableneſs in ſinning. <hi>We all like ſheep have gone aſtray, and turned every one to his own way,</hi> Iſa. 53 6. And like <hi>ſheep</hi>

                  </gap>n this, that if one that is leading, get over the hedge, all the reſt will follow after; but eſpecially if the <hi>greater part</hi> be gone. And do not think that our Churches are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and that the greater part of the godly cannot erre, or be in the wrong: For that would be but to do as the Papiſts, when we have <hi>ſinned</hi> by <hi>fallibility,</hi> to keep off repentance by the conceit of <hi>infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. We are in great danger of <hi>ſinning,</hi> in caſes where we are <hi>ignorant:</hi> For who can avoid the danger which he ſeeth not? And who can walk ſafely in the dark? Therefore we ſee that it is the <hi>ignor anter</hi> ſort of Chriſtians, and ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Novices,</hi> that moſt erre; eſpecially when <hi>Pride</hi> accompanyeth Ignorance, for then they fall into the ſpecial condemnation of the Devil, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. Study therefore painfully and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently till you underſtand the truth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But above all, we are in danger of thoſe ſins which are <hi>masked with a pretence of the greateſt truths and duties, and uſe to be fathered on God and Scripture; and ſo under the ſpecious titles of Holineſs and of Free Grace.</hi> For here it is the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> chiefly that reſiſteth, while the very names and pretences ſecretly ſteal in, and bring them into love and reverence with the <hi>Will.</hi> And the poor honeſt Chriſtian is afraid of reſiſting them, leſt it ſhould prove a reſiſting God. What can be ſo falſe that a man will not plead for, if he take it to be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary truth of God? And what can be ſo bad that a man will not do, if he take it once to be of Gods commanding? The foreſaid inſtances of the <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Germane</hi> actions, with thoſe of the followers of <hi>David George</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> (who took himſelf to be the Holy Ghoſt, or the immediate Prophet of his Kingdom) and <hi>Hacket</hi> and his Grundletonians, and the Familiſts, the Ranters, the Seekers, the Quakers, the Church-dividers, and the Kingdom and State-overturners in <hi>England,</hi> have given ſo great a demonſtration of this, that it is not
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:59417:229"/>
lawful to overlook it or forget it. <hi>The time cometh, that they that kill you, ſhall think that they do God ſervice,</hi> Joh. 16.2. And then who can expect that their conſciences ſhould avoid it? Why did <hi>Paul</hi> perſecute the Chriſtians, and compel them to blaſpheme? Becauſe he verily thought that he ought to do many things againſt the Name of Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9. O it is religious ſins which we are in danger of! ſuch as come to us as in the Name of God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit: ſuch as pretend that we cannot be ſaved without them: and ſuch as plead the holy Scriptures: ſuch as <hi>James</hi> 3. is written againſt, when a <hi>wiſdom from beneath,</hi> which is <hi>earthly, ſenſual and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh,</hi> working by <hi>envy and ſtrife, unto confuſion and every evil work,</hi> pretendeth to be the <hi>wiſdom from above:</hi> when <hi>Zeal</hi> conſumeth <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> under pretence of <hi>conſuming ſin:</hi> which made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> require us not to <hi>believe every ſpirit, but to try the ſpirits whether they be of God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.2. &amp; 1 Theſ. 5.20, 21. 1 Joh. 4.1, 2, 3. And made <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>If an Angel from Heaven bring you another Goſpel, let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> Gal. 1.7, 8. And more plainly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14. <hi>Such are falſe Apoſtles; deceitful workers; transforming themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Apoſtles of Chriſt: and no marvel, for Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of light: therefore it is no great thing if his Miniſters alſo be transformed as the Miniſters of righteouſneſs, whoſe end ſhall be according to their works.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30. <hi>Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them.</hi> And what need any Diſciple of Chriſt greater warning, than to remember that their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf was thus aſſaulted by the Devil in his temptation, with [<hi>It is written.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Yet let no Papiſt hence take occaſion to vilifie the <hi>Scripture,</hi> becauſe it is made a plea for ſin: For ſo he might as well vilifie <hi>humane Reaſon,</hi> which is pleaded for all the errours in the world; and vilifie the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe Lawyers plead it for <hi>ill Cauſes</hi>; yea and vilifie <hi>God</hi> himſelf, becauſe the ſame and other ſinners plead his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> for their ſins: when contrarily, it is a great <hi>proof</hi> of the <hi>Scripture Authority</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> that Satan himſelf, and his ſubtileſt inſtruments, do place their greateſt hope of prevailing, by perverting and miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; which could be of no uſe to them, if its authority were not acknowledged.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:59417:230"/>11. We are in conſtant danger of thoſe ſins which we think we <hi>can conceal from men:</hi> Therefore ſuppoſe ſtill that all that you do <hi>will be made known</hi>; and do all as in the open ſtreets: It's written (by two) in the life of holy <hi>Ephrem Syrus,</hi> that when a Harlot tempted him to uncleanneſs, he deſired but that he might chuſe the place; which ſhe conſenting to, he choſe the open market-place, among all the people; and when ſhe told him, that there they ſhould be ſhamed, for all would ſee; he told her ſuch a leſſon of ſinning in the ſight of God, who is every where, as was the means of her converſion. Conceit of ſecrecy emboldeneth to ſin.</p>
               <p n="12">12. We are in conſtant danger of ſins of <hi>ſudden paſſion</hi> and irruption, which allow us not ſeaſon to deliberate, and ſurprize us before our reaſon can conſider.</p>
               <p n="13">13. We are in danger of ſins that come on by <hi>inſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> and from ſmall beginnings creep upon us, and come not by any ſudden wakening aſſaults: Thus <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,</hi> and <hi>ambition,</hi> do infect men: And thus our <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>deligence</hi> for God, doth uſually <hi>decay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14.

               <head>CHAP. XIV. How to live by Faith in Proſperity.</head>
               <p>THE work of Faith in reſpect of <hi>Proſperity,</hi> is twofold: 1. To ſave us from the danger of it. 2. To help us to a ſanctified improvement of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And for the firſt, that which Faith doth, is eſpecially, 1. To ſee deeper and further into the <hi>nature</hi> of all things in the world, than <hi>ſenſe</hi> can do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31. To ſee that they were never intended for our <hi>Reſt</hi> or portion, but to be our wilderneſs proviſion in our way. To foreſee juſt how the world will uſe us, and leave us at the laſt, and to have the very ſame thoughts of it now, as we foreſee that we ſhall have when the end is come, and when we have had all that ever the world will do for us. It is the work of Faith, to cauſe a man to judge of the world, and all its glory, as we ſhall do when death and judgment come, and have taken off the mask of ſplendid names, and ſhews, and flatteries: that we may uſe the world as if we uſed it not, and poſſeſs it as if we poſſeſt it not, becauſe its faſhion doth paſs away. It is the work of Faith to <hi>crucifie</hi> the world to us, and us to the world by the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. that we may look on it as diſdainfully as the world looked upon Chriſt, when he hanged as forſaken on the Croſs.

Moreover, Faith doth obſerve Gods <hi>particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> who diſtributeth his talents to every man as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and diſpoſeth of their eſtates and comforts: ſo that the <hi>Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Victory to the ſtrong, nor Riches to men of underſtanding,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.11.</p>
               <p>Therefore it convinceth us, that our lives, and all being in <hi>his hand,</hi> it is our wiſdom to make it our chiefeſt care to uſe all ſo as is moſt <hi>pleaſing unto him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. It foreſeeth alſo the day of Judgment, and teacheth us to uſe our proſperity and wealth, as we deſire to hear of it in the day of our accounts. Faith is a provident and a vigilant grace; and uſeth to ask when we have any thing in may poſſeſſion, which way I make the beſt advantage of it for my ſoul? which way will be moſt comfortable to me in my laſt review? how ſhall I wiſh that I had uſed my time, my wealth, my power, when time is at an end, and all theſe tranſitory things are vaniſhed?</p>
               <p n="6">6.

For if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on this ſubject Mr. <hi>Alleine</hi> hath ſaid ſo much in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Book of the <hi>Victory of Faith over the world,</hi> that I ſhall at this time ſay no more.</p>
               <p>The Directions which I would give you in general, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from the danger of proſperity by Faith, are theſe that follow.</p>
               <p>Direct. 1. <hi>Remember ſtill that the common cauſe of mens damnation is their Love of this world more than God and Heaven, and that the world cannot undo you any other way, but by tempting you to over-love it, and to undervalue higher things:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is the moſt dangerous condition, which maketh the <hi>world</hi> ſeem moſt <hi>pleaſing,</hi> and moſt <hi>lovely</hi> to us. And can you believe this, and yet be ſo eager to be humoured, and to have all things fitted to your pleaſure and deſires? Mark here what a task Faith hath? and mark what the work of ſelf-denyal is? The <hi>worldling</hi> muſt be <hi>pleaſed</hi>; the <hi>Believer</hi> muſt be <hi>ſaved.</hi> The <hi>worldling</hi> muſt have his <hi>fleſh</hi> and fancy gratified: the <hi>Believer</hi> muſt have <hi>Heaven ſecured,</hi> and God obeyed. Men ſell not their ſouls for <hi>ſorrow,</hi> but for <hi>mirth:</hi> They forſake not Heaven for <hi>poverty,</hi> but for <hi>riches</hi>: they turn not away from God for the love of <hi>ſufferings</hi> and diſhonour, but for the love of <hi>pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preferments,</hi> dignities and eſtimation in the world. And is that ſtate better and more deſirable, for which all that periſh turn from God, and fell their ſouls, and are befooled and undone for ever? Or that which no man ever ſinned for, nor forſook God for, or was undone for? Read over this queſtion once and again, and mark what anſwer your <hi>hearts</hi> give to it, if
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:59417:233"/>
you would know whether you live by ſenſe or faith? And mark what contrary anſwers the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> will give to it, when it comes to practice? I ſay, though many ſin <hi>in poverty,</hi> and <hi>in ſufferings,</hi> and <hi>in diſgrace,</hi> yea and <hi>by occaſion</hi> of them, and by their temptations, yet no man ever ſinned <hi>for them:</hi> They are none of the bait that ſtraled away the heart from God. Set deep upon your heart, the ſenſe of the <hi>danger</hi> of a proſperous ſtate, and ſear and vigilancy will help to ſave you.</p>
               <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Imprint upon your memory the characters of this deadly ſin of worldlineſs, that ſo you may not periſh by it, whilſt you dream that you are free from it; but may alw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies ſee how far it doth prevail.</hi> Here therefore to help you, I will ſet before you the characters of this ſin; and I will but briefly name them, leſt I be tedious, becauſe they are many.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The great mark of damning worldlineſs is, when <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> are not <hi>loved</hi> and <hi>preferred</hi> before the pleaſures, and profits, and honours of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another is, when the world is <hi>eſteemed</hi> and uſed more for the ſervice and pleaſure of the fleſh, than to honour God, and to do good with, and to further our ſalvation: When men deſire great places, and riches, more to pleaſe their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and carnal minds with, than to benefit others, or to ſerve the Lord with; when they are not <hi>rich to God, but to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> Luke 12.20, 21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a mark of ſome degree of worldlineſs, to deſire a <hi>greater meaſure</hi> of riches or honour, than our ſpiritual work, and ends, and benefit do require: For when we are convinced that <hi>leſs</hi> is as good or better to our higheſt ends, and yet we would have <hi>more</hi>; it is a ſign that the reſt is deſired for the <hi>fleſh, Rom.</hi> 13.14. &amp; 8.8, 9, 10, 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When our deſires after worldly things are too <hi>eager</hi> and <hi>violent</hi>: when we <hi>muſt needs</hi> have them, and cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When our contrivances for the world are too ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icitous; and our <hi>cares</hi> for it take up an undue proportion of our time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24, 25. to the end.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When we are impatient under want, diſhonour, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, and live in <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>diſcontent,</hi> if we want much, or have not our wills.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:59417:233"/>7. When the thoughts of the world are proportionably ſo many more than our thoughts of Heaven, and our ſalvation, that they keep us in the neglect of the duty of Meditation, and keep empty our minds of holy things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When it turneth our <hi>talk</hi> all towards the world, or taketh up our freeſt, and our ſweeteſt and moſt ſerious words, and leaveth us to the uſe of ſeldom, dull, or formal, or affected words, about the things which ſhould profit the ſoul, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our great Creator.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When the world incroacheth upon Gods part in our <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> and thruſts out prayer, or the reading of the Scriptures, or the due inſtruction of children or ſervants: when it cometh in upon the <hi>Lords day</hi>; when it is intruding in <hi>Gods Worſhip,</hi> and at <hi>Sermon</hi> or <hi>Prayer</hi> our thoughts are more pleaſingly running out after ſome worldly thing, than kept in attendance upon God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>31.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When worldly proſperity is ſo ſweet to you, that it can keep you quiet under the guilt of wilful ſin, and in the midſt of all the dangers of your ſouls. Becauſe you have your hearts deſire a while, you can forget eternity, or bear thoſe thoughts of it with ſecurity, which otherwiſe would amaze your ſouls, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When the <hi>peace and pleaſure</hi> which you <hi>daily live</hi> upon, is fetcht more from the <hi>world,</hi> than from God and Heaven; ſo that if at any time you ask your ſelves the true reaſon of your <hi>peace,</hi> and whence it is that you riſe and lie down in quietneſs of mind, your conſciences muſt tell you, it is not ſo much from your belief of the Love of God in Chriſt, nor from your hope to live in Heaven for ever, as becauſe you feel your ſelf well in body, and live at eaſe and proſperity in the world: And when any mirth or joy poſſeſſeth you, you may eaſily feel, that it is more from ſomething which is grateful to your fleſh, than from the belief of everlaſting glory.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When you think too highly and pleaſingly of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>rich,</hi> and too meanly of the ſtate of <hi>poor</hi> Believers: when you make too great a difference between the rich and the poor, and ſay to the man with the gold Ring, and the gay Apparel, Come up hither, and to the poor, Sit there at my footſtool, <hi>James</hi> 4. &amp; 5. When you had rather be made like
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59417:234"/>
the rich and honourable in the world, than like the poor that are more holy; and think with more delight of being like Lords or Great men in the world, than of being more like to humble heavenly Believers.</p>
               <p n="13">13. When you are at the heart more thankful to one that giveth you lands or money, than to God for giving you Chriſt and the Scriptures, and the Means of Grace: and would be better pleaſed if you were advanced or enriched by the King, than to think of being <hi>ſanctified</hi> by the Spirit of Chriſt. And when you give God himſelf more hearty thanks for <hi>worldly</hi> than for <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things.</p>
               <p n="14">14. When you make <hi>too much ado</hi> for the things of the world; and <hi>labour</hi> for them with inordinate induſtry; or plunge your ſelves into unneceſſary buſineſs, as one that can never have or do enough.</p>
               <p n="15">15. When you are too much in expecting liberality, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and gifts from others; and are too much pleaſed in it; and grudge at all that goeth beſide you; and think that it is mens duty to mind all your concernments, and further your commodity more than other mens.</p>
               <p n="16">16. When you are ſelfiſh and partial about worldly intereſt, and have little ſenſe of your neighbours concernments in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of your own. If one give never ſo liberally to many others, and give nothing to you, it doth never the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you, nor reconcile your mind to the charity of the giver. If one give to you, and paſs by many that have more need, you love and honour the bounty which ſatisfieth your own deſires. If you ſell dear, you rejoyce; and if you buy cheap, you are glad of your good bargain, though perhaps the ſeller be poorer than you. He that wrongeth you, or any way hindereth your commodity, is alwaies a bad man in your eſteem: No vertue will ſave him from your cenſures and reproach: But he that dealeth as hardly by your neighbour, and well with you, is a very honeſt man, and worthy of your praiſe.</p>
               <p n="17">17. When you are <hi>quarrelſome</hi> for worldly thing, and the love of them can at any time break your charity and peace, and make an enemy of your neereſt friend; or engage you in cauſleſs Law-ſuits and contentions. What abundance doth the world ſet together by the ears?</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:59417:234"/>18. When you can ſee your poor brother or neighbour in want, and ſhut up the bowels of your compaſſion from him; and do little good with what God hath given you, but the fleſh and ſelf devoureth all.</p>
               <p n="19">19. When you will venture upon <hi>unlawful waies</hi> of <hi>getting</hi>; or will ſin for honour or commodity; or at leaſt will let go your innocency and conſcience, rather than loſe your proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the world; and will diſtinguiſh your ſelves out of every danger, or coſtly duty, or ſuffering for righteouſneſs ſake; and will prove every thing <hi>lawful,</hi> which ſeemeth neceſſary to the proſperity and ſafety of the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="20">20. When you are more careful to provide riches and honors for your children after you, than to ſave them from worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, voluptuouſneſs and pride, and to bring them up to be the heirs of Heaven: and had rather venture their ſouls in the moſt dangerous temptations, than abate any of their plenty or grandure in the world.</p>
               <p>Theſe be the plain marks of worldly minds, whatever a blinded heart may deviſe to hide them.</p>
               <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Take heed of thoſe blinding pretences which world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minds do commonly uſe, to flatter, deceive and undo themſelves.</hi> For inſtance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The moſt common pretence is [<hi>That Gods creatures are good, and proſperity is his bleſſing, and that our bodies muſt be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and that ſynical and eremetical extreams and auſterities, are far from the genius of true Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is truth in all this, or elſe it would not be ſo fit to be made a cloak for ſin by miſapplication. The world and all Gods works are good; and to the pure they are pure: to the ſanctified they are ſanctified; that is, they are devoted to the ſervice of God, and uſed for him from whom they come: God hath given us nothing which may not be uſed for his ſervice, and our ſalvation. No doubt but you may make you friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, to further your reception into the everlaſting habitations: You may lay up a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the time to come; and you may ſow to the Spirit, and reap in the end everlaſting life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. You may provide you bags that wax not old: you may pleaſe God by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of diſtributing and communicating, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. But yet I
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:59417:235"/>
muſt tell you, the world and all Gods creatures in it, are <hi>too good</hi> to be ſacrificed to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and to the Devil; and not <hi>good enough</hi> to be <hi>loved</hi> and <hi>preferred</hi> before God, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The body muſt be cheriſhed, but yet the fleſh muſt be <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued</hi>; and if you live af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It muſt be cheriſhed as your horſe or ſervant for his work; but it muſt not be pampered, and made unruly, or your Maſter. You may ſeek food for your neceſſity and uſe; and ask of God your daily bread (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.) but you may not with the <hi>Iſraelites, ask meat for your luſt,</hi> as being weary of eating <hi>Manna</hi> ſo long, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. Hurting your health by uſeleſs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, is not pleaſing unto God: But ſenſuality and fleſh-pleaſing, and love of the world, is nevertheleſs abominable in his ſight.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>Neceſſity makes me mind the world: I have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to maintain, and am in debt, and cannot pay every one his own.</hi>

               <p>What wretched muck-worm would not <hi>pray,</hi> if he believed that praying would make him rich? I warrant you then their tune would be turned.

               <head>CHAP. XV. How to be poor in ſpirit. And how to eſcape the pride of Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</head>
               <p>THough no man is ſaved or condemned for being either <hi>rich</hi> or <hi>poor</hi>; yet it is not for nothing that Chriſt hath ſo often ſet before us the <hi>danger</hi> of the <hi>rich,</hi> and the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>difficulty</hi> of their ſalvation: And that he began his Sermon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. with, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The ſenſe of which words, is not as is commonly imagined, [<hi>Bleſſed are they that find their want of grace.</hi>] For 1. So may a deſpairing perſon. 2. The text com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Luke</hi> 16. where ſimply the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>rich</hi> are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, doth plainly ſhew another ſenſe; agreeing with the uſual doctrine of Chriſt. And whereas Expoſitors doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt ſpake that Sermon to his Diſciples, or to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, the text maketh it plain, that he ſpake it to both, <hi>viz.</hi> that he <hi>called</hi> his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to him, and as it were pointed the finger at them, and made them his text on which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the multitude; and the ſenſe is contained in theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; as if he had ſaid [<hi>See you theſe followers of me: You take them to be contemptible or unhappy, becauſe they are poor in the world; but I tell you,</hi> 1. <hi>That poverty maketh not Believers miſerable:</hi> 2. <hi>Yea they are the truly belſſed men, becauſe they ſhall have the heavenly riches:</hi> 3. <hi>And the evidence of their right to that, is, that they are poor in ſpirit, that is, their hearts are ſuited to a low eſtate, and are ſaved from the deſtructive vices of riches and proſperity.</hi> 1. <hi>And their outward poverty is better ſuited and conducible to this deliverance, and this poverty of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than a ſtate of wealth and proſperity is.</hi>] All theſe four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are the true meaning of the text.</p>
               <p>That we may ſee here what is the ſpecial work of Faith, we muſt know which are the ſpecial ſins of <hi>proſperity,</hi> which riches

And though the Apoſtle tell us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. that the <hi>love of money is the root of all evil,</hi> I will confine my diſcourſe to that narrower compaſs, in the enumeration of the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> in <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And firſt of the <hi>Pride</hi> of the rich and proſperous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PRIDE</hi> is a ſin of ſo deep radication, and ſo powerful in the hearts of carnal men, that it will take advantage of any condition, but <hi>Riches and Proſperity</hi> are its moſt <hi>notable</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. As the boat riſeth with the water; ſo do ſuch hearts riſe with their eſtates. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Charge the rich that they be not high minded. High-mindedneſs</hi> is the ſin that you are firſt here to avoid. In order whereunto I ſhall give you now but theſe three general Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p>Direct. 1. <hi>Obſerve the masks or covers of High-mindedneſs or Pride, leſt it reign in you unknown.</hi> For it hath many covers, by which it is concealed from the ſouls that are infected, if not undone and miſerable by it.</p>
               <p>For inſtance: 1. Some think that they are not <hi>Proud,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>their parts and worth will bear out all the eſtimation which they have of themſelves.</hi> And he that thinketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but as he <hi>really</hi> is, being in the right, is not to be accounted proud.</p>
               <p>But remember that the firſt act of Pride is the overvaluing of our ſelves: And he that is once guilty of this firſt act, will juſtifie himſelf both in it, and all that follow. So that <hi>Pride</hi> is a ſin which blindeth the underſtanding, and defendeth it ſelf by it ſelf, and powerfully keepeth off repentance. When once a man hath entertained a conceit, that he is <hi>wiſer</hi> or <hi>better</hi> than indeed he is, he then thinketh that all his thoughts, and words, and actions, which are of that ſignification, are juſt, and ſober, becauſe the thing is ſo indeed. And for a man to deny Gods graces, or gifts, and make himſelf ſeem worſe than he is, is not true humility, but diſſimulation or ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>But herein you have great cauſe to be very careful, leſt you
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59417:241"/>
ſhould prove miſtaken: Therefore 1. Judge not of your ſelves by the by as of ſelf-love; but, if it be poſſible, lay by partiality, and judge of your ſelves as you do by others, upon the like evidences. 2. Hearken what <hi>other men</hi> judge of you, who are <hi>impartial</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> and are <hi>neer you,</hi> and throughly acquainted with your lives. It's <hi>poſſible</hi> they may think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or worſe of you than you are: but if they judge <hi>worſe</hi> of you, than you do of your ſelves, it ſhould ſtop your confidence, and make you the more ſuſpicious, and careful to try left you ſhould be miſtaken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And remember alſo that you are obliged to a <hi>greater modeſty</hi> in judging of your own vertues, and to a greater <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in judging of your own <hi>faults,</hi> than of other mens; though you muſt not <hi>wilfully erre</hi> about <hi>your ſelves,</hi> or <hi>any others,</hi> yet you are not bound to ſearch out the truth about the faults of another, as you are about your own. We are commanded to <hi>prefer one another in honour,</hi> Rom. 10.21. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>For I ſay, through the grace given to me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly, than be ought to think; but to think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Another cloak for <hi>Pride</hi> is, <hi>the Reputation of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Profeſſion or Party,</hi> which will ſeem to be diſgraced by us, if we ſeem not to be ſome what better than we are. If we ſhould not hide or extenuate our faults, and ſet out our graces and parts to the full, we ſhould be a <hi>diſhonour</hi> to Chriſt, and to his ſervants, and his cauſe.</p>
               <p>But remember 1. That the way by which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed you to honour him, is, by <hi>being good,</hi> and <hi>living well,</hi> and not by <hi>ſeeming</hi> to be <hi>good,</hi> when you are not, or ſeeming better than you are: The God of Truth, who hateth Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, hath not choſen lying and hypocriſie to be the means by which we muſt ſeek his honour It is damnable to ſeek to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him by a lye, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.7.8. We muſt indeed cauſe <hi>our light ſo to ſhine before men that they may ſee our good works, and glorifie our heavenly Father,</hi> Mat. 5.16. But it is the light of <hi>Sincerity and good Works,</hi> and not of a diſſembled Profeſſion that muſt ſo ſhine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the pretended end doth greatly
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:59417:241"/>
aggravate the crime: As if the honour of God and our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt be upheld, by ſo deviliſh a means as proud Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And, though it be true, that a man is not imprudently without juſt cauſe, to open his ſins before the world; when it is like to tend to the injury of Religion, and any way to do more hurt than good: yet it is as true, that when there is no ſuch impediment, true repentance is forward to confeſs, and when the fault is <hi>diſcovered,</hi> defending and extenuating it, is then the greateſt diſhonour to Religion. (As if you would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all on Chriſt, and make men believe that he will juſtifie or extenuate ſin as you do.) And then it is a free ſelf-abaſing confeſſion, and taking all the ſhame to your ſelves (with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reformation) which is the reparation which you muſt make of the honour of Religion. For what greater diſhonour can be caſt upon Religion, than to make it ſeem a friend to ſin? Or what greater honour can be given it, than to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it as it is, as an enemy to all evil; and to take the blame, as is due, unto your ſelves?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another cloak for <hi>Pride,</hi> is the <hi>Reputation of our offices, dignities and places.</hi> We muſt live according to our rank and quality: All men muſt not live alike. The grandeur of Rulers muſt be maintained, or elſe the Magiſtracy will fall into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. The Paſtors Office muſt not by a mean eſtate, and low deportment, be expoſed to the peoples ſcorn. And ſo abundance of the moſt ambitious practices, and hateful enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the proud, muſt be vailed by theſe fair pretences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We grant you that the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> muſt be kept up by a convenient <hi>grandeur</hi>; and that a competent <hi>diſtance</hi> is neceſſary to a due <hi>reverence:</hi> But <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary an ingredient in Government, as <hi>Greatneſs</hi> is; and to be <hi>great in Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> is the principal <hi>Greatneſs:</hi> And <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is <hi>Loving,</hi> and humble, and condeſcending, and ſuiteth all deportments to the common <hi>good,</hi> which is the end of Government. See then that you keep up no other <hi>height,</hi> but that which really tendeth to the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, in order to the <hi>common good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And look alſo to your hearts, leſt it be your <hi>own exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which you indeed intend, while you thus pretend the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:59417:242"/>
honour of your office: For this is an ordinary trick of pride. To diſcover this, will you ask your ſelves theſe Queſtions following?</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>How</hi> you <hi>came</hi> into your offices and honours? did they ſeek you, or did you ſeek them? did the place need you, or did you need the place? If pride brought you in, you have cauſe to fear, leſt it govern you when you are there?</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What do you</hi> in the place of honour that you are in? Do you ſtudy to do all the good you can, and to make men happy by your Government? and is this the labour of your lives? if it be, we may hope that the means is ſuited to this end. But if you <hi>do</hi> no ſuch thing, you have no <hi>ſuch end:</hi> And if you have <hi>no ſuch end,</hi> you do but diſſemble, in pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your grandeur is uſed but as a <hi>means</hi> to that end which really you never ſeek. It is then your <hi>own</hi> exaltation that you aim at, and it is your <hi>pride</hi> that playeth all your game.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. Are you more offended and grieved when you are croſt and hindered in <hi>doing good,</hi> or when you are croſt and hindered from your <hi>perſonal honour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 4. Are you well contented that another ſhould have your honour and preferment, if God and the <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> ſo diſpoſe of it, ſo be it, it be one that is like to do more good than you?</p>
               <p>By theſe Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſtions you may quickly ſee if you are willing, whether your grandeur be deſired by your pride for ſelf-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, or by Chriſtian prudence to do good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I muſt tell you, that there is abundance of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the caſe of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrates,</hi> and the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Church in this. <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> muſt have more <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>pomp:</hi> But Paſtors muſt govern by <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi> When his Apoſtles ſtrove for ſuperiority, Chriſt left a deciſion of the controverſie for the uſe of all following ages. It is the <hi>contempt of the world,</hi> and the <hi>mortifying of the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> that Paſtors have to <hi>teach the people,</hi> and withall to <hi>ſeek a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly treaſure:</hi> And will not their <hi>own example</hi> further the ſucceſs of their Doctrine? The reverence that a Paſtor muſt expect, is not to be <hi>feared</hi> as one that can <hi>do hurt</hi> (For all <hi>coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>corporal force</hi> is proper to the <hi>Magiſtrate:</hi>) but it is to

be thought one that is <hi>above all the riches and pleaſures of the world,</hi> and hath ſet his heart on higher things: <hi>Such a one</hi> therefore he muſt both <hi>be</hi> and <hi>ſeem.</hi> A Paſtor will be but the ſooner deſpiſed, if he look after that <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>worldly pomp,</hi> which is ſeemly for a Magiſtrate: If he have a ſword in his hand, it's the way to be hated: If he have <hi>teeth</hi> that are <hi>bloody,</hi> or <hi>claws</hi> that <hi>can tear,</hi> he will be accounted a wolf, though he have the cloathing of a ſheep.<note place="margin">See Dr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> of Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on this point.</note> When our Divines give the reaſon of Chriſts humiliation, they ſay, that if he had preached up heavenly-mindedneſs, ſelf-denyal, and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had himſelf lived in pomp and fulneſs, the people would not have regarded his words: And ſurely the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon holdeth in ſome meaſure as to all his Miniſters. Again, I ſay, that if ever the Church be univerſally reformed, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral office muſt be only encouraged with <hi>neceſſary ſupport,</hi> to keep the Paſtors from <hi>deſpondency,</hi> and <hi>diſtracting cares</hi>; but it muſt not be made a <hi>bait</hi> of <hi>ambition, covetouſneſs or ſloth</hi>; but muſt be <hi>ſtript</hi> of that which makes it <hi>thus deſirable</hi> to a carnal mind.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is one of the ſigns and effects of Pride, that it maketh a <hi>greater matter of other mens thoughts of you,</hi> than you ought to make: It cannot bear contempt and ſcorn ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as <hi>Humility</hi> can do: Too careful avoiding of contempt, is the proper work of Pride. 2. It is granted that you ſhould
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:59417:243"/>
not be contemptuous of your juſt reputation; and alſo that you muſt not by any cauſleſs affected ſingularity, or by any practice which is indeed uncomely, make your ſelves the ſcorn of others. But it is as true that you muſt not deſire a higher eſtimation than is really your due; nor yet be <hi>over ſolicitous</hi> for that which is your due indeed; nor muſt you follow the proud in any thing which is contrary to true humility, for the keeping of their good report, nor go above your rank to avoid contempt. 3. And forget not whoſe good word it is that you ſhould eſpecially regard: Your trueſt honour is in the eſteem of God, and all good men, and not in the opinion or praiſes of the proud. They that are addicted to this vice themſelves, perhaps may deride thoſe that go below them (and yet they will more <hi>envy</hi> thoſe that go above them:) But the <hi>humble</hi> will think much better of you for being <hi>humble,</hi> and nothing can make you viler in their eyes than <hi>Pride.</hi> If you were humble your ſelves, you would prefer your honour with humble, wiſe and ſober perſons, above the opinions of the proud, who know not good from evil.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another cloak of Pride is <hi>opinionative</hi> and <hi>doctrinal</hi> Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: When we have heard and read much againſt Pride, and can ſpeak (or preach) againſt it, as freely, and fluently, and vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and movingly, as any others; and in all company and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſignifie our diſlike of it; when we are much in diſſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others from it, and in extolling humility, and lowlineſs of mind; this doth not only deceive others, but very often the ſpeaker himſelf; and makes him think that he hath no great degree of Pride.</p>
               <p>But <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> and <hi>opinion,</hi> and <hi>talk,</hi> are one thing, and a <hi>renewed truly humble ſoul</hi> is another thing. If all this while you are as <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> in your own eſteem, and make as great a matter of mens opinion of you, as others do that ſpeak leſs againſt Pride, your ſpeeches and preachings ſerve but to condemn your ſelves. It is as eaſie to talk againſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, gluttony, and other ſins, whileſt he that condemneth them, continueth in them, and condemneth himſelf. Talking againſt an enemy, obtaineth no victory; and talking againſt ſin, may ſignifie what you have <hi>learned to ſay,</hi> or perhaps what diſlike you have to that ſin at a <hi>diſtance,</hi> or <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> or <hi>in
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:59417:243"/>
another,</hi> when yet you may damnably <hi>love</hi> it in <hi>your ſelves.</hi> It were well for Preachers, if it were as eaſie or common to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſin, as to preach againſt it: But alas it is not ſo.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another cloak of <hi>Pride</hi> is, <hi>The preſence of a real partial humility, together with an outward humble garb.</hi> A man may be really humble in <hi>ſome,</hi> yea in <hi>many</hi> reſpects, and yet be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding proud in <hi>others</hi>: He may be vile in his own eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is conſcious of many great and odious ſins, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth that ſin is a thing odious to God, and all that will be ſaved, muſt be humbled for it; and becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that his body is earth, and muſt return by death to filth and duſt: And he may go in ſordid poor apparel; and ſuch may have a humble tone and manner of ſpeech; and perhaps ſpeak ſo ſelf-abaſingly, as if there were none ſo lowly as they: And yet they may be exceeding proud of their ſuppoſed <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual underſtanding,</hi> and of a ſuppoſed extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meaſure of <hi>holineſs,</hi> or <hi>revelations,</hi> or <hi>intereſt in God,</hi> or of this <hi>humility</hi> it ſelf: Yea their common natural pride may not be taken down, though there be frequent expreſſions of great humiliation.</p>
               <p>And if the proudeſt Gallants can, with their <hi>hat</hi> at your <hi>foot,</hi> profeſs themſelves your <hi>humble ſervants,</hi> why may not <hi>Religious Bride</hi> go as far?</p>
               <p>And note here, that this <hi>Religious Pride,</hi> is of a higher and more aggravated ſtrein than the other: 1. Becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt more humbling means. 2. Becauſe it is a ſin againſt more knowledge. 3. Becauſe it is accompanied with the profeſſion of Humility, and ſo is aggravated by more hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. 4. Becauſe it is an abuſe of more excellent things: It is more odious to turn the pretence of wiſdom, revelations, humility, godlineſs, good works, &amp;c. into pride, than to be proud as children are of their <hi>fine cloaths</hi>; or as addle-brained women are of their <hi>precedencies.</hi> 5. Becauſe it moſt odiouſly fathereth it ſelf <hi>on God,</hi> as if it were but the grateful magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his graces: To put Gods Name into the boaſts of Pride, and ſay, <hi>I thank thee, Lord, that I am not as other men, nor as this Publican (Luke</hi> 18.11.) To ſay, God hath revealed more to me than to you; or hath made me more holy and ſpiritual than you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.5. <hi>Stand by thy ſelf; come not neer
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59417:244"/>
me; for I am holier than thou:</hi> This is, when Pride ſpeaketh it, moſt odious blaſphemy; to father the firſt-born of the Devil upon God.</p>
               <p>There are two ſad inſtances of this kind of Pride, which are now too familiarly ſeen among us.</p>
               <p>The one is in the caſe of many <hi>convinced Hypocrites,</hi> yea and many paſſionate feeble Chriſtians, who are afrighted with the terrours of the Lord, and partly diſturbed by their guilt, or paſſions, and partly take it to be an honourable ſign of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to condemn themſelves; and therefore will fill the ears of Miniſters with ſad complaints of their fears and doubts, and ſins and wants, as if they would hardly be kept from deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet if they know that another doth believe them, and think and ſpeak as bad of them as they ſpeak of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yea if he do but ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght them, and prefer others before them, or plainly reprove them for any diſgraceful ſin, they ſwell with the wrath of Pride againſt him, and will not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think or ſpeak well of ſuch a one: And they love him beſt that thinketh beſt of them, and praiſeth them moſt, even when they moſt diſpraiſe themſelves; which ſheweth that a man may be really <hi>humbled</hi> in ſome reſpects, and <hi>ſeem</hi> to be humbled in more, and yet at the heart be dangerouſly proud.</p>
               <p>The other inſtance is, in the common ſeparating Spirit of Sectarians; and in particular, in thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> in theſe times (For againſt <hi>commanded ſeparation from ſin, by ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> or <hi>diſcipline,</hi> I am far from ſpeaking.) Their great pretence of ſingularity is, to avoid and deteſt the <hi>Pride</hi> of others; they <hi>cry out againſt Pride</hi> as much as any. Their garb is plain; humility, and ſelf-emptineſs, and poverty of ſpirit, is their profeſſion. And yet when they are ſo ignorant, that they can ſcarce ſpeak ſenſe; and when they underſtand not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm or Creed, but have need to be taught which are the principles of the Oracles of God; they think they are taken into the counſels of the Almighty; they think they abound in the Spirit, and in wiſdom, in revelations, and in holineſs; and the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>holieſt</hi> of Chriſts Miniſters and People, who are as far above them in knowledge and godlineſs, as the aged are above a ſtammering Infant, are proudly deſpiſed by them, and openly and impenitently reviled and railed at, as ignorant
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59417:244"/>
fools, and ungodly, worldly, ſelf-ſeeking men, and as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of the people, and as void of the Spirit; which could never proceed to the height that we have ſeen it, and which their words and writings utter at this day, without a very <hi>ſtrange degree of Pride,</hi> and ſuch as either <hi>maketh men mad,</hi> or is <hi>made by madneſs,</hi> or little leſs.</p>
               <p>And here note alſo, that it is no wonder if Religious Pride can deſpiſe the <hi>common</hi> applauſe of the <hi>world,</hi> and bear a great deal of ignominy from the <hi>vulgar</hi>; becauſe they have learnt ſo much as to know that wicked men are fools, and baſe, and their judgment is no great honour or diſhonour to any man; and that godly men only are truly wiſe, and their judgment moſt to be regarded. And therefore it is <hi>with them</hi> whom they think highlieſt of themſelves, that they deſire to be thought highlieſt of; and it is among the <hi>Religious ſort,</hi> that <hi>Religious Pride</hi> doth fiſh for honour: even as men that are proud of their <hi>Learning,</hi> do hunt after the applauſe of <hi>learned men,</hi> and can deſpiſe the judgment of the <hi>unlearned vulgar,</hi> as quite below them.</p>
               <p>I know that this laſt inſtance of <hi>Pride,</hi> is not alwaies an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of <hi>Proſperity:</hi> But oft it is, a kind of wantonneſs thence ariſing, which is much reſtrained in ſuffering times: And being ſpeaking of the reſt, I thought not meet to paſs it by.</p>
               <p>Direct. II. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand which are the ordinary effects and characters of Pride, that you may not live in it, and periſh by it, whilſt you thought you had overcome it.</hi> At this time (having ſaid more of it elſewhere) I ſhall recite but theſe marks of proſperous <hi>Pride,</hi> and ſhew the contrary ſigns of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The high-minded are ſelf-willed, and much addicted to rule and domineer.</hi> They would have their own wills, in all their <hi>own matters,</hi> and are hardly brought to ſubmit to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and will of others. <hi>Obeying</hi> goeth quite againſt their grain, any further than they like the commands of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours: And if they are in any hope of reaching it, they aſpire to be the <hi>Governours</hi> of others, that they may ſtill ſtand
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59417:245"/>
uppermoſt, and have their will in all the matters about them, as well as in their own. If there be a place of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment</hi> void, the <hi>proud</hi> man is the <hi>forwardeſt expectant</hi>; and maketh no great queſtion of his fitneſs; but thinketh that he is injured if he be put by, how worthy a man ſoever be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before him: He ſnuffs and ſcorns at inferiours that ſtick at his moſt ſinful and unreaſonable commands; and thunders out the charge of Rebellion or Schiſm againſt thoſe that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his infallibility, or that will ſtick at obeying <hi>him</hi> before God, and againſt him; as if he had been <hi>born to rule,</hi> and other men to <hi>obey him</hi>; and all do him wrong, who fall not down and worſhip not his will, at the firſt intimation: Though perhaps he be but a Miniſter of Chriſt, who ſhould be as a little child, and the ſervant of all, and ſhould ſtoop to the feet of the pooreſt of the flock, and ſhould receive the weak, and bear with their infirmities; yet Pride will there lift up the head, and forget all the humbling examples and admonitions of Chriſt, and will either ſeek to <hi>draw Diſciples after it, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perverſe things,</hi> Acts 20.30. or forget 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Neither us being Lords over Gods heritage, but examples to the flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the contrary, the <hi>poor in ſpirit</hi> are readier to <hi>obey</hi> than <hi>rule,</hi> as knowing that <hi>ruling</hi> requireth the greater parts and graces; and are enclined to think others to be fitter for places of Teaching or Authority than themſelves (further than clear experience conſtraineth them to know the contrary:) For <hi>in honour they prefer others,</hi> inſtead of ſtriving to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others: They have a tractable, humble, yielding diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except when they are tempted to ſin. They are gentle, and eaſie to be entreated, <hi>James</hi> 3.17. and can <hi>ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to one another</hi>; yea and be their voluntary ſubjects, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.21. (Yet not becoming unneceſſarily the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of men; but <hi>chuſing</hi> it <hi>rather</hi> when they <hi>may be free.</hi>) They are as <hi>little children,</hi> in that they expect not rule, but to be ruled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. They have learned to <hi>ſerve one another in love,</hi> Gal. 5.13. and take it not for Chriſtian love, that can do good only upon terms of equality, and cannot ſtoop to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary <hi>ſervice.</hi> They can go two mile with him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth them to go one: No man more obedient when you command not ſin. For as he affecteth not to be called <hi>Maſter,</hi>
                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:59417:245"/>
or Rabbi, or to have the higheſt ſeat or name (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.11, &amp;c.) So he hath learnt not to <hi>pleaſe himſelf, but to pleaſe others for their good to edification,</hi> Rom. 15.2. Eſpecially if he be a Paſtor of the Church, though he do by an <hi>excelling light,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>good life,</hi> keep up the true honour of his calling; yet is he the more averſe to <hi>Lord</hi> it over the <hi>flock,</hi> becauſe he knoweth <hi>that he muſt be an example to them:</hi> And it is not <hi>an example of pride,</hi> but of <hi>lowlineſs,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt did give,</hi> and <hi>he muſt give</hi>; and therefore both are joyned together, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Proud do make too <hi>great a matter</hi> of that honour which perhaps may be their due: They plot for it: they ſet their hearts upon it. If they are ſlighted, or others preferred before them, their countenances are caſt down, as <hi>Cains</hi>; or they are troubled, as <hi>Haman</hi>; or they will revenge it, as <hi>Cain,</hi> and as <hi>Joab</hi> upon <hi>Abner:</hi> Touch their honour, and you touch their hearts: Deſpiſe them, and you torment them, or make them your enemies.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Poor in ſpirit</hi> regard their honour, as they do other matters of this world; that is, with moderation, and ſo far as it is conducible to the honour of Religion, or their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or to the ſervice and buſineſs of their lives. They will not be Prodigals of that which they may ſerve God by: and they will not be over deſirous of that which may be a bait to Pride, and a ſnare to their ſouls, though it gratifie the fleſhly fancy. They will ſeek it, as if they ſought it not; and poſſeſs it, as if they poſſeſt it not, remembring how vain a thing man is, and how little his thoughts or breath can do, to make us happy: God is ſo great in a Believers eye, and man and worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſo ſmall, that a lowly mind can ſcarce have room and time to regard the honour which is the proud mans portion; becauſe he is taken up with honouring his God, and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the honour which conſiſteth in his approbation.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is tolerable to him, to <hi>be made of no reputation</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be laden with reproaches, to be ſpit upon and buffeted; to be made as the ſcorn and off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:59417:246"/>
concernment: your favour is not his felicity; nor are you the Judge, whoſe ſentence muſt finally decide his cauſe. He <hi>humbleth himſelf,</hi> and therefore can endure to be <hi>humbled</hi> by <hi>others.</hi> He <hi>chuſeth</hi> the <hi>loweſt place</hi> himſelf, and therefore can endure to <hi>be low,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.3, 4, 5. Luke 14.11. &amp; 18.14. &amp; 14.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>high-minded</hi> are aſhamed to be thought to come of a <hi>low deſcent</hi>; or that their <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Anceſtors</hi> were <hi>poor:</hi> And if their Anceſtors were rich and great, that little honour doth help to elevate their minds; becauſe they want that perſonal worth which is honourable indeed, they are fain to adorn themſelves with theſe borrowed feathers.</p>
               <p>But the lowly know that if Riches prove ſuch a hinderance of ſalvation, and ſo few of the rich proportionably are ſaved, as Chriſt hath told us, it can be no great honour to be the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the rich: It is a ſad kind of boaſt, to ſay [my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors are liker to be in Hell than yours; or if any of them be in Heaven, they came thither as a Camel through a needles eye.] We know we are all of the common earth, and there our fleſh will all be levelled, and our nobleſt blood will turn to the common putrefaction: We are all the ſeed of ſinful <hi>Adam</hi>; our Father was an <hi>Amorite,</hi> and our Mother an <hi>Hittite, Ezek.</hi> 16.3. And good men have uſed humbly to lament their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers pride and wickedneſs, inſtead of boaſting of their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wealth; as you may read, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.16, 39. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>high-minded</hi> are aſhamed to be thought <hi>poor</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Becauſe <hi>wealth</hi> is the Idol which they moſt honour; they think that it will moſt honour them. Becauſe they ſee that moſt men admire and honour it in the world; therefore they being of the world, do judge as the world, and confirm themſelves to its opinion. Even the <hi>poor</hi> that is <hi>proud,</hi> is aſhamed of his poverty, and would be fain accounted rich.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>lowly</hi> are not aſhamed to ſay with <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.6. <hi>Silver and gold have I none</hi>; while they have better riches to rejoyce in: They are glad, when with <hi>Paul</hi> they can ſay, <hi>We are poor, but making many rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.10. They will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or caſt away any riches (which God doth lend them) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as his Stewards, they muſt be accountable for them to their Lord. But they take it to be no ſhame to be liker Chriſt

Nor is it any deſirable honour to have our ſalvation ſo much hindered and hazarded, as the rich have. God, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and wiſe men, do think never the worſe of a good man for being poor.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>high-minded</hi> are therefore uſually addicted to ſome exceſs in ornaments and apparel, becauſe they would be taken to be <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>comely</hi> (unleſs when their Pride worketh ſome other way.) Yea, if they be never ſo mean and poor, they would ſeem by their clothing to be ſomewhat richer than they are; or would be rich in hypocriſie, or outward appearance, except it hinder their relief. They that wear ſoft clothing were wont to dwell in the houſes of Kings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.8. but now they dwell in the houſes of moſt Citizens, Tradeſmen, Husbandmen; yea of Miniſters themſelves; wives, children and ſervants are commonly ſick at once of this diſeaſe: And though it be one of the loweſt and fooliſheſt games, which Pride hath to play; yet women, and children, and light-headed youths, do make up the greater number for this vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; while the pride of the graver wiſer ſort, doth turn it ſelf to greater things.</p>
               <p>But the lowly who are not aſhamed to be poor, are not aſhamed of poor apparel: Though they are not for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, nor for an affected ſingularity, for oſtentation of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; yet they had rather go below their rank, than above it, as taking <hi>Pride</hi> to be a greater <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>hurt</hi> than poverty: If their clothing be convenient to their health and uſe, and not offenſive to others, it ſufficeth them: and a patch, or a rent, or a garment that is old, will not make them bluſh: they have learnt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. [<hi>Whoſe adorning, let it not be that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, of plating the hair, or of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>high-minded</hi> have high thoughts of worldly pomp, and wealth, and greatneſs; and think of ſuch as excel in theſe, with great eſteem and reverence: They bow to the man that

And they think if they be poor and low themſelves, how brave a thing is it to be high and rich: And had far rather be rich than gracious, and be higher in the world, than to have a lowly mind.</p>
               <p>But the humble have learnt of Chriſt to be meek and lowly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. and are ſtill learning it of him more and more: They had rather have <hi>Pauls heart,</hi> that <hi>counted all things as loſs and dung for Chriſt, and learned to abound and to ſuffer want, and in every ſtate to be content,</hi> than to be lifted up with worldly vanity. They know that <hi>it is better to be of a humble ſpirit with the lowly, than to divide the ſpoils with the proud,</hi> Prov. 16.19. And as the brother of <hi>low degree</hi> (being ſanctified Believer that can uſe all for God) muſt rejoyce when he is exalted; ſo muſt the brother of high degree, when he is made low, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.9, 10. They pitty a <hi>Dives</hi> in his purple and ſilk, more than a <hi>Lazarus</hi> at his gates in rags. They wiſh not too eagerly for ſo dangerous an exaltation, from which they ſee ſo many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly caſt down. They much more honour a poor Believer, than a pompous ſinner. For in <hi>their eyes a vile perſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; but they honour them that fear the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 15.4.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>high-minded</hi> are aſhamed of low employments: If they be ſeen doing ſuch work as is accounted baſe, or proper to poor inferiour perſons, they think they are diſhonoured: If the proud ſort of the Paſtors of the Church, had been ſent as <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles, to travel about the world on foot, and to preach the Goſpel in their humble ſelf-denying terms, they would have ſaid that this was an unſufferable drudgery; and Chriſt muſt have provided more encouraging <hi>rewards of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or elſe he ſhould have been no Maſter of theirs. Yea a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> that is <hi>proud,</hi> will diſdain the loweſt works of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as if it were a diſgrace to ſtoop ſo low.</p>
               <p>But the lowly do learn of Chriſt another leſſon. He ſtoopt to waſh and wipe the feet of his Diſciples, to teach them what to do toward one another. Not as the Pope doth once a year waſh ſome poor mens feet, by a Scenical ceremony (For <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are both turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his Miniſters themſelves, what lowlineſs they muſt uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, and to all the flock.

When Chriſt would appear in ſtate at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he rode upon a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Aſs, to fulfill the Prophecy, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Behold thy King cometh unto thee, meek and ſitting upon an Aſs,</hi> Matth. 21.5. <hi>Paul</hi> refuſed not (with other Preachers) to labour at the trade of a Tent-maker, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.3. And <hi>Timothy</hi> was not aſhamed to bring him his cloak and parchments, ſo great a Journey, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. Nothing is avoided by the lowly at a ſhame, but that which is diſpleaſing to God, and diſagreeeble to his Chriſtian duty: But not that which he can call the ſervice of God, and which God accepteth and will reward.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>high-minded</hi> are <hi>aſhamed of the company and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the poor</hi> (unleſs when they ſeek for applauſe by popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But the lowly chuſe to converſe with the low. For ſo did Chriſt who was our pattern: and it is his Law [<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Mind not high things, but condeſcend to men of low eſtate.</hi> Chriſt was not aſhamed to call us brethren, <hi>Heb</hi> 3.11. nor will he be aſhamed ſo to call the leaſt of his true Diſciples before God and Angels at the dreadful day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.40. &amp; 28.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17. They are the moſt honourable company, who are <hi>likeſt to Chriſt,</hi> and are the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> and the <hi>holieſt</hi>; and not thoſe who are likeſt to his <hi>crucifiers</hi> and <hi>enemies,</hi> and have their portion in this world.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Pride is uſually attended with <hi>vain curioſity:</hi> curioſity in ornaments, in faſhions, in diſtreſſings, in attendance, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, in rooms, and in abundance of ſmall inconſiderable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. The proud (who go this lower way) do make a great matter of ſo many ſuch trifles, that their minds have no room for the greateſt things. They do not only trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:59417:248"/>
                  <hi>with many things,</hi> while the <hi>one thing needful</hi> is the more neglected (<hi>Luke</hi> 10.42.) but all about them muſt be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the trouble. What abundance of trades doth Pride maintain? and how many are continually at work to ſerve it?</p>
               <p>But the lowly who mind not vain oſtentation, do ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all this unprofitable pains: They can avoid undecent ſordidneſs, at a cheaper rate than by proud curioſity. They are accurate and curious in greater matters, in doing good, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their ſalvation, in eſcaping ſin, and in pleaſing God; which will one day prove a wiſer curioſity, than to be curious in courtſhip, and complements, and dreſſings, and other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent childiſh things: Though the <hi>leaſt juſt decency</hi> is not to be neglected in its place, it is fooliſh pride to prefer it before things of importance and neceſſity. Mans mind and time are not ſufficient for all things: Somewhat muſt be omitted; and its wiſdom which chuſeth to omit the leaſt, and folly which chuſeth to omit the greateſt. As in <hi>Learning,</hi> they prove the ſoundeſt Scholars who ſpend their ſtudies on the moſt excellent and uſeful parts of learning; whilſt thoſe that too much ſtudy things <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi> are ever empty of <hi>neceſſary</hi> knowledge: It is ſo alſo in the actions of our lives: As <hi>Paul</hi> ſo vehemently condemneth <hi>vain jangling</hi> about <hi>unneceſſary</hi> and <hi>unedifying queſtions,</hi> though yet <hi>truth</hi> was not contemptible in <hi>thoſe</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: ſo alſo <hi>vain curioſity,</hi> and <hi>unedifying diligence</hi> (though about things not altogether contemptible) is but the perilous <hi>diverſion</hi> of the mind, from <hi>greater</hi> things, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6, 7, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The <hi>high-minded</hi> cannot endure to be <hi>beholden</hi> (unleſs neceſſity or covetouſneſs prevail againſt their Pride.) But they would have all others <hi>beholden to them,</hi> that they may ſeem as petty Deities in the world. O how it puffeth them up to have the people depend upon them, and acknowledge them for their benefactors, and to have crouded ſacrifices of thanks and praiſe to be offered them as they go about the ſtreets: If they were accounted ſuch as the world could not live, nor be happy without them, as being the moſt neceſſary parts or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars thereof, nothing could more content their humour.</p>
               <p>But the lowly mind deſireth rather to <hi>do good,</hi> than to be
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:59417:248"/>
known to do it: And it is not mens unthankfulneſs that will take him off, becauſe it is not their thanks which is his reward. He would be as like God as he can in doing good, but not for his own glory, but for Gods. As he is <hi>Gods Steward,</hi> it is <hi>with God</hi> that he keepeth reckoning; and if his accounts will paſs with <hi>him,</hi> he hath enough. And if God will have him to need the help of <hi>others,</hi> he is not too ſtout to ſeek and be beholden. Though every ingenious man ſhould value his freedom from the ſervitude of man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. and if he can be <hi>free, ſhould chuſe it rather,</hi> verſ. 21. (And the <hi>borrower is a ſervant to the lender,</hi> Prov. 22.7.) And we may ſay with him in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.3. <hi>To beg I am aſhamed:</hi> Yet here humility will make us ſtoop, <hi>when God requireth it.</hi> Chriſt himſelf refuſed not to be a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, Luke</hi> 8.3. No nor to ask a draught of water, <hi>John</hi> 4. And poverty is oft a great mercy to the proud, to take them down, and make them ſtoop. <hi>The rich anſwereth roughly; but the poor uſeth intreaties,</hi> Prov. 18.23. So much of the Marks of Pride.</p>
               <p>Direct. III. <hi>Overlook not the odiouſneſs and peril of Pride.</hi> I will name you now but a few of its aggravations, becauſe I have more largely mentioned them elſewhere.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the moſt direct <hi>oppoſition to God,</hi> to ſet up our ſelves as Idols in his place, and ſeek for ſome of his honour to our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the <hi>firſt born of the Devil,</hi> and an imitation of him whom God in nature hath taught us to take for the greateſt enemy of him and us; and the moſt odious of all the creatures of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is madneſs to fall by that <hi>ſame ſin,</hi> which we <hi>know</hi> was the overthrow of our firſt Parents, and of the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it is <hi>ſottiſh</hi> impudency in ſuch as <hi>we,</hi> who know that our bodies are going into rottenneſs and duſt, and think in what a place and plight we muſt there lie, and that thoſe daies of darkneſs will be many: And who know that our ſouls are defiled with ſin, and if we have any ſaving knowledge and <hi>grace,</hi> it is ſmall, and mixt with abundance of ignorance and corruption; and the <hi>nature</hi> of it is contrary to Pride.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:59417:249"/>5. It is contrary to the deſign of redeeming grace, which is to ſave the humble contrite ſoul.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It betrayeth men to a multitude of other ſins (as vanity of mind, loſs of time, neglect of duty, ſtriving for preferment, quarrelling with others, upon matters of reputation or prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, &amp;c)</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               <head>CHAP. XVI. How to ſcape the ſin of Fulneſs or Luxury by Faith.</head>
               <p>THE ſecond ſin of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and fruit of abuſrd Proſperity, is <hi>Fulneſs of Bread,</hi> Ezek. 16 49 Concerning which (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo handled it elſewhere more at large) I ſhall now brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give you theſe general Directions firſt, and then a few that are more particular.</p>
               <p>Direct. I. Underſtand well what <hi>ſinful Fulneſs:</hi> It is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when it hath any one of theſe ill conditions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When you eat or drink more in <hi>quantity,</hi> than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the due preſervation of your health: or ſo much as <hi>hurteth</hi> your <hi>health</hi> or <hi>reaſon.</hi> For the uſe of food is to fit us for our duty; and therefore that which diſableth and <hi>unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> us, is too much. But here both the <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>future</hi> muſt be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you have <hi>no higher end</hi> in eating and drinking, than the <hi>pleaſing of your appetite.</hi> Be it little or much, it is to be judged of according to <hi>its end.</hi> A beaſt hath no other <hi>end,</hi> becauſe he hath <hi>no reaſon,</hi> and ſo properly hath <hi>no end</hi> at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But <hi>we</hi> are bound to <hi>eat and drink to the glory of God,</hi> and <hi>to do all</hi> to further us in his ſervice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. The appetite may
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:59417:250"/>
be <hi>pleaſed</hi> in order to a <hi>higher end</hi>; that is, 1. So far as it is a true <hi>directer</hi> what is for our <hi>health,</hi> and will be beſt digeſted: 2. So far as by moderate and ſeaſonable <hi>exhilaration,</hi> it fitteth us by cheerful <hi>alacrity</hi> for our duty: and therefore it hath been good mens uſe to have <hi>holy feaſts,</hi> as well as holy faſts. But the appetite muſt be reſtrained and denyed, 1. When it is <hi>againſt health:</hi> And 2. When it <hi>hindereth</hi> from <hi>duty:</hi> Or 3. When it would be the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of our repaſt, and there is <hi>no higher reaſon</hi> for it, than the <hi>appetites delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not ſaid that the Senſualiſt in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. did eat <hi>too much</hi>: but that he <hi>fared ſumptuouſly every day,</hi> and that he <hi>had his good things here:</hi> that is, that he <hi>lived</hi> to the <hi>pleaſing of his fleſh.</hi> It is not ſaid of him in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19, 20. that he ate or drank <hi>too much</hi>; but that he ſaid, <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry</hi>; that is, that he preferred the pleaſing of his appetite or fleſh, before the everlaſting pleaſures. The ſin of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites was, that they were weary of eating <hi>Manna</hi> only, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, and deſired fleſh <hi>only to pleaſe their appetite:</hi> and therefore is is ſaid, that <hi>they asked meat for their luſt,</hi> Pſal. 78.18. that is, to gratifie their fleſh or ſenſe. And the terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings thundered out by <hi>James</hi> againſt the rich, are on ſuch accounts, <hi>James</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Ye have lived in pleaſure on earth, and been wanton; ye have nouriſhed your hearts as in a day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And we are commanded to <hi>make no proviſion for the fleſh, to ſatisfie the wills or luſts thereof</hi>; that is, <hi>meerly or chiefly</hi> to pleaſe our ſenſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is <hi>ſinful Fulneſs,</hi> when you <hi>needleſly</hi> ſtrengthen either <hi>luſtful</hi> or <hi>ſluggiſh</hi> inclinations by the <hi>quantity</hi> or the <hi>quality</hi> of your food. I know nature muſt not be famiſhed, nor our health and life deſtroyed, under pretence of conquering ſin: But when neceſſity of life and health doth not require it, all that muſt be avoided, which cheriſheth any vicious diſpoſition. And theſe two are the uſual effects of fulneſs. 1. Some, eſpecially <hi>idle youths,</hi> abound with <hi>luſtful thoughts</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> which <hi>fulneſs</hi> greatly cheriſheth; and pleaſing their appetite, is the fuel of their luſt: when as if they would drink water, and eat courſer food, and little of it (and withall be laborious in ſome ſerious work) their luſts would be more extinguiſhed: Theſe perſons are guilty of ſinful <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> if they take but neer as

                  </gap>uch as other men may do; becauſe for the pleaſing of one luſt, they ſeed another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others that are <hi>flagmatick</hi> and <hi>dull,</hi> can never feed fully, but they are <hi>heavy</hi> and <hi>drowſie,</hi> unfit for prayer, and unfit for work: uſually the health, as well as the conſciences of theſe perſons, doth require a ſpare kind of dyet; and that which is but enough for others, is too much for them. Becauſe the <hi>avoiding of ſin,</hi> and the <hi>performance of our duties,</hi> is the <hi>meaſure</hi> of our food.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is <hi>ſinful Fulneſs,</hi> when any of Gods creatures are taken <hi>without any benefit,</hi> and <hi>in vain.</hi> It is a ſin to take any more than we have cauſe to think is like to do us good; though we thought it were like to do <hi>no harm.</hi> That which is uſed only to gratifie the appetite, or for any other unprofitable cauſe, and neither furthereth <hi>health</hi> nor <hi>duty,</hi> is ſinfully caſt away. And if <hi>vain words</hi> be forbidden, <hi>vain eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> can be no better.</p>
               <p>The evil of the ſin is, 1. Becauſe man being a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould do nothing in <hi>vain:</hi> 2. Becauſe we are <hi>Gods Stewards,</hi> and muſt give an <hi>account</hi> of all our talents: 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods <hi>mercies</hi> are not to be <hi>contemned,</hi> nor caſt away as nothing worth. 4. But eſpecially becauſe there are <hi>thouſands</hi> in <hi>want,</hi> while you <hi>abound</hi>; and if you ſpend that in vain, which others <hi>need,</hi> you wrong God, and rob them, and ſhew that you want love to your brethren, and prefer <hi>your appetites</hi> before <hi>their neceſſities.</hi> If you think any thing that you have is abſolutely <hi>your own,</hi> you are but fooliſh pretenders againſt God: But if you know that God hath lent it you for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, how dare you caſt it away in vain? <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.12. When Chriſt had multiplied food (or ſatisfied mens appetite) by <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be loſt:</hi> Nothing then muſt <hi>be loſt,</hi> on your ſelves or others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To beſtow <hi>too much coſt</hi> upon the belly, is a ſinful <hi>Fulneſs</hi> too; though the <hi>quantity</hi> of food be never ſo ſmall. <hi>Coſt</hi> is <hi>too much</hi> when it is more than is <hi>profitable</hi>; or when the <hi>coſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth</hi> the <hi>profit.</hi> The reaſons of this are the ſame as of the former; becauſe we are Gods Stewards, and muſt give account of all that we have, and muſt improve it all to our Maſters uſe; and becauſe thouſands want what we might ſpare, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouſly

expend. What are the occaſions which will juſtifie ſome extraordinary coſtlineſs, is too long now to explicate. In general, it muſt be for ſome end and benefit, which is better than any which might be procured otherwiſe by that expence: But pride or appetite are no juſtifying cauſes of it.

It is ſuch a ſacrifice which <hi>James</hi> calleth, the <hi>cheriſhing of their hearts as in a day of ſlaughter,</hi> James 5.5. This is the <hi>hid treaſure</hi> which their <hi>bellies are filled with,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. The rich mans <hi>full barns, Luke</hi> 12 20. were but to <hi>fill his belly,</hi> and <hi>pleaſe his fleſh [Thou haſt enough laid up for many years.</hi>] For what? why for <hi>eaſe,</hi> and <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> and <hi>mirth</hi>; They think it is their <hi>own,</hi> and that they may ſpend it on <hi>themſelves</hi>; but O the terrible account! As <hi>David</hi> would not offer that to God <hi>which coſt him nothing,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.24. ſo neither will they offer <hi>too cheap</hi> a ſacrifice to their bellies. But luſt deſerveth not much coſt: He that is your God, is the God of others as well as of you; and careth for them as well as for you; even when he giveth them leſs than you: And he giveth it <hi>you,</hi> that <hi>you</hi> may have the <hi>tryal,</hi> and the <hi>honour</hi> of giving it according to his will to <hi>them.</hi>

               <p>He that loveth his neighbour as himſelf, will not ſee mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes cold and hungry, while he gratifieth his own ſenſuality with ſuperfluities.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A pampered appetite is <hi>unruly</hi>; and feedeth your <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> is <hi>now</hi> become our <hi>moſt dangerous enemy</hi>; and therefore it muſt be dangerous to pamper it, to the ſtrengthening of its luſts: When even <hi>Paul</hi> was put to <hi>buffet and tame</hi> it, and bring it into <hi>ſubjection,</hi> for fear of proving a caſt-away after all his wondrous labours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The pleaſing of the appetite too much, <hi>corrupteth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and relliſh of the ſoul.

And <hi>the carnal mind is enmity to God:</hi> if <hi>it cannot be ſubject to his Law,</hi> certainly it is unfit to relliſh the ſweetneſs of his <hi>Love,</hi> and ſpiritual mercies.</p>

And as ſome of Chriſts hearers were after the loaves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The uſe of pleaſing the fleſhly appetite doth make men <hi>need riches</hi>; which is a miſery, and a ſnare. Such <hi>muſt needs have their deſires ſatisfied,</hi> and therefore <hi>cannot</hi> live on a little: And therefore if they <hi>have riches,</hi> their fleſh devoureth almoſt all, and they have little to ſpare for any charitable uſes. And if they <hi>have none,</hi> they are tempted to ſteal, or get it by ſome unlawful means. And ſo it tempteth them to the love of money (which is the root of all evil) becauſe they love the luſt which needeth it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And it maketh them <hi>utterly unfit for ſuffering</hi> (which Chriſt will have all his followers to expect.) He that is <hi>uſed to pleaſe his appetite,</hi> will take that for a <hi>grievous life,</hi> which another man will feel no trouble in: If a full fed Gentleman or <hi>Dives</hi> were tyed to fare as the poor labourer doth at the beſt, he would lament his caſe as if he were undone, and would take that for half a martyrdom (if it were on a pious pretence) which his neighbour would account no ſuffering, but a <hi>feaſt.</hi> And will God <hi>reward</hi> men for ſuch <hi>ſelf-made ſufferings?</hi> How unfit is he to endure impriſonment, baniſhment and want, who hath alwaies uſed to pleaſe his fleſh? If God caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>poverty,</hi> how impatient would he be? How plentifully and pleaſantly would moſt poor Country-men think to live, if they had but a hundred pounds a year of their own? But if he that hath thouſands, and is uſed to <hi>fulneſs,</hi> ſhould be reduced to an hundred, how querulous or impatient would he be?</p>
               <p n="6">6. It maketh the <hi>body heavy</hi> and unfit for duty: both du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of piety, and the honeſt labours of your calling.</p>

It is to be noted, that the exceſs reproved by <hi>Paul</hi> at their Love-feaſts, was puniſhed with <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> and with <hi>death:</hi> And as that puniſhment had a <hi>moral ſuitableneſs</hi> to

The <hi>lowneſs</hi> of a <hi>mans calling,</hi> or <hi>baſeneſs</hi> of his <hi>employment,</hi> will not allow him to be negligent or weary of it, or uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in it: Seeing God muſt be obeyed in the loweſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, as well as in the higheſt; and will reward men according to their <hi>faithful labour,</hi> and not according to the <hi>dignity</hi> of their <hi>place:</hi> And indeed no ſervice ſhould be <hi>accounted low</hi> and <hi>baſe,</hi> which is ſincerely done for ſo <hi>great and high a Maſter,</hi> and hath the promiſe of ſo <hi>glorious a reward,</hi> Col. 3.23, 24.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>The greater and more excellent any mans work and calling is, his idleneſs and neligence is the greater ſin.</hi> It is <hi>bad</hi> in a <hi>Plow-man,</hi> or any day-labourer; but it is <hi>far worſe</hi> in a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of the Goſpel, or a <hi>Magiſtrate:</hi> Becauſe they wrong <hi>many</hi> and that in the <hi>greateſt things,</hi> and violate the <hi>greateſt truſt</hi> from God: Chriſt biddeth us pray the Lord of the <hi>harveſt to ſend forth Labourers into his harveſt,</hi> Luke 10.27. and not proud, covetous, idle drones, that would have honour only for their <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>titles:</hi> And he ſaith, that the <hi>Labourer is worthy of his hire,</hi> but not the <hi>loiterer.</hi> Among the Elders that rule the Church, it is <hi>eſpecially the labourers in the word and doctrine that are worthy of double honour.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> noteth on 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. that the Biſhops whom they are required to <hi>know</hi> and honour, were thoſe that <hi>laboured among them, and
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:59417:255"/>
were over them in the Lord, and admoniſhed them</hi>; and that it was [<hi>for their works ſake</hi>] that they were to <hi>eſteem them very highly in love.</hi>] The higheſt title that ever was put on Paſtors, was to be [<hi>Labourers together with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9.]</p>
               <p>And the calling of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> alſo requireth no ſmall dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. <hi>Jethro</hi> perſwadeth <hi>Moſes</hi> to take helpers, not that he might himſelf be idle, but leſt he ſhould <hi>wear away himſelf</hi> with doing more than he could undergo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.18.</p>
               <p>So the calling of a <hi>Schoolmaſter,</hi> and of <hi>Parents</hi> and Maſters of families, who have rational ſouls to inſtruct and govern, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a ſpecial diligence: And negligence in ſuch is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin, than in him that neglecteth ſheep or horſes.</p>
               <p>So alſo it is a great ſin in a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> becauſe he doth neglect <hi>mens lives</hi>; and in a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> when by ſloth he deſtroyeth mens eſtates: The greatneſs of the <hi>truſt,</hi> muſt greaten mens care.</p>

do it, there is no remedy: Neceſſity hath no Law: Or if one ſort of labour hurt you, when you can take up another, in which you may be as ſerviceable to the Common-wealth, you may chuſe that to which your ſtrength is ſuitable: But if you think that every <hi>ſudden pain</hi> or <hi>wearineſs</hi> is a ſufficient excuſe; or that ſome real hurt will warrant you in an idle life, you may as well think that your <hi>ſervant,</hi> and your Horſe or Oxe may ceaſe all their labour for <hi>you,</hi> when they are <hi>weary:</hi> or that your candle ſhould not burn, nor your knife be uſed in cutting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that uſe conſumeth them.</p>

Anſw.</hi> The labours of your callings are <hi>part of the ſervice of God:</hi> He hath ſet you <hi>both</hi> to do, and you muſt do <hi>both</hi>; that is, both ſpiritual and corporal work: And to quarrel with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to quarrel againſt God who hath appointed them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>But is it not worldlineſs when we follow worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, without any need? Anſw.</hi> 1.

He cannot be ſaid to have <hi>no need,</hi> who hath a body that needeth it, or liveth in <hi>Common-wealth</hi> that needeth it, and is a ſubject to God who commandeth it.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>But what if I find by conſtant experince, that my ſoul is more worldly after worldly buſineſs, and more cold and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from God? Anſw.</hi> What if you ſhould find it ſo after <hi>giving to the poor,</hi> or <hi>viſiting the ſick,</hi> or providing for your family? What then muſt you do? You muſt lament the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of your minds, and beg of God for ſuch grace as may fit you for your duties: And not caſt off your duty, becauſe you are ſo bad; but labour to be better, and to do it better. And 2.

Many a one thinks that to forſake all bodily labour, and to do nothing but the duties of Religion, doth benefit them more at the preſent; when perhaps in a little time, the ſickneſs of their bodies, or the melancholy deſtraction of their minds, doth loſe them more than they had gotten, and make them unfit for almoſt any duty

at all. And many a one that think their ſpiritual benefit is interrupted by their callings, do find all Gods Promiſes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled at laſt, to their ſatisfaction.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a duty to be as religious as you can: But it is alſo a duty to <hi>labour</hi> in your calling, and do all the good you can to others. The <hi>aged</hi> and <hi>impotent</hi> that cannot labour in a calling, are excuſed from it: And they that give up themſelves to the Magiſtracy, Miniſtry, Phyſick, &amp;c. muſt meddle with no lower things, which would hinder them in the higher. But no man can be excuſed from doing all the good he can to others, by any pretences of looking to his ſoul; For he can no way more ſurely further his ſalvation; nor cahe hinder it more, than by ſinful negligence and ſloth.</p>

               <p>Queſt. 9. <hi>Doth not</hi> Paul <hi>ſay to ſervants, If ye can be free, uſe it rather? Anſw.</hi> True: But he ſaith not, <hi>If you can be idle, uſe it rather.</hi> A <hi>free man</hi> may <hi>work</hi> as hard as a bondman.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 10. <hi>May not a man that hath ſeveral callings before him, chuſe the eaſieſt? Anſw.</hi> Not meerly or chiefly <hi>becauſe</hi> it is <hi>eaſie:</hi> but he muſt chuſe the moſt profitable to the common good, be it eaſie or hard, if it be ſuch as he can undergo. Yet he may avoid ſuch a calling, as by trying his body, indiſpoſeth him to ſpiritual things; or by taking up all his time, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of convenient leiſure for things ſpiritual. But he that only to eaſe his fleſh, doth put by more profitable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe they will coſt him labour, doth ſerve his fleſh, and caſt off his duty to his God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſigns of <hi>wealthy-idleneſs</hi> are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When men think it unneceſſary for them to labour conſtantly and diligently, becauſe they are rich, and can live without it</hi>; or becauſe they are <hi>great,</hi> and it is <hi>below</hi> them. The confutation
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:59417:258"/>
of which errour, I gave you before, and ſhall give you more of it anon. The <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> think not a laborious life <hi>below</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When men have time to ſpare:</hi> This is a moſt evident mark of Idleneſs: For God hath given us no time in vain; but hath given us full work, for all our time. They that have time to play away needleſly, to ſleep away needleſly, to prate away needleſly, do tell the world that <hi>Sodom's Idleneſs</hi> is their ſin. Eſpecially poor ſouls, who are yet unſanctified, and are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to a renewed heart and life, and are utterly unfit to die, O what abundance of important work have theſe to do? And can they be idle, while all this lyeth undone? Indeed if they are in deſpair of being ſaved, it is no wonder: And one would think by their lives that they did deſpair: For ſurely a man ſo neer another world, that muſt be in Heaven or Hell for ever, would never live idly, if he had any good hope that his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould not be all in vain. The poor in ſpirit have no time to ſpare: Labour is their life: Eternity is ſtill before their eyes. Neceſſity is upon them; and they know the wo that followeth Idleneſs: Repentance for ſin, and negligence paſt, is a conſtant ſpur to future diligence. And their work is ſweet, and incomparably more pleaſant to them than Idleneſs. If the Devil be ſo diligent, becauſe he knoweth that his time is ſhort, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12. it is a ſhame to them that are not ſo, who call themſelves the ſervants of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When mens labour hath but the time that's due to Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Recreation and Idleneſs hath the great part of time that's due to labour.</hi> The <hi>labour</hi> of the <hi>idle Sodomite,</hi> is like the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>reſerved Hypocrite:</hi> It is but the <hi>leavings of the fleſh,</hi> or ſomewhat that cometh in upon the by. But God is not unconſtant in his <hi>mercies unto us:</hi> He is <hi>ſtill preſerving</hi> us, and maintaining us: The Angels are <hi>ſtill guarding us:</hi> The faithful Miniſters of Chriſt are conſtant in teaching us (and loth that Satan ſhould hinder them, and ſave their labour:) Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magiſtrates alſo <hi>watch continually,</hi> to be a terrour to evil doers, and a praiſe to them that do well, as the Miniſters of God for our good: And can a ſhort and idle kind of labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then excuſe us? Chriſt ſaid, <hi>It was his meat to do his Fathers will,</hi> when he was endeavouring mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>John</hi> 4 34. And that <hi>he muſt do the work of him that
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:59417:258"/>
ſent him while it was day,</hi> John 9.4. And ſhall Idleneſs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in us? even in us who muſt be <hi>judged according to our works,</hi> Rev. 22.12. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.34. by him that hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every man his work? Yea when we are redeemed and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified to be <hi>zealous of good works,</hi> Titus 2.14. and <hi>are his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip created to good works in Chriſt, which God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we ſhould walk in them,</hi> Epheſ. 2.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>When men make a great matter of all their labour</hi>; and of that which to a diligent man is ſmall. The ſluggard hath his <hi>thorn hedge, and a Lion in the way,</hi> Prov. 22.13. &amp; 26.13, 15, 16. But the diligent ſay, when they have done their beſt, <hi>We are unprofitable ſervants:</hi> Nothing is ſo <hi>weary</hi> to them as unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable idleneſs (except hurtful wickedneſs.) They think ſtill, O how ſhort is time! and how much work is yet undone! And as every <hi>faithful Miniſter</hi> in his calling, is never ſo well pleaſed, as when he <hi>doth moſt</hi> for the good of ſouls; ſo is it with every <hi>faithful Chriſtian</hi> in his place. A Candle if it be not burnt, is loſt, and good for nothing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The idle <hi>Sodomite hath a mind which followeth the affections of his body:</hi> And as ſoon as his <hi>body</hi> is a <hi>little weary, his mind</hi> is ſo too, and ſuffereth the wearineſs of the body to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: Becauſe the fleſh is King within them. Nay a <hi>ſlothful mind</hi> doth <hi>oft begin,</hi> and they are weary to <hi>look upon their work,</hi> or <hi>to think of it,</hi> before it hath wearyed the body at all: And what they do, they do unwillingly; becauſe they are in <hi>love</hi> with idleneſs, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. But the lowly and laborious are in <hi>love with diligence and work:</hi> and therefore though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid the <hi>wearyneſs</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> their willing minds will carry on the body as far as it can well go. The diligent woman <hi>worketh willingly with her hands; her candle goeth not out by night, &amp;c.</hi> Prov. 31.13, &amp;c. Servants muſt <hi>do ſervice with good will, as to the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 6.7. If Miniſters preach and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>willingly, they have a reward,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.17. But not if they are only driven on by <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and the fear of <hi>woe,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. What ſhall we do <hi>willingly,</hi> if not <hi>our duties?</hi> He that <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth willingly,</hi> and <hi>ſerveth God,</hi> and followeth his labour <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,</hi> ſhall be rewarded according to <hi>his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The idle <hi>Sodomite</hi> doth <hi>love and chuſe that kind of life which is eaſieſt,</hi> and hath leaſt work to be done. This is the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:59417:259"/>
chief proviſion by which he fulfilleth his fleſhly luſt. An <hi>idle ſervant</hi> thinketh that the <hi>beſt place,</hi> in which he ſhall have moſt eaſe and fulneſs. An <hi>idle Parent</hi> will caſt all the burden of his childrens teaching, upon the Schoolmaſter and the Paſtor. An <hi>idle Miniſter</hi> thinketh himſelf beſt, where he may have no more labour, than what tendeth to his publick applauſe; and when he hath the <hi>moſt wealth</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>leaſt to do,</hi> he taketh that to be the flouriſhing proſperity of the Church. And indeed if our calling were like the <hi>ſouldiers</hi> to <hi>kill men,</hi> and not liker the Surgeons to <hi>cure them,</hi> we might think it is the beſt time, when we have leaſt employment.</p>
               <p>But the faithful ſervant will be moſt thankful for that ſtate of life, in which he doth moſt good: And as he taketh <hi>doing good,</hi> to be the ſureſt way of <hi>getting</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi>; ſo he taketh the good of another as his own; and anothers neceſſity is his neceſſity: He knoweth that he is beſt, who is likeſt unto God; and that is he that is the moſt abundant in love, and doing good: Like the Sun that never reſteth from moving or giving light and heat. The running ſpring is pure, when the ſtanding water is muddy and corrupt: The ceſſation of motion quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mortifieth the blood: He that ſaid as to works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Be not weary of well doing; for in due time, you ſhall reap, if you faint not,</hi> Gal. 6.9. hath ſaid ſo too, as to our bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in our common callings in the world, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.13.</p>
               <p>I know that a ſervant may be glad of a place where he is not oppreſſed with unreaſonable labour, and where he hath competent time for the learning of Gods Word: And a poor man may be glad when he is freed from neceſſity of doing that which is to his hurt: But otherwiſe no man but a fleſhly bruit will wiſh or contrive for a life of idleneſs.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Is it not ſaid, Bleſſed are the dead, for they reſt from their labours?</hi> Rev. 14.13. <hi>Anſ.</hi> True: but mark that their <hi>works follow them:</hi> And what are the works which follow you? And note, that it is not <hi>work</hi> or <hi>duty</hi> that they ſhall reſt from: (For <hi>they reſt not crying, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty, &amp;c.</hi>) But it is only their <hi>labours</hi>; that is, the <hi>painful ſort of work and ſuffering,</hi> proper to this ſinful life.

If your ſouls be unrenewed, and your aſſurance of ſalvation, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences yet to get, and few the better for you in the world, and you are yet unready for death and judgment, you give too full a proof of idleneſs. The diligent woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.16, &amp;c. could ſhew her labours in her treaſures, her Vineyard, the cloathing and proviſions of her family, &amp;c. ſhew yours by the good which you have done in the world, and by the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſouls for a better world. <hi>Let every man prove his own work, that he may have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in another,</hi> Gal. 6.3, 4. What caſe are your children in? Are they taught, or untaught? What caſe is your ſoul in? your <hi>fruit</hi> muſt judge you.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The miſchiefs of this Sodomitical Idleneſs, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt it, are (briefly) theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is contrary to the active nature of mans ſoul</hi>; which in activity exceedeth the fire it ſelf. It is as natural for a ſoul to be <hi>active,</hi> as for a ſtone or clod of earth to lie ſtill. And this active nature animateth the paſſive body, to move it, and uſe it in it's proper work. And ſhould this heavenly fire be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in the body, which it ſhould command and move? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.23. <hi>Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour till the evening.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is contrary to the common courſe of nature.</hi> Doth the Sun ſhine for you as well as for others? or doth it not? Doth all the frame of nature continue in its courſe (the air, the waters, the ſummer and winter) for you as well as for others, or not? If not, then you take not your ſelves beholden to God for them: And if you have no uſe for the Sun and other creatures, you have no uſe for life: for by them you live. But if <hi>yea,</hi> then what is it that they ſerve you for? Did God ever frame you ſo glorious a retinuue, to attend you only to ſleep, and laugh, and play, and to be idle? what, is all this for no higher an end? or rather do you not by your idleneſs forfeit life, and all theſe helps and maintainers of your lives?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is an unthankful reproach and blaſphemy againſt the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:59417:260"/>
God of Nature</hi>; yea and againſt the Lord your Redeemer; to think that the wiſe Almighty God, did make ſo noble a thing as a ſoul, and place it in ſo curious an engine as the body, where ſpirits, and blood, and heart, and lungs, are never idle, but in conſtant motion; and that he hath appointed us ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a retinue as aforeſaid, and all this to do nothing with, or worſe than nothing? To ſleep, and riſe, and dreſs your ſelves, and talk, and eat, and drink; to tell men only that you are not dead, leſt they ſhould miſtake, and bury you alive? what is it but to put a ſcorn on your Creator and Redeemer, to live as if he had created and redeemed you for no better and nobler ends than theſe?</p>
               <p n="4">4. You do <hi>as it were pray for death, or provoke God to take away your lives.</hi> For if they be good for nothing elſe but idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and beaſtly pleaſures, why ſhould you expect to have them continued? or at leaſt, why ſhould he not uſe you as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> and take away your reaſon, and turn you into beaſts, if the life and pleaſure of a beaſt be all that you deſire? Could not you eat, and drink, and ſleep, and play, without an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual ſoul?

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Idleneſs is a ſin which is contrary to Gods univerſal Law:</hi> The Law which extended to all times and places. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency was to labour: He that had all things prepared for his ſuſtenance by God, was yet himſelf to labour: He that was Lord of all the world, and was richer than any of our proud ones whoſoever, was yet to dreſs and keep the garden. <hi>Cain</hi> was a tiller of land, and <hi>Abel</hi> was a keeper of cattel, when they were heirs of all the earth. <hi>Noah</hi> alſo was Lord of all the world, and richer than you, and yet he was an Husbandman. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were Princes, and yet keepers of ſheep and cattle: It is not a bare permiſſion, but a precept of diligence in the fourth Commandment [<hi>Six daies ſhalt thou labour, and do all that thou haſt to do.</hi>] Chriſt himſelf did not live idly, but before his Miniſtry they ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.3. <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?</hi> And afterward how inceſſantly was he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to mens bodies and ſouls? And what laborious lives did his Apoſtles live? See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.5. &amp; 11.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.3. And are you exempt from the univerſal Law?</p>

None are freed from condemnation, nor are members of Chriſt, but <hi>they that walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>For the carnal mind is enmity againſt God,</hi> v. 7.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Idleneſs is a ſin much aggravated by its continuance.</hi> A drunkard is not alwaies drunken, nor a ſwearer is not alwaies ſwearing, nor a thief is not alwaies ſtealing; but an idle perſon is almoſt alwaies idle: whole hours and daies, if not weeks and years together. O what a continual courſe of ſin do our rich and gentile drones ſtill live in! As if they were afraid to do any thing, which when death cometh, they could comfortably be found doing!</p>

And what would they give for a little of it themſelves, upon the ſame terms, when it's gone, and when wiſhing is too late!</p>
               <p n="12">12. Idleneſs is a <hi>ſelf-contradicting</hi> ſin: None are ſo much <hi>afraid of dying as the idle</hi> (and I do not blame them if they knew all) and yet none more <hi>caſt away their lives:</hi> They <hi>die voluntarily</hi> continually: He that loſeth the <hi>uſe and benefit</hi> of life, doth loſe his <hi>life it ſelf:</hi> For what is it good for, but as a <hi>means</hi> to its <hi>ends?</hi> What difference between a man aſleep and dead, but only that one is more in expectation of uſefulneſs when he awaketh?

               <p n="14">14. By <hi>Idleneſs</hi> you ſhew that <hi>when you do labour, it is but for your carnal ſelves,</hi> and that it is not <hi>God</hi> whom you ſerve in your daily callings.

               <p n="15">15. <hi>Idleneſs is a forfeiture of your protection, and of your daily bread.</hi> God is not bound to keep you to play, and loiter, and do nothing.

or your Families, or whomſoever you ſhould labour for, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.9. <hi>He that is ſlothful in his work, is Brother to him that is a great waſter,</hi> Prov. 21.25. <hi>The deſire of the ſlothful killeth him, becauſe his hands refuſe to labour</hi>; that is, 1.

               <p n="17">17. <hi>The idle are drones and burdens of the Common-wealth:</hi> And the beſt ordered Governments have made Laws againſt them, as they did againſt other pernicious crimes, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Paul laboured day and night, that he might not be chargeable to any.</hi> And you think becauſe you <hi>have enough,</hi> that other men muſt labour <hi>for you,</hi> but you may live idly without any blame.

               <p n="18">18. <hi>Idleneſs depriveth you of the great delight of doing good.</hi> There is no ſuch pleaſure in this world, as is found in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful doing good: No man knoweth it but he that tryeth it, (and that without any conceits of merit, in commutative
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:59417:262"/>
Juſtice.) To do good in Magiſtracy for the piety, peace and ſafety of the people; to do good as Miniſters, for the ſaving of ſouls; to do good as Parents, to educate a holy ſeed; to do good as Phyſicians, to ſave mens lives, &amp;c. It is a pleaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding all voluptuouſneſs. And this the idle wilfully reject.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>You loſe all the reward of well doing at the laſt, and fall under the doom of the unprofitable ſervant,</hi> Mat. 25. who muſt be caſt into outer darkneſs. You muſt anſwer for all the talents of time, and health, and ſtrength, and parts, to him who will judge all according to what they have done in the body: And where ſhall the idle then appear?</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>Idleneſs will deſtroy your health and lives:</hi> Nothing but <hi>fulneſs</hi> (which is its companion) doth bring ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands unſeaſonably to the grave. And do you neither love your ſouls, nor your lives? Are you only for your preſent eaſe?</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Idleneſs breedeth melancholy, and corrupteth the fantaſie and mind, and ſo unfitteth you for all that is good.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Idle</hi> that will do no good, are fain to deviſe ſome vanity to do; ſome game, or play, or dreſs, or complement, &amp;c. or elſe they would grow addle-brained, and a ſhame and burden to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The conſtant labours of a lawful calling is one of the beſt cures of melancholy in the world, if it be done with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, ſucceſs and pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Laſtly, <hi>Idleneſs is the Nurſery of a world of vices.</hi> It is the field of temptation, where Satan ſoweth his tares while men are ſleeping. When they are idle, they are at leiſure for luſtful thoughts; for wanton dalliance; for idle talk; for needleſs ſports, and playes, and viſits; for gaming, and riotous feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking and exceſs; for pride, and an hundred vain cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities: Yea for contentions and miſchievous deſigns: Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſinful things muſt be done, when neceſſary duties are laid by.</p>
               <p>And if they are poor, idleneſs prepareth them to <hi>murmure</hi> and be <hi>diſcontent,</hi> and <hi>fallout,</hi> and contend with one another; to <hi>defraud</hi> others, and to <hi>ſteal.</hi> Theſe and more are the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fruits of Idleneſs.</p>
               <p>But here I muſt annex two Cautions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That none make this a pretence for a worldly mind and life; nor think that Religion is a fruit of Idleneſs; nor ſay
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:59417:263"/>
as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they would go ſacrifice to God, <hi>Ye are idle,</hi> Exod. 5.17. It is Idleneſs that maketh moſt men ungodly: They are convinced that it is better to meditate on Gods Word, and call upon his Name, and give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure; But they are idle, and ſay, There is a Lion in the way; what a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is it? we ſhall never endure it: As if their ſouls and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were not worth their labour, and as if they would go to Hell for eaſe; and as if the <hi>feaſt</hi> of joy and glory were not worth the labour of <hi>eating</hi> or receiving it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Make not this a pretence to oppreſs your ſervants with unmerciful labours, beyond their ſtrength; or ſuch as ſo weary them, and take up all their time, that they have not leiſure ſo much as to pray. It is Gods great mercy to ſervants, that he hath ſeparated the Lords day for a holy reſt; or elſe many would have little <hi>reſt,</hi> or means of <hi>holineſs.</hi> Some think that <hi>others</hi> can never labour enough <hi>for them,</hi> becauſe they pay them wages; and yet that they are bound to do nothing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even becauſe God hath given them <hi>more wages and wealth</hi> than he hath given to others.</p>
               <p>More particular Directions are as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Give up your ſelves by abſolute ſubjection to God as his ſervants; and then you can never reſt in an idle unſerviceable life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take all that you have, as Gods talents, and from his truſt; and then you dare not but prepare in the uſe of them, for your account.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Live as thoſe that are certain to die, and ſtill uncertain of the time, and that know what an eternal weight of joy or miſery dependeth upon the ſpending of your preſent time: And then you dare not live in Idleneſs. Live but as men whoſe ſouls are awake, to look before them into another world, and you will ſay (as I have long been forced to do) O how ſhort are the daies! how long are the nights! how ſwift is time! how ſlow is work! how far am I behind-hand! I am afraid leſt my life will be finiſhed before the work of life; and leſt my time will be done, while much of my work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth undone.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="491" facs="tcp:59417:263"/>4. Ask your ſelves what you would be found doing if death now ſurprize you? and whether work or idleneſs will be beſt in the review?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Try a laborious life of well-doing a while, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will draw you on.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Try your ſelves by a ſtanding reſolution, and engage your ſelves in neceſſary buſineſs, and that in a ſet and ſtated courſe; that neceſſity and reſolution may keep you from an idle life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Forſake the company of the idle and voluptuous, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the laborious and diligent.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Study well how to do the greateſt good you can, that the worth of the work may draw you on. For they that are of little uſe, for want of parts, or skill, or opportunity, are more liable to be tempted into idleneſs, as thinking their work is to no purpoſe: when the well-furniſhed perſon doth long to be exerciſing his wiſdom and vertue in profitable well-doing.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. How to live by Faith in Adverſity.</head>
               <p>IF I ſhould give you diſtinct Directions, for the ſeveral caſes of poverty, wrongs, perſecutions, unkindneſſes, contempt, ſickneſs, &amp;c. it would ſwell this Treatiſe yet bigger than I intended. I ſhall therefore take up with this <hi>general</hi> Advice.</p>
               <p>Direct. 1. <hi>In all Adverſity remember the evil of ſin, which is the cauſe, and the Holineſs and Juſtice of God which is exerciſed</hi>; and then the <hi>hatred of ſin, and the love of Gods Holineſs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> will make you quietly ſubmit. You will then ſay, when
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:59417:266"/>
Repentance is ſerious, <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him,</hi> Micah 7.9. And, <hi>why doth living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins?</hi> Lam. 3.39. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our waies, and turn again unto the Lord; for he hath ſmitten, and he will heal, &amp;c.</hi> v. 40, 41.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not</hi> Job<hi>'s caſe tell us, that ſome afflictions are only for tryal, and not for ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; it only telleth us that the reaſon why <hi>Job</hi> is <hi>choſen out at that time,</hi> to <hi>ſuffer more than other men,</hi> is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>was worſe than others,</hi> or <hi>us bad</hi>; but for <hi>his tryal</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> But 1. Affliction as it is now <hi>exiſtent</hi> in the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>mankind,</hi> is the fruit of <hi>Adams ſin at firſt,</hi> and contained in the peremptory unremitted ſentence. 2. And this general ſtate of ſuffering mankind, is now in the hand and power of Chriſt, who ſometimes indeed doth let out more on the beſt than upon others, and that eſpecially for their tryal and good; but uſually ſome ſins of their own alſo have a hand in them, and procure the evil, though his mercy turn it to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
               <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Deal cloſely and faithfully with your hearts and lives in a ſuffering time,</hi> and reſt not till your conſciences are well aſſured that no ſpecial provocation is the cauſe, or elſe do teſtifie that you have truly repented, and reſolved againſt it.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe you may lengthen your diſtreſs, if you leave that thorn in your ſore which cauſeth it: Or elſe God may change it into a worſe; or may give you over to impenitency, which is worſt of all: Or at leaſt, you will want that aſſured peace with God, and ſolid peace of conſcience, which muſt be your ſupport and comfort in affliction; and ſo will ſink under it, as unable to bear it.</p>
               <p>Direct. 3. Remember that the <hi>ſanctifying fruit of Adverſity is firſt and more to be looked after, than either the comfort, or the deliverance.</hi> And therefore that all men, no nor all Chriſtians, muſt not uſe the <hi>ſame method,</hi> in the <hi>ſame affliction,</hi> when as their ſpiritual caſes differ.</p>
               <p>A <hi>cleared conſcience,</hi> and one that hath walked faithfully with God, and fruitfully in the world, and kept himſelf from his iniquity, may bend moſt of his thoughts to the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:59417:266"/>
promiſes, and happy end. But one man hath been bold with wilful ſin, and his work muſt be firſt, to renew repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſee that there be no root of bitterneſs left behind, and to ſet upon true reformation of life, and reparation of the hurt which he hath done.</p>
               <p>Another is grown into love with the world, and hath let out his heart to pleaſant thoughts and hopes of proſperity, and alienated his thoughts more than before from God. This man muſt firſt perceive his errour, and hear Gods voice which call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him home, and ſee the characters of vanity and vexation, written on the face of that which he over-loved; and then think of comfort when he hath got a cure.</p>
               <p>Another is grown dull and careleſs of his ſoul, and hath loſt much of his ſenſe of things eternal, and is cold in love, and cold in prayer, and liveth as if he were grown weary of God, and weary of well doing. His work muſt be to feel the ſmart of Gods diſpleaſure, ſo far as to awaken him to repentance, and ſet him again with former ſeriouſneſs, upon his duty: And when he mendeth his pace, he may deſire to be eaſed of the rod and ſpur. But to give <hi>unſeaſonable cordials</hi> to any of theſe, is but to fruſtrate the affliction, and to hurt them, and prepare for worſe. Nay, and when they are comforted <hi>in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> it muſt be with due caution: <hi>Go thy way, and ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> It is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rp a means doth call them to.</p>
               <p>Direct. 4. Remember that <hi>your part in affliction</hi> is to <hi>do your duty,</hi> and to <hi>get the benefit of it:</hi> but to <hi>remove</hi> it is <hi>Gods</hi> part: Therefore be you careful about that part which is your <hi>own,</hi> and then make no queſtion but God will do <hi>his part.</hi> Let it be your firſt queſtion therefore [<hi>What is it that I am obliged to in this condition?</hi>] What is the <hi>ſpecial duty</hi> of one in this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this poverty, impriſonment, reſtraint, contempt, or ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which I undergo?] Be careful daily to <hi>do that duty,</hi> and then never fear the iſſue of your ſuffering: Nothing can go amiſs to him that is found in the way of his <hi>duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:59417:267"/>And let it be your next queſtion, What ſpiritual good may be got by this affliction? May not my repentance be renewed? my ſelf-denyal, humility, contempt of the world, patience, and confidence on God, be exerciſed and increaſed by it? and is not this the end of my heavenly Father? Is not his rod an act of love and kindneſs to me? Doth he not offer me by it all this good?</p>
               <p>And let your next queſtion be [<hi>Have I yet got that good which God doth offer me? Have I any conſiderable benefit to ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w, which I have received by this affliction ſince it came?</hi>] If not, why ſhould you deſire it to be taken away? Play not the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in <hi>ſpeaking that good</hi> of an afflicting God, which you do not ſeriouſly believe: If you believe that God is <hi>wiſer</hi> than you, to know what is fitteſt for you, and that he is <hi>better</hi> than you, and therefore hath <hi>better ends</hi> than you can have; and that really he offereth you far greater good by your ſufferings, than he taketh from you: Let your affections then be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this belief: Are you afraid of your <hi>own commodity?</hi> Do you impatiently long to be delivered from your gain? are you ſo childiſh as to pull off the plaiſter, if you believe that it is curing the ſore? and that it cannot be well and ſafely done without it? Do you call it the fruit of Gods <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and yet be as weary of it, as if there were nothing in it but his wrath? Truſt God with his work who never faileth; and be careful of your own, who are conſcious of untruſtineſs.</p>
               <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Look principally to your hearts, that they grow not to an over-valuing of the proſperity of the fleſh; nor to an under-valuing of holineſs and the proſperity of the ſoul.</hi> For this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy carnality doth both cauſe affliction, and make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and impatient under it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that is a worldling, or a voluptuous fleſh pleaſer, and ſavoureth nothing but the things of the fleſh, will think himſelf undone, when his pleaſure, and plenty, and honour with men, is taken away. Nothing maketh men grieve for the loſs of any worldly commodity, ſo much as the <hi>over-loving</hi> of it. It is <hi>Love</hi> that <hi>ſeeketh</hi> it when you are in <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> that <hi>mourneth</hi> when you are in <hi>want,</hi> as well as <hi>Love</hi> which <hi>delighteth in it</hi> when you <hi>poſſeſs it</hi>: As ſick men uſe to <hi>love health</hi> better than thoſe that never felt the want of it; ſo it is too
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:59417:267"/>
common with <hi>poor men</hi> to love <hi>riches</hi> better than the rich that never needed: (And yet, poor ſouls, they deceive themſelves, and cry out againſt the rich, as if <hi>they</hi> were the only lovers of the world, when they <hi>love</hi> it more themſelves, though they cannot <hi>get it.</hi>) Never think of bearing affliction with a patient and ſubmiſſive mind, as long as you <hi>over-love</hi> the things which affliction taketh from you: For the loſs of them will tear thoſe hearts which did ſtick ſo inordinately to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if you grow to an undervaluing of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> you can never be reconciled to afflicting providence. For it is <hi>for our profit</hi> that God correcteth us; but for what profit? that we <hi>may be partakers of his holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.10, 14. If therefore you undervalue that which is Gods end, and goeth for your gain, you will never think that you are gainers or ſavers by his rod. In correction God doth as it were make a bargain with you; he will take away your riches, or your friends, or your health, and he will give you (if you refuſe it not) increaſe of patience, and mortification in the ſtead of them: he will exchange ſo much heavenly-mindedneſs, for ſo much of the treaſures or pleaſures of the world. And now, if you do not like the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if really you had rather have more health, than more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; more of the world, than more heavenly-mindedneſs; more fleſhly pleaſure, than more mortification of fleſhly deſires, you will never then like the correcting hand of God, nor right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit by it: You will grudge at his dealing, and wiſh that you were out of his hand, and in your own; and that your eſtates, and health, and friends, were not at his diſpoſal, but at yours; and you will loſe the offered benefit, becauſe you value it not, and accept it not as it is offered you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And thoſe that have ſome eſteem of Holineſs, and yet neglect the duty which ſhould procure the exerciſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace, do make correction burdenſome by making it unprofitable to them. For to hear that they <hi>may</hi> be gainers by affliction, and to find that they <hi>are not,</hi> will not reconcile them to it. Whereas if they had really got the benefit, it would quiet them, and comfort them, and make them patient, and thankful to their Father. What have you to ſhew that you gained by your ſufferings? Are you really more mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, more penitent, more humble, more heavenly, more
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:59417:268"/>
obedient, more patient than you were before? If you are ſo, you cannot poſſibly think that it hath been to your loſs to be afflicted: For no one that hath theſe graces can ſo undervalue them, as to think that worldly proſperity or eaſe is better. But if you have not ſuch <hi>gain to ſhew,</hi> what wonder if you are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the medicine which healeth not? and if, when you have <hi>made</hi> it do you no good, you complain of <hi>it,</hi> when it is <hi>your ſelves,</hi> that you ſhould complain of. If you could ſay, that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you were afflicted, you went aſtray, but now you have learnt</hi> and kept <hi>Gods precepts,</hi> you might then ſay by experience, <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted,</hi> Pſal. 119.67, 71. And men are taught by natural ſelf-love, not to think ill of that which doth that which doth them good, if by experience they know it. You will then confeſs that <hi>God in very faithfulneſs afflicteth you,</hi> Pſal. 119.75.</p>
               <p>Direct. 6. Remember that <hi>nothing can be amiſs which is done by God:</hi> For where there is perfection of <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> no actions can be <hi>bad.</hi> And there is nothing done by any of your afflicters, which is not governed by the will of God, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> 2 Chron. 10.15. <hi>So the King hearkened not to the people; for the cauſe was of God, that the Lord might perform his Word</hi>—God who would not <hi>cauſe the ſin,</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the <hi>event</hi> as a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> becauſe he wiſely permitted it for that end, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>Him being delivered by the determinate counſel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain</hi>—Acts 4.28. <hi>The people of Iſrael were gathered to do, whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel determined before to be done:</hi> That is, he willed by his <hi>antecedent</hi> will, that Chriſt ſhould be a ſacrifice for ſin; and he willed by his <hi>conſequent</hi> will, (as a Judge and puniſher of mans ſin) that the rebellious Jews ſhould be left to their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wills, to execute it. And that God which moderateth the wills and actions of the moſt malicious men and Devils, will reſtrain them from violating any of his promiſes for his ſervants good.</p>

If you did determine to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Chriſt crucified, and by his croſs had crucified the the world, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.) you would be able to ſay, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, yet I live,</hi> that is, <hi>not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. And to look on the pleaſure and glory of the world, as the world did look on a crucified Chriſt, when they ſhook the head at him as he hanged on the croſs. You would love the narrow ſuffering way, where you ſee before you the footſteps of your Lord, and of ſo many holy Martyrs and Believers: You would ſay, ſure this is the ſafe and bleſſed way, in which Chriſt, and all the heavenly Army have paſſed hence unto their Crown: You would ſay, <hi>Is the ſervant grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his Lord?</hi> If thus the innocent Lord of life, and <hi>Maſter of the houſe</hi> was injured and afflicted, am I better than he? Though he ſuffered to ſave me from Hell, yet not to ſave me from the purifying tryals here on earth. <hi>Doubtleſs you would count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and count them but dung that you might win him— and that you might know him, and the power of his reſurrection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable to his death,</hi> Phil. 3.8, 10.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX. How to live by Faith, in troubles of Conſcience, and doubts or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours about our ſpiritual and everlaſting ſtate.</head>
               <p>HAving written a Treatiſe called, <hi>The Right Method for Spiritual Peace and Comfort, &amp;c.</hi> upon this ſubject al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, I muſt refer the Reader thither, and here only add theſe few Directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:59417:271"/>Direct. 1. <hi>Diſtinguiſh of the ſeveral Cauſes of theſe troubles</hi>; and take heed of thoſe unskilful Mountebanks, who have the ſame cure for every ſuch diſeaſe, and ſpeak preſent comfort to all that they hear complain; and that think every trouble of mind is ſome notable work of the Spirit of God; when it is often the fruit of the manifold weakneſs or wilfulneſs of the troubled complainers.</p>
               <p>Direct. 2. <hi>When it is ſome heinous ſin committed, or great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption indulged, which doth cauſe the trouble, be ſure that ſound Repentance be never omitted in the cure; and that a real reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prove the truth of that Repentance.</hi> For Chriſt never died to juſtifie and ſave the impenitent ſinner: And a <hi>deceitful Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is the <hi>common ſelf-deceit</hi> and <hi>undoing</hi> of the world. And how can that be <hi>true Repentance,</hi> which changeth not the <hi>will and life?</hi> God will not give you peace and comfort, as long as you indulge your wilful ſin.</p>
               <p>Note here the difference between 1. The groſly impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: 2. And the mock-repentance of the Hypocrite: 3. And the true Repentance of ſound Believers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The groſly impenitent cannot bring his heart to a <hi>ſerious purpoſe</hi> to let go his ſin, nor to a <hi>conſent</hi> or <hi>willingneſs,</hi> that God ſhould <hi>cure him,</hi> and <hi>change</hi> his mind: but he had rather have his pride, and covetouſneſs, and ſenſuality, to be <hi>fully pleaſed,</hi> than to be <hi>mortified.</hi> Like a fool in a Feaver or a Dropſie, that had rather have <hi>drink,</hi> than have the <hi>cure</hi> of his <hi>thirſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The mock repentance of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> hath <hi>ſome purpoſes</hi> under an extraordinary conviction, to leave his ſin; and for a time may ſeem to do it. But when the temptation is as ſtrong again, he is the ſame, and returneth to his vomit; or elſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeth his ſin for a worſe. And if you ask him whether he had rather have the <hi>mortifying</hi> of all his luſts, or the <hi>pleaſing</hi> of them, his underſtanding and conviction may cauſe him truly to ſay at the preſent, that if God would <hi>preſently mortifie</hi> his ſin, or <hi>offer him this in choice,</hi> he would rather conſent to it, than take the <hi>pleaſing</hi> of them. But mark it, 1. That though he conſent that <hi>God ſhould do this himſelf</hi>; yet he will not conſent to <hi>uſe the means, and do his duty</hi> to attain it. If a <hi>cold wiſh,</hi> or <hi>bare conſent</hi> would change his ſoul, and take away all ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:59417:271"/>
at once, that he might never more deſire the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſin, nor be put to any conflict to overcome it, nor any great difficulty to deny it, and all this might be done without any labour of his own, I doubt not but the Hypocrite would conſent to be ſo mortified. But to <hi>watch, and pray, and read, and meditate, and uſe the means</hi> which God appointeth him, both to <hi>get</hi> mortification, and to <hi>uſe</hi> it for the conquering of every temptation; this the Hypocrite will <hi>not conſent</hi> to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And what he <hi>doth conſent to</hi> at the preſent, he conſenteth not to when his ſinful pleaſure is revived by the <hi>next tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But the <hi>true penitent Chriſtian</hi> is both <hi>willing to be changed</hi> and had rather have his luſts to be <hi>killed,</hi> than <hi>pleaſed</hi>; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo willing to <hi>uſe Gods means</hi> both to mortifie the <hi>inward luſt,</hi> and to overcome the <hi>outward ſin:</hi> And this in ſincerity is his <hi>habitual ſtate.</hi>

               <p>Direct. 4. The particular application of this to our ſelves, is, 1. By <hi>Believing,</hi> and then by <hi>knowing that we do believe</hi>; and then by <hi>diſcerning our priviledges upon believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our <hi>believing</hi> it ſelf is, 1. Our <hi>Aſcent</hi> to the truth of the Goſpel: 2. Our <hi>Acceptance</hi> of the good (even Chriſt and life) which is <hi>offered</hi> in it, and <hi>conſent to the Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit:</hi> And 3. Our <hi>Affiance</hi> in Chriſt and his Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>know that we do believe</hi> (ſomehow) is <hi>eaſie,</hi> when we do it: But to be ſure that this <hi>belief is ſincere and ſaving,</hi> is more difficult, becauſe of the <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> of man, and the <hi>mixtures of unbelief,</hi> and other ſins, and the <hi>weakneſs of grace</hi> where it is true, and the <hi>counterfeits of it,</hi> and the <hi>inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient degrees</hi> which are in Hypocrites; ſo that it is not eaſie to diſcern whether the faith which we have be ſincere, and <hi>predominant above our ſenſe and our unbelief</hi> (as it muſt be.) But
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:59417:272"/>
yet it may be known by ſuch means as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By labouring to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> and <hi>increaſe</hi> our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> that it may not by the ſmalneſs be next to undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 2. By <hi>ſubduing all contrary inward</hi> corruptions, which obſcure it. 3. By <hi>frequent exerciſing it</hi>; ſeeing habits are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned only in their acts. 4. By reſiſting and <hi>conquering temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> and <hi>doing all the good</hi> we can in the world, and living as wholly devoted to God, above all worldly fleſhly intereſt; that ſo 1 Faith may be <hi>evidenced</hi> by its fruits: 2. And <hi>God</hi> may <hi>reward</hi> the faithful ſoul with his aſſuring ſeal, and light and comfort. 5. By eſcaping all thoſe <hi>lapſes</hi> into <hi>heinous and wilful ſin,</hi> which cauſe wounds, and ſears, and hinder aſſurance, peace and joy. 6. By a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>conſtant examination</hi> of the heart, and obſervation of it, in the time of tryal, and finding the habits and ſtrength of faith, and of unbelief, in their ſeveral actings, and prevalencies in their conflicts. 7. And withall, eſcaping thoſe <hi>ignorances</hi> and <hi>errours,</hi> about the nature, means, cauſes and ſigns of grace and aſſurance, which keep many from it, who have juſtifying faith. Theſe ſeven are the true and neceſſary means to get <hi>aſſurance</hi> of your <hi>own ſincerity,</hi> and that indeed you have the true <hi>ſeal,</hi> and <hi>earneſt,</hi> and <hi>witneſs</hi> of the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When you have firſt truly <hi>believed</hi> (or <hi>conſented</hi> to the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant</hi> of Grace) and next <hi>got aſſurance</hi> that you <hi>do this in ſincerity,</hi> the laſt part is the eaſieſt, which is to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the <hi>priviledges,</hi> or comfortable <hi>concluſions</hi> which follow hereupon: Which are your <hi>pardon and juſtification,</hi> your <hi>adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and right to life eternal,</hi> and to all the benefits promiſed by God, in that Covenant to which you do conſent; which are all comprehended in the three great Relations eſtabliſhed by, the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> that God is your <hi>Reconciled God and Father Chriſt in your Head and Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit is your Life and Sanctifier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three works which make up aſſurance, are contained in the three parts of this ſyllogiſm. 1. He that truly believeth, is juſtified, and adopted, and an heir of life. But I do truly believe: Therefore I am juſtified, adopted, and am an heir of life.</p>
               <p>Or thus to the ſame ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:59417:272"/>Every one who truly conſenteth to the Baptiſmal Covenant, hath right to the bleſſings of the Covenant; God is his Father, Chriſt is his Saviour, and the holy Spirit is his Sanctifier. But I do truly conſent to the Baptiſmal Covenant: Therefore I have right to all the benefits of it: God is my Father, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Direct. 5. Remember that <hi>when you have got aſſurance, and have truly gathered this concluſion, the continual and lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of faith, is ſtill neceſſary to your actual joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is poſſible for a man to have no <hi>notable doubtings</hi> of his own ſincerity or ſalvation, and yet to have ſuch <hi>dulneſs</hi> of ſoul, and ſuch <hi>diverſions</hi> of his thoughts, as that he ſhall enjoy but little of the comforts of his own aſſurance. Therefore true joy requireth much more, than bare ſelf examination, and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our evidences, and right to life.</p>
               <p>Direct. 6. <hi>When doubts and troubles are cauſed by ignorance or errour, about the true nature and ſigns of grace, and the way of aſſurance</hi> (which is very common) <hi>nothing then is more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than a ſound and skilful Teacher</hi>; to work out thoſe miſtakes, and to help the ignorant Chriſtian to a clearer underſtanding of the terms of the Covenant, and the ſenſe of the Promiſe, and the true methods of Chriſt in his gifts and operations. Otherwiſe the erring ſoul will be diſtracted and loſt in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of doubts, and either ſit down at laſt preſumptuouſly on falſe grounds, or turn to one errour to cure the troubles of another; or languiſh in deſpair; ſo lamentable a thing is it to be poſſeſſed with falſe principles, and to attempt ſo great a work in the dark.</p>
               <p>Direct. 7. And here there are theſe two extreams to be carefully avoided: 1. That of the Infidel and Juſticiary, who truſteth and teacheth others to truſt to his own <hi>vertues and works without a Saviour,</hi> or aſcribeth the <hi>part</hi> of a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to them.</hi> 2. The Antinomian and <hi>Libertine,</hi> who teach men <hi>not to look at any thing in themſelves at all,</hi> no not as an <hi>evidence,</hi> or <hi>condition,</hi> or <hi>means,</hi> much leſs as <hi>any cauſe</hi> of life; but to truſt to Chriſts blood, to be to you <hi>inſtead of Faith, and Repentance, and Obedience,</hi> and all your uſe of means; and do aſcribe the <hi>part of theſe duties</hi> of man, to the blood of Chriſt; as if it did belong only to Chriſt to do that ſame thing which belongeth unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:59417:273"/>Therefore here you muſt be ſure to be well acquainted what is truly the <hi>office and part of Chriſt</hi>; and what is truly the <hi>office and part of Faith,</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> of <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> of <hi>Prayer, &amp;c.</hi> And to be ſure that you <hi>wholly truſt Chriſt</hi> for <hi>his part,</hi> and joyn not Faith, nor any of your own works or duties in the leaſt degree of <hi>that truſt</hi> or <hi>honour</hi> which belongeth to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>his office</hi> and <hi>work:</hi> And that you faithfully <hi>uſe</hi> (yea I will ſay, <hi>Truſt</hi> too, though ignorance ſnarl at it) your <hi>Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Prayer, &amp;c. in</hi> and for <hi>its own office and part</hi>; and do not fooliſhly blaſpheme Chriſt, by aſcribing the <hi>part and office of your duty</hi> unto <hi>him and his office,</hi> under pretence of giving him the honour of them. It is <hi>Chriſts office</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> to be a <hi>ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> and a <hi>propitiation for us,</hi> and a <hi>perfect Saviour</hi> and <hi>Interceſſor,</hi> and to <hi>give us the Spirit,</hi> by which we believe, repent, pray, obey, hope, love, &amp;c.

               <p>Direct. 8. In this caſe alſo take heed of thoſe ignorant guides, who <hi>know not the errours of fancy, melancholy, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed paſſions, from the proper works of the Spirit of God:</hi> For they wrong the Spirit, when they aſcribe mens ſinful weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to him: And they greatly wrong the troubled ſinner many waies: 1. They puff up men with conceits that they are under ſome great and excellent workings of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> when they are the works of <hi>Satan,</hi> and their own <hi>infirmity</hi> or ſin. 2. They teach them hereby to magnifie and <hi>cheriſh</hi> thoſe <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,</hi> and <hi>paſſions,</hi> and <hi>thoughts,</hi> which they ſhould <hi>reſiſt,</hi> and lament, and caſt away. 3. And they ſet them in an Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick, or <hi>truly Fanatical</hi> way of Religion, to look for <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> or live ſtill upon their own <hi>fancies,</hi> and <hi>paſſions,</hi> and <hi>diſtempers,</hi> and Satans temptations, conceiting that they live upon the incomes of God, and are actuated in all this by the Holy Ghoſt. And of what miſchievous importance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:59417:273"/>
all this is, and how much hurt ſuch zealous ignorance doth, both in the Teachers and the people, the thing it ſelf doth plainly ſhew; and the ſad experience of this age doth ſhew it more plainly, in Ranters, Quakers, and other true Fanaticks, and in many women, and other weak perſons, of better principles than theirs.</p>
               <p>And it is an unſafe courſe which many ſuch weak perſons uſe, to think in their troubles that every text of Scripture which cometh into their mind, or every conceit of their own is a ſpecial ſuggeſtion of the Spirit of God: You ſhall ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily hear them ſay, [<hi>Such a text was brought to me, or was ſet upon my heart, and ſuch a thing was ſet upon my mind</hi>] when two to one, it was <hi>no otherwiſe brought</hi> unto them, nor ſet upon them, than any other ordinary thoughts are; and had no ſpecial or extraordinary operation of God in it at all. Though it is certain that <hi>every good thought</hi> which cometh into our minds, is <hi>ſome effect</hi> of the working of Gods Spirit, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good <hi>word,</hi> and every good <hi>work</hi> is; and it is certain that ſometimes Gods Spirit doth guide and comfort Chriſtians as a <hi>remembrancer,</hi> by bringing informing and comforting texts and doctrines to their <hi>remembrance</hi>; yet it is a dangerous thing to think that <hi>all ſuch ſuggeſtions</hi> or <hi>thoughts</hi> are from ſome <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> or <hi>extraordinary work of the Spirit,</hi> or that <hi>every text</hi> that cometh into our minds, is brought thither by the <hi>Spirit of God at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Satan</hi> can bring a text or truth to our remembrance for his own ends, as he did to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. in his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our <hi>own paſſions</hi> or running thoughts, may light upon ſome text or truth accidentally, as they do on other things which ſo come in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth in an <hi>ordinary way</hi> help us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring or meditating on any text or holy doctrine, he doth it according to our <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> and not in the way of <hi>infallible inſpiration,</hi> and therefore there is much of <hi>our weakneſs</hi> and <hi>errour</hi> uſually mixt with the <hi>Spirits help,</hi> in the product: As when you hold the hand of a child in writing, you write not ſo well by his hand, as by your own alone, but
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:59417:274"/>
                  <hi>your skill,</hi> and his <hi>weakneſs</hi> and unskilfulneſs do both appear in the letters which are made; ſo is it in the ordinary aſſiſtance of the Spirit in our ſtudies, meditations, prayers, &amp;c. other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all that we do would be <hi>perfect,</hi> in which we have the Spirits help; which Scripture, and all Chriſtians experience do contradict.</p>

               <p>Direct. 1. <hi>Come not before God with Phariſaical conceits of the worthineſs of your ſelves, or Worſhip, as if you offered him ſomething which did oblige him: But come as humble receivers, that need him and his grace, who needeth not you; and as learners that hope to be wiſer and better by drawing neer to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You know Chriſts inſtance of the prayers of the Phariſee and the Publican: And remember that many a ones <hi>heart</hi> ſaith, <hi>I thank thee Lord that I am not as other men, or as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,</hi> whoſe <hi>tongue</hi> can ſpend an hour or more in ſad confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; yea and that it is thoſe very <hi>copious confeſſions</hi> of their <hi>badneſs,</hi> that puff them up as if they were ſo good.</p>

               </p>
               <p>All this telleth us, that fools and hypocrites, while they diſobey Gods Law, do think to make up all with ſacrifice, or to appeaſe God with offering him ſomething that is excellent: But the acceptable Worſhipper cometh to God as a <hi>penitent, a learner,</hi> reſolving to obey; as a <hi>Receiver of mercy,</hi> and not a <hi>meriter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="521" facs="tcp:59417:279"/>And if another man hear a form of prayer, eſpecially if it be read out of a Book; and eſpecially if it have any diſorder or defect, he ſticketh not to reviſe it, and call it <hi>falſe Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>mans Inventions,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and to fly from it, and make the world believe, that it is an odious thing which God abhorreth. And why ſo? <hi>Are your words</hi> ſo much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the words of <hi>others?</hi> Or doth the <hi>Book,</hi> or <hi>Preſs,</hi> or <hi>Pen,</hi> make them odious to God?

               <p>Many a time I have heard ſuch forms of prayers, whoſe diſorders and defects I have much lamented (and done my part to have cured) and yet I durſt not ſo reproach them as to ſay, God will not accept and hear them: Or that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to joyn in communion with them.

And though this prayer was more diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly than the forms which (<hi>perhaps in that prayer</hi>) were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of diſorder; yet durſt I not run away from this neither, nor ſay, it is ſo bad, that God will not hear it, nor good men ſhould have no comunion in it.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie (but abominable) to fall in love with <hi>our own,</hi> and to vilifie that which is againſt our opinion, and to think that God is of our mind, and is as fond of our mode and way as we are, and as exceptious againſt the way or words of other men, as childiſh, pieviſh Chriſtians are.

               <p>For the reaſon why your ſeed is called <hi>Holy,</hi> and in a <hi>better caſe</hi> than the ſeed of <hi>Infidels,</hi> is not meerly becauſe they are the <hi>off-ſpring of your bodies,</hi> and have their <hi>natures</hi> from you; much leſs as deriving any <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>vertue</hi> from you by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But becauſe you are perſons your ſelves who <hi>have dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated your ſelves with all that you have, abſolutely to God by Chriſt:</hi> And <hi>they</hi> being <hi>your own,</hi> and therefore at <hi>your diſpoſal, your wills</hi> are taken for <hi>their wills,</hi> ſo far as you act in their names, and on their behalf: And therefore when you <hi>dedicate them to God,</hi> you do but that which you have both <hi>power</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> to do: And therefore <hi>God accepteth</hi> what <hi>you ſo dedicate</hi> to him.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many whoſe Judgement is againſt <hi>baptizing them,</hi> is not againſt an offering or <hi>dedicating them to God.</hi> And thoſe who think that they are not allowed <hi>ſolemnly to enter them into Covenant with God,</hi> yet <hi>really do that</hi> which is the <hi>ſame thing:</hi> For they cannot be imagined, to be <hi>unwilling,</hi> to <hi>dedicate them to God,</hi> to the utmoſt of that intereſt and power, which they underſtand that God hath given them: and doubtleſs they moſt earneſtly deſire that <hi>according to their capacity,</hi> they may be the <hi>children of God,</hi> and <hi>God will be their God in Chriſt.</hi> And this <hi>vertual dedication</hi> ſeemeth to be the principal requiſite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>

               <p>It is the concluſion of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> in <hi>Artic.</hi> 1. And the reaſon is this.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Parent and child</hi> be in the <hi>ſame Covenant,</hi> then if that <hi>Covenant pardon</hi> and <hi>adopt</hi> the <hi>Parent,</hi> it doth <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>adopt</hi> the <hi>child:</hi> But the <hi>Parent and child</hi> are <hi>in the ſame Covenant:</hi> Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>God hath but <hi>one Covenant</hi> on his part, which is ſealed by baptiſm (as I have proved at large to Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi>) Indeed ſome are only <hi>externally in Covenant</hi> with him on <hi>their part,</hi> that is, they did covenant only with the <hi>tongue,</hi> and not the <hi>heart:</hi> And conſequently God is no further in covenant with them, than to <hi>allow and command his Miniſters</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> them into the <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> and give them its priviledges; and is not as a <hi>Promiſer in Covenant with them at all himſelf,</hi> either for <hi>inward,</hi> or for <hi>outward bleſſings.</hi> He hath not <hi>one Covenant</hi> which giveth <hi>outward,</hi> and another which giveth <hi>inward</hi> bleſſings.</p>

                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:59417:287"/>And it is here ſuppoſed, that the <hi>only condition</hi> prerequiſite on the <hi>Infants</hi> part, that he may have <hi>right</hi> to this Covenant, and its bleſſings, is that he <hi>be the ſeed of a true Believer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in Covenant to God by the Parents will or act.</hi> Actual Faith is not prerequired: Seminal grace may be inherent, but 1.

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe therefore being prerequiſite as a condition, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that as the <hi>Parents dedicating themſelves to God,</hi> if <hi>baptized at age,</hi> is the condition of <hi>their</hi> certain title to the <hi>preſent bleſſings</hi> of the Covenant (<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God be their Father, Chriſt their Saviour, and the Spirit in Covenant to operate in them to ſanctification,</hi> and their <hi>ſins are all pardoned, and they are heirs of Heaven</hi>) even ſo upon the Parents <hi>dedication of their children to God, they</hi> have right to the ſame bleſſings; elſe why do we baptize them, ſeeing Baptiſm in the true nature and uſe of it, is a <hi>ſolemn dedicating them to God, in that ſame Covenant, and a ſolemn inveſting them in the relations and rights of that ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Covenant,</hi> and not in any other.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay that <hi>all baptized Infants,</hi> ſo dying, are ſaved, be they the children of <hi>Infidels,</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> and remaining their true propriety; nor thoſe that are offered and baptized never ſo wrongfully, or hypocritically; nor will I ſtay to diſpute for what I have aſſerted. But 1. I exhort Chriſtians <hi>believingly to dedicate</hi> their children in Covenant with God in Chriſt: And 2. To believe that if they ſo dye, that Covenant of Chriſt forbiddeth them to doubt of their ſalvation.</p>

               <p>Direct. 1. <hi>TAke heed that you loſe not that common Love which you owe to mankind, nor that deſire of the increaſe of the Kingdom of Chriſt, which muſt keep up in you a conſtant compaſſion to the unconverted world,</hi> viz. <hi>Idolaters, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and ungodly Hypocrites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is pittiful to obſerve the unchriſtian ſenſleſneſs of moſt zealous Profeſſors of Religion in this point: Though God hath purpoſely put the three publick Petitions firſt in the Lords Prayer, to tell them what they muſt firſt and moſt deſire, that is, the <hi>hallowing of his Name, and the coming of his Kingdom, and the doing of his Will on Earth as it is in Heaven</hi>; yet they ſeem not to <hi>underſtand it,</hi> or to <hi>regard</hi> it: But their thoughts and deſires are as <hi>ſelfiſh, and private, and narrow,</hi> as if they knew nothing what the <hi>World</hi> or the <hi>Church</hi> is, or cared for neither. Their mind and talk is all of their <hi>own matters,</hi> for <hi>body</hi> or <hi>ſoul,</hi> or of their ſeveral <hi>Parties,</hi> and <hi>particular Churches</hi>; or if any extend his care as far as this ſpot of Land in <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or ſome of the Reformed Churches, they go further than their companions; their <hi>ſelves,</hi> and their <hi>ſide</hi> or <hi>party</hi> is almoſt all that moſt regard: Perhaps the poor <hi>ſcattered Jews</hi> have a few words in the prayers of ſome; but the miſerable caſe of the vaſt Nations of the Earth, who ſeem to be forſaken of God is neglected by them. Five parts in ſix of the earth are Heathens and Mahometanes: and of the ſixth part, the Proteſtants are but about a ſixth, compared with the poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Abbaſſines, Armenians, Syrians, the Greek Churches, and the Papiſts; (to ſay nothing what the moſt of the Proteſtants themſelves are.) Yet are almoſt all theſe put by, with a word or two, or none at all, in the daily prayers of moſt Profeſſors: And it is rare to hear any to pray with any importunity for their converſion. Is this mens love to mankind? Is this their love to the Kingdom of Chriſt? or to God and Godlineſs? Is God of as narrow a mind as you? Are <hi>you</hi> and <hi>your party</hi>

               <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Do not only pray for them, but ſtudy what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of your power to do for their converſion.</hi> For though private men can do little in compariſon of what Chriſtian Princes might do who muſt not be told their duty by ſuch as I.) Yet ſomewhat might be done by <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,</hi> if skill and zeal were well united; and ſomewhat might be done by <hi>writing</hi> and <hi>tranſlating</hi> ſuch books as are fitteſt for this uſe:
<hi rend="margQuotes">And <hi>greater matters</hi> might be done, by training up ſome Scholars in the <hi>Perſian, Indoſtan, Tartarian,</hi> and ſuch other languages, who are for mind and body fitted for that work, and willing with due encouragement to give up themſelves thereto. Were ſuch a Colledge erected, natives might be got to teach the languages: and no doubt but God would put into the hearts of many young men, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themſelves to ſo excellent a ſervice; and of many rich men, to ſettle Lands ſufficient to maintain them; and many Merchants would help them in their expedition.</hi>
But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe that God will ſo much honour, be yet born, I know not.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If the Proteſtant Churches were more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>peaceable,</hi> more <hi>holy,</hi> and more unanimous and charitable to each other, it would do much to win the Papiſts that are near them: And if the Papiſts, and Greeks, and Armenians, and Abaſſines were more reformed, wiſe and holy, it would do much to win the Heathens and Mahometanes round about them. They would be the ſalt of the earth, and the lights of the world, and the leaven which muſt leaven the whole lump: The neighbouring Mahometanes, and Heathens, would ſee their good works, and glorifie God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>A holy, harmleſs, loving converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a Sermon which men of all languages can underſtand:</hi> Thus as Apoſtles we might preach to men of ſeveral tongues, though we have but one.

               <p>Direct. 5. When you ſee that the world lyeth ſtill in wickedneſs, and there ſeemeth to be no poſſibility of a cure, yet <hi>ſearch the Scripture,</hi> and ſo far as you can find any <hi>Prophecy</hi> or <hi>Promiſe</hi> of their converſion, <hi>believe</hi> that God in his time will make it good.</p>
               <p>Direct. 6. But take heed that on this pretence, you <hi>plunge not your ſelves into any inordinate ſtudies, or conceited expoſitions of the Revelations,</hi> and other Scripture <hi>Prophecies,</hi> as many have done, to the great wrong of themſelves, and the Church of God.</p>
               <p>By <hi>inordinate ſtudies,</hi> I mean, 1.

When you are proudly and cauſleſly conceited of your ſingular expoſitions: That when of ten of the learnedeſt and hardeſt ſtudied Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of the Revelation, perhaps in many things ſcarce two are of a mind; yet when you differ from them all, or all ſave one, you can be as peremptory and confident in your opinion, as if you were far wiſer, or more infallible than they. 4.

               <p>If God ſhould forſake no place but Hell, of all his Creation, you could not grudge at him as unmerciful: And it is a very hard queſtion whether this <hi>earth,</hi> and the <hi>air about it,</hi> be not the <hi>place of Hell</hi>; when you conſider that the Devils are caſt down from Heaven, and yet that they dwell and rule in the <hi>Air,</hi> and compaſs the Earth, and tempt the wicked, and <hi>work in the children of diſobedience,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1, 2.

And this is to <hi>Love our neighbour as our ſelves</hi>; that is, without the vice of partial <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi>; not ſetting up our <hi>own</hi> intereſt againſt his, but equally meaſuring both by Gods; and referring them thereunto, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.18, 34. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 15.4.</p>
               <p>Direct. 10. Remember that <hi>loving others as our ſelves is our own intereſt and benefit, as well as our duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And a notable inſtance it is, how much <hi>our duty</hi> is our <hi>own intereſt and good</hi>; and how merciful God is in his ſtricteſt Laws. As the <hi>Love of God</hi> is <hi>Heaven it ſelf,</hi> and ſinners that <hi>love him not,</hi> do <hi>damn themſelves,</hi> and <hi>put themſelves</hi> from Heaven and happineſs (and to <hi>pardon</hi> them, is to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> them) even ſo it is an unſpeakable loſs and miſery which ſinners draw upon themſelves, by not loving their neighbours, as themſelves, but only in a ſubordination to themſelves, and for their proper private ends. I pray you mark but theſe few particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If I love my neighbour as my ſelf, <hi>my very love is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and eaſe.</hi> The form of Love conſiſteth in <hi>complacency</hi> or <hi>pleaſedneſs</hi>; and therefore it muſt needs be <hi>pleaſant</hi> to every one that uſeth it (However <hi>bad Love</hi> hath <hi>bitter fruits.</hi>) And whenever wrath, or envy, or hatred, comes inſtead of Love, it is my <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> I <hi>feel</hi> my ſelf <hi>diſeaſed</hi> by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If I love others, <hi>others will love me.</hi> They are <hi>ſcarce free</hi> to do otherwiſe. You may <hi>almoſt conſtrain</hi> any man to <hi>love you,</hi> if you <hi>love him heartily,</hi> and <hi>ſhew it plainly,</hi> and were <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his view</hi> to make <hi>him ſee it.</hi> All men love a loving nature; but eſpecially if <hi>they</hi> be loved by ſuch <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If I love my neighbour as my ſelf, <hi>to do good to him will be as eaſie and pleaſant as to my ſelf.</hi> I can ride, and run, and labour contentedly for my ſelf: I can ſloop to the moſt ſordid
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:59417:292"/>
employment for my ſelf: And ſo I ſhould as eaſily do for others: Whereas <hi>want of Love</hi> doth make all <hi>tedious</hi> that I do, and maketh my duty a continual burden, and too often tempts me to omit it. Love made both Chriſt and his Apoſtles to do ſo much for ſouls with eaſe and pleaſure, which elſe they could not have undergone, <hi>John</hi> 15.13.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. &amp; 5.2 <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If I love my neighbour as my ſelf, <hi>I can as eaſily ſuffer any thing from him, as from my ſelf.</hi> I can eaſily bear that in my ſelf, as to <hi>ſight</hi> or <hi>ſmell</hi>; the <hi>loathſomeſt</hi> ſores or ulcers, which others cannot bear. I am eaſily brought to <hi>forgive my ſelf,</hi> and to <hi>forbear ſelf-hurting,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-revenge</hi>; and ſo ſhould I do to others, if I thus loved them. And then how eaſie would my life be among all the injuries of the world!</p>
               <p n="5">5. If I loved my neighbour as my ſelf; if my fleſh did want, <hi>my mind</hi> (which is my ſelf) <hi>could never be in want:</hi> Becauſe <hi>all that my neighbours have is mine, as to my comfort and content. My houſe</hi> is homely, but <hi>my neighbours</hi> is comely and convenient; and to <hi>my mind</hi> that is as comfortable, as if it were my own: <hi>My Land</hi> is ſmall, but my <hi>neighbours</hi> is large: <hi>my grounds</hi> are barren, but my <hi>neighbours</hi> fruitful: <hi>my corn</hi> is bad, but <hi>his</hi> proves good: <hi>my cattel</hi> die, or proſper not, but <hi>his</hi> do well: I am low and deſpicable, and no man careth for me; but <hi>others</hi> are Lords, and Princes, and honourable: and if I love them as my ſelf, <hi>their</hi> corn, <hi>their</hi> cattel, <hi>their</hi> houſes and lands, <hi>their</hi> Kingdoms and honours, are as much my comfort, as if they were my own. I know theſe are Paradoxes to da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved ſelfiſh nature; but thus it would be if <hi>Love</hi> were <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>; and thus <hi>it is</hi> in that meaſure that we <hi>love.</hi> And ſhould that duty be taken for a burden, which as to my comfort mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the wealth, and honour, and Kingdoms of others to be my own?</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If you love your neighbours as your ſelves, you muſt mourn with them that mourn; and all the calamities and ſorrows of the world muſt be yours; which will overcome your joyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I am not to ſorrow as <hi>much as they do ſorrow,</hi> but as much as they rationally <hi>ought to do.</hi> And men are not to think that a <hi>loving correction,</hi> which worketh for their <hi>good and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> is worſe than the ſnares of proſperity: The brother of
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:59417:293"/>
high degree muſt <hi>rejoyce when he is made low,</hi> as well as the <hi>brother of low degree muſt rejoyce when he is exalted,</hi> Jam 19.10. And why ſhould that be <hi>my ſorrow,</hi> which is <hi>his benefit,</hi> and <hi>ſhould</hi> be <hi>his joy?</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſing in the ſtocks, why ſhould not I ſing with them? <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>rejoycing</hi> are the duty of all Believers in affliction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>mercies and happineſs</hi> of every one that <hi>feareth God</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is far <hi>more</hi> than his miſery: Therefore his <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>gratitude</hi> ſhould be <hi>more</hi> than his <hi>ſorrows</hi> and <hi>complaints.</hi> If a mans tooth do ach, and all the reſt of his body be well, ſhould not he and I be more thankful for the health of all the reſt, than troubled for a tooth? A Believer hath alwaies the Spirit of God, and a part in Chriſt, and the pardon of ſin, and a right to Heaven: And then how much greater ſhould <hi>his joy</hi> be than his <hi>ſorrows,</hi> and <hi>mine</hi> alſo on <hi>his</hi> behalf?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Goodneſs and Love of God</hi> is manifeſted to the world more abundantly than his <hi>juſtice and ſeverity.</hi> We know of no afflicted Saints but on this ſpot of earth: And we know of no damned ones, but Devils and wicked men: But we know that the worlds above us are incomparably more vaſt than this, and that the glory of the celeſtial Spirits, is far greater than our ſufferings and ſorrows here: Therefore our <hi>joy</hi> which <hi>Love</hi> procureth, ſhould be a thouſand-fold greater than our ſorrows.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And as for the <hi>wicked,</hi> as the <hi>conſequent Will of God</hi> layeth by compaſſion; ſo conſequently, conſidering them as the <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate final refuſers of grace,</hi> they are not <hi>thoſe neighbours</hi> whom we are bound to <hi>love as our ſelves:</hi> For they are enemies to God, and deprived of his Image; and therefore our obligations to mourn for them, are abated (as <hi>Samuels</hi> for <hi>Saul,</hi> when he knew that God had rejected him (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.35. &amp; 16.1.) And we are obliged to rejoyce in the declarations of the Juſtice and Holineſs of God, and the univerſal benefit which redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from his Judgments, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.20. &amp; 12.12. <hi>Eſther</hi> 8.15. So that it ſtill remaineth clear, that <hi>loving our neighbours as our ſelves,</hi> doth entitle us to the comforts of all mens health, eſtates, proſperity, honours; yea and their holineſs and wiſdom too; and this without any ſuch participation of their ſorrows, as ſhould be any conſiderable ecclipſe of our delights;
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:59417:293"/>
if we do it all regularly, as God requireth us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If I love my neighbour as my ſelf, I am <hi>freed from all the trouble of croſs intereſts</hi>; in <hi>buying and ſelling,</hi> in <hi>treſpaſſing,</hi> in <hi>Law-ſuits</hi>; It will comfort me as much if <hi>he get by me,</hi> as <hi>if I get by him:</hi> If <hi>his</hi> bargain prove the better, as if <hi>mine</hi> did; if <hi>he</hi> have the better at Law, as if it were judged to <hi>my ſelf.</hi> Yea all his ſucceſſes, proſperity, and whatever good befalleth any that I know of in the world, will all be <hi>mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And <hi>I ſhall never be loth by death to leave the world</hi> (while I have no cauſe to fear the miſſing of ſalvation) becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I <hi>leave behind me,</hi> will be poſſeſſed by ſuch as I <hi>love as my ſelf.</hi> They will have <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>comforts,</hi> and whatever my nature is loth to leave: Therefore whileſt I live, why ſhould it not be as comforting to me to think that ſo many ſhall live and proſper, whom I love as my ſelf, as if I were my ſelf to live and proſper.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Yea, more than ſo, I <hi>have by Love a part in the Joyes of Heaven,</hi> before I am actually there. For the Joyes of all thoſe bleſſed ſouls, and of thoſe holy Angels, are mine by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo far as to cauſe me to rejoyce in their felicity, as if it were my own, as far as I can now apprehend it.</p>
               <p>Yea the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, and the eternal bleſſedneſs of God himſelf, would rejoyce us more than our <hi>own felicity,</hi> if we loved him as much above our ſelves, as we ought to do, we ſhould partake of our Maſters joy.</p>
               <p>And now judge whether <hi>loving God as God, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſincerely as our ſelves,</hi> would not cure almoſt all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of our minds, and give us a kind of Heaven, and be a cheap and certain way, to have what we can wiſh in all the world, and even to make all the world our own. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not <hi>ſin it ſelf,</hi> which is the <hi>firſt part</hi> of all mens hell and miſery?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But my neighbours meat will not fill my belly; nor his health doth not eaſe my pain; nor his fire keep me warm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The fleſh hath got the dominion indeed, when men cannot diſtinguiſh between <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> between the pain and pleaſures of the <hi>body</hi> and of the <hi>mind.</hi> I do not ſay that Love will change the <hi>pain</hi> or <hi>pleaſure</hi> of your <hi>bodies,</hi> but of your <hi>minds.</hi> Your <hi>appetites</hi> will not be ſatisfied with your neighbours
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:59417:294"/>
food, but your <hi>minds</hi> may be comforted to ſee his welfare. Your <hi>pain</hi> is not <hi>eaſed</hi> by your neighbours <hi>health</hi>; but your <hi>minds</hi> may be <hi>pleaſed</hi> by it, as much as if it were your own, if you loved him as much as you do your ſelf. And therefore many in a danger have ſaved the life of a Prince, a Captain, a Parent, a Child, a Friend, with the voluntary loſs of their own.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>This is all true; but who is there in the world that doth it, or findeth it poſſible to love another as himſelf? And how can that be a duty, which is to nature it ſelf an impoſſibility? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us firſt know what this duty is, of loving our neighbours as our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doubtleſs if it be the ſumm of the Law, all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do it in <hi>ſincerity,</hi> though not in <hi>perfection.</hi> And as to the ſenſe of it, 1. You muſt diſtinguiſh between that <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>paſſionate affection,</hi> which is in the ſoul as <hi>ſenſitive,</hi> and is common to <hi>beaſts</hi> with <hi>men,</hi> and that <hi>rational appetite,</hi> which doth <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>chuſe,</hi> and is <hi>pleaſed</hi> according to the conduct of <hi>pure reaſon.</hi> The firſt we doubt not will be ſtill <hi>more</hi> to <hi>our ſelves</hi> than others; and it is not the uſe of grace to deſtroy it, but to rule and moderate it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>outward actions,</hi> which are the expreſſions of it. When our <hi>Love</hi> is due as much to one, as to another, yet our outward actions may be under a <hi>particular Law,</hi> which obligeth us to do that <hi>for one,</hi> which we are not bound to do for <hi>others.</hi> As to maintain our <hi>own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, families, ſervants, and ſo our ſelves</hi> rather than <hi>others.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe the difference of <hi>individuals</hi> maketh that fit for one, which is not fit for another; and ſo maketh every man the fitteſt chuſer for <hi>himſelf,</hi> and thoſe that are <hi>neereſt to him</hi>; and <hi>nature</hi> inſtigateth him to the greateſt care in doing it: And all <hi>good</hi> muſt be done in <hi>a regular order,</hi> or elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion will deſtroy it. And nature maketh this moſt orderly As every Pariſh muſt keep their own poor, and yet muſt love other poor as well.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt know that <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>formally</hi> nothing but <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence</hi> (as aforeſaid) but <hi>Love</hi> joyned with a <hi>will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to do good to another,</hi> is called <hi>Love of benevolence</hi>; when yet the <hi>Love</hi> there is <hi>one thing,</hi> and the <hi>doing good,</hi> or purpoſe to
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:59417:294"/>
do it, is another; and I may in obedience to God, <hi>purpoſe</hi> and <hi>do</hi> more good to one whom I am bound to Love, not more but leſs.</p>
               <p>And now you may ſee what it is to love our neighbours as our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God muſt be loved above our neighbours and our ſelves; and both muſt be loved purely as related and ſubordinate to him, and for his ſake.</hi> There is a double reſpect which all things have to God: 1. As they contain that excellency which he hath put upon them, which is ſome <hi>likeneſs,</hi> repreſentation or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of himſelf; and is called <hi>his Glory</hi> ſhining in the creature; that is, it's <hi>derived Goodneſs.</hi> 2. As they conduce to his further ſervice, and may honour him, and pleaſe him. Thus all creatures muſt be loved only as a <hi>means,</hi> even a <hi>means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring God,</hi> being <hi>derivatively</hi> and <hi>ſignificantly good</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi>; and as a means to <hi>ſerve</hi> and <hi>pleaſe</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore this being the <hi>formal reaſon</hi> of our <hi>Rational Love,</hi> muſt alſo be the <hi>meaſure</hi> of it (<hi>à quatenus ad quantum.</hi>) As it is certain that I muſt love that beſt which <hi>is beſt,</hi> becauſe I muſt love it only <hi>as good</hi>; ſo it is certain that that <hi>is beſt</hi> which hath moſt <hi>likeneſs to God,</hi> and moſt of his <hi>Glory</hi> upon it, and that which is <hi>moſt pleaſing to him,</hi> and uſeful to his ſervice. Therefore if my neighbour be <hi>better</hi> than I am, I muſt <hi>judge him better,</hi> and <hi>love him better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Though natural <hi>ſelf-appetite,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> by which all creatures are for themſelves only (not feeling the hunger, cold, pain of others) be not <hi>ſinful,</hi> but the effect of creating individuation, yet <hi>Reaſon was perfect,</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> could perfectly follow Reaſon, in its <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>choice,</hi> till ſin corrupted it: Reaſon could judge that <hi>beſt</hi> which <hi>was beſt,</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> could <hi>love that beſt</hi> which <hi>was beſt.</hi> Therefore where ever any of this is <hi>wanting,</hi> it is <hi>ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The principal part or ſumm of poſitive ſin, doth conſiſt in <hi>ſelfiſhneſs.</hi> Man is fallen from the Love of God and <hi>man,</hi> to <hi>himſelf</hi>; and <hi>grace</hi> recovereth him from this. Therefore it is, that this duty is not only <hi>unperformed,</hi> but hardly <hi>diſcerned</hi> by unrenewed men: ſo far as they are ſelfiſh, they hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they <hi>ſhould</hi> love their neighbours as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="548" facs="tcp:59417:295"/>5. To love our neighbours as our ſelves, in point of duty, containeth theſe two things: Firſt, To love them <hi>ſimply</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>goodneſs,</hi> without any <hi>hinderance of ſelfiſhneſs or partiality:</hi> Not to forbear loving them, becauſe they are not <hi>our ſelves,</hi> or becauſe they are againſt any <hi>inordinate ſelfiſh intereſt</hi> or <hi>appetite</hi> of our <hi>own.</hi> And alſo <hi>comparatively,</hi> to love them in the <hi>ſame degree with our ſelves,</hi> if they have the <hi>ſame degree</hi> of <hi>lovelineſs</hi>; ſo that it cannot extend to the <hi>kind,</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd <hi>reaſon</hi> of the <hi>Love,</hi> but it muſt needs alſo extend to the <hi>degree.</hi> If I love him <hi>leſs</hi> than my ſelf, who is <hi>better</hi> than my ſelf, I love him not <hi>as my ſelf,</hi> as to <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Yea I am bound by this Law to love every man <hi>better or more than my ſelf,</hi> who is <hi>really better,</hi> and is ſo <hi>manifeſt to me:</hi> Or elſe I love him not <hi>as my ſelf,</hi> that is, on the <hi>ſame true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> as I muſt love my ſelf (for <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the object.)</p>
               <p n="7">7. But as all men fail in the <hi>degree</hi> of this Love (and therefore none perfectly keep the Law;) ſo the ſincerity which all Gods ſervants have, doth conſiſt in this; that 1. Our love to others is for <hi>Gods ſake,</hi> and for the <hi>goodneſs</hi> which he hath endued them with, and the <hi>ſervice</hi> they may do him. 2. That this God and his ſervice, for whoſe ſake we love them, <hi>be preferred before our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>every creature,</hi> and loved better than all our <hi>ſinful pleaſures.</hi> 3. That our love to them for Gods ſake and graces be ſuch, as <hi>ordinarily</hi> in the <hi>exerciſe</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> will <hi>prevail</hi> ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

He that cannot love Chriſt in his ſervants, <hi>better</hi> than his <hi>carnal pleaſures,</hi> loveth him not at all ſincerely. Gods Image and intereſt in his ſervants, and in mankind, muſt be practically more precious to us, and more beloved by us, than all our carnal ſinful pleaſures. (For as for our <hi>own ſpiritual</hi> good, it ſtandeth in ſuch a connexion with Gods will and glory, and our neighbours good, that I know not how to put them into compariſon in the try<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

predominant in us, againſt the Love of God and man.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The meaning of the Command is not that we ſhall love our neighgours as we <hi>inordinately</hi> and <hi>ſinfully</hi> love our ſelves; but as we ought to love our ſelves; and as we regularly and juſtly do love our ſelves. He that loveth himſelf too much and ſinfully, muſt not therefore ſo love his neighbour.</p>
               <p n="9">9. He that loveth his neighbour as himſelf (that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>ſelfiſh partiality, and for the ſame reaſons as he muſt love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> viz. for the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> of God) is obliged by this very rule, to love <hi>himſelf more than his neighbour,</hi> when <hi>he is better,</hi> and <hi>more pleaſing</hi> and <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to God.

               <p n="10">10. As a <hi>Fathers</hi> Love may conſiſt with the <hi>correction</hi> of his children, and <hi>ſelf-love</hi> with <hi>blood-letting, purging, labour,</hi> and other unpleaſing things; ſo we may love our neighbours as our ſelves, and yet <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>puniſh</hi> evil doers: For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their <hi>own good</hi> requireth it; and ordinarily the <hi>publick good</hi> requireth it (<hi>poena debetur Reipublicae</hi>) and alſo <hi>Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> requireth it; ſo that this is not loving our ſelves more than our neighbour; but loving <hi>him</hi> more <hi>than</hi> his <hi>eaſe,</hi> or his <hi>favour</hi> and loving <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Common-wealth, more than him.</hi>

Our love of our neighbours as our ſelves, doth not at all make our <hi>natural ſelfiſh appetites</hi> and <hi>ſenſes,</hi> or <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>food, health, eaſe, reſt, &amp;c.</hi> to be ſinful: Nor oblige us to have <hi>ſuch natural ſenſes</hi> and <hi>appetites</hi> for <hi>others</hi>; but only <hi>rationally</hi> to equal them in <hi>eſtimation</hi> and <hi>complacence,</hi> and to do them ſo much <hi>good</hi> as God requireth us.</p>

               <p>By all this it is evident, 1. That no man hath an <hi>inequality</hi> in his love to <hi>himſelf</hi> and his <hi>neighbour,</hi> beyond the <hi>inequality</hi>
                  <pb n="550" facs="tcp:59417:296"/>

               <p n="2">2.

to diſcern the truth, is to treat with <hi>reaſon alone,</hi> and leave out the <hi>will,</hi> till we have diſpatcht with <hi>reaſon.</hi> And you will find that the common light of nature juſtifieth this Law of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that would not confeſs that it is better <hi>he</hi> had <hi>no being,</hi> than that there <hi>were no God,</hi> or <hi>no world</hi> beſides him, is a monſter of ſelfiſhneſs.

The gallant <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> had learnt it, as one of their plaineſt greateſt Leſſons, to prefer their Country before their lives: And is not that to love their <hi>Countryes</hi> better than <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. Whence come all the oppreſſions, injuries, perſecutions, frauds and cruelties on the earth: For want of loving mens neighbours as themſelves: Otherwiſe how tenderly would they handle one another? How eaſily would they pardon wrongs? How patiently would they bear the diſſent of honeſt, upright Chriſtians, who cannot force their judgments to be of other mens mould and ſize? How apt would men be to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their own underſtandings, of weakneſs, preſumption or errour, rather than to rave with the fury of the Dragon againſt all others, who think them to be miſtaken? How ſafely and quietly might we live by them in the world, if they loved their neighbours as themſelves? I do not ſay now, How plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful would men be in doing good to others? I am but plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lower cauſe, How ſeldom they would be in doing hurt? But, alas, miſerable <hi>Brittain!</hi> It was in thee that one extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Emperour, <hi>Alexander Sevetus</hi> was betrayed and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, who made that Chriſtian precept his Motto, and wrote it on his doors, and books, and goods [<hi>Do as you would be done by.</hi>] In thee it is that <hi>Love hath been beheaded,</hi> while nothing hath been more acknowledged and profeſſed. If Love be treacherous, hurtful, envious, ſcandalous, enſnaring and plotting for mens deſtruction: If Love teach proud and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſots, to take themſelves for Deities, and Oracles, and all for Vermine that muſt be hunted unto death, who bow not to their carnal erroneous conceits, and do not with the readieſt proſtitute conſciences, ſerve their carnal intereſts and ends: If Love be known by reviling thoſe that are much better than our ſelves; and ſtigmatizing the faithfulleſt ſervants of Chriſt with the moſt odious character that lyes can utter: If it was Love that called <hi>Paul</hi> a peſtilent fellow, and a mover of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the people, and repreſented Chriſt as an enemy to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his followers, as the filth and off-ſcouring of the earth; then happy age in which we live; and happy they

               <p n="5">5. You ſee here what a <hi>plague ſin</hi> is to the <hi>earth,</hi> and how great (a <hi>puniſhment</hi> may I call it, or rather) a <hi>miſery</hi> to the <hi>ſinner,</hi> and to the <hi>world.</hi>

               <p>Direct. 11. <hi>Make it the work of all your lives, by Faith in Chriſt, to bring up your ſouls to the unfeigned Love of God,</hi> and then it will be done. For then you will love God above all, and love God in all; and love your ſelves and your neighbours principally for God: Then Gods <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> will be <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or <hi>Amiableneſs</hi> in your eyes; and not carnal pleaſure, honour or commodity. And then it will be eaſie to you to love that moſt, which hath moſt of God. You will then eaſily ſee the reaſon of this ſeeming Paradox, and that the contrary is moſt unreaſonable. You will then be as <hi>Timothy,</hi> who had a <hi>natural</hi> Love to others, as others have to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and who ſought the things of Jeſus Chriſt, when all others (even the beſt Miniſters too much) <hi>ſought their own,</hi> Phil. 2.20, 21. You will underſtand <hi>Pauls</hi> charge, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>In lowlineſs of mind, let each eſteem others better than themſelves. Look not every man on his own, but every man alſo on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  <pb n="554" facs="tcp:59417:299"/>
You will learn of Chriſt to take your neereſt friend for a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> that would perſwade you to ſave or ſpare your ſelf (yea your life) when you ought to lay it down for the Glory of God, and the good of many, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22, 23. <hi>SELF</hi> and <hi>OWN</hi> are words which would then be better underſtood, and be more ſuſpected: And the reaſon of the great Goſpel duty of <hi>SELF-DENYAL</hi> would be better diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſet your ſelves to the ſtudy of God, eſpecially in his Goodneſs; ſtudy him in his Works, and in his Word, and in his Son, and in the Glory where you hope everlaſtingly to ſee him: And if you once <hi>love God as God indeed,</hi> it will teach you to <hi>love your Brethren,</hi> and in <hi>what ſort,</hi> and in <hi>what degree</hi> to do it. For many waies are we <hi>taught of God to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Even 1. By the great and heavenly teacher of Love, Jeſus Chriſt: 2. And by Gods own example, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44, 45<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. And by the ſhedding abroad of his love in our hearts by the Spirit of Love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. 4. And by this actual loving God, and ſo loving all of God in the world.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But by this doctrine you will prepare for the Levellers and Fryers, to caſt down, or cry down Propriety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a propriety of food, rayment, &amp;c. which individuation hath made neceſſary. 2. There is a propriety of Stewardſhip, which God cauſeth by the various diſpoſal of his talents, and which is the juſt reward of humane induſtry, and the neceſſary encouragement of wit, and labour in the world: None of theſe would we caſt down, or preach down. 3. But there is a common <hi>abuſe of propriety</hi> to the maintenance of mens <hi>own luſts,</hi> and to the <hi>hurt of others,</hi> and of all <hi>Societies:</hi> This we would <hi>preach down</hi> if we could: But it is Love only which muſt be the <hi>Leveller:</hi> In the Primitive Church, Love ſhewed its power by ſuch a voluntary community, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. And all Politicians, who have drawn the Idea of a perfect Common-wealth, have been fumbling at other waies of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing it: But it is <hi>Chriſtian Love</hi> alone that muſt do it. Unfeignedly love God as God, and love your neighbours real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as your ſelves, and then keep your <hi>proprieties</hi> as far as this will give you leave.</p>
               <p>I will conclude with this conſiderable obſervation; that though it is falſe which ſome affirm, that individuation is a
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:59417:299"/>
puniſhment for ſome former ſin (for how could a ſoul not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuate ſin?) And though ſenſitive ſelf-love, which is the principle of ſelf-preſervation, be no ſin it ſelf; nor doth grace deſtroy it; yet the <hi>inordinacy</hi> of it is the ſumm and root of all <hi>poſitive</hi> ſin, and an increaſer of <hi>privative</hi> ſin: And this <hi>inſeparable ſenſitive ſelf-love,</hi> was made to be more under the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>reaſon,</hi> and to be <hi>ruled</hi> by it, than now we find it in any the moſt ſanctified perſon; even as <hi>Abrahams</hi> love of the life of his only Son, was to be ſubject to his Faith.</p>
               <p>And holineſs lyeth more in <hi>this ſubjection,</hi> than moſt men well underſtand. And the inordinacy of this perſonal ſelf-love, hath ſo ſtrangely perverted the mind it ſelf, that it is not only very hard to convince men of the evil of any <hi>ſelfiſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> or <hi>ſins</hi>; but it greatly blindeth them, as to all <hi>duties</hi> of <hi>publick intereſt,</hi> and <hi>ſocial</hi> nature: Yea and maketh them afraid of <hi>Heaven it ſelf</hi>; where the union of ſouls will be as much neerer than now it is, as their <hi>Love</hi> will be greater and more perfect: And though it will not be by any ceſſation of <hi>perſonal individuation,</hi> and by falling into <hi>one univerſal ſoul</hi>; yet <hi>perfect Love</hi> will make the <hi>union</hi> neerer than we who have no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of it, can poſſibly now comprehend. (And when we feel the ſtrongeſt Love to a friend, deſiring the neereſt union, we have the beſt help to underſtand it.) But men that <hi>feel not</hi> the <hi>divine and holy love,</hi> are by <hi>inordinate ſelf-love,</hi> and <hi>abuſe of individuation,</hi> afraid of the life to come, leſt the <hi>union</hi> ſhould be <hi>ſo great</hi> as to <hi>loſe</hi> their <hi>individuation,</hi> or prejudice their <hi>perſonal divided intereſts.</hi> Yea true believers, ſo far as their holy Love is weak, and their inordinate ſenſitive ſelf-love is yet too ſtrong, are from hence afraid of another world, when they ſcarce know why; but indeed it is much from this diſeaſe; which maketh men ſtill deſire their <hi>perſonal felicity,</hi> too partially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in a <hi>divided</hi> way, and to be afraid of loſing their <hi>perſonality</hi> or <hi>propriety,</hi> by too ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. How by Faith to be followers of the Saints, and to look with profit to their examples, and to their end.</head>
               <p>THE great work of living in Heaven by Faith, I have ſaid ſo much of as to the principal part in my [<hi>Saints Reſt</hi>] that no more of that muſt be expected here. Only this ſubject which is not ſo uſually and fully treated of, to the people as it it ought (being one part of our <hi>heavenly converſation</hi>) I think meet to ſpeak to more diſtinctly at this time.</p>
               <p>As we are commanded firſt, to <hi>look to Jeſus the Author and perfecter of our faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2, 3. ſo are we commanded to <hi>remember</hi> our <hi>guides, and to follow their faith, and conſider the end of their converſation,</hi> Heb. 13.7. And <hi>not to be ſlothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> Heb. 6.12. To which end we have a cloud of witneſſes ſet before us, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that next to Jeſus whom they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, we ſhould look to them, and follow them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.10. <hi>My Brethren, take the Prophets for an example —</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſons of this duty are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God hath made them our examples</hi> two waies: 1. By <hi>his graces,</hi> making them <hi>holy and fit</hi> for our imitation. He gave them their gifts, not only for <hi>themſelves,</hi> nor only for that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generation,</hi> but <hi>for us</hi> alſo, and all that muſt ſurvive, to the end of the world. As it is ſaid of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23, 24. It was ſaid that Faith was <hi>imputed to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, not for his ſake alone, but for us alſo</hi> to whom it ſhall be imputed if we believe—So I may ſay in this caſe; their faith, their piety, their patience was given them, and is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not for their ſalvation, or their honour only; but alſo to further the ſalvation of their poſterity, by encouragement and imitation. If <hi>all things are for our ſakes,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.15. then the <hi>graces</hi> of Gods Saints were for our ſakes: For the Churches edification it is that Chriſt giveth both offices, gifts and graces to his Miniſters, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5, 12, 14, 15, 16. yea and ſufferings too, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. <hi>I endure all things for the elects ſake.</hi>

For <hi>your ſelves know how ye ought to follow us —To make our ſelves an example for you to follow us,</hi> Phil. 3.17. <hi>Be followers together of me, and mark them that ſo walk, as ye have us for an enſample,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.16. <hi>I beſeech you be followers of me,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.6. <hi>Ye became followers of us, and of the Lord:</hi> So well are both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples conſiſtent.</p>

If we be to learn any <hi>Trade</hi> or Artifice, we would learn it of them who with beſt ſucceſs have practiſed it before us. If we are <hi>ſick</hi> of any <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> we are glad to talk with them that have had the ſame, and have been cured of it; to hear what means they uſed for their cure. In all ſuch caſes reaſon teacheth us, both to obſerve how others were affected; whether their caſe and ours were the ſame; what courſe they took; and how they ſped; eſpecially if they were perſons known to us, and the likeneſs of their caſe well known; and if they were ſuch as for wiſdom and fidelity we could truſt: So is it in this great buſineſs of our ſalvation. We have nothing to do, but what many thouſands have done before us; nothing to ſuffer but what they have ſuffered; no temptation to reſiſt, but what they have been aſſaulted with, and overcame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. and we want no grace, no help or comfort, but what they did attain: And the glory which we ſeek and hope for, they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. To <hi>look to them</hi> therefore, muſt needs be uſeful to us in this our wilderneſs ſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as <hi>experience</hi> is a powerful <hi>Teacher</hi>; ſo to be the Maſter of <hi>other mens experiences,</hi> and ſo <hi>many,</hi> and ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi> and in ſuch <hi>various caſes,</hi> and in ſo <hi>many ages,</hi> muſt needs be very uſeful to us. We that are born in the laſt ages of the world, have the benefit of the experience of all the world that have gone before us: Therefore is the Scripture written ſo much hiſtorically; that all who are there mentioned, may ſtill be our inſtructors. Even the firſt brethren that were born into the world, were ſo plain a diſcovery of the nature of ſin and
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:59417:301"/>
grace, and of the difference of the womans and the Serpents ſeed, that their hiſtory is uſeful to all generations. And <hi>Abel</hi> by his faith, and ſacrifice, and righteouſneſs, being <hi>dead</hi> (by malignant cruelty) <hi>yet ſpeaketh,</hi> Heb. 11.4. He that will but ſoberly look back to all the worlds experience, may quickly be reſolved, whether wiſdom or folly, labour or idleneſs, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ungodlineſs, temperance or ſenſuality, furthering the Goſpel of Chriſt, or perſecuting it, have ſped better at the laſt, and hath proved beſt to the actors upon full experience.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore here give you ſome directions how you may believingly follow the Saints. And firſt obſerve that the duty hath theſe parts, which you muſt diſtinctly mind; 1. <hi>To take them for your examples under Chriſt,</hi> and ſo to fix <hi>your eyes</hi> upon them, and <hi>look at them,</hi> and <hi>mind</hi> them as <hi>examples,</hi> muſt be minded: 2. To <hi>improve</hi> theſe examples which you <hi>look</hi> upon: And that is, 1. For your <hi>direction</hi> in duty, and for your warning againſt ſin: 2. To your <hi>encouragement</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
               <p>Direct. 1. <hi>Look after them to their end, and conſider</hi> 1. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are gone: We <hi>ſee</hi> nothing of them after death, but the corpſe which we leave in duſt and darkneſs: But Faith can attend their ſouls to glory, and ſee <hi>where</hi> they now are; even <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> according to his promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 12.26. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>John</hi> 17.24, with Angels, and with one another, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſociety, the City of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What they are <hi>doing:</hi> And Faith can ſee that they are <hi>beholding</hi> God, and their glorified Redeemer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. They are loving God with perfect Love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. &amp; 13.1, 2, &amp;c. They are praiſing him with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect alacrity and joy; ſaying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8. They are ſo far minding the ſtate of the world, as to cry, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth:</hi> And they are <hi>waiting in white Robes, till their fellow ſervants alſo, and their brethren that ſhall be killed as they were, ſhall be fulfilled,</hi> Rev. 6.10, 11. <hi>They are rejoycing when the enemies of Chriſt and his Church are ſubdued,</hi> Rev. 18.20. And they ſhall <hi>judge</hi> the malignant <hi>Angels</hi> and the <hi>world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2, 3. And this ſeemeth
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:59417:301"/>
not to be only an <hi>approbation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> final Judgment: For 1. <hi>Judging</hi> is very often put in Scripture for governing: As in the book of the <hi>Judges,</hi> it is ſaid, ſuch and ſuch a one <hi>judged Iſrael</hi>; that is, <hi>ruled</hi> them according to the <hi>Laws</hi> of God. 2. And a <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Reign</hi> is often promiſed to the Saints: <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne,</hi> Rev. 3.21. Which muſt needs ſignifie ſome partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in power of Government, and not only in ſplendor of Glory. And ſo Chriſt expoundeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.30. <hi>Ye which have followed me, in the regeneration ſhall ſit on twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> (And of God it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Thou ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt in the Thrones judging right.</hi>) It is too jejune and forced an expoſition of them that ſay this is ſpoken only of the power which the Apoſtles had in their miniſtration on earth: And as abſurd is the other, that it is ſpoken only of Apoſtles, Paſtors, and Saints, and Martyrs <hi>in ſpecie</hi> that their ſucceſſors ſhall be Popes and Prelates, and great men in the world, and the Saints be uppermoſt after <hi>Conſtantines</hi> converſion. As if the promiſe meant only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>one man,</hi> becauſe <hi>another</hi> ſuffered for Chriſt, and God had promiſed theſe great things, not to the perſons mentioned, but to <hi>others</hi> that ſhould be their ſucceſſors; yea as if that <hi>Venom</hi> then poured into the Church, were all the benediction. And though I know not what changes are yet to come before the final Judgment, yet the Millenaries opinion, who reſtrain all this to an earthly temporal reign of ſome Saints for a thouſand years, doth ſeem as unſatisfactory on many accounts. It is moſt likely therefore that as the wicked (who are now very like them) muſt be hereafter of the <hi>ſame Region and Society</hi> with the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Angels, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41.) And as the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall be <hi>like</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> to the <hi>Angels, Luke</hi> 20.36. ſo we ſhall be of the <hi>ſame Society with the Angels</hi>; and conſequently ſhall have their <hi>employment.</hi> And as the Angels have a Miniſterial Stewardſhip or Superintendency over <hi>men</hi> and their affairs (as many Scriptures fully ſhew) ſo alſo ſhall the <hi>Saints:</hi> And it is not likely that this is wholly deferred till the <hi>reſurrection</hi>; but as they have a <hi>Glory</hi> before that with Chriſt and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; ſo they have <hi>now</hi> their part in this Superintendency
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:59417:302"/>
before; though both will be <hi>greater</hi> at the Reſurrection. If any ſay, what uſe will there be of our ſuperiority, after the world is deſtroyed? I anſwer, 1. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> plainly telleth us (though ſome would force his words into the dark) <hi>that we according to his promiſe, expect a new Heaven and a new Earth, in which dwelleth righteouſneſs.</hi> And the Creation <hi>groaneth to be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21. And the <hi>Heavens muſt contain Chriſt, till the times of Reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, ſince the world began,</hi> Acts 3.21. 2. And he that ſaid, <hi>the Saints ſhall judge the Angels,</hi> ſeemeth ſo intimate, that the <hi>Devils</hi> with the <hi>wicked</hi> will be in a ſtate of <hi>ſubjection</hi> or <hi>ſervitude</hi> to them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Certain it is, that <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels ſhall be the conquerours of the Dragon and his Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7, 9. And that the <hi>Serpents head ſhall be bruiſed</hi> by all the <hi>womans ſeed,</hi> though chiefly by the Captain of our ſalvation. But this ſhall now ſuffice concerning their employment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Behold alſo by Faith what the departed Saints are now <hi>enjoying.</hi> And what is ſaid of their <hi>place</hi> and <hi>work</hi> will tell you that. They enjoy the <hi>fight</hi> of their <hi>glorified Head,</hi> Joh. 17.24. They are <hi>with him in Paradiſe,</hi> and therefore alſo enjoy the <hi>ſight</hi> of the <hi>Glory of God: Being abſent from the body, they are preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. They ſee not as in a glaſs, as here they did, but with <hi>open face.</hi> They enjoy the pleaſures of a more perfect knowledge of God and all his wondrous works, than this world affords. They are happy in their <hi>works,</hi> in the perfect <hi>Love and Praiſes</hi> of God; and they are filled with the pleaſures of his <hi>Love</hi> to them. This is their fruition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let Faith alſo behold what <hi>evils</hi> they are delivered from. 1. From a heavy droſſy <hi>body</hi> which ſince the fall hath been an enemy, a priſon and fetters to the ſoul: and therefore they here <hi>groaned</hi> to be <hi>better cloathed,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.4, 5. Rom. 8.21. 2. From the <hi>worlds temptations:</hi> 3. From <hi>wicked</hi> mens <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> and <hi>perſecutions:</hi> 4. From <hi>ſickneſs, pain, neceſſities, labours, wearineſs,</hi> and all the troubleſome effects of ſin: 5. From all troubleſome paſſions, deſires, anger, diſcontent, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, griefs, and cares, and fears of evil. 6. Specially from the fears of Hell, and the doubts of their own ſincerity
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:59417:302"/>
and ſalvation; and from the deſertions of God, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſenſe of his diſpleaſure. 7. From the troubles and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of ignorance, and all our natural imperfection. 8. From the fears of death, which now is more painful than death it ſelf. 9. From the ſuggeſtions of Satan, and his malicious vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſquieting temptations, and from his flattering allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are much worſe. 10. From the company, and the tempting or grieving examples of ungodly men. 11. From all ſin it ſelf, and all our moral imperfections and defects. 12. And finally from all danger, and fear of ever loſing the felicity they poſſeſs. Theſe are the immunities of the bleſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Faith hath ſeen the <hi>Saints in Glory,</hi> look back and think next <hi>what they were lately here on earth</hi>; that it may help you to compare your ſtate and theirs. And here you will ſee 1. That they were lately in <hi>fleſh,</hi> as we now are. They had <hi>bodies</hi> as droſſie, as vile, as frail, as burdenſome as ours are. It coſt them as dear (not as it doth the <hi>ſenſual,</hi> but) as it doth the <hi>temperate</hi> perſon now to <hi>keep them up</hi> a while for the ſervice to which they were appointed. 2. They had pains and ſickneſſes as we have. The ſouls in Heaven have eſcaped thither from bodies which have lain as long tormented with the Stone, with Stranguries, Collicks, Gripes, Convulſions, Conſumptions, Feavers, and other the moſt tedious, painful and lothſome diſeaſes, as ſober men on earth now feel. 3. Satan was as malicious to them, as he is to us; and to many of them as troubleſome: he haunted them with as ugly temptations, to the greateſt ſins, to unbelief, and pride, and deſpair, and ſelf-murder, and horrid blaſphemy, as he doth any of us. (Yea he did ſo by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.) 4. They met with as many allurements to worldlineſs, ſenſuality, pride and luſt in the worlds deceiving baits, and flatteries, as now we do; and were fain to proceed every ſtep towards Heaven, by conflict and conqueſt as we muſt do. 5. They were in as many wants and ſtraits; in as poor, and low, and deſpiſed a ſtate, as we are now: They were tempted to cares, and murmurings, and diſcontents, through their wants and croſſes, as well as we. 6. They have been in dangers, and in fears, and many a time at the brink of death, before it came: and put to cry to God
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:59417:303"/>
for deliverance in the terrours and anguiſh of their hearts. Their fleſh, and heart, and friends have failed them, and all the creatures caſt them off. 7. They have gone through far greater perſecutions for the ſake of Chriſt and righteouſneſs, than ever we did: <hi>So perſecuted they the Prophets before you,</hi> Mat. 5.11, 12. <hi>Which of the Prophets did not your Fathers kill and perſecute?</hi> even of them for whom their poſterity erected Monuments? <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.36, 37, 38. We <hi>have not reſiſted unto blood,</hi> as many of them did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. The ſame and greater afflictions which we have undergone, were accompliſhed on our brethren in this world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. We go through the ſame conflict as they did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.30. We are no more falſly nor odiouſly ſlandered in any of our ſufferings than they were, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12. 8. They were men of like paſſions as we are; for ſo <hi>James</hi> ſaith even of <hi>Elias,</hi> that was carryed to Heaven without our kind of death. They had their ignorances, uncertainties, doubts, miſtakes; their dark thoughts of God, and that world where they now are. Many of them knew as little of it, till they ſaw it, as we do now. Many a fearful trembling hour, many a thought that God had forſaken them, and that the day of grace was paſt, have many of them had as well as we. 9. Yea they were imperfect in all their graces; they had an imperfect faith, an imperfect hope, an imperfect Love to God and man, and many an hour in ſuch groans as ours now are, O when ſhall we be ſaved from our darkneſs and unbelief! when ſhall we better love the Lord! 10. They had their actual ſins alſo. (Though none that were regnant after converſion) their obedience was imperfect as ours now is. Many of their faults and falls are left on record for our warning. There is not one humane ſoul in Heaven beſides our Saviours, that was not once a ſinner: They all came thither by a Redeemer as we muſt do. They had their too great ſelfiſhneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. They had their puſillanimity and fears of men (as <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles.) They had their ſinful controverſies, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>; and ſinful <hi>ſeparations</hi> in complyance with the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16, 17. They had their carnal ſidings, factions and diviſions in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. &amp; 3. Many a time have they been put to groan, <hi>O wretched man, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death,</hi>
                  <pb n="563" facs="tcp:59417:303"/>
Rom. 7, &amp;c. 11. They had as difficult duties to go through, as any of us: They were put upon as many tears and troubles, watchings and travels, faſtings and ſelf-denyal, as the moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and ſuffering Chriſtians now. 12. They had as long delayes of the accompliſhment of their deſires, as any of us. 13. And laſtly, they paſt through death it ſelf, as we muſt do. They lay gaſping on their beds of langu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhing, and death broke in upon every part, and they underwent that ſeparation of ſoul and body, as we muſt do: Their fleſh was turned to rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs and duſt, and laid out of the ſight of man in darkneſs, and remaineth to this day as common earth.</p>
               <p>All this the Saints in Heaven have undergone. This was their caſe a while ago, who are now in glory. And this was not only the caſe of ſome few, but of thouſands and millions, and that in the moſt of theſe particulars, even of all that are gone before us unto bleſſedneſs: It is not we that are tempted firſt, that are perſecuted or afflicted firſt, that have ſinned firſt, that muſt die firſt; but all this hoſt hath broke the Ice, and are ſafely paſt through this Red Sea, and are now triumphing in felicity with their Saviour.</p>
               <p>Direct. 3. Let Faith next look back, and ſee by what way theſe Saints have come to this felicity; I mean, by what means they did overcome, and win the Crown. And briefly, you will find, 1. That they all came to Heaven by the Mediation, the Sacrifice, the meritorious Righteouſneſs of a Redeemer, Jeſus Chriſt (either as promiſed, or as incarnate) none of them were juſtified by the works of the Law, or the Covenant of Innocency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their common way was by <hi>Faith, Repentance, Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience; Not by works of Righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They lived <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world,</hi> and were <hi>zealous of good works, looking for the bleſſed hope</hi> which they have attained, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14, 15. Knowing that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are the ſumm of ſaving doctrine and duty, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. And

that to <hi>fear God and keep his Commandments,</hi> is the <hi>whole duty</hi> of man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. And that the <hi>end of the Commandment is Charity, out of a pure heart, and a good conſcience, and of faith unfeigned,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. and that <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſtudied the Word of God, or ſuch means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as God afforded them, in order to the attaining and maintaining of theſe graces, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. and ſought the Lord with all their hearts, while he might be found, and called upon him while he was near, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6, 10. And did not preſumptuouſly neglect Gods helps, and deſpiſe his Word, while they truſted for his mercy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They lived in a continual conflict againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Devil, the world and the fleſh, and in the main did <hi>conquer</hi> as well as <hi>ſtrive.</hi> They made it their work to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie</hi> thoſe fleſhly luſts, which others make it their intereſt and work to <hi>pleaſe, Gal.</hi> 5.17.21, 22. &amp; 6.14.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They ſuffered afflictions and perſecutions patiently; and being reviled, they <hi>did not revile:</hi> They <hi>loved their enemies,</hi> and <hi>bleſt thoſe that curſe them,</hi> and <hi>prayed for thoſe that deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed and perſecuted them,</hi> Matth. 5.44 45. 1 Cor. 4.11, 12, 13. 2 Cor. 1.6, 7. Heb. 11. They would <hi>not accept of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from impriſonment, torments</hi> and death, upon ſinning terms.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They endured to the end, and did not fall off and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Covenant of their God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

The <hi>ſame mercy</hi> which called them, and waited on them, calleth us, even a God who hath <hi>no reſpect of perſons; but in every Nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him, Acts</hi> 10.37.

The ſame <hi>Goſpel</hi> and Word of God, in the main, though under various promulgations and adminiſtrations: Thoſe before the flood were under the <hi>Covenant of the promiſed ſeed,</hi> made <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to mankind in Adam.</hi> Thoſe after the flood were under the <hi>ſame Covenant</hi> renewed <hi>univerſally</hi> to <hi>mankind</hi> in <hi>Noah.</hi> The Iſraelites were under the ſame Covenant renewed to them <hi>ſpecially in Abraham,</hi> with ſpecial additions; and after under that Covenant <hi>ſeconded with the Law</hi> which was given to <hi>Moſes:</hi> And all Chriſtians after Chriſts Reſurrection are under the <hi>perfected Covenant of Grace,</hi> and have the ſame word of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for their rule; even the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the power of God, to the ſalvation of every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 1.16.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="566" facs="tcp:59417:305"/>5. They had but the <hi>ſame Promiſes</hi> in this Covenant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to aſſure them of the ſalvation which they now poſſeſs. They had no other charter from God to ſhew, nor any but this <hi>univerſal act of oblivion</hi> to truſt to for the <hi>pardon of all their ſins,</hi> which we have to truſt to for the pardon of ours, <hi>John</hi> 3.16.18. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. The promiſe which was made to the Jews, and to their children, was made alſo to them <hi>that are afar off, and to as many as the Lord ſhall call,</hi> Acts 2.39. <hi>For the promiſe that he ſhould be heir of the world, was not to Abraham or his ſeed through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.13. And <hi>therefore it was of faith,</hi> that it might be by <hi>grace, to the end the promiſe might</hi> be ſure to all <hi>the ſeed, not only to that which is of the Law,</hi> but to <hi>that alſo which is of the faith of Abraham,</hi> who is the <hi>father of us all, v.</hi> 16. That it might appear that God juſtified not <hi>Abraham</hi> for any peculiar carnal priviledge, but as a <hi>Believer,</hi> which is a reaſon common to him with all <hi>Believers: To whom alſo their faith ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for righteouſneſs,</hi> v. 24. <hi>Godlineſs ſtill is profitable to all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8.</p>
               <p>Yea what difference there is in both theſe forementioned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, it is to <hi>our</hi> advantage: we have the moſt perfected Rule, and the fulleſt Promiſes; and we have many Promiſes fulfilled to us, which were not fulfilled to them in their daies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. laſt. And we are nearer the final accompliſhment of all the promiſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They had the <hi>ſame Motives</hi> to faith, and patience, and godlineſs as we have: They could have no greater <hi>happineſs</hi> offered them, nor any greater <hi>puniſhment</hi> threatned, to drive them from ſin by fear: They could have no <hi>higher ends</hi> than ours; nor any nobler <hi>reaſons</hi> to be religious. The ſame <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and <hi>ends</hi> did bring them through all temptations and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, to everlaſting life, which we have alſo to ſatisfie us, and to carry us on, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſame ſpirit did <hi>illuminate, ſanctifie</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> them, which is <hi>illuminating, ſanctifying,</hi> and <hi>quickening</hi> us. All the moſt excellent and heavenly endowments and workings of their ſouls, were wrought by the ſame operator who is ſtill at work in all the Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>There are diverſities of gifts,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:59417:305"/>
but the ſame Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.4. <hi>We have the ſame Spirit of Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. All that are Sons have the ſame <hi>Spirit of the Son,</hi> even the Spirit of <hi>Adoption, Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.26. which is the Spirit of <hi>Power,</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and of <hi>a ſound mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7. We have the ſame Almighty Power within us, to deſtroy our ſins, to raiſe up our ſluggiſh hearts to God, to keep us in his Love, to overcome the fleſh, which did all theſe excellent works in them. We are <hi>ſealed with the ſame ſeal,</hi> and are known by the ſame mark, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. and are actuated by the ſame heavenly principle as they were.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We are members of the ſame <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> which is the body of Chriſt: For there is but <hi>one body,</hi> whatever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the members there be, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6, 7, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. We are members of the ſame City and Family of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. We are in the ſame Ship which conveyed them to the Haven: We are Diſciples in the ſame School, where they learnt the way to life eternal: We are workmen in the ſame Vineyard, where they procured their reward.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They had the <hi>ſame work to do</hi> as we have; the <hi>ſame God</hi> to love and ſerve; the <hi>ſame Chriſt</hi> to believe in; the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to obey; the ſame things to <hi>believe</hi> (in the main) the ſame things to <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>pray for</hi>; the ſame things to <hi>love,</hi> and the ſame to <hi>hate</hi>; the ſame things (in the main) which are <hi>ſin</hi> to us, were <hi>ſin to them,</hi> and the ſame life of holineſs, temperance and righteouſneſs, which is commanded us, was commanded them. They had the ſame temptations to reſiſt, and the ſame fleſhly mind to overcome, and the ſame ſenſes, and appetites, and paſſions to rule; the ſame enemies to overcome; and the ſame or greater ſufferings to bear, as is ſaid before.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They had but the ſame means and helps as we have (except ſome Prophets and Apoſtles, and extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in one age:) And what <hi>they received of the Lord,</hi> they have <hi>delivered unto us,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. We have the ſame <hi>Goſpel</hi> to to teach us; the ſame <hi>Sacraments</hi> to initiate and confirm us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame Paſtors and Teachers, for office, to inſtruct us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12, 13, 14, 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Faſting,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> and <hi>Church-communion,</hi> and mutual <hi>Exhortation,</hi> which are <hi>our</hi> helps and means, were theirs.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The ſame <hi>method of Providence</hi> which carryed them on,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:59417:306"/>
is ſtill on foot for all the Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9, 18. &amp; 86.5. He broke them, and bound them up; he caſt them down, and raiſed them, as he doth us now: He made them contrite, and then did comfort them: He led them through as rude a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and they had as many wild beaſts to aſſault them, and as many dangers round about them as we have: They had ſeaſons of adverſity, and ſeaſons of proſperity; their ſtormy and their ſunſhine daies; their troubles, which quickened their cryes to God, and the gracious anſwer of thoſe cryes; and were led to Heaven in the ſame courſe of providence as we are.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And, to conclude, the ſame <hi>Heaven</hi> is prepared for us, and offered, yea given to us, which they poſſeſs. It is ours in <hi>right,</hi> though our title be not <hi>abſolutely perfect,</hi> till we have finally preſevered and overcome: We are heirs of God, and co-heirs with Chriſt, having his ſeal and earneſt; if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be glorified with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16.17. The Kingdom is prepared for all them that love him. Chriſt prayed for all that the Father had given him; and for all that ſhould believe by his Word, <hi>John</hi> 17.2, 20, 27. even that they may have eternal life, and may be with him where he is, to ſee his glory: Whoſoever believeth ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life, <hi>John</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>In all this you may ſee, how like their condition in this world was unto ours, and that our way is the ſame which all thoſe have gone, that are now paſt all theſe ſnares and dangers, ſins and miſeries, in the preſence of their <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Direct. 5. When you have made theſe compariſons, think next what an excellent <hi>benefit</hi> it will be to <hi>you,</hi> to <hi>look thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly and frequently to the Saints,</hi> that are gone before you into glory. All theſe unſpeakable <hi>benefits</hi> will follow it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will much quicken and confirm our faith: As we do the more eaſily truſt the boat, and boat-man, when we ſee many thouſand paſſengers ſafely landed by him: And we eaſily truſt the Phyſician, when we ſee many thouſands cured by him, who were once in our caſe; ſo it will greatly ſatisfie the ſoul againſt the ſuſpicions and fears of unbelief, when faith ſeeth all the glorified Saints, that are actually, ſaved by Chriſt already, and have obtained all that we believe and ſeek: Methinks I
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:59417:306"/>
hear <hi>Henoch, Joſhua, Abraham, Peter, Paul, John, Cyprian, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius, Auguſtine, Melancthon, Calvin, Zanchius, Rogers, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Hooper, Jewel, Grindal, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, Hilderſham, Ames, Dod, Baines, Bolton, Gataker,</hi> with thouſands ſuch, as men ſtanding on the further ſide of the river, and calling to us that muſt come after them [Fear not the depths, or ſtorms, or ſtreams; truſt boldly that veſſel, and that faithful Pilot; we truſted him, and none of us have miſcarried, but all of us are here landed ſafe: We were once in ſtorms, and doubts, and fears, as you now are; but it is our diffidence, and not our confidence, which proved our infirmity and ſhame.] Who would not bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow ſuch a multitude of excellent perſons, who have ſped ſo well?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will alſo much confirm our <hi>hope</hi> (that is, our glad <hi>expectation</hi> of the Crown) when our apprehenſions of it grow dull and ſlack, and our feare do grow upon us, and we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to queſtion whether ever ſuch a happineſs will be our lot, the ſight of theſe that are now triumphing in the actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, will baniſh deſpair, and much revive us: We cannot but think, they were once as low and bad as I, and had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties to overcome: and why may not I then be as holy and as happy as they?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such a ſight will greatly quicken our <hi>deſires,</hi> to attain their <hi>happineſs,</hi> and to go their <hi>way:</hi> As when <hi>worldlings</hi> ſee the grandeur, and honours, and power of <hi>Great men</hi> (as they are yet called) it maketh them think, how brave a life is this? And as the <hi>ſenſual,</hi> when they ſee their companions in the <hi>Tavern,</hi> or <hi>Gaming-houſe,</hi> or <hi>Play-houſe,</hi> or the <hi>merry fool-houſe,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> accounteth it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.4. do long to be with them, and to partake of their beloved pleaſure: ſo when by faith we ſee the departed Saints in glory, and think where our old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance are, and the multitudes of wiſe and holy ſouls, that are gone before, it will greatly ſtir up our ſluggiſh deſires, and make us long for the ſame felicity, and to be as near to God as they are.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it will do much to direct us in the way: For we muſt follow them as they followed Chriſt. As the hiſtory of the Wars of <hi>Alexander, Caeſar, Tamerlane, &amp;c.</hi> will teach men how to fight for temporal tyrannical domination; ſo the
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:59417:307"/>
hiſtory of the Saints do teach us how to fight againſt ſpiritual wickedneſſes and powers, and how to take the proſpering way. It is eaſie there to find, whether lazineſs or labour, whether ſenſuality or ſpirituality hath alwaies been the way to Heaven? Whether Saints were gluttons, drunkards, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, riotous, licentious and proud, or temporate, chaſte, mortified and humble? whether the Saints were the ſcorners, or the ſcorned, the oppreſſors, or the oppreſſed, the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or the perſecuted; the burdens, or the bleſſings of the times they lived in: When the world is divided about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and every Party hath a ſeveral way, for the Unity, and the Reformation, and the Communion of the Churches, and the right Government, Diſcipline and Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God; how eaſie and ſafe is it (in the main, and in all things of neceſſity) to look back and ſee which way it was that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did go to Heaven by; and what terms they were on which their Union, Communion, Government, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Worſhip were performed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſight of bleſſed ſouls by faith, will alſo increaſe the <hi>Reſolution</hi> and <hi>Fortitude</hi> of the mind. Faintneſs and puſilani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſeize upon us when we look only on the difficulties and dangers: But when we ſee the thouſands that have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them all, by the ſame means which we are called to uſe; it ſteeleth our courage, and maketh us reſolve to break through all: When we think only how mortal our diſeaſes are, our hearts do fail us: But when all that were cured of the very ſame, do call to us, and ſay, [Never fear; there is no diſeaſe too hard for your Phyſician; he hath cured us of the very ſame, and cureth all that ever truſt him, and uſe his remedies] This will embolden a fainting mind. Therefore in the fore-cited text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. It is ſaid, <hi>Be not ſlothful</hi> (which there meaneth, ſuch <hi>as faint with deſpondency, deſpair or fears) but followers of them who by faith and patience inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi>] When we look on the Saints tribulations for the faith, we are apt to faint (as ſome do that ſtand by another that is under the Surgeons hands) <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.13. But when we ſee them in triumph, it cureth our cowardize (and it is they only that <hi>labour and faint not,</hi> that are <hi>crowned,</hi> and that <hi>reap in due ſeaſon, &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9.) that is, who <hi>faint not into
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:59417:307"/>
ceſſation,</hi> or ſo as to be <hi>overcome.</hi>) Do you think when the Iſraelites paſſed through the Red Sea, that the <hi>Leaders</hi> had not the <hi>greateſt</hi> tryal? and that it was not an exceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their courage, who <hi>came after</hi> in the rear, when they ſaw moſt of their brethren ſafely paſſed through? Look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly upon the <hi>ſouls in Heaven,</hi> and you will <hi>do</hi> or <hi>ſuffer</hi> any thing to follow them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And it will greatly provoke us to <hi>diligence in well doing:</hi> Look up to your Brethren, and you will mend your pace. If a horſe be going towards his <hi>Paſture,</hi> he will go chearfully; eſpecially when he ſeeth his <hi>companions</hi> there. It will make us pray hard, and meditate ſtudiouſly, and work laboriouſly, and watch diligently, that we may be with Chriſt, where our Brethren are, and receive the end of our faith and labour.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And to <hi>ſee our Brethren in Heaven</hi> before us, will greatly help us to <hi>ſuffer for Chriſt,</hi> and to be <hi>patient</hi> in any tribulation which befalleth us. When we ſee them in glory, we ſhall ſource ſtay to complain of the ſoulneſs or narrowneſs of the way: but look before us, and go on through all. Or if the fleſh do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, and our hearts begin to fail us, it will make us <hi>lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and make ſtrait paths for our feet,</hi> Heb. 12.12, 13. and <hi>to gird up the loins of our minds, and be ſober, and hope to the end,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.13. When we look forward to the end of former ſufferers, it will cauſe us to <hi>poſſeſs our ſouls in patience,</hi> and to let it have <hi>its perfect work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. It will much overcome the <hi>fears of death:</hi> It is no ſmall <hi>abatement</hi> of them that <hi>Cicero,</hi> and ſuch honeſt Heathens had, to think of the thouſands of their worthieſt Anceſtors, and that they were to go the common way of all mankind: But how much more may it encourage a Believer, to think that he is not only to go the way of all the world, through the gate of mortality; but the way alſo which all Gods <hi>Saints</hi> have gone (ſave <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>) who are now in Heaven. <hi>Thus died</hi> all the Prophets, and the holy men of God; yea Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, before us; that death might be conquered when it ſeemed to have conquered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It will do much to raiſe us from <hi>hypocritical reſerves,</hi> and <hi>temporizings,</hi> and from <hi>lukewarmneſs,</hi> and reſting in low
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:59417:308"/>
degrees. When our converſation is with the holy ones above, we ſhall have upon our minds an ambition to attain to their degrees; and to do Gods will on Earth, as it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. It will much encline us to the higheſt and nobleſt ſort of duty, which the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. He that converſeth only with his own ſad, tempted, ſinful heart, and with tempted, faulty, mourning Chriſtians, may learn to <hi>confeſs,</hi> and <hi>mourn,</hi> and <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>pray:</hi> But he that alſo converſeth with glorified ſpirits, will be ſo rapt up with their heavenly melody, that he will learn and long to love God more fervently, to praiſe him more chearfully, and to give him thanks more abundantly for his mercies. <hi>Heaven-work</hi> is learnt by a <hi>heavenly mind,</hi> in the uſe of a <hi>heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. And to <hi>look</hi> much at our <hi>Brethren</hi> that are now in glory, will alſo fill our lives with <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and make our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion our <hi>continual joy</hi>; and will help us to a foretaſte of Heaven on Earth: For we ſhall as it were take our ſelves to be almoſt with then; and <hi>their</hi> melodies will <hi>be our delight</hi>; and <hi>love to them,</hi> will make their joyes to be our own. And though it is the ſight of God and our Mediatour by faith, which muſt be our chiefeſt hope and joy; yet while we are here men in fleſh, yea more when we have laid by fleſh and blood, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the bleſſed ſpirits, and heavenly hoſt, will be a great, though ſubordinate part of our heavenly felicity and delight.</p>
               <p>Direct. 6. When you have gone thus far, conſider what <hi>obligations lie upon you to converſe by Faith with your Brethren in Heaven, and to look up frequently to their ſtate and work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Your neceſſary <hi>Love to God requireth it:</hi> For as your Love to him muſt be ſhewed by your loving his Image in your Brethren; ſo it requireth you, <hi>to love them moſt</hi> that are <hi>likeſt</hi> God: or elſe you love them not <hi>for his likeneſs.</hi> And it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth you to <hi>love them moſt</hi> whom <hi>God loveth moſt</hi>; and that is thoſe that are <hi>likeſt</hi> him, and <hi>neareſt</hi> him. And he that loveth God in his creatures, and loveth any one truly for God, muſt love the Angels and perfected Spirits beſt, becauſe they love him beſt, and are neareſt him, and likeſt to him, and are alſo moſt beloved by him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="573" facs="tcp:59417:308"/>2. The <hi>common nature</hi> of Love and Humanity requireth it: For it requireth us to love <hi>that beſt which is beſt</hi>; (as is ſaid) But the bleſſed ones in Heaven <hi>are better</hi> than any here on Earth; and therefore ſhould be <hi>better loved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The nature of our <hi>Love to the Saints</hi> requireth it: For if we love them as <hi>Saints and Godly,</hi> we ſhall love thoſe moſt that are <hi>moſt holy</hi>; and that is the bleſſed ones above. And if we <hi>love them moſt,</hi> we ſhall certainly <hi>mind</hi> them, and <hi>converſe</hi> with them by Faith, and not be voluntary <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is part of that <hi>heavenly converſation,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21. When it is ſaid, that our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in Heaven,</hi> it ſignifieth that our <hi>Burgeſhip</hi> is there, and our <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>great concerns</hi> are there, and our <hi>dwelling</hi> is there, and our <hi>trading</hi> and <hi>thriving buſineſs</hi> is there, and for it; and our <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>fellow-citizens,</hi> and thoſe that we daily trade and <hi>converſe</hi> with, in <hi>love</hi> and <hi>familiarity,</hi> are there; even as our <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>Head,</hi> and our <hi>Inheritance</hi> is there. He never knew a <hi>heavenly converſation,</hi> that pretending there to know <hi>God alone,</hi> hath <hi>no converſe</hi> with his <hi>holy ones</hi> that attend him; and doth not live as a member of <hi>their ſociety</hi> in the City of God; that doth not with <hi>ſome delight</hi> behold their holineſs, unity and order, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>honouring of God</hi> and our <hi>Redeemer</hi> doth require it, (that we daily converſe with the Saints in Heaven:) Becauſe it is in them that God is ſeen, in the greateſt glory of his Love; and it is in them that the Power, and Efficacy, and Love of our dear Redeemer moſt appeareth. You judge now of the Father by his Children, and of the Phyſician by his Patients, and of the Builder by the Houſe, and of the Captain by his Victories. And if you ſee <hi>no better children</hi> of God, than ſuch <hi>childiſh</hi> crying, feeble, froward, diſeaſed, burdenſome ones as <hi>we are,</hi> you will rob him of the chief of this his honour. And if you look at <hi>none</hi> of the <hi>Patients</hi> of our Saviour, but ſuch <hi>lame</hi> and languid, pained, groaning, diſeaſed, half-cured ones <hi>as we</hi>; you will rob him of the glory of his <hi>skill and cures.</hi> And if you look but to ſuch an imperfect broken fabrick, as the Church on Earth, you will diſhonour the Builder. And if you look to no other Victories of Chriſt and his Spirit, but what
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:59417:309"/>
is made in this confuſed, dark, and bedlam world, you will be tempted to diſhonour his conduct and his conqueſts. But if you will look to his <hi>Children in Heaven,</hi> who are perfected in his Love and Likeneſs, and to Chriſts <hi>Patients</hi> which are <hi>there</hi> perfectly cured, and to his <hi>Building</hi> in the heavenly unity and glory, and to all his <hi>Victories</hi> as there <hi>compleat,</hi> then you will give him the glory which is his due, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. &amp; 22. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So alſo you will <hi>diſhonour Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> if you converſe not with the Saints above. For the reaſons laſt given: For you will judge of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of <hi>Religion,</hi> by ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect things as here you ſee, where men turn Religion to the ſervice of their worldly intereſts and ends, and fight for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, faction, tyranny, uſurpation, and worldly luſts, under the ſacred names of Religion and the Church; and for the pretended Love of Chriſt, and one another, do tear the Church into ſhreds, and worry, and hunt, and devour one another: You will be tempted to be Infidels, if you do not <hi>here</hi> converſe with the ſincere, humble, holy, charitable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and look up to Heaven to perfect ſouls: And then you will ſee a Church that is truly amiable, holy, unanimous and glorious in perfect Love.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If you look not up to thoſe in Heaven, you will quite miſunderſtand the providences of God, in the proſperity of the wicked, and the ſufferings of the Saints, and the changes that are uſually made on Earth: You will begin to think, that ſin is ſafe, and the wicked are not ſo miſerable as they are, nor godly diligence ſo profitable a thing; you will not know the <hi>reaſons</hi> of <hi>providence,</hi> unleſs you can ſee unto the end: And the <hi>ultimate end</hi> is not on Earth. But go into the Sanctuary, and take the proſpective of the promiſe, and look to the <hi>bleſſed ſouls with Chriſt,</hi> and all the riddle will be expounded to you, and you will be reconciled to all the <hi>providences</hi> of God: You are ſtrange to <hi>truth,</hi> if you are ſtrange to the triumphing Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The progreſſive nature of your faith and godlineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it. You are travelling to Heaven, where the bleſſed are, and are nearer to them than when you firſt believed: And the nearer you are to them, the more you ſhould mind them,
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:59417:309"/>
and by Faith and Love be familiar with them: And when you are almoſt at home, you ſhould be even ready to embrace your friends at the meeting.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Your <hi>Relation</hi> to the bleſſed Spirits doth require it; and your Chriſtian and ingenuous diſpoſition towards them. 1. Are they not ſuch as were latety near you in the fleſh; ſome of them your deareſt companions and friends; and ſhould you cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly forget them? 2. Are they not not now your friends who love you better than they could do on earth? Doubtleſs their knowledge and memory is not grown leſs, to forget you, if once they knew you; but they are like to know much more: And their Goodneſs being increaſed, their Love is increaſed, and not diminiſhed. 3. And you belong to the ſame Society with them; even to the Body or Church of Chriſt, whoſe nobler part above, and inferiour part on Earth, do make up the whole. Is it not expreſly ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23. that <hi>we are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the City of the Living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and to the general Aſſembly, and Church of the firſt born, which are written in Heaven?</hi> (that is, to thoſe which as the firſt born, are moſt noble, and poſſeſſed of the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and are there entered inhabitants already:) <hi>And to God the Judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediatour of the New Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> And what is it to <hi>come</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> but to <hi>come,</hi> or be <hi>joyned</hi> to that <hi>Society,</hi> of which <hi>they</hi> are the nobler part? Will you be <hi>Fellow-Citizens</hi> with them, and have no communion with them, nor ſeriouſly remember them? How can you remember God himſelf, and not remember thoſe that are his Courtiers, and nearer to him than you are? And how can you think of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not think of his <hi>Body?</hi> Or how can you think of <hi>his Body,</hi> and forget the moſt excellent and honourable parts? Or how can you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your <hi>ſelves,</hi> and forget your chiefeſt <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Lovers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The very <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Life of Faith</hi> requireth us, to look much to the departed Saints: The <hi>Life of Faith</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in our converſing with the things <hi>unſeen</hi>; as the life of <hi>ſight</hi> or <hi>ſenſe</hi> is our converſing with things <hi>ſeen:</hi> If you love, and think on none of the Saints, but thoſe that are <hi>within your

ſight,</hi> you live (ſo far) but as by <hi>ſight:</hi> Though <hi>Faith</hi> live not <hi>upon Saints</hi> properly, but <hi>on God,</hi> and our Redeemer; yet it liveth and converſeth <hi>with the Saints:</hi> If it work aright, it will as it were ſet you among them, and make you live on Earth, as if you heard their ſongs of praiſe, and ſaw their Thrones of Glory.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The preſent <hi>neceſſities of your condition in this world,</hi> do require you to look much to the <hi>Saints above</hi> (as is before ſhewed in the benefits recited:) We live <hi>here</hi> among ſuch <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>things</hi> as are objects of continual <hi>ſorrow</hi> to us: And have we not need of ſome <hi>more comfortable company?</hi> If you had nothing at <hi>home</hi> but <hi>chiding,</hi> and <hi>diſcontent,</hi> and <hi>poverty,</hi> you will be willing of ſo much recreation, as to be invited to feaſt ſometimes, where there is plenty, pleaſure and content. If you lived among <hi>groaning, ſick</hi> or melancholy perſons in an Hoſpital, you would be glad ſometimes of merryer company, a little to refreſh your minds. Alas, what a deal of ſin do we daily ſee or hear of? and what a deal of ſorrow is round about us?

<pb n="577" facs="tcp:59417:310"/>
How ſad is it to hear all Chriſtians ſpeak of love and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Unity and Peace, while few of them <hi>know the way of Peace,</hi> or how to hold their own hands from tearing the Church into more pieces, while theſe peaceable words are in their mouths?

To ſee their Prelates take their own domination, wealth and greatneſs, to be really the proſperity of the Church, and the intereſt of the Goſpel and Kingdom of Chriſt; and to promote the Goſpel by ſilencing or prohibiting the moſt able, zealous, faithful Preachers of it; and to go with a drawn ſword among the people, and ſay, <hi>Love us, or we will kill you: Love Chriſt and us,</hi> or the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and wrack ſhall reach you love: To ſee them take the terrifying of men by corporal penalties, to be their chiefeſt work, and the way of Love to be but ſuch <hi>popularity</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will not now and then a walk in Heaven, be a great refreſhing to the mind that hath been long haunted with ſuch hideous and ugly ſpecters as all theſe?

               <p n="12">12. Laſtly, The remembrance and obſervation of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inhabitants, is the way that is commended and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to all Believers, and that as part of their <hi>ordinary duty,</hi> in their <hi>prayers to God.</hi> He hath not only minded us that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are ſtill <hi>living,</hi> to prove the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Matth.</hi> 12.27. but hath alſo comforted the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants of Heaven, by deſcribing the joy of <hi>Lazarus</hi> as in <hi>Abrahams boſome, Luke</hi> 16.22, 23. and introduced <hi>Abraham</hi> as pleading <hi>Lazarus's</hi> cauſe, <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. And hath made it a part of the comfortable deſcription of his Kingdom, that we ſhall <hi>ſit down</hi> with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11. And when he would appear transfigured in a glimpſe of his glory, to <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> he would not do it alone, but with <hi>Moſes and Elias talking with him,</hi> Matth. 17.

As himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth his appearing as with his <hi>glorious Angels,</hi> Mat. 25.31. <hi>All the holy Angels with him.</hi> Whether it be all the <hi>bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> of the <hi>higher worlds,</hi> or only all thoſe of them, who were deputed to the ſervice of the Church on earth (<hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10.) and ſo were made <hi>Angels to man,</hi> I paſs over. And <hi>Henoch</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam</hi> propheſied, ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lord cometh

with ten thouſands of his Saints, &amp;c,</hi> Jude v. 14. Many other Scriptures tell us, that we muſt not leave out the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> when we look towards Heaven by faith, and when we converſe and walk above.</p>
               <p>But this is but as on the by: That which I intend for your ſpecial obſervation, is, the <hi>third Petition of the Lords Prayer,</hi> where the annexed clauſe (which ſeemeth to referr to all the three firſt Petitions) doth ſet the <hi>heavenly Church</hi> before us, as the <hi>Pattern</hi> of that obedience to the will of God, which both we, and all the world muſt imitate, and <hi>pray to God</hi> that we <hi>may imitate. [Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is done in Heaven.</hi>] Here Chriſt requireth all Chriſtians in Prayer, to <hi>look up</hi> to the <hi>Heavenly Society,</hi> and to conſider <hi>how they do the Will of God,</hi> and to make it their <hi>Pattern,</hi> and in their <hi>daily Prayers,</hi> as men that long for their celeſtial perfection, to pray that they may become their <hi>imitators:</hi> even as the Scholars in the loweſt form in the ſchool, muſt look at thoſe in the higheſt form, and deſire and endeavour to attain to their degree. You ſee them that this is a <hi>commanded ordinary duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Direct. 7. Conſider next <hi>wherein it is that your converſe with Angels, and the perfected ſpirits of the juſt conſiſteth</hi>; that you may neither by your miſtake, neglect it, nor carry it too far.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Negatively: 1. It is not a <hi>Deifying</hi> them, as the Heathen did their <hi>Hero's,</hi> and their <hi>Divi:</hi> They are ſtill but <hi>Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> and muſt have nothing aſcribed to them of the <hi>Divine</hi> Prerogative.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor doth it conſiſt in <hi>building Temples</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> to their honour, which ſavoureth at leaſt of a compliance with Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor doth it at all conſiſt in <hi>praying to them.</hi> 1. Becauſe, as we know that they are not omnipreſent, or omniſcient; ſo 2. We know not at all when they are preſent, and when they do hear us, and when not. 3. Nor do we know which of them it is that is at any time preſent with us. 4. Nor have we any precept, preſident, promiſe, or other encouragement to ſuch prayers in Gods Word, but rather much to keep us from it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor yet is it in <hi>deſiring them to pray for us:</hi> For that
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:59417:313"/>
which is their duty, they better know than we; and it is little that we know of their capacities or opportunities. And we have no Word of God neither to encourage us to this.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nor doth it conſiſt in <hi>chuſing</hi> any one of them above the reſt, for <hi>our guardian and protector</hi>; and ſo committing our ſelves to their care. For we have no reaſon to be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, as to think that <hi>we</hi> have the <hi>choice</hi> of our <hi>own Protector</hi>; or that it is a matter at all referred to us; or that they will undertake it ever the more for our choice.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor yet may we <hi>pretend to know</hi> what particular Saint or Angel is <hi>deputed of God</hi> to our <hi>protection:</hi> For there is not the leaſt diſcovery of it in Nature, or in the Word of God: And he that pretendeth <hi>extraordinary revelation</hi> of it, muſt be ſure to <hi>prove</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Nor may we <hi>pray for them,</hi> as if they were in <hi>purgatory,</hi> or in any <hi>miſery</hi> or danger which did need our prayers for them: For we have neither reaſon to believe the thing, nor any precept or encouragement to the work.</p>
               <p>And as all theſe ſeven are unlawful things, ſo theſe alſo that follow muſt be medled with very tenderly and cautelouſly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our <hi>Praiſes</hi> of them, muſt be ſober and wary; and ſuch as are in a plain tendency to the <hi>praiſes of God</hi> and <hi>godlineſs,</hi> leſt before we are aware, we kindle ſuperſtition in the minds of the auditors. Praiſe them we may; but with a care of the manner, meaſure and conſequents, and with a due reſpect to the praiſe of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of their <hi>bodies,</hi> and their ſolemn Juſtification at the <hi>day of Judgment,</hi> though lawful in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> yet muſt be done with very great caution. And it is fitter that we pray together in general for the Reſurrection of <hi>All the members</hi> of Chriſt, both thoſe that are dead, and thoſe that will be, than to fix upon the <hi>dead diſtinctly,</hi> becauſe as we have no precept or example for it in the Scriptures; ſo the minds of the hearers (if it be publick) may eaſily abuſe our example to errour and exceſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our <hi>thankfulneſs to them</hi> for their love and benefits, muſt be very cautelouſly expreſſed: Not by a <hi>verbal thanksgiving to them,</hi> of whom we are uncertain <hi>when they hear us:</hi> Nor yet in any ſuch language as tendeth to encroach upon the
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:59417:313"/>
honour of our <hi>great Benefactor</hi>; nor to acknowledge any more as <hi>from them,</hi> than as the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And in our acknowledgements of their <hi>general prayers</hi> for the Church, we muſt take heed of feigning them to be more <hi>particular</hi> than we can prove that they are.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And we muſt take heed of all ſuch <hi>Rhetorical Proſopopeia's</hi> as tend to delude the hearers or the readers; as if we would draw them to believe the preſence and audience of thoſe ſpirits which we intend not to expreſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And our honouring of the <hi>memory</hi> of their <hi>Martyrdom</hi> or <hi>Holineſs,</hi> muſt be ſo cautelous, that it tend not to Idolatry or Superſtition: It is <hi>lawful in it ſelf</hi> to keep the <hi>relicks</hi> of a <hi>Saint</hi> or a <hi>Friend,</hi> and to keep a ſolemn thankful memorial of Gods mercy to his Church, in her moſt excellent helpers, and ſucceſsfulleſt inſtruments of her good: But in a time when theſe are commonly abuſed to ſuperſtition, the conſequents may make that evil, which in other circumſtances might be good. When the Primitive Paſtors led their people, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the places where their <hi>neighbours ſuffered Martyrdom</hi> for Chriſt, and there praiſed God for <hi>their praiſed conſtancy,</hi> to encourage the people, and engage themſelves to be true to Chriſt, and die as conſtantly as others did; this then had good effects; and if it had been uſed more cautelouſly, had been laudable: But they did not foreſee the great inconveniencies of relicks, pilgrimages, prayers to Saints, &amp;c. which in after-ages it introduced: And now, it muſt be with very great caution indeed, if we will imitate them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>To pray to God to hear their general prayers for the Church,</hi> (ſuch as thoſe mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10.) doth intimate no falſe doctrine that I know of. But it is a practice that hath danger, and no Scripture precept or example to encourage it, nor ſolid reaſon, that I remember: And if God would have had us uſed it, it's like he would have made it known.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Affirmatively:</hi> Our converſe with thoſe in Heaven conſiſteth in all theſe parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt acknowledge <hi>our Relation to them,</hi> and not think that they are nothing to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt <hi>not forget them,</hi> but <hi>ſee them by faith,</hi> and take it as part of our <hi>daily buſineſs</hi> to have ſome daily converſation with them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:59417:314"/>3. We muſt <hi>love them</hi> with a <hi>peculiar love</hi>; even better than we love the <hi>godly</hi> upon earth: becauſe they <hi>are better,</hi> and liker unto God, and love him more, and are more beloved by him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt ſpecially rejoyce that God is glorified in and by them; and look often to them as the more illuſtrious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenters of the Divine Perfections, than any of the Saints on Earth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We muſt <hi>greatly rejoyce in their own felicity and glory</hi>; even as if it were our own. If we did <hi>ſee</hi> with our eyes our old dear friend, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome, triumphing now in the glory of the bleſſed, we could not chuſe but be daily very glad on their behalf; to ſee and think, O what fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity do my friends enjoy! And faith ſhould make it in ſome meaſure to you, as if you ſaw it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We muſt have a <hi>grateful ſenſe in our minds</hi> of their <hi>love to us</hi>; and muſt give God thanks for his Angels miniſtrations for us. For doubtleſs, as they are wiſer and better than any of our friends on earth; ſo they have a better, a purer and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner kind of Love to us, than theſe below have. And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels diſdain not to be Chriſts ſervants for our good; yea for our ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. For, <hi>are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation,</hi> Matth. 18.10. <hi>Their Angels alwaies behold the face of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven,</hi> Pſal. 34.7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord campeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them,</hi> Pſal. 91.11. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy waies. They ſhall bear thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone,</hi> Luke 15.10. <hi>There is joy in the preſence of the Angels of God over one ſinner that repenteth,</hi> Luke 16.22. <hi>The beggar dyed and was carryed by Angels into Abrahams boſome.</hi> Though the <hi>great Love</hi> is that of <hi>God</hi> our Creator, Redeemer and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier, and our <hi>chiefeſt gratitude</hi> is due to him; even for the benefit which we have by any of his creatures; yet <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mental thankfulneſs</hi> is due to the <hi>rational creatures</hi> which are his <hi>voluntary inſtruments</hi>; becauſe they do what they do out of <hi>real love to us</hi>; otherwiſe we ſhould owe thankfulneſs to none, either benefactor, friend or parents.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And our believing converſe with the bleſſed ſpirits, muſt
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:59417:314"/>
make us earneſtly <hi>deſire to be like them</hi>; even to be as like them here as poſſibly we may, and to <hi>be with them,</hi> that we may be perfect as they are perfect. We muſt long to be near God, as they are, and to know him, and love him, as they do; and this holy ambition is well pleaſing to God: Though we muſt not deſire <hi>to be as God,</hi> we muſt deſire to <hi>know and love him perfectly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. And hence we muſt proceed to a <hi>ſober imitation</hi> of them as they are <hi>now</hi> employed in <hi>Heaven</hi>: Not in thoſe particulars wherein their caſe and ours differ (as to thank God for that conqueſt which they have made, and that glory which they do poſſeſs, &amp;c.) But in all thoſe duties, which in ſome degree, belong to us as well as them.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, Ask what kind of Religion is likeſt to that which is in Heaven? Is it ſtudying bare words, and diſputing about things unprofitable, or contending and quarrelling about precedency, preheminence or domination? Or is it not rather the cleareſt knowledge, and the ferventeſt Love of God, and all his holy ones, and the fulleſt content, delight and reſt of the ſoul in God, and the higheſt praiſes and thankſgivings, with the readieſt and chearfulleſt obedience.</p>
               <p>And what kind of Religious performances are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent which we muſt principally intend? Groans, and tears, and penitent confeſſions, and moans, are very ſuitable to our preſent ſtate, while we have ſin and ſuffering: But ſurely they are duties of the lower rank: For Heaven more aboundeth with praiſes and thankſgiving; and therefore we muſt labour to be fitter for them, and more abundant in them; not caſting off any <hi>needful humiliations,</hi> and <hi>penitent complaints</hi>; but grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as faſt as we can <hi>above</hi> the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of them, by conquering the ſin which is the <hi>cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So ask, what is it that would make the <hi>Church on Earth</hi> to be likeſt to that part which is in Heaven? Is it ſtriving what Paſtors ſhall be greateſt, or have precedency, or be called <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lords</hi> or <hi>Benefactors?</hi> Luke 22.24, 25, 26. 1 Pet. 5.3, 4, 5. Or is it in making the flock of Chriſt, to dread the ſecular power of the Shepherds, and tremble before them, as they do before the Wolf? Or is it in a proud conceit of the peoples power to <hi>ordain</hi> their <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and to <hi>rule them</hi> and <hi>themſelves</hi>
                  <pb n="584" facs="tcp:59417:315"/>
by a <hi>major vote</hi>? Or in a ſupercilious condemning the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and a proud contempt of others as too unholy for our communion, when we never had <hi>authority to try</hi> or <hi>judge</hi> them? Is it in the multitude of Sects and diviſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every one ſaying, Our party, and our way is beſt? Surely all this is unlike to Heaven: It is rather in the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of all the members: When they all know God, eſpecially in his Love and Goodneſs, and when they fervently love him, and chearfully and univerſally obey him; and when they love each other fervently, and with a pure heart, and without diviſions do hold the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; and with one heart, and mind, and mouth, do glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God and our Redeemer. Leaving <hi>that Church-Judgment</hi> to the <hi>Paſtors</hi> which Chriſt hath put into <hi>their</hi> hands; and leaving <hi>Gods part</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> unto <hi>himſelf.</hi> This is to be like to our <hi>heavenly exemplar,</hi> and to do <hi>Gods Will on Earth as it is done in Heaven,</hi> Epheſ. 4.2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 16.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And we muſt alſo look <hi>back</hi> to the examples of their lives, while they were on earth; and ſee wherein they are to be imitated as the imitators of Jeſus Chriſt: which way went they to Heaven before us?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Laſtly, We muſt <hi>give God thanks</hi> on their behalf; for making them ſo perfect, and bringing them ſo near him, and ſaving them from ſin, and Satan, and the world, and bringing them ſafe to Heaven, through ſo many temptations, difficulties and ſufferings: For making them ſuch inſtruments of his glory, in their times, and ſhewing his glory upon them and to them in the Heavens? For making them ſuch bleſſings to the world in their generations, and for giving us in them ſuch patterns of faith, obedience and patience, and making them ſo great encouragements to us, who may the more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow them in faith, duty and ſufferings, who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered all, and ſped ſo well: For, ſhewing us by faith their preſent ſtate of glory with Chriſt, for our confirmation and conſolation. Thus far, in all theſe ten particulars, we muſt have a heavenly converſation with the glorified by Faith.</p>

               <p>In brief, this is the true imitation of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Direct 9. Never ſuffer your <hi>life of ſenſe</hi> to engage you ſo deeply <hi>in ſenſible converſe with men on earth,</hi> as to <hi>forget your heavenly relations and ſociety</hi>; but live as men that unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that you have a more high, and noble converſe every day to mind.</p>
               <p>If you are Believers indeed, let your faith go along with the ſouls of your departed friends, into glory: And if you have forgot them by an unfriendly negligence, renew your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them. Think not that thoſe only that live on earth, are fit for our converſe, and our comfort: Will you converſe with none but ignorant, ſelfiſh, worldly ſinners? Are you more contemptuous of the heavenly inhabitants, than the Gentleman in hell torments was, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.26, 27. that thought one from the dead, though it had been but a beggar, would have been reverenced even by his ſenſual brethren on earth, ſo far as to have perſwaded them unto ſaving Repentance. I tell you, a <hi>dead mans skull</hi> is oft-times a more profitable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, than moſt that you ſhall converſe with in the common world. The <hi>duſt</hi> of your departed friends, and the <hi>clay</hi> that corps are turned into, is a good medicine for thoſe eyes that are blinded with the duſt of worldly vanities. Much more ſhould you keep your acquaintance with the <hi>ſoul,</hi> which may, for all the diſtance, be perhaps more uſeful to you, than it was in the fleſh. Alas, how carnally, and coldly, or ſeldom, do moſt Profeſſors look at their Brethren, and at the Angelical hoſts that are above. <hi>They</hi> long for our <hi>converſion,</hi> and mind

               <p>Many think that they have no more buſineſs with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friends, than to ſee them decently interred, and to mourn over them, as if their removal were their loſs; or to grieve for our own loſs, when we perceive their places empty; but we ſcarce look up after them with an eye of faith, much leſs do we <hi>daily maintain our communion</hi> with them in Heaven: When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was taken up, his Diſciples <hi>gazed after him,</hi> Act. 1.10. <hi>Stephen looked up ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, and ſaw Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of God,</hi> Acts 7.55. And how ſeldome, how ſlightly do <hi>we look up,</hi> either to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> or his <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I tell you Sirs, you have not <hi>done</hi> with your <hi>friends</hi> when you have buryed their fleſh. They have left you their holy examples: They are entered before you into reſt: You are haſtening after them, and muſt be quickly with them, if you are true Believers: You muſt ſee them every day by faith: When you look to Chriſt, you muſt look <hi>to them,</hi> as his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friends, entertained by him in his family of glory. When you look up to Heaven, remember that they are there: When you think of coming thither, remember that you muſt there meet them. You muſt honour their memories more than you did on earth, becauſe they <hi>are more honourable,</hi> being more <hi>honoured of God.</hi> You muſt <hi>love</hi> them better than you did when they were on earth, becauſe they are <hi>better,</hi> and ſo more <hi>lovely:</hi> You muſt <hi>rejoyce</hi> much more for their felicity, than you did whileſt they were on earth; becauſe they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more happy than they were. Either you <hi>believe</hi> this, or you <hi>do not.</hi> If you <hi>do not believe</hi> that the dead are bleſſed that die in the Lord, and reſt from their labours, and are with Chriſt in Paradiſe, why do you <hi>ſeem Chriſtians?</hi> If you <hi>do believe</hi> it, why do you not more <hi>rejoyce</hi> with your <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified friends,</hi> than you would have done, if they had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the greateſt honours in the world?

               <p>Direct. 1. Let your firſt work, when God ſeemeth to call you away, be, to renew a diligent ſearch of your hearts and lives, and to ſee leſt in either of them there ſhould be any ſin which is not truly hated and repented of.</p>
               <p>Though this muſt be done through all your lives, yet with an extraordinary care and diligence when you are like to come ſo ſpeedily to your tryal. For it is only to <hi>Repenting Believers,</hi> that the Covenant of Grace doth pardon ſin: And the impenitent have no right to pardon. Though for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary failings which are forgotten, and for ſins which you are willing to know and remember, but cannot; a <hi>general Repentance</hi> will be accepted; (as when you pray God to ſhew you the ſins which you ſee not, and to forgive thoſe which you cannot remember or find out:) Yet thoſe which <hi>you know</hi> muſt be <hi>particularly</hi> repented of: And <hi>Repentance</hi> is a <hi>remembring</hi> duty, and will hardly forget any great and heinous ſins, which are known to be ſins indeed. If your <hi>Repentance</hi> be then to <hi>begin,</hi> alas it is high time to begin it: And though if it be <hi>ſound,</hi> it will be <hi>ſaving</hi> (that is, <hi>If it be ſuch as would ſettle you in a truly godly life, if you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover</hi>;) yet you will hardly have any <hi>aſſurance</hi> of ſalvation, or ſuch <hi>comfort</hi> in it as is deſirable to dying man: Becauſe you will very hardly <hi>know</hi> whether it come from <hi>true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>

and contain a <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi>; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be only the fruit of <hi>fear,</hi> and would come to nothing if you were reſtored to health: But he that hath truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented <hi>heretofore,</hi> and lived in uprightneſs towards God and man, and hath nothing to do, but to <hi>diſcern</hi> his ſincerity, and to exerciſe a <hi>ſpecial</hi> Repentance for ſome late or ſpecial ſins; or to do that again which he hath done unfeignedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will much more eaſily get the aſſurance and comfort of his forgiveneſs and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Renew your ſenſe of the Vanity of this world:</hi> Which at ſuch a time one would think, ſhould be very eaſie to do. When you ſee that you are near an end of all your pleaſures, and have had all (except a grave to rot in) that ever this world willd o for you, may you not eaſily then ſee, whether the godly or the worldly be the wiſer and the happier man? And what it is that the life of man ſhould be ſpent in ſeeeking after? <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2, 3. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5, 6.</p>

               <p>Of the duſt it was made, and to the duſt it muſt return: <hi>Corruption</hi> is <hi>your Father,</hi> and the <hi>Worm</hi> is <hi>your Mother,</hi> and <hi>your Siſter,</hi> Job 17.14. <hi>Drought and beat conſume the Snow-waters; ſo doth the grave thoſe which have ſinned: The womb ſhall forget him; the Worm ſhall feed ſweetly on him,</hi> Job 24.20. <hi>Fleſh and blood ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God; but this mortal muſt put on immortality,</hi> by being made <hi>a ſpiritual body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
               <p>And this fleſh hath coſt you ſo dear to carry it about; ſo much care and labour to provide it food, to repair that which daily vaniſheth away; and ſo many weary, painful hours; and ſo many fearful thoughts of dying, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you ſhould quietly reſign it to the grave, which hath been ſo long calling for it.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially conſidering what it hath done, by the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a vitiated appetite and ſenſe, againſt your ſouls: into how many ſins it hath drawn you, and what grief and ſhame it hath procured you; and what aſſurance and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly pleaſures it hath hindered; and how many repentings,
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:59417:319"/>
and purpoſes, and promiſes it hath fruſtrated, or undone: Methinks we ſhould conceive that we have long enough dwelt in ſuch an habitation.</p>
               <p>Direct. 4. <hi>Foreſee by Faith the reſurrection of the body,</hi> when it ſhall be raiſed a ſpiritual body unto Glory; and ſhall be no more an enemy to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Renew your familiarity with the bleſſed ones above.</hi> Remember that the great Army of God (the ſouls of the juſt from <hi>Adam</hi> till now) are all got ſafe through this Red Sea, and are triumphing in Heaven already; and that it is but a few ſtraglers in the end of the world that are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: And which part then ſhould you deſire to be with? And remember how ready thoſe Angels which rejoyced at your converſion, are to be your Convoy unto Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23.</p>
               <p>Direct. 6. But eſpecially think with <hi>greateſt confidence and delight, that Jeſus your Head is entred into the Heavens before you,</hi> and is making <hi>interceſſion</hi> for you, and is preparing you a place, and loveth your company, and will not loſe it. You ſhall find him ready to receive your ſouls, and preſent them ſpotleſs unto God, as the fruit of his mediation: He will have you be with him to behold his glory; and none ſhall take you out of his hands. Let his Love therefore draw up your deſires, and ſtabliſh your hearts in confidence and reſt.</p>
               <p>Direct. 7. Remember, that all that are living muſt come after you; and how quickly their turn will come; and would you wiſh to be exempt from death alone, which the whole world below muſt needs ſubmit to?</p>
               <p>Direct. 8. Think ſtill of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt your Head, that you may ſee that death is a conquered thing, and what a pledge you have of a life to come.</p>
               <p>Direct. 9. Dwell ſtill in the believing fore thoughts of the bleſſedneſs of the life to which you go, as it is your <hi>perſonal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and the <hi>perfect Love and fruition of God,</hi> with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect joyous praiſe.</p>

And labour to revive your <hi>Love to God,</hi> and then you revive your deſires and preparations.</p>
               <p>Direct. 10. Give up <hi>your ſelves wholly to the Will of God</hi>; and think how much better it is for upright Souls to be in Gods hand, than in your own. The Will of God is the firſt and laſt, the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of all the creatures. Beſides the <hi>Will of Infinite Goodneſs,</hi> there is no <hi>final Reſt</hi> for humane ſouls. But <hi>mans will</hi> is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning or <hi>firſt efficient,</hi> and the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of all obliquity and ſin: Be bold then and thankful in your approach to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring how much more ſafe and comfortable it is to be (for life and death) at Gods diſpoſal, than our own.</p>

Thy Kingdom in me, and my daily faithful ſubjection to thy Government there, muſt prepare me for the glorious endleſs Kingdom: If now thou wouldeſt pour out thy Love upon my ſoul, it would flame up towards thee, and long to meet thee, and think with daily pleaſure on that day: And my perfect Love would caſt out that fear, which maketh the thoughts of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a torment: O meet me now when my ſoul doth ſeek thee, and ſecretly cry after thee; that I may know thou wilt meet me with love and pitty at the laſt. O turn not now thine ears from my requeſts: For if thou receive me not now as thy humble ſupplicant, how ſhall I hope that thou wilt receive me then? And if thou wilt not hear me in the day of grace and viſitation, and in this time when thou mayeſt be found, how can I hope that thou wilt hear me then, when the door is ſhut, and the ſeeking and finding time is paſt?

Why wouldeſt thou come down from Heaven to Earth in the daies of thy voluntary humiliation, but to bring down grace to dwell where God himſelf hath dwelt? If the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> will dwell <hi>in fleſh,</hi> the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit</hi> will not diſdain it, whoſe dwelling is not by ſo cloſe an union, but by ſweet unexpreſſible inoperations: This world hath had the pledge of thy bodily preſence, when thou broughteſt life and immortality to light: O let my dark and fearful ſoul, have the pledge of thy illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, quickening, comforting Spirit, that life and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may be begun within me! Thy word of promiſe is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it ſelf; but knowing our weakneſs, thou wilt give us more: Thy ſeal, thy pledge, thy earneſt, will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirm my faith, as ſettling my doubting <hi>mind</hi>; but it will alſo draw up my love and deſire, as ſuited to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual <hi>appetite</hi>; and will be a true foretaſte of Heaven: How oft have I gazed in the glaſs, and yet overlookt, or not been taken with the beauty of thy face?

If I could love thee more ardently, more abſolutely, more operatively, I ſhould quickly <hi>know</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> thy Love.

            <p>LET the Reader know, that whereas the Bookſeller hath in the Catalogue of my Books, named my [<hi>Holy Common-Wealth, or Political Aphoriſms</hi>] I do hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the ſaid Book, and profeſs my Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that ever I publiſhed it, and that not only for ſome by-paſſages, but in reſpect of the <hi>ſecondary</hi> part of the <hi>very ſcope.</hi> Though the <hi>firſt</hi> part of it, which is the defence of <hi>God, and Reaſon</hi> I recant not.</p>
            <p>But this Revocation I make with theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo's, 1. That I reverſe not <hi>all the Matter</hi> of that Book, nor all; that more than ONE have accuſed; As <hi>e. g.</hi> the Aſſertion <hi>that all humane Powers are Limited by God:</hi> And if I may not be pardoned for not defying DEITY and HUMANITY, I ſhall preferr that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy before their preſent <hi>Faſtus,</hi> and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, who defie them.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:59417:330"/>3. That though I diſlike the Roman Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies writing ſo much of Politicks, and deteſt Miniſters medling in State matters without neceſſity, or a certain call; yet I hold it not ſimply unbeſeeming a Divine, to expound the fifth Commandment, nor to ſhew the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of humane Powers on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; nor to inſtruct Subjects to obey with judgement, and for Conſcience ſake.</p>
