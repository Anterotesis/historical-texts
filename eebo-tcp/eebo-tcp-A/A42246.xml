            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Grounds of Complaint of ſeveral Merchants and other Traders of the City of <hi>London,</hi> who are humble Petitioners to the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> againſt the preſent Managers of the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT has always been the Uſage and Practice of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, to make Publick Sale of all their Goods by Inch of Candle, in the <hi>Eaſt-India Houſe</hi> (purſuant to the Preamble, that every Adventurer Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, before he can be admitted into the Stock.) And to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient notice of the time of their Sale; together with Printed Books, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Accounts of the Quantities and Sorts of every particular Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as they were indifferently diſpoſed into ſeveral Lotts.</p>
            <p>The preſent Managers of the ſaid Company have of late preſumed to alter the aforeſaid Uſages, by introducing other Methods, in diſpoſing of their Goods by Private Contracts amongſt themſelves; Monopolizing thoſe Commodities in beſt Demand at under Rates to their own uſe; and ſeveral Goods which have in ſuch Manner been ingroſt by ſome Members of the Committee, have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards been expoſed by the Candle at the Publick Sale, as ſtill belonging to the Company, where Brokers have been appointed to bid conſiderable Advance on the Prices, at which they were privately bought at, with no other Deſign, than to impoſe on the other real Buyers. Whereby the Petitioners are very much diſappointed in their Affairs, to their great Loſs and Detriment, for that Commiſſions from abroad cannot be effected, nor Occaſions at home ſupplyed.</p>
            <p>Moreover, When Publick Notice has been given by the aforeſaid Printed Books, of an intended Sale, ſpecifying the ſeveral Lots of each Commodity as above; and the Petitioners have accordingly made Proviſion with their Correſpondents abroad, and for their own Occaſions at home; the foreſaid Managers have very indirectly altered their appointed Lots at the time of their Sale, and put up the whole Quantities of ſome Goods to a very great Value in one Lot, to the great Surprize of all the Buyers; deſigning thereby to give opportunity to ſome amongſt themſelves, to ingroſs the ſame, as they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done, to the further prejudice of the Petitioners.</p>
            <p>By all which indirect Proceedings, the Joint-Stock has been prejudiced in the ſpace of about two years to the Value of above One Hundred Thouſand Pounds and the Petitioners put out of their Way of Trade, as they are ready to prove, and humbly ſupplicate this Honourable Houſe, for Redreſs of their Arbitrary Abuſes.</p>
