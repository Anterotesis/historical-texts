            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GReat Courtesies, which are in their value beyond gratifying, grant the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver this Excuse however; that he may expect a Pardon, if his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour be answerable to his real Will and natural Ability.</p>
            <p>I am extreamly Sensible of the many Favours I have had from you, and I am as sensible of the very few ways my ill Stars make me capable of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em this little flourish, Sir, is only to Introduce a common Truth, which your Iudgment can inform your self very well without my telling; which is that a Poet has no better way of paying his Gratitude, than by an offering of the Fruits of his Brain, to the generous Person he is oblig'd to.</p>
            <p>Sir, if I had not known you to be one that has made it some part of your business as well as diversion, to encourage things of this Nature, I should not have troubled you with this, but the Conversation which for some years I have had the honour to enjoy with you, has given me this boldness, asuring my self, that as you have the same good Humour as formerly, so you have a Gusto and Relish to taste with the same Appetite now, as you did at other times, when I have been so Happy to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you with the like sort of Treat.</p>
            <p>Sir the Comedy I now present to you is in the best Iudgment of my most judicious Friends one of the best of mine, and till I see more and better Matter and Humour in a scription of this kind, I shall not be uneasie when I think on the little poor abuses and disturbances of a malecontented Party, that like the Devil have for some late Years ow'd me an ill turn, and I have reason to fear now will never have done pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me.</p>
            <p>The entertainment of Songs and Dances in it, as they gave more diversion than is usually seen in Comedy's, so they were perform'd with general Applause, and I think my Enemies have cause to say with greater than is ordinary; and though this had its Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience by lenghtning the whole Piece a little beyond the common time of Action, which at this time o'th Year I am sensible is a very great Fault, yet the worst of malice has granted me this, that there appeared no defect of Genius, whatever there might of Iudgment.</p>
            <p>The Perusal therefore, Sir, most humbly I commit to yours, and dedicate both my self and it to you, whom I know to be a Man of honour and sence, in which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, I think all others are comprehended, and since I know your temper too well, to inlarge much upon Complement, or trouble you with impertinent Praise, <hi>I will only think of you as all the sensible World does that know ye,</hi> and make an humble Suit to ye to accept this Trifle as a mark of Gratitude from,</p>

                  <p>Thou seem'st my Brother-Collegian indeed by thy Voice and Grimace; but then agen thou may'st be Brother to some Prince by thy Habit. Prithee let me look on thee and wonder!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Quick.</speaker>
                  <p>Do, do, <hi>Ned,</hi> wonder on, whilst I slouch my Hat, and practice the Air of a Country-Booby of Quality to improve thy Admiration.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Cunning.</speaker>
                  <p>Harkee; prithee let me ask thee a civil Question: Hast not made some <hi>Nokes</hi> of Quality here about <hi>Richmond</hi> drunk, and stole his Clothes, hah?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Quick.</speaker>
                  <p>No, ye Rogue; tho' I am your Brother in Wit, I am no kin to ye in Mischief. I love to give occasion for Men's Wonders; and there's a Mystery in this Habit, <hi>Ned,</hi> surpasses all your Cunning to find out. But come, to examine now in my turn: Prithee, what Project hast thou now a-foot here at <hi>Richmond?</hi> For by this comical Disguise, there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than ordinary. What stanch Fool hast thou to Cully out of his Money? Or, what half-Fool out of Meat, Drink, and Lodging, hah?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cunning.</speaker>
                  <p>Why to tell thee the Truth, I am intrigu'd here with a Son of a Whore, who is also the Son of a Knight, and have (thus equipp'd as I am) been with him to Night upon a Frolick.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Quick.</speaker>
                  <p>Intrigu'd was an admirable Word there; for thy Bubbles are all us'd like common Whores; when thou hast had thy Pleasure of 'em, they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45500:6"/>
are left to their Fortune. Well, and this Compound makes up one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Fool; hah?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cunning.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea, verily; Fools, half Fools, and such like, are <hi>Cunnington</hi>'s Real Estate; and sometimes I've the luck to have a Wit to provide my Personal. I am a true <hi>Terrae Filius,</hi> and flourish by the Abuse of Mankind, wanting seldom or never Matter to work upon: But if some malignant Planet should reign, whenever you hear that I am out of Fool, you may reasonably conclude too that I am out at Elbows.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Quick.</speaker>
                  <p>A little Hardship is a good Whetstone to make Wit sharp; and we poor Fellows, <hi>Ned,</hi> that live by 'em, like Black birds, thrive best in hard Weather: For not being born to Estates for our selves, Fortune has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd 'em to others with weaker Brains for us to manage. Now I improve my Talent by Love, Compliance, Insinuation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I love every body, and every body loves me: I oblige all People; I mimick this or that Sot in Company, to humour perhaps one that's a worse himself. I flatter and sing to the Women, to get their Tongues on my side too: And now and then when I am desir'd by some rich Booby that's worth the managing, I can turn my Face into a Changling Grimace, and act like <hi>Solon</hi> in the Play; when, as I hope to be sav'd, I'm all the while bant'ring him, and thinking him the more comical <hi>Solon</hi> of the two, as a Man may say.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cunning.</speaker>
                  <p>Why this is an artful Method, I confess; but, for my part, if I should practice it, I should starve: For to tell thee the truth, I love no body; nay, what's worse, can hardly counterfeit common Courtesie to the World. The reason is, I hate all People that I think happier than my self: If that Man has a fine Coach, I wish his Horses may founder; if this has a pretty Wife, I wish him a plaguy fit of the Stone, and my self a bed with her: If a third has a rich Cargo in a Ship, or a fourth a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate House, I wish one may be sunk to the bottom, and t'other burnt to the ground.</p>

                  <p>Well, <hi>Ned,</hi> I see thou art now about some new Project, and 'twould do thee an injury to keep thee longer from thy Vocation, therefore I'll leave thee.</p>

                  <p>Ay, but this is a secret only proper for my Sphere of Activity; besides, I have had this Advice formerly, Keep <hi>Cunnington</hi> from thy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and thy Mistress, or he'll certainly endeavour to betray the one, and debauch the other; and so no more wheedling, good Brother.

a Man that's richer than I am, but that's wittier too; and would by my Good-will engross all the Money in the World, and all the Sense too. New is my Head as full of mischievous Contrivance, as a young Thief that is just going to do his Probation Exploit; and from my Brain I have present information, That the Old Woman that was here just now, is wove in <hi>Quickwit</hi>'s Design: I'll after, and dog her; these old Runts are as leaky as Sieves: And if I can, by speaking <hi>French</hi> giberish pretending to be a <hi>German</hi> Astrologer, get to tell her her Fortune, all the rest of her Secrets shall quickly be laid open. Humph, this may turn to good advantage of my side too, and be more valu'd, as flowing from the Fountain of my own Wit: I hate the poor Satisfaction of being oblig'd to Fortune for a Benefit.</p>

He was first Apothecary of a Physick-Garden; but hapning to cure the Son of a great Statesman that had crack'd his Brains with studying to out-do his Father, in out-witting the <hi>French</hi> Councils, got himself into Money and Reputation, and is now, forsooth, President of the Insanery.</p>

                  <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                  <p>Most certainly. I have told thee nothing but Truth, upon my Honour. Oh, she's the Soul, the Miracle of her Sex:</p>
                  <lg>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Besides, I have often, as a Lesson, told thee, That Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> her Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law and Guardian, being always an inveterate Enemy to our Family; and designing her for his own Son, has forc'd me to this Artifice of thy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and that sweet Angel to frustrate all other Pretensions, to act a witty Scene of Lunacy.</p>

                  <p>Your Brother Sir <hi>Quibble Quere,</hi> you tell me, is to be bubbled too; so that I find I'm to divide my Brains into three several Projects: First, to disappoint the Guardian: Secondly, to banter the Doctor: And, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to make a meer Ass of your Brother, to pay a friendly Tribute to your Wit.

thou know'st, and can claim but little Obligation upon the score of Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Besides, he's a Block-head, and I have only hedg'd him into this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to stand buff with his Purse upon occasion, and pay the Expence of it. My Mother did me manifest wrong by crossing the strain. Her last Husband, old Sir <hi>Quibble Quere,</hi> was, for above thirty Years together, an old Court-Follower; but of so harmless a Character, that tho' he never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd himself, he hindred no one else, being always like a Turn stile, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in every body's way, and hindering no body. He was also called here, <hi>The Teizer of</hi> Richmond, and would ask you more foolish Questions in a quarter of an Hour, than a hundred wise Men could answer in a Year: And this Brother of mine is his own, by this Light. See, yonder he comes.

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Madness, Doctor, is but a more extravagant sort of Wit, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the excessive Heat in the Brain: I studied the very Point many Years ago, in the Colledge at <hi>Barcelona;</hi> 'tis but the Skill of cooling the Part, and the Patient presently recovers.</p>

                  <speaker>Guiac.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, but, Sir, this is a new Case, and I must do it specifically; for she is very obstinate, and will take no Medicines; nor do I resolve to make her Blood ferment, by putting her into a Rage about it, she has Fire enough already; for about the Age of Eighteen the Heat predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates extreamly in her Sex; and then, if ever they are infected, they become strongly delirious.</p>

                  <speaker>Guiac.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, at that Age the warm Quality of their Blood, fermented by the force and vigour of the Animal Spirits, naturally make 'em half mad: To remedy which there are but Two ways, which are either to get them Husbands just in the Nick, or for want of such Provision to send 'em to me.</p>

                  <p>Why, God-a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mercy Doctor, this old Fellow is too Lepid to be a Whoremaster sure: If this hoary Elder should be a Rogue now, and make use of a natural Recipe to cure my Daughters Madness, my Son and I were finely serv'd.</p>

Well, I must go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and humour him, least when he has cur'd my Daughter, he should, in revenge, Introduce new Suitors to her, and so baffle my Son's Designs; who, I think, I see coming down the Hill yonder,—Ay, 'tis he, and two more with him; they seem in hot Dispute; I'll stay a little while longer to observe.</p>

                  <p>Come, Sir, for once I'll be a little satyrical, and venture to describe the course of life of all you Men of the Town: In the Morning the first thing you do is, to reflect on the debauch of the Day before; and instead of saying your Prayers as you ought, relate the lewd Folly to some other young rakehelly Fellow, that happens to come to your Leve: The next thing is to dine, where instead of using some witty or moral Discourse that should tend to improvement, you finish your Desert with a Jargon of senceless Oaths, a relish of ridiculous Bawdy, and strive to get drunk before ye come to the Play.</p>

You nuzzle your Noses into their Hoods and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modes, just for all the world like the Picture of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Pigeon, when he gave the false Prophet his ghostly Instructions. Fogh how many fine things are said there, perfum'd with the Air of sour Claret! which the well-bred Nymph as odoriferously returns in the scent of <hi>Lambeth-Ale</hi> and <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae</hi>

Then supper coming in, the Glasses go about briskly. The Fools think the Wenches heavenly Company, and they tell them they are extream fine Gentlemen; 'till at last few Words are best; the Bargain's made, the Pox is cheaply purchas'd at the price of a Guinea, and no repentance on neither side.
