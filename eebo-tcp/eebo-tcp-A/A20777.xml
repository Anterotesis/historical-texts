         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

if you conſider the matter, I aſſure you it is most

gaue vnto the Church, this is to be conſidered; <hi>Let al

purpoſe in collecting &amp; framing this worke, was to
edifie, comfort and ſtirre vp the godlie mindes vnto
care, watchfulneſſe, Zeale, &amp; feruentneſſe in the cauſe of Gods truth; you
ſhall eaſilie perceiue by the chuſing and ordering of theſe ſingular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which hereafter inſue. In which theſe ſpeciall circumſtances are to be
conſidered. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The great furie and rage of Sathan likelie to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
from his Kingdome of error and blindnes; the franticke madnes of
the ignorant poſſeſſed people, delighting in darkeneſſe, and ſtriuing to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
the Kingdome of their Maſter; and the prompt facilitie and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Sathans miniſters to put in execution anie kinde of wickedneſſe: al
which is to be ſeene both in the firſt example of <hi>The winning of Saint
Iames his Streete,</hi> &amp; in all the reſt of the booke. <hi>Secondlie,</hi> The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
maieſtie, &amp; dignitie of the Diuell, poſſeſſing the chiefeſt States of the
earth, &amp; ſeeming to the outward appearance to weild the Truth vnto his
obedience, in ſuppreſſing the ſtrongeſt that dared openly to withſtand him:
in the Storie of <hi>Annas Burgaeus. Thirdlie,</hi> The policie and crafte of
Sathan and his members in deuiſing by ſubtiltie to circumuent the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie;
vnder the ſhadow of trust, to exerciſe tyrannie; vnder the colour of
courteſie to practiſe crueltie; and vnder the vaile of a ſacred oath, to couer
moſt ſhamefull villanie. This is to be ſeene in the third example, of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Maſſacre at the bloodie marriage. We had need therefore to be
watchfull, ſtrong, and wiſe: watchful in praier, that we be not taken ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
ſtrong in faith, that we be not ouerthrowen by Sathans might; wiſe
as ſerpents, that we be not deceaued by the diuels allurements. We are to
learn alſo, what trust we ought to repoſe in the promiſes and oaths of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Papiſts, what ſhewe ſo euer they make of loue and frendſhip. Here
as in a glaſſe, you ſhall plainlie ſee the picture of all the morall vertues moſt
liuelie deſcribed, in the ſtrange patience, the godlie perſeuerance, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb facs="tcp:25358:4"/>
orations, ſweete ſpeeches, and the constant and famous endings of
theſe ſacred Martires. Whereſoeuer thou ſhalt finde the Diuel brought
in Poëticallie to make any oration to the King and States of <hi>France,</hi> as in
manie places he is: then vnderſtand, that vnder thoſe ſpeeches are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all the ſubtilties, villanies, cruelties and policies that were deuiſed, and
by diueliſh meanes put in practiſe againſt the godly, more liuely to ſet them
down in their colors, as if it came from the diuels owne mouth, as no doubt
it came from his ſpirite. Againe, in all the orations of the Martirs, &amp;
of the King, the Queene, the Guiſe, and all other that haue ſpeaches in
this booke, marke that of purpoſe the nature both of the perſon that ſpeaks
and alſo of the matter that is ſpoken, are liuely ſet downe: ſo that here are
not bare examples of vertue and vice, but alſo the nature and qualities of
thoſe vertues or villanies are manifeſtly depainted to them that will ſeeke
for it. The noble Martirs of <hi>England</hi> are knowen ſufficientlie almoſt to
all; theſe excellent French Histories were ſeene but of few, being in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
nothing inferior vnto the other.</p>
            <p>The cauſes why I haue deſcribed it in verſe are 3. Firſt for mine owne
exerciſe, being a learner in that facultie; Secondlie, to reſtore againe ſome
credit if I can vnto Poëtrie, hauing been defaced of late ſo many waies by
wanton vanities. Thirdlie, for the more noueltie of the thing, and apt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie
in diſpoſing the matter framed to the better liking of ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies,
becauſe the ſame Storie in effect is alreadie tranſlated into Engliſh
proſe. Many of theſe orations that are here fully &amp; amplie expreſſed, were
in the French Commentaries but onely in ſubſtance lightly touched, and
the ſumme ſet downe without amplifying the circumſtance, and yet heere
is no more ſet downe, than there is ſignified. I haue alſo, for the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

of God ſhewed againſt the perſecutors in euery ſeuerall History, &amp;
