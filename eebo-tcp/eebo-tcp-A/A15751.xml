         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

limbe conteyneth the names and diuisions of the
12. Windes as they were wont to bee deuided in old

dayes of the new Kalender, first established by Pope
GREGORIE the XIII. and now vsed in many places
beyond the Seas. In the fourth limbe are set downe
the moneths and dayes of the ordinarie Kalender

12. Signes and degrees of the Zodiacke, that so the
place of the Sunne might bee presently knowne for

Heauens from the nether halfe that is hidden
out of our sight.</p>
               <p>2. It sheweth partly the difference of a right and
oblique Sphaere, for when this circle and the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall,
crosse each other at the right Angles, it is

               <p>3. In an oblique Sphaere this circle seuereth those
Starres which neuer rise nor set, but are alwayes ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aboue or beneath the Horizon, from such Starres
as rise and set in euery 24. houres. For all the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly

               <p>4. In respect of this circle, the Sunne, Moone and
Starres, or any other part or point of the Heauens,
are sayd to rise or set: For when they come vp from

the Ecliptick that is at the East part of the Horizon
arising, is the Ascendent; and the point opposite to
this at the West part of the Horizon, may be called
the Descendent.</p>

And the time that he continueth vnder the Horizon,

               <p>9. This Circle sheweth the reason of the equality
of artificiall dayes and nights, in a right Sphaere: and
of the inequality of them in an oblique Sphaere. For
in a right Sphaere, the Horizon deuideth all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralels

               <p>11. From the Horizon is measured the twilight:
For in the morning the Sunne being vnder the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon

the quantitie of the artificiall and naturall dayes, of
which Moneths and Yeares are made: It measureth
also the quantitie of Houres and of other times which
the Sunne maketh going vnder the Zodiacke. And
therefore the degrees of the Equinoctiall are called

               <p>3. It sheweth the two Equinoctiall points in the

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21028:9"/>
the Signes and degrees thereof, is measured by this
Circle. For seeing the most part of the apparences of
the first motion are referred to the Zodiacke, which
is not turned about his owne Poles, but about the
Poles of the Sphaere, and therefore must needs bee
vnequally turned about; it was needfull that this ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie

of the same Degrees and Starres, &amp;c. For the
right ascention of any starre or point of the Heauens,
is nothing else but the Arch of the Equinoctiall circle
contained betweene the beginning of <hi>Aries</hi> and the
Meridian, the same Starre or point being first brought
vnder the Meridian.</p>
               <p>9. In the Equinoctiall is counted the ascentionall
difference and the oblique Ascention and Descention
of any point of Heauen. And from the same Circle is
reckoned the distance of the Sunne rising from the
true East point. For the oblique ascention or descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is nothing else but the arch of the Equinoctiall,
contained betweene the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> and that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21028:9"/>
point of the Equinoctiall Eastwards, which ariseth or
setteth together with the Starre or point that is giuen,
in an oblique Sphaere. And the difference ascentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
or descentionall is nought else but the arch of the
Equator, whereby the right and oblique ascention or
descention of a Starre, or any other point in Heauen
doe differ each from other. The distance of the sunnes
rising from the true East point (which in Latine is
called <hi>Amplitudo ortiua,)</hi> is the arch of the Horizon
contayned betweene the Equinoctiall and the paralell
of the Sunne, or his Center when he riseth.</p>
               <p>10. In Geographie wee count the Longitudes of
places in this Circle; and from it we reckon the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
in the Globe of the earth, and in Maps, and sea
Charts. For the longitude of a place is nothing else
but the arch of the Equinoctiall circle contayned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two Meridians, whereof one goeth by the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
Ilands, and the other by the place that is giuen,
And the latitude of a place is the arch of a Meridian
contayned betweene the Equinoctiall, and the Zenith
of the place that was giuen.</p>

because it maketh not alwayes the same angles of
intersection with the Equator, but sometimes grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
sometimes lesse. For the greatest obliquitie of
the Zodiacke, which not long before <hi>Ptolomees</hi> time

               <p>The manner of the variation of this obliquitie may

               <p>The one aboue the Equinoctiall is called the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
semicircle: the other halfe beneath the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall,
is the Southerne semicircle of the Zodiacke.</p>
               <p>So long as the Sunne moueth vnder the first of
these semicircles, the dayes are longer then the nights,
otherwise they are shorter.</p>
               <p>Each of these semicircles is againe deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two parts, and so the whole Zodiack into foure
quarters: the first from <hi>Aries</hi> to <hi>Cancer,</hi> may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the vernall or Spring-quarter, which in this
Sphaere is also shewed by the word <hi>Ver</hi> (signifying
the Spring:) The next from <hi>Cancer</hi> to <hi>Libra,</hi> the
Summer quarter, wherein is written the word <hi>Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tas</hi>
signifying the Summer. The 3. from <hi>Libra</hi> to <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne,</hi>
is the Haruest quarter, wherein you shall finde
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21028:11"/>
in this Sphaere the word <hi>Autumnus</hi> which signifieth
Autumne or Haruest. The fourth and the last, from
the beginning of <hi>Capricorne</hi> to <hi>Aries,</hi> is called the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Quarter, which in this Sphaere is shewed by this
word <hi>Hiems,</hi> which signifieth the Winter. And these
foure quarters of the Zodiacke are thus called by the
names of the Quarters of the yeare, because the Sunne
mouing vnder those quarters of the Zodiacke, maketh
those foure Quarters of the yeare. Euery one of these
quarters of the Zodiacke is againe deuided into three
parts, and so the whole compasse of the Zodiacke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
12. which are called the 12. Signes, whereof euery
one contayneth 30. Degrees in length from West to
East, and is in bredth equall to the bredth of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacke.
These Signes, and the Zodiacke it selfe haue
their beginning from that common meeting, or cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Eclipticke, and the Equinoctiall, where
the Eclipticke beginneth to arise aboue the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall
towards the North pole: and they are called by
these names; <hi>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarie, Capricorne, Aquarie, Pisces.</hi>
That is to say, The Ramme, the Bull, the Twinnes,
the Crab, the Lyon, the Virgin, the Ballance, the
Scorpion, the Shooter, the Goat, the Water-pourer,
the Fishes. And they are signified by these Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
♈ ♉, ♊, ♋, ♌, ♍, ♎, ♏, ♐, ♑, ♒, ♓.
This deuision of the Zodiacke into 12. Signes and of
euery signe into 30. Degrees, nature it selfe seemeth to
haue shewed by the motions of the Sun and Moone.
For in what time the Sunne moueth once about the
whole compasse of the Zodiacke, the Moone maketh
twelue reuolutions through the same. Therefore as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21028:11"/>
the time of a yeare is deuided into 12. Moones, so the
Zodiacke is deuided into 12. Signes: And as euery
Moneth contayneth 30. dayes, so euery signe is deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into 30. parts, which they call Degrees, which
signifieth as much as steps, because the Sunne step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,
or goeth forwards almost so much as a degree
in euery day, from the West Eastwards vnder the
Zodiacke.</p>
               <p>The Zodiacke is otherwise also deuided into two
semicircles, the one (from <hi>Capricorne</hi> to <hi>Cancer)</hi> ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
because that so long as the Sunne or any of the
Planets are in that semicircle, they still ascend and rise
higher and higher aboue the Horizon. The other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle
of the Zodiacke, from <hi>Cancer</hi> to <hi>Capricorne,</hi>
is called descending, because the Sunne or Planets
being in that semicircle, come downe euery day low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then other.</p>
               <p>The 12. Signes are by the Astrologians diuersly
deuided, first into chiefe, meane, and common signes.
The chiefe signes (which are also called Cardinall,
that is the principall signes) are <hi>Aries, Cancer, Libra,</hi>
and <hi>Capricorne,</hi> because they come next after the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
points of the Zodiacke, that is, the two Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall
points at the beginnings of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Libra;</hi>
and the two solstitiall points of <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Capricorne.</hi>
The meane signes (which are also called fixed) are
<hi>Taurus, Leo, Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Aquarius.</hi> They are called
meane, because they are placed betweene the chiefe
or principall, and the common signes. They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
fixed signes, because that when the Sunne is in
those signes, wee finde a more perfect temperature of
the Ayre, then when he is in the other signes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:21028:12"/>
The common signes (which are also called double
bodyed) are <hi>Gemini, Virgo, Sagitarie,</hi> and <hi>Pisces.</hi> They
are called common, because they take part of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the fixed signes going before them, and of the
Cardinall signes following after them. They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
double bodied, by reason of their Images, as they
are imagined in the eight Sphaere, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of two bodies: For there be two Twinnes;
and the Virgin holdeth an eare of corne in her hand;
<hi>Sagitarie</hi> is made of a Man and an Horse; and there
are two Fishes. The placing, and nature of these signes
brought in this diuision.</p>
               <p>The Astrologians also deuide the 12. Signes into
foure trigons of triplicities, so called because they are
distant the third part of a Circle, one from another.
The first triplicitie contayneth <hi>Aries, Leo,</hi> and <hi>Sagita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi>
and is called the fiery trigon, or triplicitie: The
second triplicitie contayneth <hi>Taurus, Virgo,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorne;</hi>
and is called the earthly trigon. The third
triplicitie contayneth <hi>Gemini, Libra,</hi> and <hi>Aquarius;</hi>
and is called the ayrie trigon. The fourth triplicitie
contayning <hi>Cancer, Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Pisces;</hi> is called the
watrie trigon. Nature it selfe is the cause of this diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Signes also. For into these Trigons of the
signes, shee hath distributed the Coniunctions of the
three superiour Planets: especially the coniunctions
of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which the Astrologians call
great coniunctions. For examples sake, if there bee a
great coniunction in <hi>Aries,</hi> the same shall be twenty
yeares after in <hi>Sagitarie,</hi> and other twenty yeares after
in <hi>Leo;</hi> and after as many more yeares, it returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into <hi>Aries.</hi> The reuolution of one Trigon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21028:12"/>
almost 200. yeares, after which time the same
great conjunctions remoue into the next trigon.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. The vse of the Zodiack.</head>
               <p>1. THe Zodiack is the measure of the second
motions, as the Equinoctiall is the measure
of the first motion.</p>
               <p>2. For in this Circle wee reckon the longitudes,
and from it we count the latitudes of all the Starres.
For the longitude of a Starre is nothing else but the
arch of the Ecliptck conteyned betweene the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Aries, and the circle of the Starres latitude.
And the latitude is the Arch of a great circle, drawne
by the poles of the Ecliptick, conteyned betweene
the Starre and the Ecliptick.</p>
               <p>3. According to this circle, the whole Heauen,
yea, the whole world is deuided into twelue Signes.
Whereof it commeth that because of this Circle, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
the fixed, as the wandring Starres which we call
Planets, yea, and those Starres also that appeare of a
sudden, as blazing Starres or Comets, and other
Meteors, are said to be in this or that signe; and that
three manner of wayes.</p>
               <p>First, to be in a signe, is to be vnder some one of the
12. parts of the Ecliptick. Thus the Starres which are
vnder the Ecliptick, but especially the Sunne which
runneth alwayes vnder it, are said to be in the Signes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because the Zodiack hath latitude, those
Starres are said to be in a signe, which although they
be beside the Ecliptick, yet are vnder the Zodiack,
and so any of the other Planets, which for the most
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21028:13"/>
part wander beside the Ecliptick, may be said to bee
in some signe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we vnderstand six great Circles to bee
drawne by the beginnings of the twelue signes, and
by the poles of the Eclipticke; by these circles the
whole heauen (or rather the whole world) is deuided
into twelue parts, which with a generall name are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
signes: Thus all the Starres aswell fixed as Planets
and Comets, which are without the Zodiacke in any
of these parts, may be said to be in some signe.</p>
               <p>4. In this circle are noted the degrees of the signes,
with which the Starres doe rise and set, as well in a
right as in an oblique Sphaere. For because this circle
is the chiefest, all Caelestiall apparances (or at least
the most part of them) are referred vnto it, and not
vnto the Equinoctiall. But the Equinoctiall measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the times of their risings and settings.</p>
               <p>5. The obliquitie of the Ecliptick is the cause of
the inequalitie, aswell of naturall dayes in both
Sphaeres, as of artificiall dayes in an oblique Sphaere.
For seeing it is moued vnequally, because it is moued
vpon other Poles then his owne, the Sunne which is
the author, and maker of times mouing vnder it, must
needs make vnequall dayes.</p>
               <p>6. The chiefe times are defined by this circle, as the
time of a yeare, by the motion of the Sunne; the time
of a moneth by the motion of the Moone, through
the whole compasse of this circle. Also the foure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the yeare, Spring, Summer, Autumne, and
Winter, whereto may be added <hi>Plato</hi> his great yeare,
which is the time wherein the fixed Starres make one
reuolution about the axtree and poles of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21028:13"/>
if God would haue the world to last so long.</p>
               <p>7. The Eclipticke line sheweth the places, and
times of the Eclipses: For the Sunne and Moone, are
Eclipsed onely vnder it, or neere vnto it.</p>
               <p>8. As the description of the Tropicks dependeth
on the obliquitie of the Eclipticke, so the polar Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
are described by the Poles thereof.</p>
               <p>9. Hereof it commeth, that by reason of the same
obliquitie, the Zones and Climats are set forth and

               <p>10. This Circle is of especiall vse in Astrologie,
for it distinguisheth the points of the 12. Houses,

               <p>1. THe common meetings of this circle with
the Ecliptick, shew the Solstitiall or Tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
points; in which points the Sunne seemeth to
stand, and then returneth backe againe: for which
cause this circle is called the Colure of the Sun-stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
These points are called tropicall (which is as
much to say as turne-points, or points of returne) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that when the Sunne going alwayes vnder the
Eclipticke commeth to these points, which are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
distant from the Equinoctiall circle, it returneth
againe towards the same circle. But they were called
Solstitiall or Sun-ding points, because that whilest
the Sunne is about those points, the difference of the
Sunnes returning is (for certaine dayes) insensible.
Hereof the Sunne is said to make his station, or to
stand, when he commeth to either of those points.
They that dwell without the Tropickes, haue two
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21028:15"/>
sunne-standings, that is the Summer sun-standing, or
high sun-standing (when the Sunne in Summer time
is at the highest, and next vnto our Zenith being in
the beginning of <hi>Cancer)</hi> and the winterly, or low
sun-standing, when the Sunne in Winter time is low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in the Meridian, and furthest from our Zenith. But
they that dwell within the Tropicks (by a certaine si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
taken from our sun-standings, wherein the
Sunne is either highest or lowest) are said to haue
foure sun-standings; that is two high sun-standings,
when the Sunne passeth by their Zenith (the highest
point in the Heauens) which hapneth twice euery
yeare in two places, equally distant from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Capricorne:</hi> and two low sun-stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,

               </p>
               <p>2. In this Circle by the arch conteyned betweene
the Equator and Eclipticke, we measure the greatest
declination of the Sunne, or obliquity of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
which in <hi>Ptolomees</hi> time was 23. degrees 51. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
and one third part of a minute. But euer since
that time it hath beene found by obseruation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
so as in this our age, it is no more then 23. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and one halfe, or little more: Notwithstanding
<hi>Copernicus</hi> thought that the greatest obliquity was
23. degrees 28. minutes.</p>
               <p>3. It sheweth the places of the Eclipticke, in
which the Sunne (comming neerest to our Zenith)
maketh the artificiall day longest; or going furthest
from the same point, maketh the same shortest.</p>
               <p>4. It deuideth the Zodiacke into two halfes, the
one ascending, and the other descending.</p>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:21028:15"/>
5. Hereby also the signes are distinguished, which
doe rise rightly, and which rise obliquely in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Sphaere. For the descending halfe riseth right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the ascending halfe riseth obliquely.</p>
               <p>6. So the points of the Eclipticke are shewed by
this Circle, wherein the greatest difference of right
and oblique ascensions happeneth. It distinguisheth
those signes in which when the Sunne moueth, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
dayes are increased, and the nights decrease;
from those signes wherein the dayes are diminished,
and the nights increase.</p>
               <p>7. In this circle are the bredths of the Zones boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;

               <p>THe two smallest circles that are next about the
poles of the Sphaere, are called the polar circles.
They are drawne by the poles of the Eclipticke,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21028:17"/>
and are euery where Equidistant from the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and from the poles of the Sphaere.</p>
               <p>They are called polar Circles, either because they
are neere the poles of the Sphaere, or else because they
are described by the motion of the poles of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipticke.</p>
               <p>And therefore there be two polar Circles, that is,
so many as there are poles of the Ecliptick: the Polar
circle Artick, and the Polar Antartick.</p>
               <p>The Articke polar circle, is that which passeth by
the North pole of the Ecliptick, or which is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by the North pole of the Ecliptick being carried
about with the motion of the first moueable Sphaere.</p>
               <p>The Antartick polar circle, is that which goeth
by the South pole of the Eclipticke, being described
with the first motion by the Antartick pole of the
Ecliptick.</p>
               <p>The distance of these polar Circles from the poles
of the Sphaere, is equall to the distance of the tropicks
from the Equinoctiall, which in our time is about
23. degr. and an halfe: for so much as is the obliquity
of the Zodiack (whereto the distance of the Tropicks
from the Equinoctiall is alwayes equall) so much are
the poles of the Ecliptick distant from the Poles of
the world.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Of the Zones.</head>
               <p>A Zone is a space of Heauen, or Earth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
betweene two of the smaller Circles;
or inclosed within the compasse of either Polar
circle.</p>
               <p>They are called Zones (that is as much to say as
girdles) because they compasse about Heauen or
Earth like a girdle.</p>
               <p>The Zones are deuided by auncient Writers into
two kindes; that is into temperate, and vntemperate
Zones.</p>
               <p>A temperate Zone is the space of Heauen or earth,
conteyned betweene either of the Tropicks, and the
next Polar circle.</p>
               <p>There be two temperate Zones; the one North,
the other South.</p>
               <p>The North temperate Zone is conteyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

               <p>The South temperate Zone is that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned

betweene the Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and the

               <p>They are called temperate Zones, because they
haue a better temperature of the ayre for the most
part, and more meer for habitation, then the vntem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Zones. The bredth of eyther temperate Zone
is alwayes equall to the complement of the distance

degrees, that is 2580. English miles.</p>
               <p>There be two kinde of vntemperate Zones, the
one exceeding in heat, the other in cold, for the
most part.</p>
               <p>The hot vntemperate Zone, (called also the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid;
that is, the burnt or broyled zone) is that space
of Heauen or Earth, which is conteyned betweene
the tropicks.</p>
               <p>It is called the burnt Zone, because that by reason
of the Sunnes continuall going ouer that zone; and
casting his beames directly downe thereupon, it is
scorched with ouer-much heat, and is not so meet to
be inhabited as the temperate zones.</p>
               <p>The bredth of this Zone is alwayes equall to the
obliquitie of the Zodiack, or greatest declination of
the Sunne, doubled; which in our time is about 47.
degrees, that is 2820. English miles.</p>
               <p>The cold or frozen zones, are the spaces of Heauen
or earth, conteyned within the Polar circles.</p>
               <p>There be two cold zones, the one North, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
within the compasse of the Articke circle: the
other South, conteyned within the compasse of the
Antartick Polar circle.</p>
               <p>These zones exceed in cold, because they want
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21028:18"/>
the sight of the sunne for a great part of the yeare,
and when the Sunne appeareth vnto them, his beames
fall so obliquely vpon them, that they can (in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood)
receiue but small heat thereby for the most
part.</p>
               <p>The bredth of these Zones is measured from the
Poles of the world to the Polar circles, and therefore

gather, that the difference of ascention answerable to
one degree, which about the beginning of <hi>Capricorne</hi>

of <hi>Aries,</hi> or <hi>Libra,</hi> is onely 55 minutes. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the apparent motion of the Sun is much swifter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his <hi>Parig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

his Apogaeum in <hi>Cancer,</hi> or in other parts of the

moueth 61. minutes and something more in a
day: in <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Libra</hi> he moueth but 59. min. or very
little more in the same time. Therefore seeing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
day is nothing else, but the time wherein the
Sunne moueth from the Meridian about, till it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
again to the same part of the Meridian; it must

made one whole reuolution of the Equinoctiall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and so much more as is the difference of right as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention
answerable to the apparent motion of the
Sun in the meane time: which differences of ascenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
because they be vnequall, for the two causes before
alledged; the naturall dayes must needs also bee vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
the motion of the Equinoctiall circle about his
owne center being (as it hath beene alwayes supposed
to be) equall, that is mouing alwayes an equall space
in equall time.</p>
               <p>Which by this example may most plainly appeare:
The Sunne being in <hi>Capricorne</hi> moueth 61. minutes
in a naturall day: difference of ascention agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereto is 67. minutes, or something more. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at that time, in the space of one naturall day, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21028:33"/>
Equinoctial circle must make one full reuolution, and
67. minutes more. But when the Sun is in <hi>Aries,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
onely 59. minutes in a day, and the difference of
right ascention answerable thereto, scarce 54. minutes
more then one reuolution of the Equinoctiall circle;
there shall passe onely 54. minutes more in a naturall
day; so as here the Equinoctiall circle moueth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
so much in one day as before by 13. minutes.
Seeing then that 15. degr. or little more of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall

and consequently one degree of the Equinoctiall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

13. minutes of the Equinoctiall shall passe the

for these Orbes be framed together, that the
narrowest part of the one, answereth alwayes to the

of the Sphaere of the sunne, haue alwayes the same
center, that the world it selfe hath.</p>

and carying about the body of the Sunne it selfe,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21028:37"/>
is called the eccentricke of the Sunne; because it hath
another center, then the center of the world. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall
reason, that moued the skilfull in this coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
science, to make this Orbe (wherein the body of
the sunne is carryed) eccentricall, was because they
found the apparent motion of the sunne vnder the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick
line to be vnequall, that is, swifter in the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Signes: and slower in the Northerly.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Hipparehus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolemee</hi> found in their times,
that the sunne continued in the Northerne semicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the ecliptick, from <hi>Aries</hi> to <hi>Libra,</hi> 187. dayes:
and in the other halfe of the Zodiack, that is South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from <hi>Libra</hi> to <hi>Aries,</hi> 178. dayes and a quarter
onely. But in our time by diligent obseruation it is
sound, that the time of the sunnes continuance in the
first of those semicircles from <hi>Aries</hi> to <hi>Libra,</hi> is 186.
dayes 14. houres and an halfe: and consequently in
the other semicircle, from <hi>Libra</hi> to <hi>Aries,</hi> 178. dayes
15. houres and an halfe. Taking it therefore for a
ground, according to the doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that
the motion of the coelestiall bodies is circular and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;
it must needs follow, that a greater part of the
circle described by the proper motion of the sunne
must be conteined vnder the Northerly semicircle of
the ecliptick, then vnder the Southerly: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that the circle or Orbe that caryeth about
the body of the Sunne vnder the ecliptick, hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
center then the center of the Ecliptick.</p>
               <p>2. Another reason to proue, that the Sunne is
caryed in an eccentricall Circle, is the vnequall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
bignes of the Sunnes diameter, the Sunne
being of the same height aboue the Horizon and the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21028:38"/>
ayre alike affected, and alike cleare; so as if there were
any refraction by reason of the thicknes of the ayre,
it must needs be the same in both places. For in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
when the Sun is at, or neare his <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> his
apparent diameter hath beene found by exquisit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
to be 13. minutes 48 seconds. But in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being about his <hi>Perigaeum</hi> 33. min. 54. seconds, as
it may appeare in <hi>Copernicus</hi> his reuolutions 4. booke
21. Chapter.</p>
               <p>Therefore seeing euery visible obiect appeareth
greater when it is neare, and lesse when it is further
remoued from vs, it is manifest that the Sun appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
greater in winter, then in sommer, must needes
be nearer to the earth in winter, then in sommer.</p>
               <p>The reason of which apparance is most easely shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by supposing the Sunne to be moued, in an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricall
Orbe.</p>
               <p>3. A third reason may bee the vnequall great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and continuance of the eclipses of the Moone,
euen at those times when she hath had the same lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
or distance from the Ecliptick, and the same
distance from the Center of the earth: which argueth
that the conicall sharp pointed shadow of the earth,
in the place where the Moone in time of the Eclipse
passeth through that shadow, at the same distance
from the earth, is sometimes greater, and sometimes
lesser: wherof there can no cause be shewed more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
then this, that the Sun is sometimes further
distant from the earth, and the maketh the shadow
greater and sometimes nearer, and so maketh it lesser.
Whereby it is also manifestly proued, that the Sun
is moued about another center then the center of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21028:38"/>
earth, and therefore that the circle or Orbe, wherein
the Sunne is moued, is an Eccentricke.</p>

that are at the center of the world, or vpon the earth,
he shall seeme to moue vnequally; that is, swiftly
when he is in that part of his eccentricke which is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
vnto the earth; and slowly when he is farthest from
the earth. And therefore in sommer, when the Sunne
is about his <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> and in his greatest distance from
the earth, he seemeth to moue little aboue 57. min.
in one day. But in winter, being about his <hi>Perigaeum</hi>
and nearest vnto the earth, he seemeth to moue more
then 16. minutes: whereas notwithstanding he mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
equally in his Eccentricke, euery day about nine
and fifty minutes and 8. seconds; and so finisheth his
reuolution in 365. dayes, and six houres almost.</p>
               <p>2. The second vse of the Sunnes Eccentricke,
may be to shew the reason why the Sun appeareth
greater at one time then at another; for the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in those parts of the eccentrick that are nearest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to be least.</p>
               <p>3. And lastly the inequality of the Sunnes distance

from the earth, caused by his eccentrick, is one espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

               <p>THe little Orbe placed in the Eccentrick, is called
the Epicycle of the Moone; in the circumference
whereof is also placed the body of the Moone, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

in this Sphaere.</p>
               <p>The plaine superficies of this epicycle agreeth euen
with the plaine of the eccentrick: and the axtree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which it is moued, is perpendicular to the plaine
of the eccentrick. This Epicycle is moued equally
from his middle <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> about his owne center and
axtree from the East Westwards, contrary to the
motion of the eccentrick, carying forwards the body
of the Moone with this motion 13. degrees and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

in 27. dayes 13. houres and 19. minutes almost.</p>
               <p>The middle <hi>Apogaeum</hi> of the Epicycle is shewed by
a right line, imagined to be drawne, from that point
of the little circle (described by the motion of the
center of the Moones eccentrick) which is opposite

               <p>But the true <hi>Apogaeum</hi> of the Epicycle, is shewed
by a right line, vnderstood to be drawne from the
Center of the earth by the center of the Epicycle,
vnto the vpper part of the circumference thereof.</p>
               <p>By the motion of this Epicycle it may easily be
conceiued why the Moone seemeth to moue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
swifter and somteimes slower:<note place="margin">Why the Moone see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to moue swifter, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times slower.</note> For seeing that
the vpper part of the Epicycle, moueth contrary to
the motion of the Eccentrick from the East West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when the Moone commeth in that part, shee

               <p>But when the Moone commeth in the nether part

both one way: that is, from the West East-wards,
and therefore at that time the Moone seemeth to

semediameters of the Moone and shadow of
the earth (at that place where the Moone should passe
through that shadow) in the oppossition, to make an
Eclipse: it commeth to passe, that in most coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

there is no Eclipse. And the reason hereof is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the Moone commeth vnder the way of the

in a moneth, and those 2. points (wherin the wayes of
the Sunne and Moone crosse each other) onely twise
in a synodicall moneth, which two points wee called
the Dragons head and taile; whereof wee haue also
spoken before,) Wherfore, seeing the Sunne (going
but once only through the compasse of the Ecliptick
in a yeare) can come but once in a yeare to eyther of
those points; the Moone for the most part, when she
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to bee in opposition, or coniunction with the

the Sunne is to the earth, the lesse shadow shall the
earth haue, at the place of the Moons passage through
the shadow, at equall distances from the earth.</p>
               <p>Contrariwise, the further that the Moone is from
the earth, the lesse shall the shadow of the earth be,
and the nearer the Moone is to the earth, the greater
shall the shadow be, at the place where the Moone
is to passe through the shadow.</p>
               <p>The greatest distance therefore from the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
head or taile, wherein there can at any time
happen any Eclipse of the Moone, is about 13. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
And the least distance at which it is possible
for the Moone to auoid an Eclipse, is about 10. degr.
and one third part of a degree; which hapneth when
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21028:49"/>
the Moone is in the <hi>Apogaeum</hi> of her Epicycle, in her
greatest distance from the earth, and the Sunne in his
<hi>Perigaeum,</hi> in the time of his greatest eccentricity, for
then the Sunne commeth nearest to the earth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the least shadow: as contrarywise at the same
time of his greatest eccentricity, beeing in his
<hi>Apogaeum,</hi> he hath his greatest distance from the earth,
and so maketh the earth cast forth her greatest sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
At which time, if the Moone also chance to be
in the <hi>Perigaeum</hi> of her Epicycle, and so in her nearest
distance from the earth, she may be something Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
although she be full 13. degrees or something
more from the Dragons head or taile.</p>

               <p>NOw the place, and time of the full Moone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
easily knowne by some Almanack, or Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostication;
it shall not be hard, to giue a reasonable
neare estimate, and to foretell both the time, and
quantity of the Eclipse of the Moone, the place of
the Dragons head and taile, being first knowne after
this manner.</p>
               <p>The place of the Dragans head, being first giuen for
any time, for euery yeare before the same time, adde
to the same place: and for euery yeare after the same
time subtract 19. degrees and one third part of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and for euery moneth a degree and an halfe and
a tenth part of a degree and for euery day 3. minutes
and the remainder shall shew you the place of the
Dragons head after the same time: or the summe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21028:49"/>
that time without any great errour.</p>
               <p>As for example, The 30. of Iune this present yeare
1600. suppose you would know the place of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
head: The place therefore of the Dragons head
being first giuen, for the beginning of the same yeare,
in 0. degree 45. minutes, of <hi>Aquarius:</hi> and six moneths
onely of that yeare being passed, I take for those six
moneths 6. degrees and 6. halfe degrees that is 9. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and sixteenth parts of a degree that is 36. min.
the summe of all which is 9. degrees and 36. minutes.</p>
               <p>Which being subtracted out of 0. degree, 45. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> there remaine 21. degrees 9. min.
of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> for the place of the Dragons head at
that time.</p>
