            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I Call him a Tyrant, who either Intrudes himself forcibly into the Government of his Fellow-Citizens, without any legal Authority over them, or who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a just Title to the Government of a People, abuses it to the destruction or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of them: So that all Tyrants are at the same time Usurpers, either of the whole, or at least of a part of that Power which they assume to themselves, and no less are they to be accounted Rebels, since no man can Usurp Authority over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but by Rebelling against them who had it before, or at least against those Laws which were his Superiours.</p>
            <list>
               <head>Several Queries proposed to the Sages of the LAW, who have Studied to Advance the Publick, equally with, if not more than their own private Interest.</head>
               <item>Q. I. <hi>WHether the Legislative Power be in the King only, as in his Politick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, or in the King, Lords, and Commons, in Parliament Assembled? If in the latter, then</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Q. II. <hi>If the King grants a Charter, and thereby great Franchises and Priviledges, and afterwards, the Grantees obtain an Act of Parliament for the Confirmation hereof, is this the Grant of the King, or of the Parliament? If the latter, as it seems to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is done by the whole, and every part of the Legislative Power, then</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Q. III. <hi>To whom can these Grantees forfeit this Charter? and who shall take Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Forfeiture? If the King, then an Act of Parliament may be destroyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Act of Parliament. If the Parliament only can call them to an Account, then</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Q. IV. <hi>Of what Validity is a Iudgment pronounced (under a colour of Law) in</hi> B. R. <hi>against a Charter granted by Parliament? If it be of any force, then the King's Bench is Superiour to the Legislative Power of the Kingdom; If not, then</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Q. V. <hi>What Reason can be assigned, why it is not as safe to Act pursuant to an Act of Parliament, notwithstanding a Iudgment entred in the</hi> King's Bench, <hi>as it was to Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Act of Parliament, before the Iudgment was entered? And then,</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Q. VI. <hi>Whether they that did the latter, were not right down Knaves, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they that refuse to do the former, be not more nice than wise?</hi>
