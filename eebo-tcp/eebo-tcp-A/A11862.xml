            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold testimonies of your loue both vnto Honor and Armes, haue induced me to think the first sight of this small booke doth of right belong vnto your Lordship, being by the due degrees of vertue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to that place, which among others in this Realme, is (and long hath been) reputed most honorable. To your L. therefore I humblie dedicate the same, as vnto him, that by censure of our Soueraigne, with the applause of people, hath in hand the consideration of actions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteining to equitie, Honor and Iustice. The

propertie of which vertue (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) is to foresee that no violence be offered, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by him that with iniurie is thereunto prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: and that things common should bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie vsed, and priuate things priuatlie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed. By which rule appeareth, that vertue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth iust reuenge, and admitteth the defence of propertie and right. But for that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath been as well an actor in Armes, as a knower of what is due to Honor, I omit to say more, either of the one or the other: beseeching your good Lordship to pardon my boldnesse, and take in acceptable wise the entent of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who both by election and obligation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth himself yours.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE cause of all Quarrell is Iniurie and reproach, but the matter of content, is Iustice and Honor. For loue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we shun no care of minde, losse of wealth, nor aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of life. Hereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth all disputation in Schooles, pleading in lawe, warre, and all worldlie wrangling. For who so is either in deede or opinion, perswaded to haue truth and reason on his side, doth not onlie constantlie beleeue that so it is, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof denied, holdeth himselfe iniured, and consequently burthened. True it is, that the Christian lawe willeth men to be of so perfect patience, as not onlie to indure iniurious words, but also quietlie to suffer euerie force and violence. Notwithstanding, forsomuch as none (or verie fewe men) haue attained such perfection, the lawes of all Nations, for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further inconueniences, and the manifestation of truth, haue (among many other trials) permitted, that such questions as could not bee ciuilie prooued by confession, witnesse, or other circumstances, should receiue iudgement by fight and Combat, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that GOD (who onelie knoweth the secret
<pb facs="tcp:17517:5"/>
thoughts of all men) would giue victorie to him that iustlie aduentured his life, for truth, Honor, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that al humaine lawes haue permitted the triall of Armes, and that euerie iniurious action not repulsed, is by common consent of all Martiall mindes holden a thing dishonorable, infamous, and reproachfull; it cannot be, but at some times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions such questions and quarrels shall arise, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie must receiue triall by the Sword. And <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, that hee who repulseth not an iniurie, being able, offendeth no lesse, than if he had abandoned his friends, parents and countrie. By these reasons appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the triall by Armes is not onlie naturall, but also necessarie and allowable. Notwithstanding, for that the vulgar sort (and many right noble also) be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what are the true causes requiring triall of Armes, and what words or deedes are of such quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as ought bee repulsed or reuenged; I haue at the earnest requests and often desires of verie honorable friends (by way of abreuiation) reduced into this small volume, all causes of Quarrell or Combat, the nature of Iniuries and repulses, the equalitie and dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of men, who may bee challenged, and for what respects Challenges ought bee refused: with many other things in matter of Honor and Armes worthie to be knowne and considered.</p>
            <p>And albeit I am not ignorant that publique Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats are in this age either rarelie or neuer graunted; yet for that (as is before said) no prouidence can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the questions and quarrels that daylie happen among Gentlemen and others professing Armes, it
<pb facs="tcp:17517:5"/>
shall not be amisse, but rather behouefull that all men should be fullie informed what iniurie is, and how to repulse it, when to fight, when to rest satisfied, what is Honor and good reputation, how it is gained, and by what meanes the same is kept &amp; preserued; which was the respect that the Earle <hi>Balthazar Castilio</hi> in his booke of the Courtier, doth among other qualities requireable in a gentleman, specially aduise he should bee skilfull in the knowing of Honor, and causes of quarrell. This booke doth not incite men to vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised fight, or needles reuenge (as some simple wit may surmize) but enformeth the true meanes how to shunne all offences: or being offended, sheweth the order of reuenge and repulse, according vnto Christian knowledge and due respect of Honor.</p>
            <p>And for that the dignitie of Knighthood apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth chieflie to Martiall merite, I haue thought fit brieflie to touch the original thereof: declaring how many Orders or degrees of Knights were in times past, and of them, how many yet extant.</p>
            <p>We haue not in this worke medled with Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or blazing of Badges; but chieflie touched mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters offenciue to reputation and Honor, whereof Combat or particular triall of Armes ought to ensue.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> COMBAT, is a single fight of one man against another, for trial of truth, either els of diuers men, as two, foure, sixe, tenne, or more, equallie and indifferentlie agreed vppon, to fight on horsbacke or foot without aduantage, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of persons, or disequalitie of weapons.</p>
               <p>These kind of fights seeme to be first vsed of great Princes, who desiring to end publique Contention and warre, did mutuallie consent to determine the same by their owne priuate vertue and aduenture of life, as did <hi>Golias</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> the <hi>Horatij</hi> and <hi>Curiatij,</hi> with diuers other, who fighting onlie in person, for the publique cause, therby saued the effusion of much bloud, and the liues of many most worthie Captaines and valiant Soldiers. And albeit the cause and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of these Combats, was publique respect, yet each particular Gentleman or other person professing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17517:8"/>
and Armes, ought sufficientlie bee moued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto for defence of his owne particular reputation; which respect, and haplie also some publique occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, mooued the Combat of <hi>Aeneas</hi> with <hi>Turnus,</hi> of <hi>Menelaus</hi> with <hi>Alexander,</hi> of <hi>Pulfius</hi> with <hi>Varenus,</hi> of <hi>Robert Mountfort,</hi> with <hi>Henrie</hi> Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> yea, Kings and Princes haue of late time done the like, as <hi>Charles</hi> the third, King of <hi>France,</hi> with the King of <hi>Hungarie, Alfonso</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> with <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> Earle of of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and King <hi>Alfonso</hi> with King <hi>Ranier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These particular fights were first vsed among the people called <hi>Lombardes,</hi> as appeareth by the lawes written by <hi>Aliprandus</hi> one of the Kings that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Nation: yet true it is, that the Combats of those People, and in that Age, were tried with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weapons but onelie certeine shields and staues of wood, vnlesse it were for cause of infidelitie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seemeth it that the chiefe occasion of their fight was respect of Honor, nor that the vanquished should become dishonored, or Prisoner vnto the vanquisher, as since hath been vsed.</p>

               <head>Of the order of challenging and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending. CAP. 2.</head>
               <p>FIrst is to bee considered, that all Iniuries are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by words or by deeds, and that in euerie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie by words, the Iniurer ought bee the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger: but in an Iniurie by deedes, the Iniured ought to challenge, as for example, <hi>Simon</hi> saith to <hi>Austen,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:17517:8"/>
thou art a <hi>Traitor. Austen</hi> answereth, <hi>Thou liest:</hi> then doth it behooue <hi>Simon</hi> to mainteine his words, and consequentlie to challenge <hi>Austen</hi> to the Combat.</p>
               <p>An Iniurie by deedes is thus. <hi>Simon</hi> giueth a hurt, a cut, or other violence vnto <hi>Austen</hi>; whereat offended, he saith, <hi>Thou hast done me offence, violence, iniurie,</hi> or such like speach. <hi>Simon</hi> answereth, <hi>Thou liest.</hi> Then behoueth it that <hi>Austen</hi> do challenge <hi>Simon,</hi> and force him by fight to mainteine the hurt he offred. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a rule or <hi>maxime</hi> in matter of Honor, it is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie to be noted, that whosoeuer is truelie and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie belied, must of force become Challenger to mainteine that he spake or did, and wherevppon the Lie is giuen him.</p>
               <p>And although some men, rather to shewe the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie of their wits, than the valour of their mindes, will at such occasion vse many superfluous words, whereby further speach of offence doth followe, and so take opportunitie to giue the Lie vnto whom the hurt by hand was giuen; yet the true and precise rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Honor is, that he who gaue the blowe &amp; hurt, should without further dispute be challenged, vnlesse he denie the doing thereof with offer of satisfaction. Thus appeareth brieflie, that whosoeuer is lawfullie belied, ought by Armes to challenge, mainteine, and proue that which he affirmed or did, in preiudice of the honor or person of the Iniured.</p>

               <p>FOr so much as in ordinarie triall by lawe, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Iudgements, whosoeuer standeth accused; by deniall of such accusation, is free from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vntill further proofe be made: euen so in euerie imposition by speach, contrarie to good reputation; honor or honestie, ought either by ciuill or martiall meanes be mainteined and auowed. Therefore, who soeuer being offered iniurious speach, shall say to the offerer thereof <hi>Thou liest,</hi> or thou saiest not truelie, doth therby repulse the iniurie, and force the Iniurer to challenge. And euerie deniall be it neuer so simple, importeth a Lie, &amp; is of like effect, although the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in pronouncing deniall onlie, is an answere more friendlie and courteous, than the qualitie of an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious imposition requireth.</p>
               <p>And although the manner of denials are diuers, as <hi>Thou liest, Thou saiest vntruelie, &amp;c.</hi> yet euerie deniall is a repulse of iniurie, being spoken to that which was iniurie: But if the same be vttered in answere of any words, wherin was no offence, the same becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth iniurious: as thus. If I tell or say any thing without euill imposition to any person, and one stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by, shall say I speake vntruelie, or vse other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of that my speach affirmed; by that manner of speach he giueth me an imputation of a Lier, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentlie offereth me iniurie. Moreouer, for that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie iniurie by words may for once be wrested, it is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17517:9"/>
lawfull for me, with euerie my deniall to repulse that iniurie, and my second deniall conteineth the effect of a Lie, and his first, the force of iniurie; by which meane, the burthen shall rest vpon him. But if so it be, that he answereth or saith, <hi>The truth is otherwise,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other such speach, that cannot bee iniurious, nor shall any waies burthen me, vnlesse I shall in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious sort replie, and then he denying, may lay the burthen vpon me: for the difference that maketh one word sometimes iniurious, and sometimes not, is, that the same is sometimes spoken iniuriouslie, and sometimes not, as thus. If I say vnto another man, <hi>Thou saiest not true,</hi> thereby I reproue him, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie offer iniurie: but if I say, <hi>That which thou saiest is not true,</hi> that speach is not iniurious, and may be without burthen of him vnto whom it is spoken.</p>
               <p>Yet in one case, that rule faileth: for if I say, such a thing I haue done, another answereth, <hi>That is not true:</hi> by so saying, he doth burthen me. To conclude I say, that whosoeuer refraineth with his words and speach to offend others, he can by no meanes receiue the Lie.</p>

               <p>CONDITIONALL lies, wee call those which are vttered vpon condition, as if a man should say thus: <hi>If thou hast called me a theefe, thou doest lie: or if thou shalt hereafter so say, thou liest: And how often thou hast or shalt so say, so oft I say thou hast and shalt lie.</hi> These Conditionall lies in this sort giuen, are the occasion oftentimes of much disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they are not in force vntill such time as the Condition is verified, I meane, vntil it be auowed that such words haue indeede been spoken. For he vnto whom such a Lie is giuen either by words or writing, as he findeth himselfe guiltie or not, so may hee make answere; and hauing haplie spoken such words, he may in vsing generall words find an eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: yea the debating of such a Conditional quarrell may be so handled, as he who gaue the Lie conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, shall vtter some speach whereon to receiue a Lie certeine.

               <p>Albeit this maner of proceeding from one Lie to another, and from one Condition to another, doth seldome occasion other effect than the multiplying of words: yet doo we often see that questions are so

handled, and consequentlie no good or honorable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution dooth followe. Wherefore to auoide all doubts, it behoueth Gentlemen and other persons of honor or credite, to shunne all Conditionall lies, and before he doth offer the Lie, either by confession of the partie or witnesse worthie credite, bee assured he hath cause to giue the Lie. So shal the Lie be certeine, and the belied forced, either to denie that he said, or stand to the iustification thereof.</p>

               <p>A Lie generall may bee in two sorts, in respect of the person, and in respect of the iniurie. The Lie is generall in respect of the Person, when no man to whom it is giuen is named, as thus. <hi>Who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath said that I haue been a Rebell to my Prince, doth lie.</hi> To this manner of Lie no man is bound to make answere, because many may haplie haue so said, and that so being, he that giueth the Lie should be forced to fight with them all, which were inconuenient. For it is vnlawfull vpon one quarrell to fight oftner than once, and vnfit that one man should hazard his reputation vpon the sword of another man. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to remooue such disorders, it hath been thought good that this kind of Lie should bee vnlawfull, of none effect, and disallowed.</p>
               <p>Touching the other Lie which we call general in respect of the iniurie, is thus. <hi>Simon, thou hast said euill of me, and spoken words in preiudice of mine honestie, and therefore I say thou liest.</hi> This manner of Lie, not being
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17517:11"/>
giuen vpon any matter certeine, or words speciallie repeated, is to none effect: and therefore if hee who giueth such a Lie, intendeth to make a iust quarrell, it behoueth him to set downe in writing, the verie words whervpon he giueth the Lie. For besides that, such lies doo not bind the aduerse partie, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so perilous, and apt to be returned. I say therfore that forsomuch as a Lie generall is of small effect, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fit to bee wrested against the giuer thereof, it ought of all Gentlemen to be vtterlie refrained.</p>

               <p>LIes speciall are those which are giuen vnto spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall persons, and vpon expresse and particular matter: as for example, Gregorie, <hi>thou hast said that vpon the day of Battaile at</hi> Grauling, <hi>I abandoned mine Ensigne and charge; for which saying thou hast lied.</hi> This is that Lie which (as is before said) I call a Lie certein &amp; lawful; yet is it to be intended that he who giueth this Lie either by word or writing, ought first to be enformed fullie, and haue sufficient proofe and witnesse of that he saith, so as the same cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. For wanting due proues, he to whom the Lie was giuen, may answere, that I lie in charging him with such words as he neuer vttered, and in that case it shall behoue me to proue the reproach wherewith I haue charged him: but if hee cannot denie that wherewith he is charged, then must he either main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine his speach, or confesse the fault.</p>
               <p>Here is to be noted, that in such quarells wherein
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17517:12"/>

Seeing then that this sort of Lie, whereof we presentlie entreate, is onlie true and lawfull; therefore it behoueth Gentlemen, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers professing Honor and Armes, therewith to giue repulse vnto such iniuries as are offered: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to shewe the cause of their offence either by word or writing, they must so plainlie and sincerelie set downe the intent thereof, as no part of the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can bee either denied or wrested to other sense than it was vttered or written, whereby afterwards no doubt shall arise, who ought to challenge, and who to defend.</p>

               <p>THe simple &amp; ignorant sort of men perswading themselues, that he vnto whom the Lie is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, doth thereby lose the election of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; therefore ignorantlie and foolishlie they giue the Lie, before they either knowe or aske the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion wherefore they so doo: as thus. <hi>If thou wilt not say I am an honest man, thou liest in thy throate:</hi> the follie of which speach doth plainlie appeare. For seeing the Lie is nothing els but an answere, in this the order of nature is changed, &amp; the answere vttered before the question asked. Another sort of ignorant quarrellers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17517:12"/>
are, that will say thus. <hi>If any man hath said euill of me, hee hath lied: and if hee will denie to haue so said, hee also lieth.</hi> This sillie sort of quarrelling, may likewise be called a Lie foolish and vaine: for hee who shall vse such words, doth thereby take vppon him both to propound and to answere, and consequentlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the office aswell of Defender as Challenger.</p>
               <p>Another sort of these Vaine lies are thus offered: <hi>Simon</hi> meeting with <hi>Lewes</hi> saith, <hi>Draw thy weapon, and I will presentlie prooue thee a Liar and a Varlet: Or if thou wilt not drawe, then art thou a Varlet also.</hi> This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Lie is without foundation, cause or reason, &amp; therefore meete to be laughed at. Others there are, who being charged to commit dishonest actions, do for the present time depart without making either deniall or answere; but after hauing assembled a number of friends weaponed with aduantage, saith to him that charged him, <hi>Thou liest:</hi> which manner of doing is also cowardlie and foolish. For as euerie accusation or imputation ought be done without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, euen so euerie answere without aduantage, ought be vttered. Also euerie Iniurie offered in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, should likewise in presence be answered: and if in absence any such wrong bee done, in absence an answere may be made. Finallie, vnto matter of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in writing, the answere ought bee framed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: yet is it reason, that if a man armed or accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied doo offer euill speach or violence to him that is vnarmed and alone; in that case it shall be lawfull to make answere at time more conuenient. But if so be that any man finding and knowing me better armed, accompanied, or prepared than himselfe, will neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17517:13"/>
offer me iniurie; in that case it is lawfull for me by words or deedes to repulse the iniurie, and bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged notwithstanding mine aduantage, because it was his follie to offer offence, seeing my strength. But Gentlemen should euer so doo, as the Lie may be no lesse or more honorablie giuen, than the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was offered.</p>
               <p>One other aduantage in offering iniurie may be in this sort. If any man shall offer the same in place of priuiledge, or in presence of the Prince; in that case it hath been thought fit that no Lie or other repulse should be. Neuerthelesse, it seemeth reasonable, that if it pleaseth the Prince to know that I am in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or Court iniuried, that it may also please him that I may desend my selfe. Yet true it is, that in such places it becommeth the Iniured to temper his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, and vse words of reuerence, and the rather if he who offereth the iniurie bee a person of more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and fauour with the Prince before whom the iniurie was offered, Howsoeuer it be, I take not vpon me to informe what ought in such case to bee done, but tell mine opinion as that which I thinke to bee honorable: whereunto I adde, that wise Princes wil more patientlie indure the repulse, than the offer of Iniurie in their presence.</p>

Whereunto may be added, that in matter of Armes, al Emperours, King and Princes, haue euer vouchsafed to be called by the name of Gentlemen and Soldiers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it standeth with good reason, that an answere
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17517:14"/>

               <p>HEretofore wee haue said, that hee vnto whom the Lie is giuen for a repulse of iniurie, ought be the Challenger: yet for more certeintie of that saying, wee are diligentlie to examine what sort of Lies are lawfull. It is therefore to be vnderstood, that the true and proper nature of the Lie, is to repulse Iniurie, and whensoeuer it worketh not that effect, it becommeth Iniurie, and by another Lie may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. Also it is to bee noted, that in one selfesame quarrell aswell vnto a Deniall as an Affirmation, the Lie may bee giuen. The Lie lawfullie giuen vnto an affirmation is that, whereof we haue before spoken, as thus. One man saith vnto another, <hi>He is a Rebell to his Prince:</hi> He answereth, <hi>Thou liest:</hi> and this kind of Lie cannot bee auoyded, because it is giuen for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse vnto an infamie directly offered. But if I, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of other do say, <hi>He is an honest man,</hi> and one stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by, doth giue mee the Lie: in that case the Lie shall not be reputed a repulse, but an Iniurie; and it is lawfull for me to say, that gainsaying the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I gaue, <hi>he lieth</hi>; because he encountereth my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and seemeth to denie that all men are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den honest, til profe be made of the contrarie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoueth him that denied the man to bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, to prooue such deniall: in the meane time he is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17517:14"/>
burthened and bound to challenge me.</p>
               <p>But let vs now speake of Lies giuen vpon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue which are either lawfull, or may lawfullie bee returned: as if any man doth say of me, <hi>That in such a seruice of Armes I had not done my duetie,</hi> and I should answere with the Lie, that shall be a lawfull answere. Yet if a man shall say, <hi>That he hath not failed of fidelitie vnto his Prince,</hi> and I say he lieth; then is it lawful for him to answere, <hi>Thou liest in saying I lie,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie force me to challenge; because in affirming his owne fidelitie he doth not iniurie to any man: but I denying thereof, doo greatlie wrong him, and therfore reasonablie the Lie to be returned vpon me. Now it resteth to produce some example, how in one selfesame quarrell, both vpon the affirmatiue and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue the Lie may be giuen, so as neither the one nor the other partie hath apparant place of repulse, as in this case.</p>
               <p>Two Gentlemen being in the field prepared to fight, do there fall into disputation, whether the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons be lawfull or not: by meane whereof, the day is spent in speach, and nothing done.

But for more particular knowledge of this matter, you shall vnderstand, that we call an act done contrarie to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Iniurie,</hi> or (as some do terme it) <hi>Offence</hi> or <hi>Wrong:</hi> and the Burthen, is a certeine naturall obligation, whereby a man standeth bound to repulse or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the matter in question. Wherefore, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17517:16"/>
we see a man burthened or charged, it is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and consequentlie looked for, that he ought to be a Challenger. It is also to bee knowne, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles one man may doo vnto another such an act as may be both an Iniurie, and a Burthen: so may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so an Iniurie bee done without Burthen, and a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then without Iniurie.</p>
               <p>An Iniurie ioyned with Burthen is thus. If a man shall charge me with an euill fact neuer by me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, whereby (contrarie to all reason) he seeketh my slaunder, hereby he offereth me Iniurie, and the Burthen he laieth vpon me, is, for that I stand bound to repulse and make answere vnto such outragious words, and consequentlie am forced to answere, <hi>He lieth,</hi> whereby I am disburthened, &amp; lay the burthen on him, by which meane I become discharged of mine obligation, and binde him vnto the proofe and mainteining of his words, which is to mainteine and be a Challenger. And in handling the matter, this is to bee noted, that I onlie doo burthen him without offer of Iniurie, because I make this answere vpon a iust and reasonable cause, onlie with intent to lay the Burthen on him.</p>
               <p>An Iniurie without Burthen is in two sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> in word or in deed, as thus. If one man shall charge another in word, with that which is manifestlie false; in that case it is not necessarie to make any answere at all, because he who speaketh such words, proueth himselfe an apparant Liar, and therefore not worthie of so much respect as to bee answered; so are those words Iniurie, but no Burthen. An Iniurie in deedes without Burthen, is, when one man offereth vnto an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17517:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other violence with aduantage, or in such euill sort, as the fact appeareth to bee done contrarie to honor and reason; in that case, to what purpose should the Iniured challenge the Iniurer? seeing the matter to be plaine and apparant. But haplie it may bee said by him that is iniured, <hi>Shall I rest without reuenge?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto may bee answered by Princes, or others hauing authoritie to graunt Combat, that to admit triall by Armes is onlie lawfull for the finding out and iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of truth; but the punishment of wilfull acts contrarie to peace, is by ciuill authoritie to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And in mine opinion, whosoeuer receiueth an Iniurie in deedes dishonorablie offered, is thereby neither dishonored nor burthened: and for reuenge of such cowardlie and beastiall offences, it is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to vse any adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage or subtiltie, according to the Italian prouerbe, <hi>Ad vna sopercheria, si conuiene vn' al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra sopercheria, &amp; ad vn tradimento vn altro tradimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> which is, that one aduantage requireth another, and one treason may be with another acquited.</p>

               <p>IT may seeme straunge that heretofore wee haue said, that a traiterous Iniurie might be in like sort reuenged; yet is it verie reasonable that so it should be: and though it were not, yet doth he that offereth such an Iniurie incurre apparant Infamie, without burthening him vnto whom it is offered. For what reason can mainteine that any man should bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

of Infamie, that was by another cowardlie and sodeinlie hurt or striken? Nay, who is he that will not blame him that offereth such an Iniurie, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite him vnto whom it was done? To conclude therfore, I say, the Infamie is due vnto him that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie doth a dishonorable wrong, not to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth it: for no man wanteth power to refraine a wicked action, no man wanteth power to performe his promise, no man is forced to be a traitor: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whosoeuer falleth into any such fault, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth odious and infamous: besides that, in offending cowardlie, he seemeth to want vertue and courage required in a Gentleman. By ancient custome it hath therefore been determined, that if any man hauing committed such cowardlie and foule facts, shal after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards challenge another Gentleman, he may in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Infamie due for his former doings, bee lawfullie refused.</p>
               <p>I will also aduise all Gentlemen to eschue one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vile and euill abuse, which is thus. A man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing offered iniurious words, and is lawfully belied, he may not with a cowardlie stroake or touch of a cudgill, or any such like meanes, thinke to bee acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the burthen, as some men haue supposed; yet the vulgar sort do thinke that to giue a blowe, or spit in the face of a man, and runne away, dischargeth a lawfull Lie, which is farre otherwise. Mine opinion therefore is, that a man directlie is not discharged by any such act, but standeth still burthened to prooue that affirmation, whereupon the Lie was giuen him, and consequentlie must challenge.</p>

               <head>Of Armes both offensiue and defensiue. CAP. 6.</head>
               <p>IT hath been before said, that by the lawe of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardie,</hi> euerie Combat (vnlesse vpon quarrell of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie) should bee tried with shields and staues, and with no other weapon. But the matter of their Combats was onlie for trial of truth, without respect of honor. Howsoeuer it were, besides that custome must bee receiued for lawe, it seemeth to me that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publique or priuate fight, such weapons ought bee vsed as are commonlie worne of Gentlemen and others professing Armes. And touching Armes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue, it hath been also the vse, that as they are thought allowable in warre and all generall fights, so in particular triall of Armes, they ought not bee reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; because <hi>Fortitude</hi> accompanied with <hi>Prudence,</hi> is much the more commendable, seeing he that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiselie or inconsideratlie aduentureth himselfe, is not to bee reputed valiant but furious: neither is he accompted valiant, that without councell or cause, delighteth in dangers, but he that neuer doth shunne any generous action, tending to publique benefite or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17517:19"/>
his owne priuate reputation. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that a valiant man doth neither feare all things, nor dare doo all things. For these respects it hath euer been thought fit, that in particular Combats, the fighters should be allowed Armes defensiue, &amp; not performe the same naked and vtterlie disarmed, with swords and daggers onlie, as is in this part of the world now vsed. And sith the perill of life is no lesse in particular than in publique fight, it seemeth verie reasonable that defensiue Armes should bee allowed; yet so as both the Challenger and Defender be equallie armed &amp; weaponed, which in truth ought be at the election of the Defendant, as heretofore hath been discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But because the custome of the land is (and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelie also lawe forbiddeth that any man should be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med saue onlie in the warre) I thinke no Gentleman ought refuse to fight disarmed.

               <p>FOr good and reasonable causes, many aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are due vnto him that is challenged, because he being accused and constrained to fight, iust and true reason willeth that he should enioy al honest fauour. It hath been therefore well determined, that whosoeuer is Defender, dooth sufficientlie acquite himselfe, and ought bee reputed victorious, if he bee not victored. But on the other side, he that challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, must not onlie escape to be vanquished, but also vanquish his enemie; for otherwise he shall bee repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as victored, and lose the quarrell, which is verie reasonable, because his office is to prooue, but the Defender is not bound to more than to defend.</p>
               <p>Another fauour also apperteineth to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is, the election of the weapon, which is also reasonablie done, because if another man will voluntarilie call me to triall of the Sword, the choyce of the weapon ought of right to be mine. Yet true it is, that no Defender ought to make election of other Armes either defensiue or offensiue, than such as are lawfull, and worne ordinarilie by Gentlemen and Soldiers. Therewith also is to be obserued, that if the question whereupon the Combat or fight groweth, may bee decided by ciuill triall, that then no triall of Armes ought bee enterprised. Much more also may be added touching the equalitie or disequalitie of the persons that enter into fight, and likewise of the Armes aswell defensiue as offensiue: but because

               <p>AT such time as publique Combats were vsed within a List, or place speciallie appoynted for that purpose, there was a Iudge indifferentlie chosen by the fighters, to see and determine which of them were victorious, and who was victored. But notwithstanding the discontinuance of those Ceremonies, and the performance of fight by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante of Princes Letters Pattents; yet doo I thinke it not amisse, brieflie to set downe in what cases men were reputed victorious.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is therefore to be knowne, that if the Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger dooth not vanquish the Defender in the day of fight before the Sunne setting, he is himselfe to bee iudged vanquished, and cannot afterwards challenge any other Gentleman to the Combat.

               <p n="2">2 The next kind of victorie is, when any of the fighters doth yeeld vnto his enemie, either by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing himselfe not able to defend, to yeeld himselfe prisoner, or by vttering anie other speach tending to submission.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon wee conclude, that euerie Bastard hauing well and vertuouslie serued in the warre, or that for his good merite hath aspired to beare charge of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Armie, ought be receiued to fight with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie priuate Gentleman or Soldier, because men so borne, haue not onelie been oftentimes aduanced to honor, but they and their posteritie also, haue attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and continued in high dignitie and greatest esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>True it is, that men so borne, cannot mainteine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17517:23"/>
themselues to bee Gentlemen by birth, and therefore directlie must not claime such title, or enter the triall of Armes, and therefore in that respect may be repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, not as infamous, but as ignoble, which defect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by valorous indeuour in Armes, or vertuous stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in learning may be supplied.</p>
               <p>Also all such Bastards as haue long serued loyallie in their Princes Court, &amp; that by priuiledge of their Prince are made legitimate, or hath liued orderlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Gentlemen, in place of reputation, may not be repulsed.</p>

               <p>ALbeit euerie Soueraigne Prince hath power to pardon disloyaltie, treason, and euerie other offence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted against his person, Crowne or dignitie, &amp; can also restore vnto the partie pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his lands and his offices, with any other fauour: yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he not vndo that is done, nor bring to passe that to be well done, which is alreadie euill done, nor that a mind infected with Infamie, should bee cleane and voyd of dishonor, &amp; consequently (notwithstanding restitution) the Prince hath still iust cause to bee sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of such a mans fidelitie, as is apt to be drawne to dishonest actions, and euerie other Gentleman should hold him in euill conceipt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, touching the power and authoritie of Princes, in this case it seemeth that as they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue the good men of their goodnes, so can they not take from the euill their euill thoughts, seeing their

               <p>It may therefore be inferred, that if a man restored after the committing of any notorious euill fact, shall challenge another Gentleman to triall of Armes, he may bee reasonablie repulsed.

               <head>Of the disequalitie of Gentlemen. CAP. 4.</head>
               <p>BEfore wee enter into consideration of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I thinke good to aduertise, that as there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sorts of men that may not challenge others, so are there some that ought not be challenged of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. The first of them is Clarkes, or Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, professing religion. The other sort is Doctors, with all Students, and such men as are onlie giuen to literature and knowledge. But to returne vnto dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of noble persons, I say that the true nobilitie of men, is <hi>Vertue,</hi> and that he is truelie noble that is vertuous, bee he borne of high or of lowe Parents. And the more highlie he be borne, the worse reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17517:24"/>
he meriteth, if he cannot continue the honor left him by his Ancestors. <hi>Chrisostome</hi> saith, what honor is it to bee well borne, being defiled with vile condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: or what hurteth base parentage to him, that is with gentle manners adorned? Who so vaunteth of his Ancestors, seemeth without any good thing of his own. <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, that who so will trulie iudge what worthines is in man, must consider of him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, laying aside his liuings and titles of honor, with all other fauours of fortune. He must also imagine him without bodie, and then weigh of what value or excellencie he is in minde, because nobilitie is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the minde, and in the minde it appeareth.</p>
               <p>Now to speake of disequalitie, I say that albeit Emperours, Kings, Princes, great Lords, and meane also, are comprised within the name of Gentlemen and Soldiers, yet is there among them such inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as no Gentleman of what title soeuer, may bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared vnto a King, nor any Soldier vnto an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, whereof we wil speake hereafter more at large.</p>
               <p>Touching the disequalitie of priuate nobilitie, thus is it to bee discoursed. All Gentlemen are either without office, either els they haue office or dignitie, as the gouernment of Townes, Countries, Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or commandements in warre. Who euer of them hath any office or employment, either it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him for time or life. If he bee an officer for time, and is occasioned to answere in Armes, he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat till the expiration of his time in office.</p>
               <p>If the office be for life, &amp; the qualitie thereof such as maketh him Superiour to the aduersarie, he may fight by Champion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:17517:25"/>If such an officer be not Superiour to the enemie, he ought aske leaue of his Prince, and not obteining it, shall without license go vnto the place of Combat, and with Armes answere the Enemie; for the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of honor is to bee preferred before all other. Whosoeuer is borne noble (vnder which word is comprised all sorts of nobilitie and gentilitie) is equal to any other Gentleman of priuate condition. Note here, that in saying a Gentleman borne, we meane he must be descended from three degrees of gentry, both on the mothers and fathers side, such is the opinion of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Gentleman descended of the most noble house, not hauing iurisdiction or commandement, may be challenged of any priuate or particular Gentleman. Also in respect that the profession of Armes is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, a Soldier that hath long serued without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ought be accompted a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Also a Scholler hauing continued the studie of good learning, &amp; is aspired to the degrees of schooles, cannot be denied the title of gentrie.</p>
               <p>A simple Soldier of honest fame, may fight with any other Soldier, Corporall, Sergeant, or other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, the Capteine excepted, and he also may bee chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to answere by Champion.</p>
               <p>Euerie Capteine may challenge another Capteine, vnlesse their charges bee such as the one can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the other, and this rule must serue through all degrees of Soldiers, both on horseback and foot: yet is it to bee vnderstood, that men at Armes being the most honorable sort of Soldiers and in continuall pay, (being for the most part Gentlemen) may not be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17517:25"/>
refused to fight with any priuate Capteine of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>It may be also that a Capteine of footmen should fight with a Capteine of horsemen, were it not that those charges are giuen to Noble men, &amp; the charge of men at Armes to the most Noble: yet is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be had aswell of their birth as their charges. For the Capteine in meaner place, may bee so hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie borne, as he ought not be repulsed: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is also to bee had among Capteines, both on horsebacke and foote, and likewise among all horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Soldiers on foote in particular.</p>

               <head>Of Iniurie done with aduantage. CAP. 5.</head>
               <p>HEretofore hath been said, that no Iniurie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with aduantage, ought to burthen him in reputation vnto whom the same was offered, and that such Iniuries may in like sort bee reuenged, which being a thing verie naturall and reasonable, needeth no further proofe. Notwithstanding, to the intent each man may bee fullie enformed what Aduauntage is, wee thinke fit somewhat to say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Aduantage in general is, when one man doth iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto another, so, and in such time and place as the Iniured cannot be reuenged: but to speake thereof in particular, thus may it be said for example.</p>
               <p>If one man being armed doth assault another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17517:26"/>
or that he be better armed, that we call aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>If a man in office or place of dignitie, hauing about him friends or seruants, doth offer iniurie to another of meaner estate, that is (likewise) Aduantage.</p>
               <p>If two or more men, doo hurt or strike another, so as the man hurt is not able to make present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, that is also Iniurie with aduantage.</p>
               <p>By these fewe examples, may all other aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Iniuries be conceiued: but therewith is to bee remembred, that the dishonor and burthen of such acts doo apperteine vnto the Iniurer, and the iniurie onelie resteth vpon the Iniured without burthen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he shewe apparant signes of cowardise: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon may bee inferred, that no Iniurie with aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage dooth occasion any necessarie quarrell, sith no man is necessarilie bound to challenge; but onelie he that standeth charged and burthened. For if an Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with aduantage did burthen the reputation of the Iniured, then were it easie for euerie coward to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the most valiant man aliue, because such Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are most safelie offered. It seemeth therefore good in this case to disstinguish the nature of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Iniuries, which may be in this manner.</p>
               <p>Either the Iniurie with aduantage is offered in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of other men that can beare witnesse thereof, or els it is offered out of presence of others.</p>
               <p>In the first case, the testimonie of witnesses will make the fact punishable by lawe and ciuill triall, which is the true reuenge, for (as hath been oft said) the triall of Armes is not allowed, but in such cases as the ciuill prooues cannot appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:17517:26"/>If the Iniurie bee offered where no man can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the manner thereof, then resteth it in the choyce of the Iniured, either to bee reuenged by challenge, which is the more honorable, or with the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. At such time as Princes were pleased to graunt license for the triall of reputation in publique Combat, whosoeuer was knowne to haue offered this sort of Iniurie (with all others his Aiders and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors) were published and proclaimed as persons Infamous. What hath been said of these Iniuries in deedes, is likewise to bee vnderstood where they are offered in words. Note also that an Iniurie receiued without aduantage, either by word or deed, may not bee discharged with an Iniurie of words or deedes done with aduantage, as thus.</p>
               <p>A blowe giuen by hand without aduantage, is not truelie discharged with tenne blowes of the hand or cudgell with aduantage. For it is not reasonable that a dishonest fact done with aduantage, should reuerse an honest fact done in good sort and manfullie. The cause why Iniurie with aduantage doth not burthen the Iniured, is, because no lawe in the world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth things impossible.</p>

               <p>If a man doth cast a Dagger, Sword, or other thing of offence, and therewith hurt, that may be also repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Iniurie in euill sort.</p>

               <head>Of Satisfaction. CAP. 7.</head>
               <p>MAny men do hold opinion, that Iniuries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by deedes, cannot by words bee satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But this matter is not to bee considered simplie, by comparing words vnto deedes, but by the weight and greatnes of the dishonor that is receiued by the fact and the words, &amp; also of the shame which I offer vnto my selfe and is offered by others. For whether doo we thinke a Gentleman lesse commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable that traiterouslie hurteth another, or him that by such meanes receiueth the harme, which may bee also said of him that offendeth with aduantage, or that giueth a hurt in euill sort. In mine opinion there
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17517:27"/>
is no doubt to answere this question, because in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie reason the offender ought to be blamed, &amp; not he that is offended, as hath been heretofore discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Notwithstanding, if I hauing done such an act, doo confesse the iniurious manner thereof, and say that without cause the same was by me committed, and consequentlie desire pardon, there is no reason but that he who receiued the iniurie should rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For I knowe no offence so great, as is vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vppon such submission, and the more for that the nature of all generous minds is enclined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and forgiuenes.</p>
               <p>Yet contrarie to my conceipt, some others doo hold, that if I haue done any iniurious deede, no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction sufficeth, vnlesse I freelie yeeld my selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of him who is iniured, and stand at his mercie; which seemeth vnto mee a course verie doubtfull and vnlike to receiue good. For if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured with his owne hand shall doo any thing to his satisfaction, in so doing he sheweth no courtesie, and consequentlie doubleth the anger and quarrell. Or if without other demonstration, forgiuenes be taken as a satisfaction, then will the matter rest suspicious, as a thing agreed on before, and preiudiciall vnto the reputation of him that is iniured. But true it is, if a man should vnaduisedlie or rashlie offend me, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie knowing his error, fall downe at my feete, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me his weapon and pray pardon; in that case there is no doubt, but that I ought rest satisfied, and he freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suspition. But if the matter be not at the first thus handled, and the bloud cooled, then seemeth it hard how to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe a peace by way of remission.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:17517:28"/>Now to confirme that was before said, that words are of effect sufficient to satisfie an Iniurie by deede, I say if a man greatlie harmed by another, doth write that he intendeth to prooue the hurt receiued of him to bee iniuriouslie and vngentlemanlie done, and the Iniurer will answere and confesse he hath indeede done euill, and an act not iustifiable; surely no reason would that afterwards any quarrell or obligation of honor should remaine. The like satisfaction ought be receiued from the mouth of the Iniurer, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that Iniuries by deedes may with words be recompensed.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in knowing the truth; he that hath done wrong, ought in reason to confesse it; and hee that hath right, should mainteine it: therefore when any man iustlie offended hath taken a reuenge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient according to the qualitie of the offence, to make a peace betwixt these parties, the matter must be thus handled. He that hath made the reuenge shall say: Verie sorie I am to haue had occasion to vse any act of reuenge, and without that occasion, if I had done thus, I should not haue done wel, &amp; as a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to do, or other words to like effect. After which words pronounced, the other partie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in conscience that he gaue the occasion (confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his fault) ought to rest satisfied, &amp; so will, vnlesse
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17517:28"/>
he bee a bodie voyde of reason. Likewise, if two Gentlemen vppon some vnkind words doo drawe, and the one hurt the other; to make them friends, the way is thus. He that gaue the hurt or wound shal say, that the Gentleman wounded, behaued himselfe as a valiant man ought, and although he receiued the hurt yet his vertue did sufficientlie appeare. Vpon these or like speaches, a peace may reasonablie ensue with reputation to both; for the one by giuing the hurt hath gained honor, and the other receiuing praise of his enemie is acquite of euill imputation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all men shall knowe, that both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath tried himselfe a manlie and valiant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>If one man doth strike or offer violence vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; presentlie runne away; or if the partie offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by any other meane, cannot bee presentlie reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: yet in that case, if he lay hand on his weapon and endeuour to make reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, he shal be reputed valiant, and the other a coward. But to make peace betweene them, the onelie way is, that he who offered the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, shall in plaine termes confesse the manner how it was done, and pray pardon. And although it may seeme contrarie to the courage of man, not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that is begun; yet when he considereth in his owne conscience, that the act was iniurious and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardlie, it shall bee better christianlie to repent, than wilfullie to persist against all truth and reason.</p>
               <p>If one man dooth chaunce to hurt another vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, or vnknowing him, as sometimes it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the night or darke places, the amends must be to say, I know you not, for knowing, I would not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17517:29"/>
haue so done, nor might so doo without offering wrong and discourtesie, and therefore pray you hold me excused.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it happeneth that one challengeth an other to haue striken him, and the other doth denie that so he did: in that case the satisfaction must bee thus. The partie charged to haue striken, shall say (if so the truth be) Indeed I did not strike you, &amp; if I had (hauing no such cause) I might iustlie bee accused of Iniurie. After this sort, many other questions may be ordered, vsing such words and reasons, as to discreete Gentlemen shall be thought conuenient. And here I will remember all Gentlemen, making profession of Honor and Truth, that they should not in any wise mainteine any vniust words or wrongfull action. But being by choler or other occasion entred into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, they ought rather reforme their error, than ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinatlie continue to the offence of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and knowledge.

               <p>THe first of these is, that aswell the Iniurer as the Iniured should bee drawne into the presence of some honorable personage, and before any act of submission or repetition of words before passed, to agree and referre the order and ending of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, vnto one man indifferentlie chosen by consent

This order hath been oftentimes vsed, and satisfaction so made, thought effectual: for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it prooueth a thing verie difficult to bring the aduersaries together face to face, before a Iudge or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person of authoritie: sometimes also being met, they fall into newe quarrell vpon newe occasion: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther els before they come, a doubt will arise how they shall bee accompanied, and whether they shall come armed or without weapon. Another while there groweth difficultie vpon the words of satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It hath been also seene, that in such conference there hath passed some blowes of the hand, weapon, foote, or other violence, whereby the enmitie was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreased, than appeased.

               <p>Another way is this, that some person of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie should call the parties afore him, and take a truce vntill hee shall at more leisure consider of the quarrell, enioyning them in the meane time not to speake or doo any thing either against other: which order is couertlie a truce perpetual.</p>

               <p>IT hath been alreadie said, that the ground of all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is truth, which cannot be denied: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whensoeuer one man hath vttered any vntrue imputation of another, hee may without discredite confesse the thing to be otherwise than he spake, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his owne excuse (vnlesse the truth bee contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) that which I said I thought then to bee true. Or thus. That I said, was tolde mee of others. Or thus. What I said was in my choller. These speaches ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to shew the truth to be otherwise than was said, the partie offended is disburthened.</p>
               <p>If a man hath giuen the Lie to another, and after doth knowe the words wherevpon the Lie was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be true: he may in that case without reproach reuoke the Lie, and thereby make satisfaction.

                  </gap>ion directlie, then may he say, I confesse the words to be true whereof our quarrell groweth, either els he may repeate the words, and therewithal allow them.</p>
               <p>Another way to procure satisfaction is, That hee who gaue the Lie shall say or write vnto the partie belied to this effect: I pray you aduertise me by this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17517:30"/>
bearer, with what intent you spake those words of iniurie, wherevpon I gaue you the Lie. The other will answere, I spake them in choller, or with no meaning to offend you. Thereunto may be answered by him that gaue the Lie, thus. If your words were said onelie in anger, and no intent to challenge me, then do I assure you that my Lie giuen shall not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then you, for I acknowledge you to be a true speaker, and a Gentleman of good reputation; wherefore my desire is, that the speach passed betweene vs may bee forgotten. This forme of pacification may serue in many cases, and at sundrie occasions.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it happeneth, that a man repenting a speach euill spoken of another, will after denie that any such words were spoken; which seemeth no ful satisfaction, vnlesse hee adde these words: I spake it not, or if I had spoken it, I should haue said vntruelie. These or like speaches are in this case verie conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: for if another man speaketh euill of me, by the deniall of his speach he shameth himselfe, but not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth me, vnlesse he also affirme mine innocencie. But a Gentleman hauing indeed said any thing, ought rather confesse, than denie what was said: which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I thinke not dishonorable, but honest, as proceeding from a Christian conscience.</p>
               <p>If a man hath said any thing that is true, yet vnfit to be spoken, he ought not denie that so he said: but for satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must say thus. I spake the words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intent to offend, and therefore pray pardon: for indeed to speake a truth with intent to offend, dooth giue iust cause of offence.</p>

               <head>How the giuing of satisfaction is a thing not reproachfull. CAP. 11.</head>
               <p>NOw for that satisfaction is commonlie made by meanes of <hi>Vnsaying,</hi> (for by that terme wee will call aswell euerie reuocation of words, as confession to haue done euil) it may be obiected that if vnsaying be so reproachfull, as for it a man may be discredited, and of other Gentlemen repulsed; then if I haue spoken vntruelie, or done euill by vnsaying or denying thereof, I am to incurre infamie. But for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of that obiection, I say, that great difference there is betweene vnsaying in the Listes or fields by force of Armes, and that vnsaying which is vttered voluntarilie for the loue of truth; for the one is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for feare of death, and the other by perswasion of reason. For hee that persisteth to mainteine euill doth condemne himselfe, as a man that would fight contrarie to iustice: but the other sheweth he will not take Armes for any cause, but that which is iust. And as the one is the part of an euill and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: so is the other a signe of sinceritie &amp; loyall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For sith there is no man liuing faultles, yet he that knoweth his error and repenteth, is most to bee excused, endeuouring to make satisfaction Therfore that Gentleman who knoweth his owne fault, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to amend it, doth not onlie deserue to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, but is also worthie much praise in offering such satisfaction as apperteineth to reason, and the office of a iust and true Christian. To conclude ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17517:31"/>
I say, albeit the vulgar sort doo thinke, that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is a signe of cowardise: yet who so choseth to fight against reason and truth, ought bee reputed rather a beast than a Christian, and a furious foole ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a reasonable creature.</p>

Others not allowing that opinion affirme, that riches, being of their owne nature vile, doo nothing helpe towards Nobilitie; and therfore concludeth, that vertue alone sufficeth. <hi>Bartholus</hi> saith, that riches doo helpe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto Nobilitie; but to preserue it, <hi>Vertue</hi> onelie hath power. Others doo thinke, that Nobilitie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the auncient honor, fame, and title of Predecessors; because otherwise a bondman being vertuous, might challenge that honor. Some men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

haue thought, that as before God he is most noble and and worthie, vnto whom is giuen most grace; euen so hee is most honorable among men, whom Princes or lawes haue enhabled vnto dignitie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it bee, most sure it is, that no man giueth vnto himselfe any title, but it behooueth him to receiue it from others. Therefore <hi>Bartholus</hi> concludeth, that to be made noble, it is requisite the Prince doo bestowe some sort of dignitie, or title vpon the person that is ennobled, to the end he may bee knowne from the Plebeiall people: but we say that men may bee repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted noble three waies. First, by nature or discent of Auncestors, which is the vulgar opinion. Secondlie, for vertue onelie, which the <hi>Philosophers</hi> affirme. Thirdlie, by mixture of auncient gentle race with <hi>Vertue,</hi> which is indeede the true and most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable kind of Nobilitie: for seeing man is a creature reasonable, he ought bee called man, in respect of his owne vertue, and not the vertue of others; which moued <hi>Vlisses</hi> to say vnto <hi>Aiax,</hi> boasting of Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesters.</p>

               <p>But for better manifestation that naturall Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie mixed with <hi>Vertue</hi> is most true and perfect, thus may it be prooued. The almightie God hath created all things both in generalitie and specialitie, with a certeine excellencie and bountie, one more perfect than the other, one noble, another ignoble.

the better sort of them, some more or lesse precious and orient: euen so among liuing creatures both in generalitie &amp; specialitie, we finde some courteous &amp; gentle, others rude &amp; voyd of vertue.

Notwithstanding, for that we finde in ordinarie obseruation, that neither the horse of excellent cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, doth alwaies beget another of like qualitie, nor that the vertuous man hath euer children resembling himselfe, wee doo not (hauing proofe of their dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration) esteeme either the one or the other: which moued <hi>Iuuenal</hi> to say,

               <p>Seeing then that either by naturall instinct, nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or endeuour, some men are more vertuous than others, therefore ought they be reputed more gentle, noble, and worthie honor, than are those which are voyd of noble Auncesters, good education, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie.

               <p>IT happened the Emperiall seate being voyd, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors named vnto that dignitie two Princes, not by general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent, but by deuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of voyces, the one partie chosing <hi>Alfonso</hi> king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the other <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal</hi> brother to the King of <hi>England.</hi> These Princes claiming the Empire, the one challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the other to trie the right by Combat: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon grewe a question, whether persons of so high calling ought be admitted to fight in Combat. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto is said, that forsomuch as the Empire in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was gotten by Armes and vertue, and that the execution of all iustice resteth in Armes, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth an Empire in that sort gained, to be more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than if it were giuen by election. Besides that, in such triall, the victorious enioyeth it by diuine iudgement. And for example that Empires haue been so iudged, we reade that the <hi>Romanes</hi> being in warre with the <hi>Albanois,</hi> it was by consent of the one and the other people agreed, that three brethren of the one partie called <hi>Horatij,</hi> should fight with three of the enemies who were also brethren, called <hi>Curiatij.</hi> These men being brought together, after long and doubtfull fight, the victorie fell vnto the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the <hi>Albanois</hi> (according vnto agreement) willinglie yeelded their Countrie vnto the <hi>Romanes</hi> gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. On the contrarie may be alleadged, that forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the weldooing of the whole Empire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17517:34"/>
vpon the life of the Emperour, he ought not to fight in person. But this is to bee vnderstood of an Emperour alreadie possessed and inuested, for if the election be doubtfull, then to auoyd a publique warre and effusion of bloud, it seemeth verie reasonable, that two Princes making claime, ought be admitted to triall of Armes, so long as no other title or interest appeareth.</p>

               <p>THe auncient Emperours of <hi>Roome</hi> were of so great puissance, and had vnder them so manie Monarchies and Kingdomes, as well neere the chiefest part of the world was vnto them subiect, and the Princes of those ages were reputed either Subiects, Vassals, or Tributaries vnto the Emperours. In which respect, it was thought vnfit that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour should vouchsafe to fight with any King or Prince of what state or qualitie soeuer. It appeareth also, that the honor and respect borne towards them was excessiue, because the ciuill lawe doth call the Emperour Lord of the world, affirming he hath iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction ouer Kings and all Princes; yea there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not of those, that haue named him GOD vpon the earth, and consequently reasonable that he should refuse to fight in Combat with any King or other Potentate. On the contrarie side may be alleadged, that the dignitie and title of Kings is more auncient, than that of Emperours, and that they haue the like
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17517:34"/>
soueraigntie ouer men. For well we knowe that <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, Romulus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Numa,</hi> gouerned in <hi>Roome</hi> many and many yeares, before that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> vsurped the title of Emperour, Neuertheles, <hi>Lancislao</hi> King of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> challenging the Emperour, was repulsed as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie. It happened also, that another King conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Emperour for the Kingdome of <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the said King did challenge the Emperour to Combat, as before that time <hi>Carlo Martello</hi> the sonne of <hi>Carlo</hi> the second had done for triall of the title of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> which he claimed by discent from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The said King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> (who was then posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) being of person puissant, did condiscend to fight with <hi>Carlo Martello</hi> a young man of twentie yeares, and vnexpert in Armes, yet indeede rightfull heire. These Princes resolued to make triall by Armes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a day certeine, &amp; appoynted the King of <hi>England</hi> to be their Iudge, and they to performe the fight in a certeine Iland of his, which was done, &amp; <hi>Carlo Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello</hi> became victorious, and tooke from the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> King his helmet, which had a cheine hanging at the same, which helmet <hi>Carlo Martello</hi> and all his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors vsed as a badge. But for resolution of this matter thus wee conclude, that Princes or Kings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing dependance of the Empire, may bee repulsed to fight with the Emperour: but a King soueraigne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging no Superiour, and holding his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of GOD and his owne sword onelie, may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge and fight with any Emperour.</p>

               <head>Certeine Questions, Opinions, and iudgements vpon accidents happening in trialls and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Armes. CAP. 5.</head>
               <p n="1">1 IF two men at Armes doo couenant to fight on horsebacke, and runne tenne courses with sharpe Launces, and that hee who worst performeth those courses should be iudged victored &amp; prisoner to the other: It happeneth that at the second course the one of them falleth from his horse, and sodeinlie recouering to horsback offereth to performe the rest of the courses. The question is, whether it be lawfull for him so to doo, or by the fall be reputed a prisoner?</p>
               <p>Whereunto is answered, that in a Challenge for life and death, no man ought bee accompted vanquished vnlesse he bee slaine, or forced with his owne mouth to yeeld or denie those words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the quarrell groweth: yet otherwise it is, when the Challenge or Combat is for Honor onlie, loue of Ladies, or exercise of Armes, because in that case (notwithstanding the Runners bee determined vpon a certeine number of courses) yet if at the first, or after (before those courses bee all performed) any of them doo fall, he that receiueth the fall shall lose the honor, and the other depart with victorie.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Two Gentlemen being come into the field to fight for life, the one in fighting happeneth to fall, the other presentlie sitteth vpon him and saith, yeeld thy selfe; he that lieth vnder, saith like words, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17517:37"/>
woundeth his enemie lying vpon him, who feeling the griefe mortall, striketh the other in the throate; he that was first falne ariseth and walketh, shortlie after they both die; the question is, which of them ought to be iudged victorious?</p>
               <p>Albeit no dead man can require iudgement of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie; yet to the end the honor due vnto the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious may be in signe of his valerous merit bestowed, and the spoyles of the vanquished laid vnder his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, thus it is said. He who first had the bodie of the enemie in his power and vnder, ought be reputed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious: yet may it be alleadged, that the other who gaue the first mortall wound, ought haue the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, because the time thereof &amp; not the time of death is to bee considered. Others are of opinion, that the longer liuer ought to haue victorie: and some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that if the Challenger gaue the first wound whereof death ensued, although himselfe did first die: yet had he performed his part and deserued most praise. Some also doo thinke, there is no iudgement can bee giuen but that the matter should lie dead. Howsoeuer it bee, I leaue the same to more learned Doctors and better experienced Knights.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Two Gentlemen being on horsebacke, the one challengeth the other, the fight being begun, the Challenger alighteth &amp; killeth his enemie; the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether he may so lawfullie doo?</p>
               <p>Thereunto is answered. That if the Challenge were for triall of Honor, Triumph, or sport on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, then is no honor due to him that thus killed his enemie, for that neither of the fighters ought to bee on foote: but in a Combat for life it is otherwise.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17517:37"/>
Sith then it is lawfull aswell for the one as the other to take and vse all meanes, aduantages and subtilties that can be inuented.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Two Gentlemen capitulate to fight on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, &amp; that he who first falleth shall be vanquished. At the first encounter they fall both at one instant; question is, which of them ought be victorious.</p>
               <p>To this case may bee answered, that forsomuch as the Challenger is not onelie to defend himselfe, but also offend &amp; winne victorie, now falling euen with the Defender, he thereby ought be accompted victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for in all doubtfull causes the Defender is most to be fauoured. Others are of minde, that seeing the fall of the Challenger might proceede of his owne force, &amp; not the vertue of the enemie, the iudgement ought lie dead. But the true decision of this question is thus. If the Combat were for triall of Vertue, Loue, or Prize, then ought the Challenger to lose the honor; but if the same were for life, then ought the fight to be performed in one other day by consent of both parties; because in Combats of that kinde no victorie is gained vntill one of the fighters bee either slaine or yeelded, or hath with his owne mouth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the words wherevpon the Combat was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Two Gentlemen determined to fight on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe for life, the one ouerthroweth the other: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe, the enemie commeth vpon him: he that is vnder saith, I yeeld, and at the same instant with his dagger striketh and killeth him that is aboue: the question is, which of them ought be pronounced vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:17517:38"/>Thereunto is said, that forsomuch as the words and deedes of him that liueth, were said and done at one instant, being of contrarie effect, the iudgement ought haue relation vnto the deedes: for oft times words are vttered, diuers from the intent of that is done. But if so be a man doth say, I yeeld, and he vnto whom he yeeldeth doth stay to fight &amp; accept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then shall the sayer be reputed vanquished; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards offending him to whom he is yeelded, for so dooing, he ought bee dishonored and condemned as a Traitor.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Two Gentlemen being agreed to breake certeine Launces for Prize and Honor, the horse of the one happeneth to stumble vpon a broken Launce &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; whether shall he in respect of that fall be iudged to lose the honor?</p>
               <p>To this question, the answere is apparant. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the fall proceeded not from the vertue or force of the aduersary, but by misfortune, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man falne ought to be excused. Notwithstanding, if the fight had been for life, the matter ought receiue other iudgement, seeing in those kind of Combats it is lawfull to take all oportunities and aduantages.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Two Gentlemen determined to fight for life vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon an accusation of treason, whether is it lawfull for the Iudge to depart them, before the Combat be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed &amp; fullie ended? Whereunto may be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that forsomuch as the office of a Iudge, is to giue sentence according to allegations and prooues; it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the Iudge ought in no wise to stay the fight, but permit the Combat to proceede, till the one or the other of the fighters bee either yeelded or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17517:38"/>
slaine, especiallie in quarrells of so heinous weight as is the cause of treason. For <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, who cassed and disanulled all particular Battells and Combats vsed by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> did notwithstanding allow, that vpon quarrell for treason and secret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Combat should bee permitted and graunted by all Princes, because the one was offensiue to God, the other to Prince and Countrie.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Two Gentlemen being come to Combat did co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, that which soeuer of them did giue vnto his enemie most wounds, should be victorious: the one hath his eye put out with a shiuer of a Launce, &amp; the other hath his bodie and armour pearced through: the question is, who ought haue the victorie?</p>
               <p>To that doubt we answere thus. Albeit the eye is a member of much delicacie, and also placed in the head: yet for that the Launce is passed through both breast and back, it must needes bee that he on whom those wounds are, should confesse to receiue most hurt, and consequentlie to lose the honor and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Two Gentlemen being in fight, the one putteth out the eye of his enemie, and he in requitall of that hurt, cutteth off his nose; the question is, who is by those hurts most dishonored?</p>
               <p>It may seeme at the first sight, that losse of an eye is greatest, being a member placed aboue, &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the sight a man prooueth vnfit for all worldlie actions: yet forsomuch as the want of a nose is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie accompted the greatest deformitie, and a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment due for infamous offences, it may bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonablie inferred, that the losse of that feature should
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17517:39"/>
bring with it most dishonor. Besides that, seeing man is made according to the similitude of God, wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt that the face being made more deformed by losse of the nose, than of one eye: therefore the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test honor of this Combat is due vnto him who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the nose of the enemie.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Two Gentlemen in fighting on horsebacke with Launces, the one hath his hand maimed, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his knee and whole legge made lame; which of them ought receiue most honor?</p>
               <p>Hereunto may be said, that the hand being a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber most necessarie for fight, and placed much higher than the legge: therefore the losse thereof is of more importance, &amp; conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie dishonorable. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side is alleadged, that seeing the leg is of as great necessitie, so as without it he is dishabled to serue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on horse or foote: therfore he who becommeth hurt and lame in that part, receiueth most dishonor, and the more for that no Arte can supplie that want, as in the hand it may. But I referre the true deciding of this doubt vnto the wise and learned reader.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Two Gentlemen come to fight for life, the Challenger being left handed is maimed on that ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the other being right handed loseth it; which of them ought receiue most dishonor?</p>
               <p>It seemeth that in this case the losses and harmes are equall; for he who was left handed, being mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on that side, is depriued of that hand which he vsed chieflie, and was no lesse apt for him, than the right hand is vnto the enemie. And sith it is the office of the Challenger not onlie to mainteine but also of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and prooue, in not doing more to preiudice the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17517:39"/>
Defender, than that harme himselfe receiueth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Challenger (although hee loseth but a left hand) is in this case most dishonored. Yet because the exercise of these mens hands were of like necessitie, I thinke (vnder correction) the iudgement ought to rest as indifferent.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Two Gentlemen in performing a Combat on foote, are hurt in places equall; the question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is victorious?</p>
               <p>We haue in the former question said, that where two fighters bee equallie hurt, the Challenger should depart with dishonor, because he hath not prooued that which he tooke in hand, which is to vanquish the Defender. Therefore, the drawing the enemies bloud, and the manner thereof is to bee considered. If then the one be hurt on the right arme, and the other on the left, it may seeme there is none aduantage: for as the right hand is apt to offend in fight, so the left hand is no lesse fit to defend. Notwithstanding, for that the vse of the right hand is both more necessarie and ordinarie, he who is hurt thereof, ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged vnto most dishonor, chieflie in Combat for life. For in the exercise of Armes for honor onlie, the iudgement ought lie dead, or els he shall bee thought victorious that most manfullie performed his part, or that regardeth least the wound, or that most cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doth handle his weapon. The qualitie of the hurts is also to bee considered, which of them is more or lesse mortall, likewise which member is more or lesse to be regarded.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Foure Gentlemen determined to fight on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe for triall of trueth and life, did enter into the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17517:40"/>
Lists: the one partie doo both charge one of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries reputed a man of small force, yet valiantlie defending himselfe, did hurt one of the assailers. And his companion seeing the matter so handled, sodein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie dismounteth, and with his Launce woundeth the other of his enemies in the backe, and forceth the one of them to denie his words: he that denied fleeth out of the Listes, perswading his fellowe being first hurt to abide there, saying it was more honorable to dye within, than without the Listes. He who forced the enemie to flie, pursued him; but not able to take him, a question was mooued which partie ought bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted victorious, because on either partie one was hurt, and the other two went out of the Listes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out license of the Iudge. Whereto may be sayd.</p>
               <p>That he who denied, ought with his companion to lose the Honor. For albeit one of the enemies did also leaue the Lists, yet his entent therein was to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue his foe being fled thence: and forsomuch as the Combat was for matter of Treason, it sufficeth not onlie for the victorious to vanquish the enemie, but also to bring him into the power of the Iudge to bee punished. And it is plaine, that seeing of the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie one was hurt, and the other fled, they ought to be iudged to lose all honor, and be condemned as guiltie of that wherevpon the quarrell was mooued.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Seauen Gentlemen doo compound with seauen other, to runne certeine courses at the Tilt for honor and loue of Ladies; in which match, it happened that fiue of the one partie did commendablie acquite themselues, but the other two of that side were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. On the other side, two onelie performed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17517:40"/>
their courses well, and the rest of that companie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding euill, losing many Launces, and running very foule: whereof a question grewe, whether vnto fiue well doers and two euill, or vnto two weldoers with fiue euill, the honor ought be allotted?</p>
               <p>Albeit in this case much may bee spoken, yet for that the question is not of any particular mans merit, but which partie in generall performed best the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; it may be alleadged, that the partie wherein were most weldoers ought to haue the honor, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the fall of two of their companions: yet forsomuch as to fall from horseback by the enemies force or vertue is most reproachfull, it seemeth that the misaduenture of two men onlie, may reasonablie be the losse of honor to all the rest. And therefore we leaue the iudgement of this doubt vnto wise men, better experienced in Armes.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Two Gentlemen being in Combat for life, the Challenger taketh the sword of the Defender from him, notwithstanding the Defender most valiantlie defendeth himselfe with his arme and hands all the whole day, during which time he could not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced either to denie, yeeld or bee slaine. A question thereupon arose, whether of them was victorious?</p>
               <p>Forsomuch as this Combat was for life, and that in euerie fight of such nature, no victorie is fullie gained vntill the Defender is slaine, or els forced to yeeld or denie; it seemeth that he is not to be iudged guiltie, nor hauing done any of these, although his sword were lost, which indeede in all Martiall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises and feates of Armes is a thing much to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended. But most certeine it is, that in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17517:41"/>
and actions of Armes, for Honor, Loue, &amp; Praise onelie, whosoeuer loseth his sword, must presentlie (also) lose the honor and victorie.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Two Gentlemen fighting for life within the Listes, the one yeeldeth himselfe a prisoner. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may the Prince of the place (who in Combat is elected a Iudge) saue the life of him that is vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed? Hereunto may be answered.</p>
               <p>That albeit euerie prisoner apperteineth vnto his taker, yet hath it commonly been vsed, that the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious haue presented their prisoners vnto the Prince, to bee disposed at his good pleasure, who in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thereof, doo vse (according to the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mindes of such persons) not onelie to pay the charges of the victorious, but also in signe of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and mercie set the infortunate prisoner free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at libertie. As did the noble King <hi>Edward</hi> the third of <hi>England,</hi> vnto <hi>Iohn Visconti,</hi> who in his presence was vanquished by <hi>Thomas de la March</hi> base sonne vnto the <hi>French</hi> King. And <hi>Phillip</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> did the like vnto another infortunate Gentleman van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by a <hi>Neapolitane</hi> Knight.</p>

               <p>IT is written, how at a Triumph in the noble Citie of <hi>Naples,</hi> a Gentleman called the <hi>L. Peter Counte</hi> of <hi>Derise,</hi> receiued so furious an encounter by the Launce of another that ranne against him, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he became at one insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t disarmed of his Shield, his Curats &amp; Headpeece, so as he being vtterly disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was left on horsback in his doublet only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other harme: In requitall whereof, the said <hi>Peter</hi> gaue vnto the other Gentleman so violent a blowe, as therewithall the girths of the horse were broken, and the man cast headlong on the ground. Thereupon a question was mooued, which of them had merited most honor, or rather which of them deserued least reproach? Whereunto was answered absolutelie, that he who fell fro the horse, was most dishonored; for (next vnto death) to fall from the horse is most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull.</p>
               <p>Yet is it lesse disgrace to fall with the horse, than to fall alone: and therefore, albeit a man doth runne neuer so well, if in the end he doth fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the horse, he can by no meanes receiue honor for that day, but shall rather depart with disgrace.</p>
               <p>Who so fighting on foote at Barrier, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>He that on horsebacke directeth his Launce at the head, is more to bee praised, than he that toucheth lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. For the higher the Launce hitteth, the greater is the Runners commendation.</p>
               <p>Who so runneth lowe, is not onelie vnworthie praise, but also meriteth reproach. And he who so ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth his Launce comelie and firme, is more to bee praised, although hee breake not, than hee who mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouerneth his horse, or vnskilfullie handleth his Launce, although he doth breake.</p>
               <p>He that vseth to runne high, sitteth steadelie and moueth least in his course, accompanying his horse euenlie and iustlie, is in running worthie al commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

               <p>He is worthie small estimation, that cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his owne horse, or that sitteth loose in his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: but much is he to bee praised that with his force disordereth his aduersarie in the saddle.</p>
               <p>He that letteth his Launce fall, can claime no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And lesse worthie praise is he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how it should be charged.</p>
               <p>He that breaketh the Launce furiouslie in manie peeces, is more reputed, than he that breaketh it faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in one onlie place.</p>
               <p>He that conueieth his Launce into the Rest in due time, is worthie commendation: but he that carieth it shaking in his hand or vnstaiedlie in the Rest, meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth blame.</p>

                  <p>THe Challenger did commonlie come vnto the East gate of the Listes, and brought with him such Armour as were appoynted by the Court, and wherewith he determined to fight.

They being come to the said gate of the Listes, and beholding the Challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger there, the <hi>Conestable</hi> said. For what cause art thou come hether thus armed, and what is thy name? Vnto whom the Challenger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered thus.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humblie desire this gate may bee opened, and I suffered to performe my intent and purpose.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17517:45"/>
Then the <hi>Conestable</hi> did open the visor of his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece to see his face, and thereby to knowe that man to be he who makes the Challenge.</p>
                  <p>These Ceremonies ended, the <hi>Conestable</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the gate of the Lists to be opened, whereat the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med man with his necessaries and councell entered.

                  <p>In like manner, the Defender being appeared, did make request vnto the <hi>Conestable</hi> &amp; <hi>Marshall,</hi> desiring they would bee pleased to deliuer and discharge his pledges. Wherevpon the said <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshal</hi> did humblie desire the King to release them, because the Defender is alreadie come, and presented before his Maiestie, there to performe his duetie. But in case the Defender did not come at time conuenient in the day appointed, then did the King deliuer his pleasure vnto the <hi>Conestable,</hi> and he report the same vnto the <hi>Marshall,</hi> who forthwith did giue order vnto his <hi>Liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,</hi> that the Defender should be presentlie called to appeare by the <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Herehaults</hi> in the <hi>South,</hi> called <hi>Clarentieux:</hi> and in case the <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haults</hi> of the King in the <hi>South</hi> were not present, then was the proclamation made by some other <hi>Herehault</hi> of King <hi>Clarentieux.</hi> But if the Combat were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the <hi>North,</hi> on the other side of the <hi>Riuer</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the circuite of the King <hi>Norre</hi>; then was his <hi>Marshall</hi> to make proclamation.

                  <p>This Proclamation was made thrice at euerie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Lists: but if at the second time, the partie appeared not, then the <hi>Herehault</hi> did add these words <hi>The day passeth, and therefore come without delay.</hi> And if in case the said Defendant appeared not before noone, but staied vntill the third houre after, then did the <hi>Herehault</hi> by commandement of the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall,</hi> in the beginning of the Proclamation say, <hi>A.G.</hi> appeare in hast &amp; saue thine honor, for the day is well neere spent, wherein thou diddest promise to performe thine enterprize. It was also vsed that the <hi>Conestable</hi> his Clarke, should in a booke record the houre of the fighters appearing within the Listes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on foote or on horsebacke, in what sort they were armed, of what colour the horses were, &amp; how they were in all poynts furnished.</p>
                  <p>It was also auncientlie vsed, that the <hi>Conestable</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the King in fauour of the Fighters, and knowe whether his Maiestie were pleased to appoynt any of his Nobilitie or other seruants of reputation, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them in Combat.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> did suruay the Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and other weapons, wherewith the Combat should bee performed, making them equall and of euen measure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conestable</hi> also appoynted two Knights or Squires vnto the Challenger, to keepe the place free from impediments; the like was also done for the Defender.</p>

                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:17517:46"/>The <hi>Conestable</hi> did also mooue the King, to knowe whether his Maiestie in person would take the othes of the Fighters, or giue him and the <hi>Marshall</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to doo it out of his presence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conestable</hi> also did send the <hi>Marshall</hi> vnto the Challenger and his councell to make readie his oath, declaring that after that ceremonie all protestations should be voyd.</p>
                  <p>After these preparations, the <hi>Conestable</hi> caused his Clarke to bring foorth the booke, wherevpon the Combatters were solemnelie sworne.</p>

That done, they were both sent backe to their places of entrie.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The third Oath was thus.</head>
                  <p>THe Combatters being againe called, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the <hi>Conestable</hi> to take one the other by the hand, and lay their left hands vpon the booke: which done, the <hi>Conestable</hi> said.

                  <p>The verie same oath in like manner vsed was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto the Defender, and that done, the Fighters returned vnto their places, friends and councellers.</p>
                  <p>These ceremonies ended, an <hi>Herehault</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall,</hi> did make proclamation at foure corners of the Lists thus. <hi>Oiez, Oiez.</hi> We charge and commande in the name of the King, the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshal,</hi> that no man of what state, title, or degree soeuer, shall approach the Listes neerer than foure foote in distance, nor shall vtter any speach, word, voyce or countenance, whereby either the Challenger or Defender may take aduantage vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17517:47"/>
paine of losse of life, liuing and goods to be taken at the Kings good pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Then the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> assigned a place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient within the Lists, where the King of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haults</hi> and their officers should stand and bee readie if they were called: for afterwards al things were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, aswell on the behalfe of the Defender as the Challenger, as if any thing were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in their confessions, either touching their lands or consciences: or that any of them desired to eate or drinke. All those lacks were supplied by the <hi>Herehaults</hi> and none other. But here is to bee noted, that no meate or drinke might bee giuen vnto the Challenger, without leaue first asked of the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, who did not denie the request. And after, the <hi>Herehault</hi> ought goe vnto the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> and make them priuie, to desire their fauour, that the Fighters might eate, drinke, or ease their bodies.</p>
                  <p>After these orders taken, the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi> did auoyd the Listes of all sorts of persons, saue onlie one Knight and two Esquires armed, to attend on the <hi>Conestable,</hi> and the like number to await on the <hi>Marshall,</hi> either of them hauing in his hand a Launce without head readie to depart the Fighters, if the King did command. Of more auncient time the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall,</hi> were vsed to haue certeine <hi>Liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants</hi> and seruants within the Listes. Also the one part to keepe order on one side, &amp; the others to looke vnto the other side. And if the Queene happened to behold the Combat, then the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> awaited on the Kings side, and their <hi>Liutenants</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Queene.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:17517:47"/>Then did the <hi>Conestable</hi> alone, sitting downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, as his Vicar generall, send his Liute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Challenger to come vnto him, and the <hi>Marshall</hi> with his Liutenant did accompanie the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>The <hi>Conestable</hi> thus set, did pronounce this speach with a loude voyce: <hi>Let them go, let them go, let them go and doo their best.</hi> Vpon which words pronounced
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17517:48"/>
in the Kings presence, the Challenger did march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Defender to assaile him furiouslie, and the other prepared himselfe for defence soberlie. In the meane time, the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> with their Liutenants stood attentiue to heare and see if any words, signe, or voyce of yeelding were vttered by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Fighters, and also to bee readie if the King should command the Launces to bee let fall to depart the fight.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> did also take regard, that the Challenger and Defender should appeare at the day and houre appoynted, whether the quarrell were for treason or otherwise.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conestable</hi> did likewise measure the weapons of the Combattors, and also search whether they had about them any engin, or other vnlawfull things, as Charmes or Inchauntment: yet was it lawfull both for the Challenger and Defender, to bee aswell and surelie armed as they could. And if any of them would haue his Sword shorter than the Standerd, yet was not the other bound to haue his cut to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if he required that fauour of the Court. But if either the one or the others Sword passed the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd, then was that inequalitie to be reformed: or if they were both ouerlong, both ought be reformed.</p>
                  <p>It had been also in more ancient time vsed, that the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall,</hi> should foresee, that if the Kings pleasure was to depart the fight, and suffer the Fighters to rest, before the Combat ended, that they should bee parted in due time, when no aduauntage were. Likewise, that they should take heed that none of them should priuatlie speake vnto the other of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17517:48"/>
yeelding, or otherwise. For vnto the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> apperteined the witnessing and record of all things.</p>
                  <p>And in case the Combat were for question of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he that was vanquished should bee foorthwith disarmed within the Lists, by commandement of the <hi>Conestable</hi> and the <hi>Marshall.</hi> The said Armour and weapons of the vanquished, in one end of the Lists was defaced in his disgrace, and after, the same was drawne out together with his horse. From thence also the man vanquished was drawne vnto the place of execution to bee there headed or hanged, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the custome of the Countrie. The perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all which punishment, apperteined onlie to the <hi>Marshall,</hi> who ought see all things done in his owne presence. And in case the Challenger did not vanquish his enemie, then ought he suffer the same paines that are due vnto the Defender, if he were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished. But if the quarrell were vpon a crime of lesse importance, the partie vanquished, should not bee drawne vnto the place of execution, but onelie led thether to receiue death or other punishment, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the custome and qualitie of the matter.</p>
                  <p>If the Combat were onelie for triall of vertue, or honor, he that was vanquished therein, should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed and put out of the Lists without further pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
                  <p>If it happened that the King would take the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell into his hand, and make peace betweene the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without longer fight. Then did the <hi>Conestable</hi> leade the one, and the <hi>Marshall</hi> the other of the figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters out of the Lists, at diuers gates, armed and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17517:49"/>
as they were, hauing speciall regard that neither of them should go the one before the other. For the quarrell resting in the Kings hand, might not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, or any violence offered without preiudice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings honor. And because it is a poynt verie speciall in matters of Armes, that he who leaueth the Lists first, incurreth a note of dishonor: therefore to depart the Lists in due time was euer preciselie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, were the Combat for treason or other cause whatsoeuer.</p>
                  <p>It is also to bee remembered, that without the principall Lists, were euer certeine Counterlists, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which two, the seruants of the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> did stand. There stood also the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iants at Armes, to see and consider if any default, or offence were committed contrarie to the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Court, against the Kings royall Maiestie, or the lawe of Armes. Those men were euer armed at all peeces.</p>
                  <p>The seruants of the <hi>Conestable</hi> and <hi>Marshall</hi> had charge of the place, and good order thereof. The Kings Seriants tooke care to keepe the gates of the Lists, and be there readie to make arest of any person, when they should bee commanded by the <hi>Conestable</hi> or <hi>Marshall.</hi> The fees of the <hi>Marshall</hi> were all Horses, peeces of Armour, or other furniture that fell to the ground after the Combattors did enter into the Lists, aswell from the Challenger as the Defender. But all the rest apperteined to the partie victorious, whether he were Challenger or Defender.</p>

                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:17517:49"/>The Barres, Posts, Railes, and euerie other part of the Lists were also the fees of the <hi>Marshall.</hi>

The manner whereof in briefe, was thus.</p>
                  <p>It pleased her Maiestie (according to her Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie custome in receiuing of noble strangers) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite vnto supper the Duke <hi>Momorancie</hi> chiefe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall of <hi>France,</hi> at that time come hether to take the honourable Order of the <hi>Garter.</hi> This magnificent supper ended, it pleased her Highnesse (the weather being warme) to walke out of her Chamber into the open Tarrace, whether also (awaiting on her) went the said Duke, and all others of the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie, with the Ambassadours, Lords and Ladies of this Court. At her Maiesties comming to the North side of the Tarrace, there were prepared and set rich Chaires, Cushions and Carpets. In which place it pleased her to stay, intertaining most gratiouslie the said Duke &amp; other noble strangers. Next vnto them were placed the Ladies, Lords Counsellors and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persons of reputation, according to their degrees and conueniencie of the roume. So as the said Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race was on all sides beset with Lords, Ladies, and persons of qualitie sumptuouslie apparelled and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie furnished, and among them (both aboue and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) stood manie of the Guard in their rich coates, holding an infinite number of Torches: and so in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17517:55"/>
the preaching place: by which meane, to those that beheld the Tarrace in this sort furnished, they dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it rather a Theater celestiall, than a Pallace of earthlie building.</p>
                  <p>The place with this royall presence replenished, sodeinlie entered the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and with him twelue Gentlemen armed at al peeces and wel moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Earle and his horse was furnished with white cloath of siluer, and the rest in white sattin, who (after reuerence done to her Maiestie) marched to the East side of the Court, &amp; there in troope stood firme. Forthwith entred the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> with a like number in like sort armed and apparelled all in blewe, and hauing presented his reuerence staied on the West end. Before either of these Bands one Chariot was drawne, and therein a faire Damsell conducted by an armed Knight, who presented cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine speeches in the French tung vnto her Maiestie. These Ceremonies past, the Queene commanded the armed men to fall vnto fight, which was performed with great courage &amp; commendation, chiefly in the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> a noble personage, valerous in Armes, and all other waies of great vertue. Trulie, this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was meruailouslie magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; appeared a sight exceeding glorious to those that wer below looking vpward to the Tarrace, wher her Maiestie, the Lords and Ladies stood, so pompously apparailed, Iewelled and furnished as hardly can bee seen the like in anie Christian Court; as my selfe and other the Actors (at occasions staying from fight) with great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did behold and thinke.</p>

Whereunto wee added some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular examples of certeine Combats for life perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by persons of honor within this land: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise haue noted the actions most glorious in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs brought before the Princes of this realme.

               <list>
                  <item>1 First, he ought be of good constitution in bodie, and conuenient strength to suffer trauell, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the actions apperteining to a man of Armes.</item>
                  <item>2 Secondly, he should be well fauoured of face and comelie: for commonlie GOD and Nature giueth beautie to such persons as are destined to command, and from others borne to obay they haue withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that fauour. Which mooued some writers to affirme, that the princelie presence of <hi>Priamus</hi> did shewe him to bee worthie of gouernment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand other men.</item>
                  <item>3 Thirdly, he should be of bold aspect, rather incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to seueritie than softnesse: which countenance the <hi>Swisses</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> doo much affect.</item>
                  <item>4 Fourthly, he must be sober and discreet; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to vaine delights or effeminate pleasures.</item>
                  <item>5 Fiftlie, that he be obedient. For of obedience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth that the meaner are content to bee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the better, and the ignorant by those that know. This vertue was greatlie imbraced of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> and occasioned their often victories: and at this day is well obserued among the <hi>Turkes.</hi> And of the punishment for disobedience towards the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie Magistrates, the <hi>Romanes</hi> haue left two most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table examples; the one of <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> who caused his owne sonne for that fault to be slaine, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

he had vanquished the enemie. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Papirius</hi> the Dictator, who for the like offence was punished by <hi>Fabius Rutilius</hi> Generall of the hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the <hi>Romane</hi> Armie.</item>
                  <item>6 Sixtly, he ought bee vigilant and patient: for in the one consisteth the execution of warlike actions: by the other all trauailes, paines, and misfortunes are indured.</item>
                  <item>7 Seuenthly, he must be faithfull and loyall, which qualitie is required in all sorts of subiects, but chiefly in Soldiers, for thereupon dependeth his Princes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie and state also: which mooued <hi>Vigetius</hi> to say that the safetie of a Prince consisted in well choosing his Soldiers. Which is the cause that men professing Armes, doo commonlie sweare by the faith of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier: the <hi>French</hi> man, <hi>a foy de Soldat:</hi> the <hi>Italian, a fe di Soldato, &amp;c.</hi> Yea the Kings of <hi>France</hi> do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vse this phrase, <hi>a foy de gentil home: a foy du chiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi>
                  </item>

                  <item>9 Ninthly, that hee should bee charitable, because warres are not taken in hand for the destruction of Countries and townes, but the defence of the lawes and people.</item>
                  <item>Lastly, that he should be fortunate, sith Fortune is the Ladie of Armies, because she sheweth her vertue in nothing more, than in the aduentures of warre.</item>

               <head>Of Knighthood. CAP. 2.</head>
               <p>FOrsomuch as in these former bookes wee haue discoursed the poynts of Honor, and in what sort the exercises of Armes haue been vsed in <hi>England</hi>; it shall not be amisse but rather necessarie to speake of Knighthood; which dignitie was at the beginning giuen chieflie for seruice in Armes and valiant enterprises. Our meaning therefore is, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the originall occasion of the name of Knight, and how many orders and degrees of Knighthood there are or haue been in Christendome. For perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof, it behoueth to knowe that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> (among whom Martiall Discipline was first knowne, and names giuen to men for valerous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite) diuided their people into <hi>Patritij</hi> and <hi>Plebei.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time, another diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made, as, <hi>Senatores, Equites</hi> and <hi>Plebs.</hi> As the <hi>French</hi> haue at this day <hi>Les nobles &amp; la populaire, or gentils homes &amp; villains.</hi> And wee in <hi>England</hi> diuide our men into foure sorts, <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilmen, Citizens, Yeomen, Artificers</hi> and <hi>Labourers.</hi> Of Gentlemen, the first and principall is the King, the Prince, Dukes, Marquises, Earles, Viconts, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons. These are the Nobilitie, and be called Lords or Noblemen. Next to these bee Knights, Esquires, and simple Gentlemen: which last number may be called <hi>Nobilitas minor:</hi> for they in Parliament haue no place among the Lords. Therefore the Barons or degree of Lords doo resemble the dignitie of Senators in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the title of our Nobilitie is like vnto the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17517:61"/>
                  <hi>Patritij,</hi> when the <hi>Patritij</hi> did signifie <hi>Senatores aut Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorum filij.</hi> But that degree which we doo now call Knighthood, is most like vnto the title in <hi>Rome</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Equestris ordo</hi>: yet other opinions there are both of the beginning and name of Knight, as wel among the <hi>Italians</hi> as the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But howsoeuer it was, most certeine it seemeth, that vntil <hi>Equestris ordo</hi> was erected in <hi>Rome,</hi> there was no such degree of men as we call Knights, neither was that name giuen with such ceremonie and shewe of dignitie, as since hath been vsed. Yet some there are that faile not to affirme that Knighthood had the originall from <hi>Romulus,</hi> in this sort.</p>
               <p>That King hauing setled his Gouernment in <hi>Rome,</hi> partlie for securitie, &amp; partlie for magnificence erected three Bands of Horsemen, the first called <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence</hi> after his owne name, the next <hi>Titience,</hi> after <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tatio,</hi> and the third <hi>Luceria,</hi> whereof only I thinke <hi>Liuie</hi> maketh mention. Hereupon they will inferre that Knighthood begun vnder <hi>Romulus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> doo hold opinion, that when faith and plaine dealing decaied, those men that made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of warre, euerie thousand did choose but one man whom they thought to bee of greatest wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, courage and curtesie among the rest. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, they made choise of such an horse as was reputed to excell the rest for beautie, force, and other perfections, and forthwith gaue that beast vnto that man whom they had chosen, as though their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were to conioyne that singular beast vnto that notable man, naming him <hi>Caualiero,</hi> which signifieth Horseman, though we improperly english it Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:17517:62"/>Thus much is said in generall concerning Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that make profession of Armes, whom the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> (as it seemeth) sometimes called <hi>Milites,</hi> and some other times <hi>Equites.</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards Caualieri:</hi> the <hi>French, Cheualiers.</hi> But in our language (as is now vsed) none are called Knights, but onelie they that haue that title giuen by the Prince, or his Lieutenant, with a ceremonie thereunto belonging. And of Knights made according to the vse of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are diuers degrees: as shall hereafter be declared.</p>

               <p>IT is affirmed by some writers, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, with the aduise of his learned tutor <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> resolued to bestowe vppon such persons as had done any notable seruice in the warre, some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and degree, in token of extraordinarie vertue and notable merite: and therefore gaue vnto some Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to some Cheines, to some Priuileges, and other such like demonstrations of honor.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours in like manner, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before the beginning of a seruice, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after, bestowed not onlie commendation, but also dignities on those whose vertue they thought so worthie: as Crownets of Bayes, of Gold, of Myrtill, or some other thing, as was thought fit to the giuers. They gaue also Horses, Swords, Armours, arming
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17517:66"/>
Garments, &amp; such like: and they that receiued them, in token of Honor kept them carefullie in perpetuall memorie of their owne valour, and the honor of that Prince who gaue them. By this meane also they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came much admired and esteemed of all other Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, for more incouragement of vertuous minds, other Princes thought meete that the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acts of Soldiers should be in perpetual memorie written, and such Priuileges as were giuen, to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, calling them in those writings valiant men, companions in Armes, victorious Soldiers and Knights. Which manner of proceeding did animate the men of warr no lesse, than the great pourtraitures which the old <hi>Romanes</hi> were wont to make for those that had performed egregious acts.</p>
               <p>Touching the making of Knights, we say, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Prince soueraine hath power to giue that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to what person it pleaseth him, as well in peace as warre. But here is to be noted, that the Knights made, are of more or lesse reputation, according to the qualitie of that Prince that maketh them: for he that is made Knight by a King, shall bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Knight made by a Prince of meaner title. Wherefore to conclude, wee say, that an Emperour, Kings, Dukes, and other Princes, acknowledging no superiour, may make Knights: and so may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales, as the <hi>Venetian</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> States. The Popes also doo take vppon them to make Knights for monie, calling them commonlie after their owne names: <hi>Cauallieri di San Petro, San Paulo, Giuliani, Pij, &amp;c.</hi>

               <head>The manner of making Knights, about the yere of our Lord. 1020. CAP. 4.</head>
               <p>IN that age, a Prince determining to make a Knight, caused a high scaffold to bee built in some Cathedrall Church of his kingdome, or other spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious place neere vnto it. Thether the Gentleman was brought to receiue that honor. Being come, he was foorthwith set vpon a Chaire of siluer couered with greene silke. Then was demanded of him, <hi>if he were healthie in bodie, and able to endure the exercises re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Soldier.</hi> Also, <hi>whether he were a man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest conuersation, and what witnesses worthie credite he could produce to answere for him.</hi> This being done, the Bishop or chiefe officer of that Church tooke the Bible, and holding it open before the newe Knight, in the presence of the King and all others, spake these words, saying. <hi>Sir, you that desire to receiue the order of Knighthood, sweare before God and by this holie Bible, that ye shall neuer fight against this mightie and excellent Prince that bestoweth the order of Knighthood vpon you, vnlesse ye shall be occasioned so to doo in the seruice of your owne King and naturall Prince: for in that case (hauing first yeelded vp the Coller; deuise, and other Ensignes of Honor now receiued) it shall bee lawfull for you to serue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, without reproach or offence to all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in Armes: but otherwise dooing you shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre infamie, and being taken in warre, shall bee subiect to the paines of death.</hi> Ye shall also sweare, <hi>with all your force &amp; power to mainteine and defend al Ladies, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17517:67"/>
Orfants, widowes, women distressed and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. The like ye must doo for wiues being desired, and shunne no aduenture of your person in euerie good warre wherein ye happen to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This oath taken, two of the chiefe Lords led him vnto the King, who presentlie drew forth his Sword and laied the same vpon his head, and said: <hi>God and S. George</hi> (or what other Saincts the King pleased to name) <hi>make thee a good Knight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then came vnto the Knight seuen noble maidens attired in white, and girt his Sword vnto his side.</p>
               <p>That being done, foure Knights of the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable in that presence put on his Spurres.</p>
               <p>These ceremonies past, the Queene tooke him by the right arme, and a Dutchesse by the left, and led him vnto a rich seate made on high, and thereupon set him: the King sitting downe on the one hand, and the Queene on the other.</p>
               <p>After the King and Queene were thus set, and the newe Knight betweene them, al the rest of the Lords and Ladies set them downe also vppon other seates prepared for them, three dissents vnder the Kings seate.</p>
               <p>Euerie Lord and Ladie being in this sort placed, thether was brought a solemne Collation or Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of delicate meates, whereof the Knight, the King, the Queene, and the whole companie did eate. And so the Ceremonie ended.</p>

               <head>The order of disgrading of Knights in those daies. CAP. 5.</head>
               <p>IF any Knight had in that time been corrupted with monie by his Princes enemie, or committed any other notable fault against loyaltie and honor, the other Knights forthwith made humble suite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King that he might bee punished. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest being granted, they apprehended the offender, and caused him to bee armed from head to foote, in such sort as if he should go to the field. Which done, they led him vp to an high stage made in a Church for that purpose, where were thirteene Priestes say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those praiers ordinarily vsed at Burials, as though that Knight had lien dead at their feete. At the end of euerie Psalme they tooke from him one peece of his Armour. First, <hi>they tooke off his Helmet as that which defended his traiterous eyes,</hi> then <hi>his Gauntlet on the right side as that which couered a corrupt hand:</hi> then <hi>the Gauntlet of the left hand, as from a member consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> And so by peecemeale dispoyled him of all his Armes, as well offensiue as defensiue, which one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another were throwne to the ground: and at the instant when euery part of Armour was cast downe, the King of Armes first, and after him all the other Herehaults cried aloud, saying: <hi>This is the Helmet of a disloyall and miscreant Knight.</hi> Then was brought thether a Bason of gold or siluer full of warme water: which being holden vp, the Herehaults with a loud voyce, sayd: <hi>What is this Knights name?</hi> The Purse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17517:68"/>
answered that which in trueth was his name. Then the King of Armes sayd. <hi>That is not true, for he is a miscreant and false traitor, and such a one as hath broken the ordinance of Knighthood.</hi> Thereunto answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Chaplins. <hi>Let vs giue him his right name.</hi> Then spake the Trompets. <hi>What shall be done with him?</hi> To which words the King answered: <hi>Let him bee with dishonor and shame banished my kingdome, as a vile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous man that hath done offence against the honor of Knighthood.</hi> When the King had so said, the King of Armes and other Herehaults cast the warme water on the disgraded Knights face (as though he were a new baptized) saying: <hi>Hencefoorth thou shalt be called by thy right name Traitor.</hi> Then the King together with twelue other Knights put vppon them mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning garments declaring sorowe: and comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Knight disgraded put him downe the stage, not by the staiers he mounted vp, when he was made Knight, but threwe him downe tyed vnto a rope. Then with great ignomie he was brought vnto the Altar, and there laied groueling on the ground, and ouer him was read a Psalme full of curses.</p>
               <p>These were the Ceremonies vsed at the degradatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Knights in the time of <hi>Sir Tristram, Sir Lancelot,</hi> and other famous Knights, who were (no doubt) men very valiant in Armes: but by meanes of writers that haue added vnto their acts many vntruths, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse and enterprises are holden as fables.</p>

               <head>Other degrees of Knighthood in England. CAP. 8.</head>
               <p>THree other sorts of Knights there are in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> but because they weare no garment, badge or signe to shewe the difference of their degree from other Gentlemen, they are not noted or known to strangers for Knights. Yet among our selues wee knowe them right well: for euerie man hauing that dignitie is called <hi>Sir.</hi> As <hi>Sir Thomas, Sir Iohn, Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here is to be noted, that Knights are not borne, but made, either before a Battaile to encourage them to aduenture their liues, or after the fight, as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement for their valour then shewed: or out of warre they are made for some notable seruice done, or some good hope of vertues that doo appeare in them.</p>
               <p>These Knights are made either by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or by his commission and royall authoritie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for that purpose, or by his Liutenant in the wars, who hath his royall &amp; absolute power for that time. And this order may be resembled to that which the <hi>Romanes</hi> called <hi>Equites Romanos,</hi> differing in a sort, but in some other sort doth agree with it: for seldome in all poynts one Common wealth doth agree with an other, nor long any State accordeth with it selfe. <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes Romani</hi> were chosen <hi>ex Censu,</hi> which is according to their substance and riches: Euen so be Knights in <hi>England</hi> for the most part, according to the yearely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenew
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17517:65"/>
of their lands, being able to mainteine that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: yet all they that had <hi>Equestrem Censum,</hi> were not in <hi>Rome Equites:</hi> no more are all Knights in <hi>England</hi> that may dispend a Knights land or fee, but they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to whom it pleaseth the King to giue that honor. In <hi>Rome</hi> the number of <hi>Equites</hi> was vncerteine, and so is it of Knights in <hi>England</hi> at the pleasure of the Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Equites Romani</hi> had <hi>Equum publicum,</hi> but the Knights of <hi>England</hi> find horses themselues both in peace and warre. <hi>Census Equester</hi> among the <hi>Romanes</hi> was at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times of diuers valewe: but in <hi>England,</hi> who so euer may dispend of his free lands fortie pounds star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of yearely reuenew, by an old lawe, either at the Coronation of the King, or mariage of his daughter, or at the dubbing of the Prince, Knight, or some such great occasion, may bee by the King compelled to take that order and honor, or to pay a fine: which many rich men, not so desirous of honor as of riches, had rather disburse. Some also who for good respect are not thought worthie that title, and yet haue abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, neither bee made Knights though they would, and yet pay the fine of fortie pounds starling, which (as siluer is now prised) is 120. pound currant monie. Wherof this word <hi>Knight</hi> is deriued: or whether it signifieth no more but that which <hi>Miles</hi> doth in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, which is Soldier, I know not. Some hold opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the word <hi>Soldier</hi> doth betoken a waged or hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red man to fight. <hi>Caesar</hi> in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> called <hi>Soldiers,</hi> men deuoted and sworne by band or oath to serue the Capteine: which order if the <hi>Almaines</hi> did followe, it may bee that they who were not hiered,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17517:65"/>
but being of the Nation vppon their owne charges and for their aduancement, and by such common oath and band that did followe the warre, were (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) called <hi>Knights</hi> or <hi>Milites:</hi> and now among the <hi>Almaines</hi> some are called <hi>Lance-Knights,</hi> as Soldiers not hiered, although they bee well neere all hiered. Or it may bee that they which were next about the Prince, as his Gard and seruants, picked and choyse men out of the rest, being called in the <hi>Almaine</hi> tung <hi>Knighten,</hi> which is as much to say as Seruants: these men being found of good seruice, the word after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was taken for an Honor, &amp; for a man that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth Armes. Now our language is so altered, that hard it were to giue iudgement thereof. But sure it is, wee in our English doo call him <hi>Knight,</hi> whom the French doo call <hi>Cheualier,</hi> and the Latin <hi>Equitem,</hi> or <hi>Equestris ordinis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the making of these <hi>English</hi> Knights: the manner is this. Hee that is to be made Knight, is striken by the Prince with a Sword drawne, vpon his backe or shoulder: the Prince saying, <hi>Soys Cheualier,</hi> and in times past was added <hi>S. George.</hi> And when the Knight riseth, the Prince saith, <hi>Auancé.</hi> This is the manner of dubbing Knights at this present: and that terme dubbing was the old terme in this poynt, and not creating. These sorts of Knights, are by the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haults called <hi>Knights Batchelers.</hi>

               <figure/>
               <p>THe number of Knights that were at the first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into this Order was 31. who ought bee of noble bloud, men of good merite, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproach.</p>
               <p>The chiefe or head of this companie, is he vnto whom the succession of the Dukedome of <hi>Burgondy</hi> doth lawfullie discend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:17517:71"/>Whosoeuer entereth into this Order, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all other Orders of Knighthood of euerie Prince, Companie or Religion. Yet out of that lawe are excepted all Emperours, Kings and Dukes, vnto whom is dispensed, that they may weare the Badge of this Order, if they bee chiefe and Soueraines of their owne Order. But to the end the truth may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, a generall Counsell of Knights shall bee called to consent vnto that dispensation.</p>
               <p>The Soueraine of this Order, hath authoritie himselfe alone to giue and bestowe the Ensigne of the Order: which is a Coller of gold, wherein are the Armes of <hi>Burgondie,</hi> hauing the <hi>Toson</hi> of gold hanging thereat. This Coller, the Soueraine and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of the Knights is bound to weare daylie, and failing thereof shall incurre a penaltie. But in time of warre or great affaires, to weare the <hi>Toson</hi> onlie shall suffice. Or if by mishap the Cheine doo breake, it is lawfull for mending thereof it may be carried to the Goldsmith. Or if any Knight trauailing by the way shall doubt to be robbed, he may without offence lay by or hide his Cheine. Yet is it not lawfull to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the quantitie of the said Cheine, nor adde thereunto any other stones or workmanship, and most of all it is vnlawfull to sell it, engage it, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change it.</p>
               <p>These and many other Statutes and ordinances the Knights of this noble Order are sworne to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and keepe. And many of them haue been sith the first institution enlarged, altered, or taken away by the Soueraines of the said Order.</p>
               <p>The day of assemblie for these Knights, was at the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17517:71"/>
first institution appoynted on the feast of <hi>S. Andrew,</hi> but sithence altered vnto the second of May, and that but once in three yeares, vnlesse it shall please the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine otherwise to command.</p>
               <p>To this Order doo belong foure principall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. That is, a Chauncelor, a Threasurer, a Register, a King of Armes named <hi>Toson d'oro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first inuenter of the <hi>Impresa</hi> belonging to the Order of the <hi>Toson,</hi> was <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgondie,</hi> whose great valour brought the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> the xj. into much trouble and warre, as <hi>Monsier de Argenton</hi> writeth.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Impresa</hi> or deuise was an Instrument made to strike fire, with these words: <hi>Ante ferit, quam flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma micet.</hi> Meaning, he had power to kindle great warre, as indeed he had. But his warres had vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie euent. For hauing in hand a warre against <hi>Lorayn</hi> and the <hi>Swisses,</hi> after the defeate of <hi>Morat</hi> and <hi>Grau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> he was vtterlie ouerthrowne and slaine before <hi>Nansi,</hi> the euen of the <hi>Epiphany.</hi> Wherevpon <hi>Renato</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorayn</hi> being victorious, and seeing a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd of Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> with the <hi>Impresa</hi> of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire, said. <hi>That vnhappie Prince when hee had most neede to warme him, wanted leisure to strike fire.</hi> Which speach was verie pithie; and the more, for that the earth was then couered with Snowe, and by reason of the conflict full of bloud. At that time was the greatest frost and cold that any liuing man could remember.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Toson</hi> which these Knights doo weare hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their collers of the Order, is the forme of a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fleece, expounded to bee like vnto the Fleece of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17517:72"/>
gold which <hi>Iason</hi> wonne at <hi>Colchos.</hi> Others suppose it to bee the Fleece of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> whereof is made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in holie Scripture: which signifieth, <hi>Fidelitie</hi> or <hi>Iustice</hi> vncorrupted.</p>
               <p>The number of these Knights was much encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift: who hauing in hand the Dukedome of <hi>Burgondie,</hi> elected into that Order persons of greater qualitie than were at the first, and would haue that the election should bee by consent. And after him King <hi>Phillip</hi> did the like.</p>
               <p>Here is to bee noted, that albeit Duke <hi>Charles</hi> did inuent the <hi>Impresa:</hi> yet the Creation was begun af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Duke <hi>Phillip,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Le bon:</hi> at such time as he called a generall assemblie of the States at the <hi>Hage</hi> in <hi>Holland. Anno.</hi> 1456.</p>

               <head>Of the Order of <hi>S. Michael.</hi> CAP. 10.</head>
               <figure/>
               <p>IN the yeare 1469. <hi>Lewis</hi> the xj. then <hi>French</hi> King erected an Order of Knighthood, whereinto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, with others the most principall Peeres of <hi>France</hi> did enter.</p>
               <p>It is said, the occasion which mooued the King to intitle this Order with the name of <hi>S. Michael,</hi> was the memorie of an apparition of that Sainct vpon the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17517:74"/>
bridge of <hi>Orleance,</hi> when that Citie was assailed by the <hi>English:</hi> at which time liued a certeine Maiden called <hi>Ioane,</hi> a woman so rare of wit and valiant in Armes, as was reputed more than a mortall creature, or rather some Inchantresse of singuler knowledge. This I find written: but in that time of Superstition easie it was to induce the people to beleeue things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</p>
               <p>This Order is also ornefied with a great Coller, whereat hangeth the Image of <hi>S. Michael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words apperteining thereunto are these: <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensi tremor Oceani.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Soueraine of this Order is the <hi>French</hi> King and his successors.</p>
               <p>The number of Knights that ought bee admitted into the said Order is 36. But of late yeares that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance hath been broken, and the number so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, as thereby the Order is become of small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: yet is it thought that the Coller appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the said Order is giuen onelie to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber aforesaid: although the <hi>Michael</hi> is bestowed on many. But sure it is that the intent of that King was to make choyse onelie of the most noble personages of his owne bloud, and of others who for vertue and honor were holden worthie, as by the first election appeared: who were these.</p>

               <head>Knights of the Band. CAP. 12.</head>
               <p>THis Order was first erected by <hi>Alfonso</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> sonne to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and Queene <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanza</hi> in the yeare 1268. And to giue the sayd Knighthood reputation &amp; honor, the King himselfe, with his sonnes and brethren vouchsafed to enter thereinto: with them were also admitted diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen of best qualitie and greatest estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The cause that mooued the King to name them Knights of the <hi>Band,</hi> was, for that he commanded e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man elected into the Order, should weare a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine red scarffe or lace of silke the breadth of three inches, which hung on their left shoulder, and was tyed vnder the right arme.</p>
               <p>No man might enter into this Knighthood, but such as the King did speciallie admit: neither was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie person capable of that dignitie, vnlesse he were the sonne of a Knight, or some Gentleman of great accompt, or at the least such a one as had serued the King by the space of tenne yeares in his Court, or in the warre against the <hi>Moores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Into this Order no Gentleman could bee receiued being an elder brother, or an heire in possession or apparance, but onelie such as were yonger, without land and liueload; because the Kings intention was to aduance the Gentlemen of his Court that had not of their owne.</p>
               <p>At such time as any Gentleman was admitted a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17517:77"/>
Knight, he promised to obserue these Articles follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, which I haue thought good particularlie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, &amp; the rather because they tend onlie to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the minds of men in the offices of Courage and Courtesie, without any mixture of superstition, whereof almost al other Orders in those daies tasted.</p>
               <p>First, that he should speake vnto the King for the commoditie of the Common wealth &amp; the defence thereof, so often as he were thereunto required. And refusing so to doo, shall forfeit all his patrimonie, and be banished his Countrie.</p>
               <p>That he should aboue all things speake the truth vnto the King, and at euerie occasion bee faithfull to his Maiestie.</p>
               <p>That he should not be silent when so euer any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should speake against the Kings honor: vppon paine of being banished the Court, and depriued of his Band for euer.</p>
               <p>That he should bee no great speaker, and in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to vtter the truth. But if he should affirme or say any vntruth, then for a punishment to walke in the streetes without his sword for one whole moneth.</p>
               <p>That he should endeuour himselfe to keepe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with wise men, and persons experienced in the warre. For being found to conuerse with Marchants, Artificers, or base people, he should bee therefore greatlie reprooued by the Great Master, and for one moneth be commanded to keepe his house.</p>
               <p>That he should mainteine his owne word, and faithfullie keepe promise with his friends. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found to doo otherwise, to be enioyned to walke and goe alone vnaccompanied of any other of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17517:78"/>
Kings Court, and should not presume to speake or come neere vnto any other Knight.</p>
               <p>That he should alwaies haue good Armour in his Chamber, good horses in his stable, good Launces in his Hall, and a good Sword by his side: or otherwise to be called Page and no Knight for one whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
               <p>That he should not bee seen mounted vppon any Mule, or other vnseemelie Hackney: neither walke abroad without his Band, nor enter into the Kings Pallace without his Sword, nor eate alone at home, vppon paine to forfeit for euerie such offence one marke towards the mainteining of the Tilt.</p>
               <p>That he should bee no flatterer of the King or any other person, neither take delight in scoffing, vpon paine to walke on foote for one moneth, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his house another moneth.</p>
               <p>That he should not complaine of any hurt, nor boast of his owne acts, nor in curing his wounds crie oh: for if in vaunting wise he vttered any ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious speach, he should bee reprooued by the great Master, and let alone vnuisited of all his companions.</p>
               <p>That he should bee no common gamester, chieflie at the Dice, nor consent that others should play in his house, vpon paine to forfeit for euerie such offence one moneths pay, and for one moneth and halfe not to be seene in the Court.</p>
               <p>That he should not in any sort lay to pawne his Armour or weapons, nor play away his garments: vppon paine to bee imprisoned in his owne house a whole moneth, and for two moneths following to go without the Band.</p>
               <p>

               <p>IT is written (with what warrant I know not) that at the Citie of <hi>Amiens</hi> in <hi>Picardie</hi> a Prouince of <hi>France,</hi> there was borne a certein Gentleman, who in his childhood had been brought vp in learning: and being growne to mans estate, disposed himselfe to the exercise of Armes, and therein long time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. Afterwards, hauing atteined riper yeares, he despised the world, and framed himselfe to a solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie life, as one fullie resolued to liue in contemplation vnseene of any but God alone. Hauing sometime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in that solitarie sort, a sodeine desire he had to visite the Sepulcher where Christ was buried,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17517:84"/>
which shortlie after he did. And to the end he might with securitie passe the barbarous Nations, he appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled himselfe like vnto a Phisition; by which meane without impediment he performed his ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Thus hauing passed the difficulties of trauell in diuers straunge Countries, he ariued at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and being there, fell into acquaintance with <hi>Simon,</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke of that Citie, and in lamenting wise enformed him of the oppression and crueltie offered and daylie vsed by the Infidels towards the poore Christians. Whereunto <hi>Simon</hi> answered, that albeit the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in those Countries indured great outrages, yet they of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> suffered much greater, and should be forced to more if God did not defend them.</p>
               <p>By this conference, the Patriarke conceiued <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the Hermit (for so he was called) to bee a man of good vnderstanding, and apt to execute any action of importance that should bee committed vnto him. Whereupon the Patriarke determined to make him a messenger vnto the Pope, vnto whom by letters he imparted the great calamitie and afflicted estate of the poore Christians inhabiting the Holy land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> hauing receiued his instructions and letter of credence, returned into the West, first vnto the Pope, and after solicited other Princes: in such sort, and with so good successe, as by his perswasions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Kings and Potentates consented to take in hand the recouerie of the Holy land from the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Infidels, and some of them furnished that enterprise with men, some with monie, and some did goe in person. Among which number (as the chiefe) was <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> sonne to King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:17517:84"/>
of <hi>England, Godfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorayn,</hi> with two of his brethren called <hi>Eustace</hi> and <hi>Baldwin, Hugh</hi> sirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Great</hi> brother to the <hi>French</hi> King: with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other Princes, Dukes, Earles and Barons. Also thether went <hi>Beomondo</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> who for zeale to that seruice (or desire of honor) resigned his Dukedome vnto <hi>Ruggiero</hi> his brother, taking with him so many of his subiects as would voluntarilie followe him, of whom (with such other Capteines and Soldiers of <hi>Italie</hi> as came vnto him) he assembled more than twentie thousand, all choyce men &amp; yong fit for the warre.</p>
               <p>All things in this sort prepared for the iorney, <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> the second (then Pope) sent vnto these Capteines a white Crosse, with commandement that al the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers should weare the like, calling that enterprise <hi>la Cruciata.</hi> It is said, that the Christians, at such time as this warre was proclaimed in <hi>Chiaramont</hi> (a Citie of <hi>Auernia</hi>) indeuoured themselues vniuersallie to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Soldiers, and ioyned in generall praier for their good successe, giuing them meate, apparell and furniture, vnasked or required. Moreouer, those that were indebted, were forgiuen, and such as had been banished were pardoned. The women also (contrarie to their custome) willinglie and with much ioy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented their husbands and sonnes should passe in this enterprise, and for their furniture gaue them their Iewels, Cheines and monie. The <hi>French</hi> King like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sent them great treasure, and gaue priuileges to the Soldiers lands and wiues in their husbands ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. And many great Princes and other Lords sold and impawned their patrimonies to further this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17517:85"/>
So as the Armie assembled for this holie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, amounted vnto three hundred thousand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and one hundred thousand horse, who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie marched towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the straight called <hi>Bosphoro Tracio,</hi> and landed at <hi>Calcedonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first enterprise they besieged <hi>Nicea</hi> in <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinia,</hi> which within fiftie daies was yeelded: and the fourth of Iuly at the foote of certeine Mounteines neere vnto that Citie, the Christians fought a battell with a Turkish Armie, which in number exceeded ours, and thereat was present <hi>Soliman</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Persia:</hi> but the Christians had victorie with the losse of two thousand men: but of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were slaine fortie thousand.</p>
               <p>This victorie gained, the Christians following their enterprise, within short time wonne an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cities and Townes of accompt, &amp; among them the great <hi>Antiochia,</hi> before which they begun the siege the 20. of October, and tooke it the last of May following, where they found <hi>Corbona</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>Cassiano</hi> Lord of <hi>Antiochia.</hi> Neere vnto that place in one other conflict were slaine more then an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand <hi>Turkes,</hi> with the losse of foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of ours.</p>
               <p>The cause of this victorie was (in that time of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition) imputed to the vertue of a bloudie Launce found in <hi>Antiochia,</hi> which they supposed to bee a Speare wherewith Christ was wounded on the Crosse. It was also said, that the <hi>Turks</hi> did see, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to see (as they reported) another great Armie comming against them from the Mounteines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17517:85"/>
by three Capteines mounted vppon three white horses, the beholding whereof occasioned their flight.</p>
               <p>This victorie being had, a Nauie ariued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Genoa</hi> and from <hi>Venice.</hi> Also with them came certeine ships conducted by one <hi>Vymer</hi> of <hi>Bullein</hi> in <hi>Picardie,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Pirate, who repenting his former life, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to followe that honorable action.</p>
               <p>The Christian forces thus increased, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and besieged it. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Citie was of great force, yet by Gods helpe and the valorous aduenture of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, it was assaulted, and in the end yeelded. <hi>Anno</hi> 1099.</p>
               <p>This Citie thus conquered, the said <hi>Peter</hi> (as the chiefe procurer of the enterprise) was highlie hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and <hi>Godfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorayn</hi> elected King of the Holy land.</p>
               <p>But to returne vnto the originall of these Knights, I say, that somewhat before the Christians conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Citie of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they had obteined of the <hi>Saracens</hi> leaue to dwell neere vnto the Sepulcher of Christ, and there builded an house, calling it the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall of Christians, whether all other Christians dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie resorted. After that, the number of Christians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, they builded another house for women, calling it <hi>S. Mary Magdalens.</hi> And at length they made a third house, and called it <hi>S. Iohn Baptists,</hi> where for the keeping of good order they appoynted an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, whom they called Rector.</p>
               <p>Sometime after, was elected vnto that Rectorship a Gentleman called <hi>Gherardus,</hi> who commaunded
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17517:86"/>
that he, with all others of that house, should weare a white Crosse vpon a blacke garment, which was the originall of the Order, and euer since hath been v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>Afterwards one other Rector or great Master was elected, whose name was <hi>Raimondus,</hi> to whom au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie was giuen, that he should gouerne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund all the Knights of this Order wheresoeuer they were dispersed.</p>
               <p>Many yeares after, these Knights conquered the Ile of <hi>Rhodi,</hi> holden by the <hi>Turkes Anno</hi> 1308. which was the cause they were called Knights of <hi>Rhodi.</hi> And diuers Princes seeing them Martiallie enclined, gaue vnto them great lands and possessions: &amp; they became greatlie esteemed for their seruice, chieflie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the said <hi>Turkes,</hi> and the <hi>Soldan</hi> King of <hi>Egipt</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The said Ile of <hi>Rhodi</hi> (during those Knights inhabited there) was foure times assaulted, yet by Gods helpe, with the valiancie of the Knights, it was defended.

               <p>THese Knights do not much varie from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for their custome is to intertein Pilgrimes, and at occasions to serue in warre.</p>
               <p>The beginning of this Knighthood was a certeine <hi>Almaine,</hi> who after the taking of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the Christians (together with diuers others of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) remained there. This <hi>Almaine</hi> being exceeding rich and married, kept a franke and liberall house, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing all passengers and Pilgrimes that trauailed to <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> in so much as his house became as an Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall or place of ordinarie accesse. At length he buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded neere vnto it a faire Church, which (according to the vse of that time) he did dedicate to our Ladie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:17517:87"/>Not long after, many Christians resorting thether, as well for loue of the Christian religion, as to visite the sicke, they resolued to erect a fraternitie, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing chosen a great Master to bee Gouernour, ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that euerie man of that assotiation, should bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled in white, and vpon their vppermost garment weare a blacke Crosse.</p>
               <p>It was also agreed, that no man should bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that Order, saue onelie Gentlemen of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation: and they to protest at all occasions to aduenture their liues in defence of Christes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.</p>
               <p>About 88. yeares after <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had remained in the Christians hands, it was taken againe from them by the <hi>Saracens</hi> in the yeare 1184. since which time it neuer was recouered. For which cause these Knights retired to <hi>Tolemaida,</hi> where they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>Tolemaida</hi> being also taken by the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi> they returned into <hi>Germanie</hi> their naturall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Where after some short abode (as loathing rest and idlenes) they went vnto <hi>Frederigo</hi> the second then Emperour in the yeare 1220. to let his Maiestie vnderstand that the people of <hi>Prussia</hi> vsed incursions vpon the confines of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> adding that those people were barbarous, Idolaters without the knowledge of God, and therefore besought his Maiestie to grant them leaue to make warre vpon them at their owne charges, yet with condition that whatsoeuer they gained, his Maiestie would giue the same to the maintenance of that Order, and they the Knights to be the Lords thereof for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:17517:88"/>The Emperour allowing of that suite, presentlie granted them the Countrie, and vnder his seale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the gift.</p>
               <p>These Knights by this donation much incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, forthwith tooke Armes, and within short space subdued al that Prouince, and then passed the riuer of <hi>Vistola,</hi> and conquered other people, who became their subiects, and were made Christians.</p>
               <p>Within short space after, these Knights builded diuers Churches, and among them some Cathedrall Temples, making them places of residence for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who were also inioyned to weare the habit of the Order.</p>
               <p>Neere vnto the riuer <hi>Vistola</hi> was a great Oake, where these Knights builded the first Castle and Towne, which with time was encreased and called <hi>Borgo di Santa Maria,</hi> where is now the chiefe Church apperteining to this Order: thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth so great riches and reuenues, as these Knights may both for men and monie compare with diuers Princes.</p>
               <p>This Countrie of <hi>Prussia</hi> is great, and much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bounded by the riuer <hi>Vistola:</hi> and is also confined by <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> the <hi>Massageti,</hi> and <hi>Polonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Knights are also Lords of <hi>Liuonia,</hi> which was likewise by them brought to the faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, and is with Christians now inhabited.</p>

               <head>The Ceremonies in the degradation of Knights. CAP. 24.</head>
               <p>IT seemeth that the degradation of Knights hath been vsed onelie for offences of greatest reproach and dishonour: which I conceiue partlie by the rarenes of such actions, and partlie for that the men bereft of that dignitie, were not onelie degraded, but also by lawe executed. As in the raigne of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 4. it appeared a Knight was degraded in this sort.</p>
               <p>First, after the publication of his offence, his gilt spurres were beaten from his heeles, then his sword taken from him, and broken. That being done, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie peece of his Armour was brused, beaten, and cast aside. After all which disgraces, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headded.</p>
               <p>In like manner, <hi>Andrew</hi> of <hi>Hekela</hi> Knight and Earle of <hi>Cardoyl,</hi> was in this sort disgraded. He being apprehended, was by the Kings commandement brought before Sir <hi>Anthony Lucy, Anno.</hi> 1322. appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in all the robes of his estate as an Earle and a Knight, and so led vnto the place of Iudgement. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thether come, Sir <hi>Anthony Lucy</hi> said vnto him these words. <hi>First thou shall lose the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by which thou hadst all thine honour: and further, all worship vppon thy bodie bee brought to nought.</hi> Those wordes pronounced, Sir <hi>Anthony Lucy</hi> commanded a knaue to hewe the Knights spurres from his heeles,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17517:92"/>
and after caused his sword to bee broken ouer his head. That done, hee was dispoyled of his furred Tabord, of his Hood, of his furred Cotts, and of his Girdle. Then Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> saide vnto him these wordes: <hi>Andrew, now art thou no Knight, but a knaue, and for thy treason the King doth will thou shalt bee han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>
               </p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit the whole scope and intent of this booke is to discourse the poynts of Honor and dignities apperteining vnto Armes; yet for not being mistaken in my meaning, I haue thought good to say, that the commendation due vnto learning is of no lesse desart, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which belongeth to Martiall merit. And indeed very rarelie doth any man excell in Armes, that is vtterlie igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in letters: for by how much one Capteine is more learned than another, by so much is he more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of gouernment in Armes, and ought bee the better reputed. For who without learning can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ordering &amp; disposing of men, in marching, incamping, or fighting, without <hi>Arithmetique?</hi> Or who can comprehend the ingenious fortifications or instruments apt for offence or defence of Townes, or passing of waters, vnlesse he hath knowledge of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie?</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:17517:92"/>
Or how may Sea seruice be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out skill of the <hi>Latitude</hi> of the place, by the <hi>Pole,</hi> and the <hi>Longitude</hi> by other Starres: which must be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the <hi>Astronomers.</hi> Yea learning is (no doubt) of such excellencie and necessitie, that no Common weale without it, is well gouerned. What State can bee well ordered, vnlesse the Gouernours or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates haue studied Philosophie, chieflie that part which entreateth of manners, sith it onlie enformeth, first how euerie man should gouerne himselfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, how he should guide his owne familie. And thirdlie, teacheth how a Citie or Common weale may bee ordered and gouerned, as well in times of warre as peace: which moued <hi>Plato</hi> to say: <hi>That hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie is the Common weale where either the Prince is a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, or where a Philosopher is the Prince.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot be denied that Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are both wonne and kept as well by force and manhood, as by wisedome and policie; yet is the chiefe of that policie atteined vnto by learning. For in all sorts of gouernments the wiser haue authoritie ouer the rude and vnlearned. And as in euerie priuate house or towne the most discreet and best experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced are preferred, so in all Nations they that bee most ciuill, learned and politicke, doo find meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the rest, notwithstanding in force they bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour. The experience hereof was apparantlie seene in the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> among whom, like as wisedome and learning was most esteemed, so their Empires were spred furthest and continued longest. And to prooue that excellencie of learning in those Nations preuailed against others equall with them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17517:93"/>
in manhood and courage, wee will vse this onlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. That albeit this realme before any conquest thereof, was (no doubt) inhabited with people of great courage; yet for that they were vnciuill, or at the least without policie and learning, they were brought vnder the subiection of other Nations: as the <hi>Saxons</hi> were last by the <hi>Normanes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Romanes</hi> by the <hi>Saxons</hi> before that, and the <hi>Brittaines</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> first of all. And albeit diuers men haue been and yet are, both wise and politick without learning, and some also that be learned (in respect of worldlie policie) be verie simple: yet I say, that such wise men should haue been more excellent, if they had been learned; and the other more simple and foolish, if they had been vtterlie without learning.</p>
               <p>Exercise in warre maketh not euerie man fit to be a Capteine, though he followeth Armes neuer so long; and yet is there none so vnapt for the warre, but with vse is more perfect, and the rather if he bee learned. For if experience doth helpe, then I am sure that learning helpeth much more to the encrease of wisedome. We wil then determine, that experience, because it doth further wisedome, may be called the father thereof, and memorie the mother; because she doth nourish and preserue it: for in vaine should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience bee sought for, if the same were not held in remembrance. Then if both experience and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie be holpen &amp; increased by learning, it must needes bee confessed, that experience helpeth wit. Euerie man seeth that the experience of an old man maketh him wiser than the yong, because he hath seen more; yet an old man seeth onlie things in his owne time:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17517:93"/>
but the learned man seeth not onlie his owne age and experience, but whatsoeuer hath been in long time past, yea since the first writer tooke pen in hand, and therefore must needes knowe more than the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, bee he neuer so olde; for no memorie can compare with writing. Besides that, if the vnlearned doo forget any thing seene, hardlie shall he reduce it to memorie againe: whereas the learned man by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his booke, hath meane to call to remembrance what he happeneth to forget. Therefore, as he that liueth foure score yeares must needes haue more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience than he that liueth fortie: so he that seeth in bookes the accidents of a thousand yeares, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more than he that by liuing one hundred yeares could atteine vnto. In like manner, if he that trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth many Nations, is of more experience than others of like age that neuer went from his natiue countrie: so he that is learned, by <hi>Cosmographie,</hi> histories, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learning, seeth the manner and vsage of euerie Countrie in the world, yea of many moe than is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for one man in all his life to trauell through: and of these he trauaileth, much better doth he learne, by small abode there, than another by longer experience that is altogether vnlearned. By this learning we may also conceiue the scituation, temperature, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of euerie Countrie throughout the world. Also through the science of <hi>Astronomie,</hi> wee knowe the course of the Planets aboue, and their Aspects and Coniunctions; which the learned men in times past atteined vnto by long conference and obseruation; but we by perusing their bookes onlie may learne it: yet without that helpe we could neuer. To conclude,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17517:94"/>
there is nothing either of profite or necessitie for mans life, but by learning is taught more perfectlie, than it can bee compassed by experience, or other meane whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>But leauing the commodities of learning to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed by those that are learned indeed, this onlie I say, that the endeuour of Gentlemen ought be either in Armes or learning, or in them both. And in my poore conceit, hardlie deserueth he any title of honor or gentilitie, that doth not take pleasure in the one or the other. For as no liuing creature is borne to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, so is there no doubt but God and nature hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined each one for some commendable businesse. And like as base occupations are fit for folke of base fortune, so valiant and vertuous minds, in actions of honor and vertue should be employed. And if in this earthlie life any thing there bee that meriteth fame or fauour, surely the same is a vertuous life and valerous endeuour: whereof <hi>Iuuenall</hi> saith:

               <p>WE haue said in our former discourse, that no man of any qualitie or fortune, is borne or destined to ease, idlenes, or vnprofitable occupation: we haue likewise touched the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of such learnings, as are required in actions both ciuill and Martiall, whereby may appeare, how necessarie it is for all Gentlemen to endeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the one and the other, as those knowledges whereby men are made worthie of honorable title. Notwithstanding, through corrupt custome or bad education, the greater part of our English Gentilitie is not onelie ignorant what honor and vertue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but consequentlie disdaineth (or at the least wise lightly regardeth) those labours whereby they might and ought become comfortable to friends, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable to their Prince and Countrie: which haplie moued the Poet to forewarne fathers to haue care of childrens education, saying:
<q>
                     <l>Gratum est quod patriae ciuem populoque dedisti,</l>
                     <l>Si facis vt patriae sit idoneus, vtilis agris,</l>
                     <l>Vtilis &amp; bellorum &amp; pacis rebus agendis.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in continuing the consideration of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I am occasioned to be right sorie, that our English youth doo not onlie earnestlie affect vaine pleasures and improfitable pastimes as recreation; but also vse them with daylie labour as their chiefe businesse and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17517:95"/>
speciall profession. And to speake plainlie, I am more then halfe perswaded, that a great sort of our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (chieflie those that haue had their nurture at home with their owne ignorant parents) doo take more comfort to be called good Faulkners or expert Woodmen, than either skilfull Souldiers or learned Scollers. Yet who so obserueth, shall finde, that the same men by secret instinct of gentle nature, doo not a little glorie in the auncient badges, titles and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices of their auncesters, supposing those passed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites (supported with riches) ought without further sufficiencie, make them more worthie than others, whose owne proper vertue and labour haue indeed deserued much honor. But as no fowle flieth with the wings of another, nor no horse doth runne on legges not his owne: so ought no man be praised or admired for the vertue or good merite of another. And albeit the fame of auncesters honor, may (for some short space) mainteine a certeine hope of vertue, (chieflie where no vice appeareth) yet time, which doth distinguish things indeed, from those that onlie appeare, will also (like vnto counterfeit mettall) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray the want or worth of euery man, and for such a one he shall be knowne &amp; esteemed, of what name, house, parentage or predecessor so euer, he is discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. It therefore behoueth euerie Gentleman well borne to imbrace the loue of vertue, and in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof to employ the course of his whole life. For what can be more pleasing to a generous minde, than the studie of wisedome? whereby to knowe good from euill, and truth from falshood, the one to be followed, the other eschewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:17517:95"/>What may be more blessed than Iustice? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we refraine from all iniuries, and giue vnto euerie one that which vnto him apperteineth. What is more noble than Fortitude? which contemneth all worldlie accidents, and with inuincible courage fighteth for equitie and right. And what is more fit or better beseeming a noble personage, than Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? which teacheth comelines and moderation, gouerning the passions and perturbations of minde, to the quietnes of mans life, and contentation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. These with other vertues on them depending, haue from base birth and poore parentage, brought many to great title and dignitie. And as those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous endeuours haue aduaunced them, so the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance of like delights, did vtterlie deface that honor in their posteritie. Vertue I say, is that which from meane estate hath euer led the louers thereof to great reputation and glorie. Among infinite exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (omitting men of meaner fortune, yet worthie much honor) we haue <hi>Agathocles, Eumenes, Pertinax, Dioclesian, Valentinian,</hi> with other Emperours, Kings and Capteines. Of like fortune in birth was <hi>Marcus Tullius, Cato, Horace,</hi> with diuers most notable lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men: yea <hi>Socrates</hi> himselfe (who by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> was iudged the wisest man aliue) had no great parentage. And <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that both for Armes and learning excelled, and was the first Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, aspired from lowe degree to excessiue glorie. Notwithstanding, through protraction of time, and the degeneration of those mens posteritie, not onelie their owne houses and names are vanished, but also the honor and renowne of the Nations where they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17517:96"/>
liued, is vtterlie decaied and extinguished. Which the Christian Poet <hi>Palingenius</hi> expressed well in these verses.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Nempe diu res nulla manet, nempe omnia semper</l>
                  <l>Deteriora solent fieri, in peiusque referri,</l>
                  <l>Naturae imperio, &amp; fatorum lege perenni:</l>
                  <l>Deinde iterum ex alio faetu instaurata rinassi.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Thus haue we heard the meanes of aspiring vnto Honor, and by what occasion the same is lost or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied. But well I wot, that vnto these reasons and examples produced to incite our English youth, they answere, that were they sure to attaine vnto the least part of that fortune these great personages and many others their inferiours haue come vnto, then would they not feare to aduenture their labour and liues to the vttermost: but because the paines and perills are certeine, and the successe doubtfull, they thinke it more wisedome to Hunt and Hawke at home, than hazard their bodies abroad, or beate their braines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which haplie neuer shall turne them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. This sillie allegation compounded of sloath and pusillanimitie, may easilie be refelled, but slowlie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Notwithstanding, (for that I am vsed to lose my labour) I will replie thereunto thus: That seeing no reward is due befor desart, and that Honor is the recompence of vertue, it may not be looked for vntill some vertuous testimonie bee first shewed. What Soldier is so simple, as entring into pay will at the first day looke to bee made a Capteine, or haue promise within fewe yeares to become a Generall? What
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17517:96"/>
Scoller will at his first comming to studie demaund the degrees due vnto Arte, or that shortlie after (with little learning) will challenge to bee a Doctor? Yet true it is, that sometimes the simplest Archer doth hit the marke, which many an excellent shooter misseth: notwithstanding, hardlie can any wise man bee brought to lay monie on his side, or hope of such suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. Euen so, in the atteining of Honor, although fauour and fortune ofttimes preferreth the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, yet the true way and most likelie meane there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is true vertue and industrious life. Wherefore concluding I say, that euery noble and magnanimous mind, doth not so much couet the rewards of vertue, as it taketh delight in vertue it selfe. As the same Poet saith:
<q>
                     <l>Propter se virtus petitur, non propter honorem,</l>
                     <l>Ipsa licet proprie, ac vere, mereatur honorem.</l>
                  </q>
