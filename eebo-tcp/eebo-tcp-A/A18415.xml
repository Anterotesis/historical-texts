            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pedlers, porters, chimney-sweepers, fooles and Physitians, such as haue free egresse and regresse into mens houses with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspicion.</p>

This is the backe gate to <hi>Honorios</hi> house, which shall be <hi>Aurelios,</hi> if God giue him grace to weepe for his fathers death in time. And in this garden, if I could see the chaste <hi>Lucresse,</hi> or the affable mistresse <hi>Temperance,</hi> I might (thus wrapt in my cloake) steale a little courtship through the chinke of a pale. But indeed I thinke it safer to sit closer, and so to cloud the summe of my visnomy, that no eye discerne it.
<stage>(He sits downe, and muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles himselfe in his cloake.)</stage>
So be it, thats my resolution. Now to my contemplation, this is no Pandarisme, is it?

No, for there is neither money nor credit propos'd or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and besides there is no vnlawfull act intended, no not this same <hi>lasciua actio animi</hi>: I thinke for his part, much lesse hers: go to, let me do my kinswoman, and her sex right, sit at rest with me then reputation, and conscience, fall asleepe with the world, but this same idle attendance is the spite of it, Idlenesse is accounted with other men a sinne, to me 'tis a penance, I was begot in a stirring season, for now hath my soule a thousand fancies in an instant, as what wench dreams on when she lies on her backe, when one hen layes an egge and another sits it, whether that hen shall mother that chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? If my bull leape your cow, is not the calfe yours? yes no doubt, for <hi>Aedificium cedit solo</hi> saies the Lawyer: and then to close all comes in a sentence, <hi>Non omnia possumus omnes</hi>: for some are borne to riches, others to verses, some to be bachelers, others to be cuckolds, some to get crownes, and others to spend'm, some to get children, and others to keepe'em: and all this is but idlenesse, would to God I had some scuruy poeme about me to laugh at,
