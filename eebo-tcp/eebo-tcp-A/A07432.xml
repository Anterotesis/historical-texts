         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

S. antes no tenia guſto. Siendo ayudado con la diligencia y diſcrecion de Don <hi>Payo Patino</hi> Arcedeano de Cadiz, hombre muy honrrado, que poſaua comigo en la Capitana, y deſpues en la co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pania de <hi>Alonço</hi> de <hi>Baeça,</hi> Teſorero de los Almojarisfazgos del Rey, el qual he tenido en mi caſa para eſte efecto: Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos de los Rehenes del Catiuerio Eſpañol: facilitandola con el muy diſcreto y raro Dicionario, que compuſo <hi>Richardo Perciual,</hi> por lo qual cierto los aficionados a eſta milicia le deuemos muchas gracias y loores, Ocaſion con que he engañado el tiempo con el curſo de hablar y leer libros Eſpañoles, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra de guerras, hora de plazeres. Entre los quales he hallado vno que compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Don <hi>Bernardino</hi> de <hi>Mendoza,</hi> en tiempos paſſados embaxador en eſta Corte, llamado <hi>Theorica y practica de guerra.</hi> El qual aun que a la primera parecia muy difficultoſo por las palabras eſtrañas, eſtratagemas y ardides de guerras, Todauia por exerciçio he paſſado algun tiempo en traduzille en nueſtra lengua vulgar; por eſte medio mejorando me en la perfecion de la lengua Caſtellana: y con todo mi trabajo no quiero yo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadir a V. S. que es poſsible yr tan perfecto palabra por palabra como en el miſmo original: ni tan poco no ſe deue V. S. marauillar, Si en nueſtro Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance empreſtamos muchas palabras de las otras naciones, pues los Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanos
<pb facs="tcp:12957:3"/>
miſmos (gente tan Catholica) las empreſta, no ſolamente de los Italia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, Franceſes, Flamencos, que ſon Christianos, pero de los Moros, Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, Alarabes, Barboros, Iudios, y Infieles. Iuntamente es de aduertir, que las materias y inſtrumentos de las milicias, por ſer entre todas las naciones dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentes, ſegun lo que acoſtumbra cada nacion al pelear, es impoſsib-le con puntualidad exprimir las en otra lengua, ſin mezelar la propia donde fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron primeramente inuentadas. Por manera que es meneſter que cada na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion empreſte poco o mucho de la vezindad de las otras. Aſsi miſmo ſe vee cada dia trocar la forma de hazer guerra y con eſto forçoſamente la manera y nombres de las Armas, enſangrentandoſe los Principes, los unos con los otros, mouidos con la ceguedad de la ambicion. De lo qual no puede auer teſtigo mas cierto, que el Autor miſmo, pues a platicado contra tantos prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes, y en ninguna coſa hecho moyor daño a ſu Rey, deſpues muchos defafue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros y agrauios hechos indignos a Cauallero de Aue Maria, que fue ſiendo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baxador con mucha confiança en eſta Corte, buſcar y platicar la deſtrucion de la ſereniſsima perſona de ſu SCCRM. neustra Señora, por lo qual con mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha uerguença lo mando deſterrar fuera de eſte Reyno. Coſa digna de exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar caſtigo ſi no lo mitigara ſu mucha bondad y clemencia tan acoſtumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da tanto a los eſtraños como a ſus vaſſallos. Mas el Dios muy poderoſo que tienne ſu Iuizio aparejado para caſtigar los pecadores, a tomado eſta cauſa a ſu cargo, començandole a pagar ſu debito con vn rayo de ſu yra, en el miembro de la viſta, (de que ſe eſcuſa en ſu carta a el Principe eſtar priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do) que era el que mas le ayudaua a pecar: conforme a vn Cauallero, que V. S. conoſcio, que a la hora de la muerte dixo con muchas lagrimas: <hi>In qua par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te maximè peccaui, in ea maximè ſtringor miſer.</hi> Y aun que el Autor ſecretamente deſcubre ſu malicioſo coraçon y flaqueza dando a entender en muchas partes a qual reyno pone el blanco, (que es a el a quien los cielos haſta agora ſon propicios, contra la ambicion, y inſolencia, y cobdicia de los Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanos, que primieramente començaron los daños de toda la Christianidad.) Todauia es digno de ſer alabado en otras particularidades', que le diſculpan de muchos yerros, de que ningun autor puede ſer perfecto: y principalmente los de la nacion que nunca precio otra en ſus brabatas, y ſiempre ſon menores en los hechos, pero en ninguna mas, que adonde alaba el que acomete, y me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſprecia el que eſpera.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the olde Caſtilian proverbe doe affirme, That by a nayle is loſt a ſhooe: and by a ſhooe, a horſe: and by a horſe a Cauallero: and by a Cauallero a Cornet: and by a Cornet an Hoſte: &amp; by an Hoſte a Battaile: and by the Battaile a Kingdome: and not onely the ſucceſſion of Kinges therein, but many times religion: a loſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable: you may wel iudge, howe much more ſpeedlie, manie other inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences may bring like loſſes, which by careleſneſſe, and ſmall heede taking, may ſucceede in warre, if that, which to looke too is of ſo ſmall moment, may come to bee cauſe thereof. The conſideration of which hath moued me to write vnto <hi>Your Highnes</hi> a briefe <hi>Theorique and practiſe of Warre,</hi> refreſhing thereby the memorie with what I haue read and experimented in thirtie and ſo many yeares, which I haue folowed, ſeruing in that, and Embaſſages, the King our Soueraine, father to <hi>Y.H.</hi> ſince that my ouertymelie blindneſſe hath kept me from being able to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie any roome fit to ſerue <hi>Y.H.</hi> in, but only as a dumme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, the office of bookes and paper, becauſe they ſpeake not but when they are ſought, nor replie vpon ought they haue repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: which ought to binde Princes to ſpende ſome parte of their time in good letters: ſince beſides tillinge of their wittes with them, and opening their eyes, to order things preſent by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and warninge of the paſſed, (which maketh able to foreſee thinges to come): Bookes and writings deliuer vnto Princes many truthes, which they that are liuing dare not preſume to doe. And
<pb facs="tcp:12957:4"/>
although many will holde it for a harde matter to make a Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que of knowledge, which conſiſteth entierly in practiſe, as the exerciſe of warre, experience being the principall foundation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Phiſicke holdeth the ſame qualitie, by ſeeing in mens bodies, after the ſame manner as in warre, ſo diuers and vnlooked for euentes: A particular which cauſeth experimented Phiſitians to bee of more eſtimation, then thoſe that are onely Theoricall. This hath not bin any cauſe why the moſt learned in ſcience ſhould forget the Theorique which is in all, applying practiſe with it. Neither in the Mathematiques, and Geometrie, doth it leaue to bee of much profit, ſince that, except the reaſon and compoſition of lines and figures had bin firſt knowne, Architectiſtes could hardlie haue traced out edifices, for the building whereof this is not ſufficient alone, except the maiſter workemen knowe what the nature of the deapth of the ſoyle is: by longe vſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the qualitie of the ſtuffe for the building: what ſorte of ſtones endure longeſt the iniurie of the weather, and if it incorporate it ſelfe better with morter and plaſter. In the game of Cheſſe the liuelie paterne of warre, which conſiſteth really in vſe, thoſe bookes leaue not to bee verie fruitefull, which are written of the Theorique thereof, aduantaging ſuch as reade them, greatly in their playe. Likewiſe it may ſeeme to ſome, that I haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many things, which ſuch as are ſoldiors alreadie knowe, and ſome which are to bee founde in ſundrie bookes. To ſatiſfie the firſt, if reaſon of offending and defending had not been from the firſt creation of the worlde vntill nowe the verie ſame, the diſpoſition of the people onely varying in the difference of weapons, engins, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes, which haue bin inuented for to obteyne, which ſoeuer of the two effectes, I mought be able to tell nouelties, the matter it ſelf miniſtring me occaſion: and God giuing to all men the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of vnderſtanding, memorie and will, wherewith to diſpoſe the diſcourſe &amp; reaſoning, no wonder is it, if for all this, ſundrie wittes doe meete in one thought, when to doe it is grounding them ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:12957:5"/>
on one ſelfe ſame cauſe. The which doth not hinder that ſome vnderſtandinges may not ſurpaſſe more then others in finding the reaſons and effectes of it, nor breede in mee any diſcontent, when myne ſhall goe after others, who haue paſſed before better then my ſelfe.

Togeather with which, the ſucceſſes and chaunces of the world breeding differences, which ordinarily falleth out beetwene Kings, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealths, and Catholike Potentates, muſte needes lye awakened: And albeit your qualitie may require to appeaſe them with armes, yet is <hi>Y.H.</hi> carefully to looke that you make no vſe of them, before you ſtand deſperate of anie other meanes of negotiation or agreement, in reſpect of the great damage which in imbrewing your ſword in blood among Chriſtian Kings may redound to the <note n="*" place="margin">A Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if you meane it as the Apoſtle doth, Rom. 1. ver. 8.</note> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Apoſtolike Church, hindring thereby the increaſe of our Catholicque faith, beſides giuing occaſion to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells and hereticques, by not ſeeing the Catholicque for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnited, to inuade their kingdomes and territories.</p>
            <p>This conſideration is accompanied with another fit for Kings, Princes and Gouernours,<note place="margin">A conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Kings.</note> often to laye before their eies, which is that our Lord cannot bee better ſerued then in time of peace, nor contrariwiſe more offended then in warre.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12957:20"/>
ſo as the puniſhement may ſeeme to be done for a good example and not reuenge: albeit the Barbarians holde it the better parte of a victorie, to refrayne the iuſt furie of ſhedding blood, and anger of men, when it falleth out betweene thoſe which before loued togeather, although occaſion haue bin giuen to the contrarie. A paſſion which can hardlie be cooled in a Prince, except he conſider the taſte of reuenge to laſt but few dayes, and the ioye of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie eternallie, and ſo to accompanie iuſtice with clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that it be no crueltie, and clemencie with iuſtice, that him ſelfe runne not into contempt. This bindeth in the inſurrections of Cities &amp; Prouinces, or mutineys of men of warre, to puniſh ſuch as make the beginninge, or firſte motion, being authours thereof, pardoning rhe moſt part in generall, ſince it is not poſſible to puniſhe a multitude. The reaſons which I haue propounded may be occaſion to take armes as well on <hi>Y.H.</hi> parte as of any other Prince or Potentate. So may there be other which I write not for being to tedious, and that they are ſufficientlie comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the before mentioned, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations ſet downe being able to ſerue for a rule as well to the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in reſoluing what foote or horſe, artillerie, or muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is fit to be leuied for the compounding of an armie, or fleete of ſhippes,<note place="margin">Opinions in forming an armie of one onely nation or diuers.</note> if the ſeruice be by Sea: many are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it were much better to compounde it of one onely nation, then of diuers, in reſpect of the diuerſitie of language, and cuſtomes, which partlie cauſeth confuſion vpon manie occaſions, not onely in lodgings, but in fight, whereby ariſeth diuerſitie of complaintes, infecting them ſelues in ſuch ſorte as hath cauſeth the very loſſe of whole armies, and for that ordinarily among thoſe of that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are ſouldiors which ſerue onely for ſuch paye and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, as in particular may fall out in the warre, with ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12957:20"/>
of which wanting, they laye aſide the reputation, good and greatnes of the Prince (owing no further fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to him then their ſeruice) for their priuate intereſt to whom their very Leaders giue aſſiſtance, moued with the gaine they haue in payes and muſters, in which they are greatlie intereſſed, alwayes making ſuch regimentes and leauies of men, more for reſpect of profitt, then anie affection they cary the Prince. Hence it doeth ryſe that they haue often refuſed to ſight, at the very time of neceſſitie, and gone and ſerued the contrarie parte, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſenting any whit at all to haue fayled in their fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie not being payde: whereby the enimie commeth to bee ſtrengthned, the contrarie parte remayning more weake.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe ſeldome times doe Kings &amp; generall Captains vnderſtande ſo many languages as to bee able to ſpeake to euery one in his owne: a matter which naturally maketh them affectionate, and winneth them to obey with more readines, and ſooner ſtirreth them vp to fight.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide experience hath proued great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to haue combated and warred yeares enough with armies of different nations,<note place="margin">Reaſon on the other ſide.</note> without euer hauing had any mutinies or ſedition among them, &amp; gayned many victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that one nation can hardly accommodate it ſelfe without a very large and continuall experience in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nage of ſuch diuerſitie of armes, as is neceſſarie for ſoldiers to vſe at this day in the armies. In this reſpect and conſideration men of auncient time were of opinion, that thoſe inſtruments of warre were of much credit and eſtimation among the moſt parte of people, as mought ſerue them without any exerciſe at all before had of them, and ſo we ſee one nation more fit for the readines of the Harquebus, and other for the ſtande and firmenes of the Pike, and better able to endure to goe and march armed:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12957:21"/>
and ſo by conſequent as well in the Cauallerie, better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating them ſelues with the demi-lance &amp; armor, or <note n="*" place="margin">Kindes of Buckleres made in <hi>Chyna</hi> much vſed in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</note> with <hi>Tablachinas,</hi> &amp; other with very long ones of two headdes, without any Iackes of mayle or corſelettes, and ſome carying light horſe ſtaues, leading ſtaues, and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guettes, &amp; other with Piſtolls, or long Petrionells: which difference of armes is as well required to be conſidered, as the horſſes may be able to beare out therewith in combat beſt. The verie reaſon which at the firſt moued men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent them, proportioning them according to the fitneſſe of ſuch horſe, as the Prouince or Climate did breede, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming iointlie, that it is a very hard matter at this time, to be able to frame an armie of one entiere nation, when it is not for the defence of the ſame kingdome, vpon the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any ſtranger, for the diuerſitie of conſiderations which may therein be offred. And in particular, whether the Prouince be ſo well peopled, as that it may yeelde ſo great a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of men, as is neceſſarie for the maintenance of a warre abroad, the which euery day conſumeth men, and to breede ſouldiers, it is neceſſarie to employ youthes which haue paſſed ſixteene yeares at the leaſt: and in caſe ſo much people may be drawne out of the Countrie,<note place="margin">The beſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Of this there are not onely probable reaſons, but effectes, conſideringe that the greateſt Empires which haue bene, haue augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and preſerued them ſelues, by warring with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors of their owne nation onely, with whom they made an entier body of their armie, lodging ſuch of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

            <p>In this caſe hath our Lorde made <hi>Y.H.</hi> ſo powerfull a Prince, as that you poſſeſſe kingdomes, and many Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, out of which you may forme great armies of one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere nation or diuers, being all your vaſſalls, or ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries aſſiſting you, where you haue Coronells in paye for the ſame effecte: and ſo may <hi>Y.H.</hi> chuſe the partie moſt conuenient, according as your generall Captaines ſhall be of opinion, &amp; the forme of warre may require which you vndertake, and in what Prouince or ſtate: particularities which will giue light to the reſolution of your leauies and places of muſters which are to be aſſigned, accordinge to their order and ſecuritie.</p>

            <p>Of theſe and other things noted, <hi>Y.H.</hi> is to commaund that in way of conuerſation they treate of them, with ſome particular headdes of the armie, which bee perſonages of experience and diſcourſe, and charge them to doe the like with the olde ſoldiors, of whoſe iudgement and reaſoning they may hold ſome ſatisfaction, for that they know what they ſpeake: becauſe many times matters of importance come to be moued, on which councellours doe not putt their eyes, being clogged with buſineſſes, which doth not giue them leaue to thinke thoroughlie of matters, nor to be able thereby to direct them, not being poſſible for a man to conſider all things which is required for the guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of one well, and that it greatly furthereth, though it be much conſidered of, to heare the opinions of manie, to reſolue of what is beſt: a point which bindeth Kinges to holde Councellors about them, affirming to thoſe which are moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident, that Princes in their particulars of warr, are to heare all, and reſolue with fewe.</p>

            <p>The firſt matter which <hi>Y.H.</hi> is to debate of, is whether they muſt make one or two lodginges or more before that you come to laie ſiege diſcouertlie, enquiring whether ther be no townes rounde about, making ſhewe as though you meant to beſiege one of them, and not that which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in deede, to finde it thereby the leſſe prouided: for this cauſe the Armie muſt bee diuided and marche on diuers partes, and in the night with great diligence troupes of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours muſt be ſent to take the paſſages and places whereby men may come to enter within the countrie.</p>
            <p>Being able to beſiege with making one lodging onelie, is the better, becauſe of putting the greater feare in thoſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are within, ſeeing them ſelues ſuddenlie encloſed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting with ſpeedines that they do not hinder the taking of the lodging, and burne the ſuburbes &amp; houſes about, which is of great moment, nor to haue readie their Artillerie, and

other things which in this conformitie may be had by dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying the time of the ſiege, if thoſe which ſtande vpon their defence come to ſuſpect it, for this they vſe when the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie holdeth three or foure paſſages or ſayles, to ſend by day or night men, if the ſcituation permitt, that at one inſtante they may occupie the paſſagages thereof, making great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in fortifying them, with trenches, ditches, and traueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whereby they ſtopp anie ſuccour from them, &amp; let them within fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaling forth, being ſo near, hauing many meanes to be able to offende them, if they entende anie ſalie with greater ſecuritie.</p>
            <p>To execute this enterpriſe, the Armie is to march accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the countrie ſerueth, in one of the manners which I haue ſet downe, and in the vandguarde the Campe maiſter generall to be ſo well renforced with Cauallerie and infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, as that he may be ſuperior to thoſe within, being able thereby, if they make anie ſalie to charge them with deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, &amp; readines, ſo as he make them turne tayle, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looſing any time vpon the occaſion which may be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, according to the diſpoſition of the place and borders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, happening ſome times vpon the like charges, to ſlaye or take ſome of the leaders which ſalie out to guyde the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, of whom intelligence may be taken: a matter which greatlie quayleth them, and in particular if they receyue much hurte vpon the firſt brunt, which bringeth them to bethinke them ſelues of yeelding.</p>

            <p>The chiefeſt point to be conſidered is, that the trenches be wrought with much heed and conſideration,<note place="margin">What is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in working of trenches.</note> taking care to guyde them with the bulwarkes, towers, and flanckes of the walles, making the windings in ſuch ſorte as no piece of the

enimie may be able to emboke them, nor to batter by direct line anie bowe or windings of them, being ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by how much they are deeper, broader, and higher, and approche neareſt vnto the quarters: and in caſe that the principall heades of the Armie be enforced ordinarilie to goe vnto them, it is verie fitt when there is a quantitie of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadors, to aſſure the entrie, <hi>Y.H.</hi> not hazarding thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages which are about you, by reaſon that the want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie leader may proue verie preiudiciall.</p>
            <p>Albeit that trenches are commonlie made after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which I haue ſett downe vnto <hi>Y.H.</hi> yet I haue my ſelfe bene in place, where they wrought them ſtraight, with flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers on high, which ſeemed verie ſtrange to thoſe ſouldiors which ſawe it, &amp; to very good purpoſe by gayning of time in not making windings: wherein is to be conſidered, the diſpoſition of the grounde, ſeruing to bee able to worke a ſtreigth trenche, that bowes be made out from one parte to another to renforce them with men, for that a ſtreight one is not able to receiue manie, and it is verie neceſſarie to hold them well renforced with ſoldiors, and prouided of budge-barills, that the harquebuſerie may ſhoote with more ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to whom order is to be giuen, that by no meanes they talke to them within, auoyding thereby any aduertiſement which might vnder hande be giuen, as ſometimes it hath fallen out of what hath not benefitt to be diſcouered.</p>

point blancke vppon ſuch parte or partes as they minde to batter. Fiftlie, that there be a place prepared readie for the ſouldiours to giue the aſſalt after the batterie made, which will be to ſmall purpoſe, if the approch vnto it be vnacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

            <p>Theſe pieces being planted with their beddes, which are made of tymber planckes or hurdles, they couer them with gabions and diches, as well for the ſecuritie of the Pyoners

(which aſſiſte to retire them with the gunners, &amp; doe other neceſſaries) as the guard of the artillerie, fortifying the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation thereof, in ſuch ſorte as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enimie driueth the men from their trenches which they haue to couer them, &amp; paſſe forward either to gaine or clowe the Artillerie, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors which ſtand at the guard, may hold ſufficient ſtrength to defende it. To batter the walles when they are onelie a caſamure without rampire of earth, you muſt plant your pieces in ſuch ſorte as they may batter the walles a ſlante, for that then they breake them worſe then ſhooting by direct line, by which they onely pearce thorough the wall with much furie, without ſhaking it. The approch being made, driuing the trenches as neare the towne as may be, the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie is to be planted, which is to begin in this order, that is to ſhoote of thoſe pieces with which you batter determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie by voleyes one after another, being of greater effect ſo,<note place="margin">Maner how to batter.</note> then if they ſhould be diſcharged euery one by it ſelfe, and then after a voley paſſed, ſhooting off thoſe pieces which ſtand at the defences, to the ende the enimie may not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer while they be charged a new, and put in ther place: and the like is to be done by the harquebuſerie &amp; muſketrie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trenches, keeping the enimie from ſhewing him ſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they returne to giue another voley, which is the manner whereby a batterie is continued, ſeruing them ſelues with the greater pieces to ſhake the wall, breaking it a pieces, and with the leſſer to cutt it after, and to make the greater ruine by the falling of that which was ſhaken, in anie wiſe haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the batterie with all the diligence that may be, and to plie it ſo (if it be poſſible) as ſo manie voleys as ſhould ſerue turne, might be ſhott in one day rather then two, diligence in batteries being of great moment, and for manie reſpectes to be vſed: a buſines which wil giue them that are beſieged to thinke on, when they ſee them ſelues furiouſlie battered. For this purpoſe, beſides the diligence which the generall
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12957:53"/>
of the artillerie, his Lieuetenants and officers are to vſe, the gunners finding that they gaine particularlie by euerie vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley which they diſcharge, are to giue cartages &amp; budgebar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, to charge more eaſilie, &amp; ſpeedilie: and by this meanes I haue bene preſent at a ſiege where there hath ben diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the end of Auguſt when the dayes are not very long, fouer ſcore and on tyre in one day, the batterie being of ſixe and thirtie pieces. It is true that in reſpect it was in a colde countrey, they cooled not their Cannons as they muſt bee forced to doe in whot, and thereby looſe much time.</p>
            <p>At night when the laſt tyre is ſhot of and the pieces char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, they place them as if preſentlie they were to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to hinder them which are beſieged from repayring any breach which is done by ſhooting of euerie piece by it ſelfe in the night at ſuch hower as is convenient.</p>
            <p>In this time if the diche be drye, may be viewed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniries, and caſamates which are within it, and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which the ruine of the batterie hath wrought, and if it holde water, they to deuiſe to let it out if the grounde will ſerue for it, or to drain it with engins for the purpoſe, or to ſtopp it vp with Fagotts, or fill it with earth, as I haue ſeene it in a ſiege,<note place="margin">Forme of bridges,</note> &amp; to make readie if it hold any depthe, bridges, which are to be thrown in for the aſſalte made of Barrelles, Barkes, and ſhip-maſtes: the throwing of them in being a matter of ſufficient peril, and great danger for a generall to commaunde an aſſalt to be giuen before he haue well view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the batterie, and the traueſſes quited, vſing all diligence in this: albeit it is true that the traueſſes where the harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſerie and muſketerie may be ſett in ſuch places as are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, can hardlie be quitted by the enimie, and in caſe the diſpoſition of the place be of ſuch ſorte, as he muſt be faine to looſe them, at the inſtant he will treat of the deliuerie of them vp, knowing if he be a ſouldior, that without them he can not be able to defend the entrie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:12957:53"/>It is likewiſe to be conſidered that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diches where the batterie is made, holde much water, it is not onely verie perillous to throwe in the bridges, but moſt daungerous to giue the aſſalte on that parte, becauſe that the depth of the diche ſwalloweth vp the ruine of the batterie, in ſuch ſorte as the head of the bridge can haue no faſtening, or giue anie commoditie at all by this for the ſoldiors at the aſſalte to be able to finde anie place in the breach, where they may ioine togither to fight againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within, wherby it is a very hard matter to be able to runne vp ſkattered, or to enter firſt in, if they within haue any courage at all to defende them ſelues, becauſe that the bredth of the bridges which are caſt in, are not capable aboue fiue ſouldiors to marche in front, and ſo fewe of the firſt come to fight, except they holde a place in the breach, for thoſe which followe them to doe as much: &amp; ſo thoſe which ſtand vpon their defence within become more ſuperior, and holde greater aduantage, by the place which they occupie, and the ſoldiors which are to giue the aſſalte, goe cloſe togither on the bridge, being thicke vppon the bancke of the diche, ſeruing onely as a marke for thoſe vpon the walles to ſhoote at without being able to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie annoyance by fighting.

            <p>The batterie being well viewed,<note place="margin">Order for to giue an aſſalte.</note> and <hi>Y.H.</hi> reſolued to haue the aſſalte giuen, you are to giue order to ſuch nation, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and Campe maiſter as muſt be of the vanguarde, In which is to be conſidered, that it be recommended to ſuch leaders and ſouldiors as haue a deſire to fight, ſhewing their determination and courage, willing to enter into any daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> particular order muſt be giuen, that in clyming

vp to the highe of the breach, they runne vp the wall, if the diſpoſition of the place will permitt it, which is that, that moſt aſſureth the entrie, and ſo likewiſe the reſt which are to followe the vanguard, all ſtanding armed in readines within the trenches.</p>
            <p>In ſome aſſaltes the ſouldiors haue ben neceſſarilie faine to vſe ladders, which is a ſigne that the batterie is not good, and the generall enforced (coſt what coſt mought) to take the town, or retire him ſelfe from it, the which he muſt bee conſtrained to doe, attempting it with ſo great daunger for to auoyde a greater inconuenience, a matter which <hi>Y.H.</hi> muſt by all meanes ſeeke to ſhunne.</p>
            <p>To withdrawe the men into the trenches, <hi>Y.H.</hi> is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that the reſt of the Armie, as well cauallerie as fante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, put them ſelues into battell, and ſquadrons within the markett place, with whom the Campe maiſter general is to be readie prepared, if the enimie ſhould come to combatt the quarters, which ought to ſtande well fortified, to ſtoppe him, and giue impediment to his attempt, and likewiſe to renforce the men, that by one or two wayes they may giue vpon him, and to refreſh them, if it be neceſſarie with ſome tierce, regiment, or collours, giuing them charge to attempt a freſhe: and in caſe that the beſieged putt backe the men from the aſſault, if they retire, it is eaſilie to be beleeued, that it will be done with diſorder and ſcattering, for that it is not poſſible they ſhould doe it otherwiſe, and if they within the towne with a new harte of grace, ſhould make anie ſalie out of the ſame breach, as hath bene ſometimes ſeene, you may not thinke to gather thoſe again togither which are retired to turne back to charge them, but to doe it with thoſe ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons and men that remaine in the markett place: thinges which are preuented by keeping the reſt of the Armie in battaile.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is to be conſidered, that when the ſouldiours
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12957:54"/>
come to ſtande pike to pike, and at hande ſtroakes with the enimie, it may fall out that they can not enter, and ſo it is meete to holde the harquebuſerie and muſketerie in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wherwith to furniſhe a newe the trenches, to the ende that they may ſhoote liuelelie from thence, in caſe the men be commaunded to retire from the aſſalte, and in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor as the enimie doe not only not take vpon him to charge them, but that he be not ſo hardie as to diſcouer him ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Y.H.</hi> hauing theſe things in readines, and your men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen in ſuch ſorte home to their trenches, &amp; the reſt ſett in battaile, the generall &amp; officers of the artillerie are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe <hi>Y.H.</hi> euery moment of the eſtate of the breach, and which ſhalbe their laſt tyre, which the gunners terme clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſweeping of the breach, &amp; what defenſes the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie may haue made, to the end that <hi>Y.H.</hi> who are to be on horſe backe, and in ſuch a place, if it be poſſible, as you may diſcouer both batteries, ſhould make a ſigne at the inſtant when the laſt Cannon ſhould be ſhott of, as <hi>Y.H.</hi> to hold vp the ſame handquerchef at your armes ende, and when that can not be, then ſome tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet to ſound which is wel known.</p>
            <p>For to aſſalt the men goe in troupes, euerie one vſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence according to ſuch valor, boldnes, and experience of aſſaltes as he hath, and while they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to clyme the breach, the ſmall pieces are to playe if there be anie, and the harquebuſerie haſtelie from the trenches, occupying the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie ſo, as he diſcouer them not vntill they come pyke to pyke with him, and the ſoldiours to hande ſtrokes, and then to ceaſe ſhooting, and the generall of the Artillerie to keepe his pieces ſtill charged and appointed for what ſoeuer may fal out, ſhooting off if it be neceſſarie ſome times a thwarte in caſe the enimie in time of the aſſalte, chaunce to diſcouer him ſelfe, which ſometimes falleth out hauing kept him ſelf cloſe before, &amp; being verie requiſite to ſhoote at the breach whereby the enimie vpon the ſouldiours retreat, not being

By this occaſion the ſoldiours are wonte ſometime to finde what hath endemnified them, and battering anew to giue the ſecond and third aſſalt: at other times they gett place in the breach walles or towres where to defend them ſelues couertlie, going before with <note place="margin">In al mines at the end of that there muſt bee a place made ether round or ſquare wher the ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rels of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt be laid.

thoſe which are beſt of ſaile doe fitt their ſayles in ſtriking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lower, wherby they come to make no more way; the ſluggie ſeeking to gaine the winde on both ſides to fight, &amp; to come in order of battailes before written, to borde, which is that which moſt importeth at ſea, he which hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the winde being able to giue a greater thruſt at bording, and to caſt the ſmoke of his artillerie vpon the contrarie ſhipp, and to helpe him with more advantage by the fires, anoying the other thereby, and in caſe he liſt to ſhoote at the enimie before bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; he may commodiouſlie doe it, by reaſon of the winde, diſcharging both his brode ſides at the time of his bordinge, which is where the ſhippes carry moſt pieces: and to preuent this he which findeth him ſelfe able in the burthen of his ſhippes and number of men to borde, goeth aſſoone as euer he hath gotten the winde, with the greateſt ſpeed he can in a fronte to doe it, and if he be deſirous to ſhunne bording, by reaſon his ſhippes be lower, he entertayneth time ſhooting of ſtill his Tyres by making Bordes, which is to annoy the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie, without aduenturing to come to hande ſtrokes with him, for the diſaduantage which he knoweth he ſhall gett by it, not hauing ſo high ſhippes, nor multitude of ſouldiours, whoſe handes and force vpon bording getteth the victorie, becauſe they diſcharge no other artillerie then Cannons pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and ſmal pieces in their vpper works where they vſe not alreadie ſlinges, ſhooting of all the artillerie he can at ſuch time as he is readie to borde, when bullets worke moſt effect, and almoſt none at all before, the reſt being but ſhort into the ayre, of which great conſideration is to be had. For this cauſe ſome are of opinion, if the winde ſerue, that the Capitana ſhould delay bording him ſelfe, vntill the reſt of the ſhippes had done, and in the meane time to be able to ſuccour, wher need ſhould moſt require, gouerning him ſelf therin, as they doe vpon the lande in dayes of battayle, where the Generalls ſquadron is the laſt which commeth to ſhocke. A particular
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12957:86"/>
in which a great inconuenience ceaſſeth not to offer it ſelfe, and that is, that at ſea euery ſhippe is to fight by it ſelfe, and to be a matter of greateſt moment for obtayning of the victory to get ſome one of the enimies in as ſhort time as may be, for which of force they are to gage their greateſt and ſtrongeſt ſhippes at firſt, to come to hande ſtrokes, and to ſeeke out the Capitanas, which by reaſon ought to be the beſt ſhippes on both ſides; and in ſhippes it is not the harte of the Captaine, which goeth in them that gouerneth them, but the Maiſter or Pilote taketh many times occaſion thorough their owne cowardiſe to put of the Capitana from bording, with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution which the Generall deſireth: And likewiſe that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is moſt conuenient, is, to haue the Capitana of the firſte ſhippes to borde the Capitana of the enimies armie, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome other to ſuccour her, if neede ſhould bee. In the iudgement of the greateſt Mariners and ſoldiers at ſea, when there is an vnequalitie in the number of ſhippes, they eſteme it a matter ouer daungerous to fight with them, groundinge them ſelues vpon this, that one ſhip is but to fight with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the aduantage in number doth eaſilie make them to fight two againſt one, and if they chaunce to yeelde, yet ſhee muſt be faine to come to helpe the reſt, and therfore they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer blame any that ſhall refuſe to fight with like diſadua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, and if one doe it, and winne, yet doe they holde him for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueruenturous, and of no great gouernement, when the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his ſhipps &amp; men be not anſwerable to the number of the reſt. Theſe the mariners affirme to be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations of greateſt importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in giuing of battaile, diſpoſing it ſo, as one ſhippe may borde another without puſling two againſt one, except they be more in number, looking into the qualitie of the pieces of artillerie which the enimie carieth, and whether his ſhippes be buylded to be able to ſerue with it or no, with two or three tyres on the ſides, according to the burthen of ſuch ſhips, and whether they be of braſſe or the greater parte

            <p>In time paſt they kept a great ſturr in arming the topps for the miſchief which was done to the enimie therby, and now they doe not hold it to be of ſo great moment, ſince muſkete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is growne in vſe, againſt which they which ſtande in the tops can hardlie defend themſelfes, and as men which ſtand naked are hurt eaſelie. For this cauſe they fit them ſelues bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by placing blinders to couer their men, ſaue ſuch onlie as are neceſſarie for the gouernement of the ſhippe, and the reſt to abyde in their places, preſeruing them ſelues as long as they can before they come to the puſh of the pike. This ſame, &amp; to procure that the poope and prowe may be reared for to combat and defend the entrie, hath made to heythen them with bords on both ſides, making them hollow, a little leſſe then a geometrical foot, filling vp the hollow with ould netts of fiſhermen, that may ſerue to be of muſkett prooffe, without clogging the ſhip much with carging, &amp; when ſhips haue a long time grapeled, ſeeing themſelues run a ground, and not able to enter to make her yeeld, by reaſon that her poope is ſo high, they vſe to caſt out of them vpon the other ſhippe, aſhes, ſcalding oyle, and molten lead, to anoy thoſe which ſtande defending vpon the decke, and running tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the ſhrowdes to offende the reſt.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe defend with woolbeds &amp; bolſters, or wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſackes, if there be anie, thoſe places in the ſhippes which are moſt conuenient at ſuch time as they goe to fight, ordayning after that the men ſtande beſtowed in the fower principall places, that they fight in order, and not running them ſelues out of breath: for that it hath fallen out after grapeling, that ſhippes haue fought without being able to iudge which was likelieſt to haue the victorie, a whole day and a night, &amp; more time too, &amp; ſerued their turne with wildefire vpon good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, becauſe if one haue not the winde, it is a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

miſchiefe to fling fier into his enimie, his owne ſhippe being likelie to take it, and very hardlie able to loſe him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>It may ſometime fall out to be in an harbor, and that a more powerfull enemie commeth to fight, in this caſe it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into conſideration, according as the harbor is, in which he findeth you, whether it be friend or enimie. Being enimie they muſt in reaſon ancker where they are likelieſt to receiue leaſt annoyance from the lande, and make them ſelues readie to fight at ſea, one ſhipp comming as neare to the other as is poſſible to be ioyned togither, by this meanes ſtanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to defende them ſelues on all partes, keeping a ſhipp or pynnes at ſea for watch, to giue notice of ſuch as they ſhould deſcrie: if it be friend, then doe they put the poopes of their ſhippes as neare ſhoare as they can, and as cloſe one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the weather ſeruing for it, becauſe by doing thus, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie ſhall not dare to come neare them, for feare leaſt their ſhippes runne a ground, for that they can not be able to ſtaie them comming vnder ſayle ſo neare the ſhoare without ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or caſting Anchor, and the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the place ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, they drawe Artillerie a ſhoare to defende the ſhippes withall, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it reacheth further &amp; with better marke, Being a calme, if the ſhippes can ſtande very cloſe togither, they put bridges ouer one another to ſuccor them ſelues by, and lanche their ſquiffes and barkes into the ſea to ſtopp that no enimie come to cutt the cables of their anchors, nor to ſet their ſhipps on fire, and when the tyde and winde ſerueth, to keepe anie from ſending ſhipps with artificiall fiers, &amp; mynes wrought in them, which when the fire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the mynes ſhould blow vp huge ſtones, and other like things put vppon the topp of the worke thereof: with which it doeth not only great annoyance, but burning it ſelfe, ſetteth all the reſt on fier that commeth neare. Theſe boates are to carrie artillerie, and ſome bring blinders to fight the better with them, and to keepe away ſhippes of ſuch fyres and inuentions, where no
