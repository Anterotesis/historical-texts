            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as the doublet fell, neater inuentions beganne to set vp. Now in the time of sprucenes, our plaies followe the nicenes of our Garments, single plots, quaint conceits, letcherous iests, drest vp in hanging sleeues, and those are fit for the Times, and the Tearmers: Such a kind of light-colour Summer stuffe, mingled with diuerse colours, you shall finde this published Comedy, good to keepe you in an afternoone from dice, at home in your chambers; and for venery you shall finde enough, for sixepence, but well coucht and you marke it. For <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> being a woman passes through the play in doublet and breeches, a braue disguise and a safe one, if the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute vnty not her cod-peece point.

               <l>Last day I met</l>

               <l>A debt of iust so many yeares as these,</l>
               <l>Which I owe to my graue, the man you all know.</l>

               <l>Nay you shall pardon me,</l>
               <l>But when he saw me (with a sigh that brake,</l>
               <l>Or seem'd to breake his heart-strings) thus he spake:</l>
               <l>Oh my good knight, saies he, (and then his eies</l>
               <l>Were richer euen by that which made them poore,</l>

               <l>Blessings to raine vpon mine house and me:</l>

               <l>I nere had but one cause to curse my starres,</l>

               <l>He paus'd, and as we often see,</l>
               <l>A sea so much becalm'd, there can be found</l>
               <l>No wrinckle on his brow, his waues being drownd</l>
               <l>In their owne rage: but when th'imperious wind,</l>
               <l>Vse strange inuisible tyranny to shake</l>
               <l>Both heauens and earths foundation at their noyse:</l>

               <l>The picture of a woman (euery part,</l>
               <l>Limb'd to the life) hung out the peece to sell:</l>

               <l>Gaue seuerall verdicts on it. some dispraised</l>
               <l>The haire, some sayd the browes too high were raised,</l>
               <l>Some hit her o're the lippes, mislik'd their colour,</l>
               <l>Some wisht her nose were shorter; some, the eyes fuller,</l>
               <l>Others sayd roses on her cheekes should grow,</l>
               <l>Swearing they lookt too pale, others cry'd no,</l>
               <l>The workeman still as fault was found, did mend it,</l>
               <l>In hope to please all; (but this worke being ended)</l>
               <l>And hung open at stall, it was so vile,</l>
               <l>So monstrous and so vgly all men did smile</l>
               <l>At the poore Painters folly. Such wee doubt</l>
               <l>Is this our Comedy, Some perhaps do floute</l>
