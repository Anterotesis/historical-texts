            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat the wonders of the Deep are infinite, and
that the water doth afford more various and
ſundry kinds of Monſters then the earth, is
undeniable; In confirmation of which Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hapned, that Upon the Eleventh of this inſtant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,
ſome Fiſhermen and other Watermen being at a
place called Rainham Creek below Graveſend, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
(to their admiration) three Fiſhes (or rather
Sea Monſters) of a huge magnitnde and greatneſs, roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and tumbling in the water, whoſe huge unwe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Watermen were amazed to ſee it: whereupon they call

               </gap>ny more to their aſſiſtance, and with Harping
irons, Fiſh ſpears, and anchors they reſove to uſe their

               </gap>heir boats, before the leaſt of the three

               </gap> to Sea again. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two they full followed, and ever as they ſaw an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
they wounded them with their fatal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and weapons.</p>
            <p>Theſe Monſters of Nature, when they felt the ſmart
of the wounds they received, they would ever and anon
ſend forth whole flouds of water like clouds into the air,
with a kind of a ſpouting trunk wh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch they had, much
like in form to that of an Elephants: For not to make
any digreſſion, as the Elephant is the Behemoth of the
earth; ſo the Whale is the Leviathan in the Seas. And
as the Scripture ſaith, Out of his noſtrils goeth ſmoak,
as out of a ſeething pot or cauldron. He maketh the
Sea like a pot of ointment. But to return where we
left; The Watermen and Fiſhermen ſtill purſuing they
drive them up by degrees towards Graveſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, the Fiſh
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153628:5"/>
ſtill ſpouting forth great quantities of water into the
air, as they ſwim along. So that it was pleaſant ſight
to all the beholders, that ſaw the purſuit, eſpecially to
thoſe that did not come within the reach of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>By that time they were come to Grave<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the two (which was ſaid to be a Whale) had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ived
his mortel wound, which they haled to ſhore, and
after they had expoſed him to the view of Thouſands of
people, they hewed him in pieces with axes, and boyl'd
him in cauldrons for his oyl, which doth amount to a
good ſum of money.</p>
            <p>Thus having diſpatched the one, with great eagerneſs
they follow the chaſe of the other, ſtill more and more
people flocking, ſome to look on, and others to aid and
aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>The concourſe of people thus gathering together,
as if it had been to deſtroy ſome Publick Enemy, by
little and little, at the laſt they force him up as high as
Greenwich; where with the Fluke of an Anchor they
give him a large and grievous wound, which diſabled
him from ſwimming any further; then with Ropes, or
Pulleys, they hoiſe him into a Hoy, or Lighter; when
upon view they find, that it was not a young Whale,
but a Grampus: However, it is a Fiſh of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Magnitude, as all that ſee it can teſtifie. Having
laid him in the Hold of the Veſſel, to the admiration of
the Beholders, his wound began to purge with Bloud,
Oyl, and Water, in ſuch abundance, that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to throw it out by great Bucket fulls, the Bloud
and Oyl ſtill boiling fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh, as if it had been a Pot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a very hot fire.</p>
            <p>The news of the taking of this ſtrange Fiſh at
Greenwich, being nois'd all over London, cauſed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of people to reſort thither to take a view, and
for their own ſatisfaction, to be eye-witneſſes of its
huge proportion and greatneſs, they procure a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153628:5"/>
to take the meaſure of him, who found him to
be one and twenty foot long, and ſixteen foot over,
which I think you cannot deny but it is of a vaſt length
and bigneſs; yet it is certainly affirmed, that the other
which was taken at Graveſend was full as big again as
this.</p>
            <p>The Citizens, and others of all ſorts flocking thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are more numerous upon the way, by ten times,
then if they were going either to Fair or Market, ſome
going, and others coming; ſo that it cannot chuſe but
make well for the Town of Greenwich, verifying the
old Proverb, that it is an ill wind that blows no body
profit.</p>
            <p>There are many of the people deſirous to cut pieces
out of his ſide, which is granted to then; and it is
obſerveable, that the Fiſh cuts very fat, and as white as
a handkerchief: If the weather had been cool, they
might a kept him expos'd to view the longer, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt they might have got a great deal more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but he being of a fat, and Oyly ſubſtance, was
preſently corrupt, and putrified in this hot weather.</p>
            <p>It is conject<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
