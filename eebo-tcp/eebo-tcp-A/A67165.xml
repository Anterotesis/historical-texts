         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of this Great Embassy, in the

Your Gracious Acceptance.</p>

THE EARL OF
Castlemaine's Embassy,
To His Holiness,
INNOCENT XI<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T having still been the Custom
of all the Great Princes, in
Communion with the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> (on their first acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Throne) to send an
Embassador to that Court, His Majesty thought
it became Him also to do the like; And in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
thereof, among the number of able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which (to the glory of the English Nation)
this Court never wanted, none (with all due
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51905:5"/>
respect to the rest) stood fairer in His Majestys
eye, for that Negotiation, than The Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
<hi>Roger</hi> Earl of <hi>Castlemaine,</hi> A Nobleman
of an Antient Family, Polite Learning, ready
parts, and who, by a well-digested Travel, and
Experience in Forreign Courts, had render'd
himself qualifi'd, for the greatest Trust.</p>
            <p>On him therefore, as a person <hi>Parem Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis,</hi>
His Majesty conferr'd the Honour, of His
Embassador Extraordinary to His Holiness <hi>Innocent</hi>
the XI<hi rend="sup">th,</hi> now Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> A Prince, whose
open hand, to the Late Defence of Christendom,
may (to pass his other Vertues) put it out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
whether He received more Honour from
The Chair, than He has added to it.</p>
            <p>In short, all preliminary matters being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed,
and his Commission, and Credentials re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
His Excellence The Lord Embassador,
made ready for his Journey; and having form'd
his English Retinue, of seven Gentlemen, six Pages,
three Valets de Chamber, and such other menial
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51905:5"/>
servants, and equipage, as could be then got
ready, most of them were shipt off, about six
weeks before him, for <hi>Leghorne,</hi> with Orders to
wait him there; himself having resolv'd, to make
his Journey through <hi>France:</hi> And that, that, might
be the easier, His Excellence took to him as his
companions, The Honourable <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr>
Grandson to the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder,</hi> now Lord
Privy-Seal; <hi>Henry Tichburne</hi> Esq; eldest Son of
Sir <hi>Henry Tichburne,</hi> Liev<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> of the Ordnance; The
Honourable <hi>Thomas Ratcliffe</hi> Esq; Son of the Lord
<hi>Ratcliffe; Barth. Walmesley,</hi> of <hi>Dunkan-Hall,</hi> in the
County of <hi>Lancaster</hi> Esq; And <hi>Tho. Eggleston,</hi> of <hi>Eggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
in the same County Esq; (which three last, went
before, and met his Lordship at <hi>Paris)</hi> And having
taken leave of their Majestys, there remain'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but to set forward on his Journey.</p>
            <p>On the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1685. S. V. His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
took water for <hi>Greenwich,</hi> accompany'd with
several Noble Personages, that brought him so
far on his way; where, after a hearty farewel, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51905:6"/>
the repeated Wishes, of a good Voyage, and as
safe a Return, he imbark'd on board the <hi>Heneretta
Maria</hi> Yacht, Capt. <hi>Fesby</hi> Commander, who lay
there for him, and receiv'd him, with the usual
ceremony, of fiering Guns, as in like cases.</p>
            <p>His Excellence designing to be <hi>Incognito</hi>
all the way, had none now with him, but Mr. <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Tichburne</hi> (before mentioned) Mr. <hi>Lidcott</hi>
(since that time, Sir <hi>John Lidcott)</hi> Secretary to the
Embassy; Mr. <hi>Michael Wright,</hi> Steward of his
houshold; Mr. <hi>Stephen Piper,</hi> Gentleman of his
Horse; <hi>Signior Francisco,</hi> his Italian Secretary;
Mr. <hi>Nicholas Furnys, Sewer;</hi> two Pages, two of his
Chamber; and some half a dozen others of his
Family, for his ordinary service on the Road;
and with these, the Yacht put off that Evening,
for <hi>Diepe;</hi> his Lordships Plate, Furniture, Liverys,
and other the <hi>Impedimenta</hi> of so long a Journey,
being left behind, with order to take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of the first wind, and expect further orders,
at <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> the Port of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51905:6"/>
In two days and a half his Excellence
arrived at <hi>Diepe,</hi> where, notwithstanding his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and endeavours of having past the whole
Journey, in as much privacy, as the occasion
would bear, he receiv'd the Complements, of
the Governour, and City, in a manner urging
him, that his Excellence would be pleas'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himself, and the Magistrates of that City, to
pay him some publick respect; which, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
would by no means hearken to, but sent
two of his Gentlemen to acknowledge, the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
and represent to them, the resolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Diepe,</hi> his Excellence, (with the
Gentleman of his Horse, a Page, and a Valet de
Chamber) took Post for <hi>Roan;</hi> and thence, to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
where the rest of his Servants soon after ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd:
And in the eleven days his Lordship stay'd
there, with the same resolutions, of being <hi>Incognito,</hi>
it was not yet possible, to avoid the numerous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses
that were daily made him; for (besides
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51905:7"/>
the Extraordinary Envoy of <hi>England,</hi> and the rest
of our Nation (who according to their duty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
hourly attended him) The most Eminent
<hi>Ranutzzi,</hi> Apostolick Nuntio to that Crown; the
Marshal <hi>d'Humiers,</hi> and other considerable Persons
of the French Court, were not wanting, in their
personal Visits: And here it was, that the most
Reverend Monsignior <hi>Cenci,</hi> Vice-Legat in <hi>Avignion,</hi>
first apply'd to his Excellence, that he would be
pleas'd to take that City in his way, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of such entertainment there, as might at
least testifie the satisfaction they receiv'd, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
once more, an English Embassador in that
City: Nor did the Vice-Legat think this Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
so sufficient, but that he seconded it at
<hi>Lions,</hi> and in a manner prest it, beyond the power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of a refusal: Whereupon the Lord Embassador
dispatcht Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> to <hi>Avignion,</hi> to complement
his Lordship in his name, and withall to signifie
to him, that his Excellence accepted his kindness,
provided it did not prejudice his design, of passing
privately, even to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51905:7"/>
About twenty miles short of <hi>Avignion,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> was met by the Vice-Legat's Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
where he not only waited his Excellence's
coming, but had laid all cross Roads, with a suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
attendance, lest possibly, by design, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
his Excellence might have past him, some
other way: In short, the Secretary having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the occasion of Mr. <hi>Wright</hi>'s coming, gave
him a Letter to his Lord, which, with his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence's
commands, he presented the Vice-Legat;
further assuring him, that the Lord Embassador
would be with his Lordship, within a day, or two,
after him.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the Vice-Legat order'd the
whole Garrison to be in Arms, and that all the
Cannon, should be ready for fiering, upon his
Excellence's entry; And the next afternoon went
out, toward the <hi>Roan,</hi> himself, with a noble and
splendid Equipage: The Horse with their Banner
display'd, led the way, then follow'd his Lordship
the Vice-Legat's Coach, in which, with himself,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51905:8"/>
were the Consuls, some chief Magistrates, and
Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> surrounded by a Guard of Swizts,
and a numerous train of Foot-men, in rich Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries:
Then follow'd five other of his Lordships
Coaches, and after them, about sixty others, with
the Nobility, and Principal Persons of the City
in them, and a suitable number of Laquies, and
other attendance, in which order, they march'd
to the River side, where, for near three hours,
they expected his Excellence's arrival; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appearing that evening, they return'd; and
the next day, marcht out as before, when at last,
about Sun-set, they might see a cover'd Barge,
wherein his Excellence was: On this, the Vice-Legat,
and his company lighted, and approacht
his Barge; nor had his Lordship sooner set his
foot on shore, than he made up to the Vice-Legat,
and after mutual embraces (and the Lord
Embassadors Complement, to the Nobility, and
a full shout of the people) his Excellence went
into the first Coach, with the Vice-Legat, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51905:8"/>
the Consuls, and then all march'd back, through
a multitude of Torches to the City.</p>
            <p>Upon the first entry, the Drums, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
and Joynt-voices of the people, spake his
Excellence's welcome; which was answer'd, by
the Cannon, from the Walls, and from thence
(through a Guard of Souldiers on either hand,
the Balconys and Windows, so stuck with lights,
that one would have thought the City, some new
Constellation) they came to the Pope's Pallace;
where, the Vice-Legat having conducted his
Lordship, to the richest, and noblest apartment,
left him a while, with those Noble Persons, that
had waited on him to the City; and having put
on his Prelatical habit, came back again, to make
his more solemn Visit, which his Excellence (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Vice-Legat's departure) accompany'd
with the same Nobility, return'd him again, in
his own appartment.</p>
            <p>During this time, the Vice-Legat had
invited those English Cavaliers (that accompany'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51905:9"/>
the Embassador) with two chief Military Officers,
and ten Principal Officers of the City, to bear
his Excellence company, at Supper, which was no
less sumptuous, than magnificent: It consisted
of four services, each, of nine grand Dishes, and
fourteen Inter-messes, and to render it yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it wanted not the pride of the Italian Musick.</p>
            <p>About the middle of Supper, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
began A health to His Holiness, at which,
He, and all the company stood bare-headed, and
six great Guns were fire'd; which in all respects,
was as punctually observ'd, when the Vice-Legat
return'd it, in A health to our Soveraign, The
King of Great <hi>Britain;</hi> Nor is it to be forgotten,
that during this time of Supper, his Excellence's
Gentlemen, were nobly treated, in another Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment.</p>
            <p>The day following, being the <hi>Feast of the
Annuntiation,</hi> the Vice-Legat, and the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Noble Persons, conducted his Excellence,
to High Mass, in the Jesuits Church of that City;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51905:9"/>
where, after a most solemn, vocal, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Musick, the young Nobility, Scholars of
the Colledge, presented the Lord Embassador,
with Devises, Epigrams, and other compositions,
more immediately relating to His Majesty, and
His Dominions; such few of which, as they came
to hand, were thought fit to be inserted, and
that, the rather, because the English Nation (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
discontinu'd, this last Century) had once, a
more than ordinary Genius, and aptness, that
way; as he that shall turn <hi>Hall</hi>'s <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Sir
<hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> or <hi>Cambden</hi>'s Remains, may find much
of this kind, and (perhaps) not unworthy his
time. And they, were such as these.</p>
            <p>A Stock of Bees, flying to an empty
Hive, the King-Bee in their Head. The word
<hi>(unde aberraverant)</hi> Whence they had fled astray.
Intimating thereby, the general defection of His
Majestys Kingdoms, and voluntary return, to
their former obedience.</p>
            <p>A Kite, hovering in the Air, and Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51905:10"/>
running under the Hen. The word <hi>(—Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persos
congregat—)</hi> It gathers 'em again. Denoting
thereby, The good effects of His Majestys Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
when all His Subjects, how divided soever
among themselves, run under His wing for shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
against the Tyranny of those Penal Laws,
which, have either disperst them into other
Countreys, or made them uneasie at home.</p>
            <p>The morning Star. The word <hi>(—Diei
praevius almae)</hi>—Forerunner of the Day. Shewing
thereby, That the Day is not far behind; And
that His Majestys Subjects (since the Day-spring
from on High, had visited them) want not a Light,
to guide their feet, into the way of peace.</p>
            <p>A Ship half foundring in the Sea, The
Polar-Star in the Clouds: The word <hi>(Dum videam
satis est—)</hi> 'tis yet enough I see 't—signifying
thereby, that <hi>England</hi> (which may be well exprest
by a Ship) can never miscarry, whilst she sees her
great Monarch, or <hi>Cynosure,</hi> to direct her.</p>
            <p>These, and the like, not without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51905:10"/>
Elogies, to the Lord Embassador, were the
entertainment of the morning; and that over,
the whole company return'd to the Palace, where,
a Dinner, even superiour to the Supper, waited
them, and that, so beautifully garnisht, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt
Figures, relating to the Triumphs of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that the like, had been scarce there before,
or to be seen any where again, if his Excellence
the Lord Embassador, had made no entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that it might not be said of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
as once of <hi>Rome,</hi> That they were <hi>(Populus viro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
deerant faeminae)</hi> A people of men, without
women, It was resolv'd among the noble Ladys
of the City, to make the Complement entire, by
bearing a part in the Symphony; And to that
purpose, they met in the house of <hi>Signior de Blewac,</hi>
a principal Gentleman of that City, and therein
too, so gloriously attir'd, as they had design'd a
contest, between Art, and Nature; for could they
have wanted Luster in themselves, the splendor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51905:11"/>
of their Jewels, spake them no less, than clad in
Star-light.</p>
            <p>In short, they made his Excellence, and
the Persons of Honour with him, an invitation to
an evening divertisement of Cards, which his
Lordship accepted; and after an hour or two's
mirth, took leave, and retir'd to the Palace, where
he was honour'd with a splendid Banquet, and
the morning following, with another, in regard
his Excellence had refus'd, the Vice-Legat's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
violences, of having detained him longer;
but nothing prevailing, he was attended out of
the City, with the same solemnity he first entred
it; nor could the Vice-Legat be perswaded to
look back, till he had conducted his Excellence
six miles on his way; where at last, the Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawn up, the Coaches stopt, and all the train
allighting, they made a circle about his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and the Vice-Legat; when after mutual
embraces, and the Pathetick acknowledgments,
of the obligations receiv'd, his Excellence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51905:11"/>
mounted the Vice-Legat's first Coach, and set
forward to <hi>Cavaillon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was his Lordship sooner arriv'd
there, than the Magistrates honour'd him with a
solemn Visit, Speech, and Banquet; so difficult it
was to pass any way, but the report of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
flew before him.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cavaillon</hi> his Excellence came by
Litter to St. <hi>Massimine;</hi> thence to <hi>Canes,</hi> and thence,
to <hi>Nizza,</hi> where he took boat for <hi>Genoa;</hi> But pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by <hi>Monaco,</hi> the Master of the <hi>Felucca,</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to come on shore, and so discover'd whom
he had aboard; on which, he was stopt, till ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was sent to the Prince, who immediately
dispatcht his Secretary, and a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi>
to invite his Excellence to his Castle; which, his
Lordship (with due sense of the obligation) refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
sent Mr. <hi>Lidcott</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his Highness, with his acknowledgments of
the honour intended him, and to further signifie,
the Lord Embassadors resolutions, of passing <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51905:12"/>
However, the Prince would take no denyal,
but came in person to the water side, and having
at last prevail'd, conducted his Excellence to his
Palace, or Castle, scituated on an impregnable
Rock, (Drums, and Trumpets sounding, and
great Guns fireing) where the magnificence of
of that night, and the next morning, came short
in nothing, of Him that made it: Nor would his
Highness yet suffer his Lordship to depart, till
Himself, his Court, and Officers, had brought
him to the <hi>Felucca;</hi> the Guns not giving over, till
the Boat was out of sight.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Monaco,</hi> the Lord Embassador past
St. <hi>Remo, Nola,</hi> and <hi>Savona,</hi> without much trouble;
and at last arriv'd at <hi>Genoa,</hi> where the most serene
Republick sent three of their Gentlemen, of the
first quality <hi>(Spinola, Grimaldo,</hi> and <hi>Durazzo)</hi> to
complement his Excellence, and (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his privacy) to shew him the Town: They
proffer'd him also a Gally to <hi>Civita Veccia;</hi> which
last civility, being (with all respect) refus'd, his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51905:12"/>
Lordship from <hi>Genoa,</hi> came to <hi>Ligorne,</hi> where His
Eminence, Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
sent, the Gentleman of his Horse, to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his Excellence in his name, and wait on him
to the End of his Journey: Cap<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
               <hi>Nangle</hi> also (on
the part of the Grand Duke) and Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> (with
the English Factory) stood ready to receive him
at his landing, and to conduct him (as they did)
to the house, which his Highness had order'd for
Him; There his Lordship found not only all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Provisions, but a splendid Regal, of very
curious Wines and Sweet-meats; for which Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
(so natural to that Great Prince) his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
sent him next day (by the Secretary of
the Embassy) his Acknowledgment and Thanks
to <hi>Ambrogiana</hi> (about thirty miles off) and then
took Post for <hi>Rome;</hi> lying at <hi>Montefiascone,</hi> in hopes
of having pass'd <hi>Viterbo</hi> early, and undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd:
But he could not out-do the Diligence
of Monsignior <hi>Vincentini</hi> the Governour, who
met him some miles out of Town, and bringing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51905:13"/>
him to the Palace, gave him a very great and
noble Collation.</p>
            <p>Three Posts distant from <hi>Rome,</hi> his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
was met, by a Coach and six Horses, from
his Eminence, the Cardinal of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> the next
Post, by another from her Highness the Dutchess
of <hi>Modena</hi> (Mother to Her Majesty) in which, was
the Count <hi>Codebo</hi> her Secretary; and one other,
from the Resident of <hi>Portugal,</hi> with some of his
Gentlemen in it; as also with one of my Lord
Embassador's own Coaches, made for him, against
his arrival.</p>
            <p>A little on this side <hi>Ponte Molle</hi> (being a
mile and half short of <hi>Rome)</hi> was the Lord Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
himself, with Signior <hi>Paolo Falconieri,</hi> (a Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentin
Gentleman, that had been in <hi>England</hi> with
the Duke) and afterwards (nor undeservedly) in
high esteem with his Excellence: Here, after the
usual complements and ceremonies were ended,
the Lord Embassador went into the Cardinal's
Coach, and so came together, to his Eminence's
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51905:13"/>
Palace in <hi>Rome,</hi> upon <hi>Easter</hi> Eve, S. N. about an
hour after Sun-set; where, Himself, and Family,
were magnificently treated, for about ten days,
till Prince <hi>Pamphilio</hi>'s Pallace, in the <hi>Piazza Navona,</hi>
could be put in order, for his Excellence's
service.</p>
            <p>His Excellence was no sooner thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
but the Grandees began their Complements
of Congratulation, by their Secretaries, which
lasted for three days, and then my Lord return'd
them in like manner, his thanks; it not being the
Custom of <hi>Rome,</hi> for Persons of that Rank, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
or give Personal Visits, except privately and
underhand, till they have publickly waited on
His Holiness.</p>
            <p>About the <hi>Wednesday</hi> after, his Excellence
(being now a little reposed) sent to the Pope for
a private Audience, which was granted him, the
following week; and then taking four of his own
ordinary Coaches, and some few Domesticks, he
was in the evening conducted by Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51905:14"/>
to the Vatican Palace, and so by the back-stairs
to His Holiness; who (as it may be easily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd)
receiv'd him with particular satisfaction,
and to the great Joy also of all the People, who in
no small numbers got together; tho' usually such
Audiences are perform'd without any noise or
stir: And when his Excellence was return'd home,
he found the Pope's Master of the houshold, with
several of his under-officers there attending, who
had brought the presents of welcome, <hi>viz.</hi> All
sorts of Fowl, Wines, Sweet-meats, and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies
of that nature.</p>
            <p>These preliminaries being now settled,
and past, his Excellence fell upon the most
troublesome part of his Embassy; I mean, his
Equipage, and preparations for his publick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
Troublesome I may call it, since Embassadors
in this Court, have exceeded in splendor and
magnificence, all the world besides; and whether
his Lordship kept not up the Port and Dignity of
his great Master, the Reader is to judge by what
follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51905:14"/>
This Equipage (besides what was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
prepar'd) consisted in stupendous Coaches,
most rich Liveries, and store of Horses, of great
value; and because the Brocard, Imbroidery,
gold Lace, Fringe, Scarlet, &amp;c. were all to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken,
'twas easily foreseen, that the said Entry
could not be at soonest, before <hi>Michaelmas;</hi> In the
mean time, tho' the Embassador could not visit,
and be visited, with the same Pomp, as when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
yet his ordinary Expence was the same; for
he weekly attended the Pope, had the same nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Family, and Retinue, kept the same Table
for his Friends and Acquaintance, and had about
forty Horses, still in his Stable.</p>
            <p>Artizans in all places have the same
methods, and perform their promises alike; for
how pressing soever his Excellency's Officers were,
they could not yet be ready, till the end of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi>
and just when every thing was thought fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht,
the Pope fell so ill of the Gout, and his
usual Defluxions, that two months past, without
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51905:15"/>
his giving Audience to any stranger, no, not to
the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> himself, who arriving at <hi>Rome,</hi>
in <hi>November,</hi> could not receive his Benediction,
till the beginning of the following <hi>January;</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time, his Excellence had the great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and satisfaction, of often seeing a Prince, so
every way accomplish't, and one too, that was
infinitely kind, and obliging to him.</p>
            <p>His Holiness being now recover'd, and
the eighth of <hi>January</hi> appointed for this great
Solemnity, it will not be perchance ungrateful
to the Reader (since the Preparations and Pomp
of it consisted in the Pope's, and King's Arms, in
the Coaches, Liveries and Attendance) if before
I further proceed, I describe first in words the
Particulars, and then shew the Draught, and
Pictures of them.</p>
            <p>The Wood-work on which the respective
Arms were painted, and placed, were 24 foot high,
and 16 broad; the edges of it being carv'd, or cut
out, according to the Parts of the Figures that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51905:15"/>
reach'd thitherward; The Boards were not only
brac't, and kept together, with several great
Beams, but had above 800 weight of Iron about
them, so that being lifted up with great labour
and pains, to the first story, they had the breadth
of the Palace-Gate between them; and beneath,
just over the Gate, stood the Arms of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in a Round, about two yards diameter, and
encompass'd with great Branches of carv'd Palms,
painted proper.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Arms of His Holiness were as followeth.</head>
               <p>They were painted by a diligent hand,
not in black and white, but in their proper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
those places only excepted, which were
covered, and shadowed with Gold; not transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
however, the order of the design; and plac't
on an elevated piece of Architecture, on each
side whereof, stood an Angel supporting the
gilded compartment, with interwoven Palms, and
Lawrels, the top of which was crown'd, with A
Triple Crown, the Pontificial Keys, and Cordons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:51905:16"/>
Under the Arms, as in a large Plain, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
in a Pedestal, were divers Figures,
double the life; the first of which, represented
the Church, in a grave majestick female Figure,
cloathed in white, girt about her; A transparent
Veil, and a Glory round her Head; her
feet naked, with Sandals; her upper Garment, a
rich Mantle, embroider'd with Gold; in her right
hand (leaningupon an Antique Altar, in which, in
<hi>Basso Rilievo,</hi> was exprest, the Manna of old, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the Children of <hi>Israel)</hi> she held a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
Staff, and extended the other, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Britannia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Altar, lay the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
on a Cushion of Crimson Velvet; and beside
it, the figure of a Church, by which stood, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable,
aged personage, with a flaming Lamp, in
his hand erected, representing piety; And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Churches feet, A Mufti, in a posture of
rage, and despair; the Alcoran in his hand, ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled,
and torn; and by him, a vanquisht <hi>Bassa,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51905:16"/>
his Ensigns, of Bows, Arrows, Scimiters, Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> all reverst.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Britannia,</hi> was a female figure, A mural
(or embattled) Crown, on her head, and A (Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vick
Garland, or) Wreath of Oak-leaves, about
her temples; cloathed in a Royal Robe, lin'd
with Ermins; her Scepter, and Globe, on which,
was <hi>Britannia,</hi> in Capital Letters, lying on a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Cushion by her; her self on the left knee,
making an obeysance to the Church, and was
attended, by prudence, and valour.</p>
               <p>Prudence, another female figure, had
her head, and breast, adorn'd with Pearl, and
in her Left hand, a staff, with a Serpent twin'd
about it.</p>
               <p>Valour, was represented by <hi>Hercules,</hi> in
a Lyon's Skin; his Club, on his Shoulder, and
trampling on envy, who with her Snakes about
her, and one twisted on her right arm, lay raving
at <hi>Britannia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Underneath that, an Oval of Gold, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51905:17"/>
by two Sphinxes, and adorn'd with Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
wherein was represented the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> by
an old man, lying at length, and leaning on an
Urne, or Vase of water; A Wreath of Reeds on
his head; in his left hand, an Oare, in his right,
A <hi>Cornucopia:</hi> On his right side, lay a Wolf, suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
two Children (the Symbole of <hi>Rome)</hi> on his

A Globe (inscrib'd <hi>Britannia)</hi> in the other; Her

against King <hi>Charles</hi> the First.</p>
               <p>On her left hand, in the middle, stood

               <p>On the other side of <hi>Hercules,</hi> was the

A rich Helmet, and plume of red Feathers, on

trampling an <hi>Hydra,</hi> which, instead of Serpentine,
had humane heads; her Wings display'd, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring

I Have done with the front, and now 'tis fit,
that I enter the Palace, which was great in it's
self, and great in his Excellences Family, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of above an 100 Persons, 60 of which were
in Livery; and those for the Pages (being eight
in number) of Crimson Velvet, their Cloaks,
Lac't above half a yard deep, with broad Gold
Lace, with little intermixtures of blew, white,
and black Silk; They were also lined with a rich
Brocard, the ground blew, with flowers of Gold;
and their habit underneath, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to wit, Dublets and Trunks, Lac't as before,
and trimm'd very thick with Gold and blew Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon:
They had all black Castors Lac't, white
Feathers; Bands, and Cuffs, of fine <hi>Genoa</hi> Point;
embroider'd Gloves, silk marble-coloured Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and gilt Swords.</p>
               <p>The other 52 Liveries, were of fine
Scarlet lin'd with silk Brocard, suitable in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and Flower, to that of the Pages; 30 of
these wore Cloaks, with the same Gold and blew
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51905:21"/>
Lace, six rows deep: The others, being running
Foot-men, and Grooms, had Coats, and Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
laid over, with the same Lace: And blew silk
Stockings, black Hats, edg'd with a broad Gold-galoon,
and gilt Swords.</p>
               <p>Besides these, and four <hi>Valets de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi>
(with under officers, of all sorts) his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
had Fifteen Gentlemen of Fashion, who
waited in his Lordships Ante-chamber, to attend
in giving, and receiving Visits; nor were these
of mean condition; there being among them, of
the <hi>Ursini, Spinola,</hi> and <hi>Bentiveglio</hi> Families; so that
'tis no wonder that the very wages his Lordship
paid, reckoning the board wages of the <hi>Italian</hi>
Servants (for they eat usually at their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
came to near 2500 pound <hi>per annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Palace it self, considering it's Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
Grandeur, Painting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is reputed the
best in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was by that Prince (a lover of
the <hi>English</hi> Nation) as well furnisht, with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask,
Velvet, and Embroidery, as Cost, or Art,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51905:21"/>
could contrive it; besides, there was a private,
well-adorn'd Chappel, and two English Chaplains
to officiate and look after it.</p>
               <p>In the Stable, his Excellence had five
compleat setts, of Coach-horses (to wit) four, for
the Town, and a lighter sett, for the Campaign,
besides several pairs, for ordinary uses, with
saddle-horses, and others for baggage and the
like; so that there wanted nothing now, to make
a full equipage, but suitable Coaches; and of
those, there were thirteen in number.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The first Coach.</head>
               <p>The design of this, was altogether poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
and alluding to the Sea; and therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the exquisite carv'd Wooden-work, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
Iron-work, not only the figures hereafter
mentioned, but the very Wheels, Pearch, and even
the meanest part of the whole (as the Pole, Swivel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
Spring, Tree Transum, &amp;c. which were carv'd
with Oak-leaves, Acorns, and Ivy-leaves) were
all, richly gilded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:51905:22"/>
The spokes of the Wheels, were carv'd
into large spreading Foliages, each spoke, being
cut out of the main timber, six Inches thick, and
nine broad; and the rings, or out-circles of the
Wheels, as also the Nails, were carv'd with Oak-leaves,
and Scollop-shells.</p>
               <p>Instead of the Fore, and Hind-standards,
the body of the Coach, was supported, by four
Tritons, as big as the life, exactly carv'd, and
gilded; having on their heads, wreaths of Sea-weeds,
and so loaden with Festons, of Roses,
Thistles, Lillies, and Acorns of Gold; that they
seem'd to bend under the Coach, as confessing
the immense weight.</p>
               <p>Under the fore-part of this Machin,
issu'd two large Dolphins, their Tails inter-woven
upon the Pearch, and all the spaces adorn'd, with
heaps of Conche-marine, Scollop-shells, and
other things, proper to the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Foot-board, represented a triple
Scollop-shell, carv'd one within another; under
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51905:22"/>
which, a little winged Genius stretcht out its self,
and looking back in the Coach-man's face, seem'd
to point with his arm, which way he was to drive.</p>
               <p>On the shoulders of the right hand
Triton behind, lean'd a large figure, representing
<hi>Britannia,</hi> crown'd with Oak-leaves, and Turrets,
and a loose Garment, flying about her.</p>
               <p>On the others, lean'd a majestick figure,
of the same bigness representing <hi>Neptune,</hi> with a
spiked Crown, on his head, his hair, and beard
ruffled, and a like flying Garment about him:
<hi>Britannia</hi> and He, extend each an Arm, and so bore
up The Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under the Tritons, on the right, and
left, lay a Marine-Lion, and Unicorn, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the other figures; their fore-feet, finny,
and resting on large Foliages, their Tails twisted
in the intermediate spaces, where also, were two
Genii; the one, curbing the Lion, the other, the
Unicorn, with a kind of flying Bridles, of gilded
metal, like Ribbon; and he that was next <hi>Neptune,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:51905:23"/>
held His Trident: In the rest of the spaces, were
heaps of Scollop-shells, &amp;c. alluding to the Sea;
so that besides the excellency of the Design, and
Workmanship, the whole carriage appear'd, as
one mighty mass, of entire Gold.</p>
               <p>And now for the Coach its self, the
outside, or Leather part thereof, was all cover'd
with Crimson Velvet (which, with what went to
the Harness, Coachman's Cushion, Braces,
Strapps, &amp;c. took up 120 yards) And over the
sides, or extream parts of the Velvet, was a rich
Gold Embroidery, of rais'd-work, and on the
Curtains before, behind, and on each side (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Italian fashion) were large em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
Loops, a foot long, and eight Inches
broad; and all other the void spaces, as the
Doors, Pannels, &amp;c. were fill'd with flourishes,
of the like embroidery, and all the seams, and
edges of the said outside, and corners, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the roof, which falling back again on it, in large
Foliages of gold needle-work, and spreading
along the outside of the Valence, in a freeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
of six Inches high, met and joyn'd in the

THE inside of the Coach, was lin'd through,
with a rich Brocard of Gold, and all the
Curtains before, behind, and on each side, as also
the Cushions, were of the same, and took up,
above an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>The Cushions, and middle Seat, were
edg'd with a deep, Gold-fringe, and the Curtains,
proportionably: Round the Valence, was a much
deeper and richer Gold gimp-fringe, and round
the Cornish (where the Valence joyn'd with the
Roof) was a rais'd Embroidery, about a foot in
breadth, with large Branches that shot forth, at the
corners, and sides; which Valence also, was lin'd
with Cloth of Gold.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the Roof, was his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence's
Coat of Arms, with Supporters, Mantling,
Coronet, &amp;c. all of emboss'd Needle-work of
Gold, or according to their proper colours; and
these were in length, five feet, and in breadth,
three, or better.</p>
               <p>There were also, several Tassels, of Gold,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51905:27"/>
to tye back the Curtains; and all the main Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as well as the Braces, Strapps, and lesser parts,
were not only covered with the same Crimson
Velvet, but edg'd every where, with a thick Gold
Galoon; and embroidered also, on all the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and remarkable places, with Roses, of the
same work.</p>
               <p>The cheeks of the Bitts, were double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilt,
and the Bosses embroidered, with a rais'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
upon cloth of Gold, in the figure of Roses;
All the Padds were also covered with Embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the Buckles (an 140 in number) laid on
with the same.</p>
               <p>The Postilion's Saddle, was of the same
embroider'd Velvet, richly laid; and the very
Stirrups, were cover'd, and edg'd as the Harness;
and on each Horse's head, hung nine Tassels of

               <p>The inside, was of a rich Brocard, of

the first; and on the roof, his Excellences Arms,
after the same manner, tho' not so large: The
Carriage, Wheels, &amp;c. carv'd and gilt, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled,

               <p>On the Corners of the hind-standards

grand Re d' Ingelterra!</hi> Live the Great King
of <hi>England!</hi> In a word, so general were the
Acclamations, through the whole progress,
that, That of <hi>Pliny,</hi> to <hi>Trajan,</hi> upon His entring
<hi>Rome,</hi> might not improperly be apply'd, to this,
of The Lord Embassador, <hi>Non aetas quemquam, non
valetudo, non sexus retardavit, quo minus oculos insolito
spectaculo impleret: Parvuli noscere, ostentare juvenes,
mirari senes, Aegroti quoque, relicto medentium imperio,
ad conspectum, quasi ad salutem properare.</hi> Nor Age,
want of Health, or Sex, with-held any one, from
feeding his Eyes, with the unwonted spectacle:
Children, prattled what it was; young men,
shouted; old men, stood in admiration! Nor
would the sick, observe their Physicians, but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51905:34"/>
ran as fast to see't, as to meet their Health.</p>
               <p>His Excellence being come to <hi>Monte-Cavallo</hi>
(where the Pope then Resided) found the
Soldiers drawn up before the Gate; so that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
the Palace, He alighted at the foot of the
great Stairs, and was received (the Lay-persons
of Quality preceding, and the Prelates following)
at the Portal of the Great Hall, just on the Top
of the said Stairs, by Monsignior <hi>Mugiaschi</hi> the
Chamberlain, who, with other Purpled Officers,
conducted him to the <hi>Anticamera,</hi> and thence
(after a little reposing) to the Bedchamber it
self) for his Holiness's Indisposition, hinder'd
him from going to the <hi>Sala Regia,</hi> where such
great Embassies, are usually first receiv'd.</p>
               <p>The Pope was clad in Red Silk, with a
lac'd Linnen Rocket, and sate in a Crimson Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
Chair, not far from his Bed: And as soon as
his Excellence had made his three Obeysances
(the last, being down to the feet) he received his
Benediction, and so seated himself just before
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51905:35"/>
his Holiness, who after an hours discourse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd
him: From thence, he was brought to
Cardinal <hi>Cibo</hi>'s Apartment, where he stay'd about
half an hour; and then taking Coach again, was
reconducted, to his own Palace, by the Light of
thirty, or forty White-Wax Flambeaux.</p>
               <p>The next day, his Excellence with the
same Equipage, visited Cardinal <hi>Ludovisio,</hi> Dean
of the Sacred College, who (in Functions of this
nature) represents the whole Body; and the day
after, the Queen of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and then, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Cardinals, as they lay most convenient;
But before this, his Excellence, to acknowledge
the continual obligations, plac't on him by the
great Prelates of <hi>Rome,</hi> invited them all (in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the King his Master) to a mighty Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
on the 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of the Current Month,
which was order'd as follows.</p>
               <p>The Great, or outward Hall (which is
one of the fairest and best proportion'd Rooms,
that can be seen any where) was surrounded with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51905:35"/>
long Tables, cover'd with excellent Linnen, and
fill'd, with wonderful quantities of Fruit, Sweet-meats,
Parmegian Cheese, and other delicacies,
belonging to the Desert, or last Course; For thus
are the Italians wont at their Solemn Feasts,
that by exposing to the Spectators, one part of
the Entertainment, they may better judge, what
the whole will be: About thirty Butlers, and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants
attended here, and at the upper end of
the said Hall, under a Canopy (after the mode
of the Place) stood a magnificent Cupboard, of
all kind of Plate, guarded by Swisse; and over
against it, was that of Glasses, which were of
Venice, in great store, and of all sorts; Three
other large, and richly furnish'd Rooms were to
be past, before ye came to the place where they
din'd; and in the last of them (under another
Canopy) was a great Cupboard of curious Gilt
Plate, for his Excellence's particular use, and
service, guarded by some of the English Servants;
and was so extraordinary, that it drew as many
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51905:36"/>
Spectators to it, as did any one thing else; Nor
would they hardly believe it to be other, than
of pure Gold, tho' they were told the contrary;
and even those that were convinc'd, could not
but confess, that Artificers in <hi>England</hi> were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative.</p>
               <p>The Dining-Room, was that gay and
pleasant Gallery, so remarkable also for its
Painting, it being of <hi>Pietro di Cortona</hi>'s doing, the
greatest Master in his Time; Its usual furniture,
was double Rows of Statues, in proportionable
Niches; but now (by reason of the Time of the
year) his Lordship order'd it to be hung with rare
Tapestry; and in the middle of the side, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the coming in, was plac'd a Cloth of
State, Embroider'd with Gold, under which, was
the King's Picture, as big as the Life, sitting
Crown'd on his Throne, and clad, in his Regal
Habit.</p>
               <p>The Table was fitted to the length of
the Room, and being cover'd with fine Damask,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51905:36"/>
was encompass'd, with about eighty fair arm'd
Velvet Chairs, which touch'd one another; only
between every four, there was place left for a
Carver, and over against him, for a Sewer; So
that each eight Persons, had these two Officers to
attend them as to the Eating Part; and behind,
every one had a Servant, to bring whatsoever he
wanted, or desired.</p>
               <p>The breadth of the said Table was
eight foot (which might easily be allow'd, the
Room being 24 wide) and thro' the middle
of it, from one end to the other, ran a Range of
Historical Figures (some almost half as big as
the Life) which the <hi>Italians,</hi> call <hi>Trionfi:</hi> They
are made of a kind of Sugar-Paste, but model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
to the utmost skill of a Statuary; So that
they are afterwards, sent as Presents to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Ladies; and their use at Entertainments, is
to gratifie the Eye, as the Meat, Musique, and
Perfumes, do the other Senses.</p>
               <p>Between these, stood great Vases of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51905:37"/>
Artificial Flowers; and (to fill up the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
spaces of the middle) there were a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Company of Birds in a flying posture, on
lesser Plates; and as many Lyons, Unicorns, and
Eagles, on larger, alluding to the supporters,
and bearings, of both their Majesties: An entire
description of which, as the Table stood all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
may be seen in the ninth Figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51905:38"/>
AND for a more particular account of the
Triumphs themselves, they were as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>The first four, were of <hi>Juno, Cybele, Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
and <hi>Vulcan,</hi> in Chariots, drawn over large
Foliages; thereby representing, the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as if each of them, had paid a Tribute to
the Table; as in the eleventh and twelfth Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51905:39"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:51905:39"/>
THE fifth, and sixth, were of two Palm
Trees, the Hieroglyphicks of Victory, and
Impress, of his Excellences Family; and under
them, several Nymphs, sitting on Foliages, and
representing the Moral Virtues, as in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51905:40"/>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:51905:40"/>
THE seventh and eighth, were the Figures
of His Majesties Royal Virtues; where, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
heaps of Arms, and Trophies, in the first,
stood Justice, and Peace, entwin'd; with their
proper Symbols in their hands; in the other,
Valour, and Victory, as in the Fourteenth Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51905:41"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:51905:41"/>
THE ninth and tenth, were of <hi>Daphne,</hi> and
<hi>Myrrha,</hi> the one transform'd into a Lawrel;
the other, into a Tree of her own Name, as in
the fifteenth Figure. Intimating thereby, That
His Majesty, whose Victories had planted Him
Lawrels in His own time, wanted not the Myrrhe
of His Virtues, to embalm Him to posterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51905:42"/>
                  <figure>
                     <p>Gio. Batta Lenardi delin. Arnoldo Van Westerho</p>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:51905:42"/>
AND in the midst of all, over against his
Majesties Picture (of which, before) stood
a Machine of six feet, and two inches high, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
on the one hand, the Figure of the
Church; on the other, Time, drawing Truth
out of a Cloud, thro' which, the Sun breaking
forth, A winged <hi>Heroe,</hi> with a Spear in his hand,
chas'd Fraud, and Discord: And on the Base,
lay a dismember'd Hydra; thereby denoting,
Rebellion supprest, and vanquish't: And over all,
stood His Majesties Arms, as may be seen in the
tenth Figure: And on the Reverse thereof, those
of his Holiness, according to the first Figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51905:43"/>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:51905:43"/>
THIS large Table, having (as is said) these
adornments in the middle, had between
them, and the Napkins (which were also most
artificially folded) two Rows of Assiets, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termesses,
on either side, fill'd with all sorts of
relishing bits, whether salt, sweet, or soure; as
Pickles, Butter, slices of delicate Bacon, Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na-Sauciges,
Taratufoli, Composts, &amp;c. all
which, stood in the abovesaid Order, for two
whole days, (according to the <hi>Roman</hi> way) that
every ones curiosity might have some share in the
Entertainment: And truly, the Concourse was
so infinite, that the Palace had bin certainly
sack't the second day, had not his Excellence
foreseen the danger, and therefore, provided a
Company of Swissers, for all the Gates and
Avenues.</p>
               <p>As for the Feast it self (which began
about one) it consisted of twenty four Imperial
Dishes, to every Mess, or eight Persons; and these
the <hi>Italians</hi> call Imperial, by reason of the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51905:44"/>
and richness of them; as fill'd, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Art could devise, or Industry procure: Two,
of each of the said twenty four, were served in
at a time, and plac'd by the Servers, before the
Respective Carvers, who cutting of every thing,
gave it to the Servers, and they, to each Guest
in their District, whether he eat of it, or not;
And as the Trumpets, and loud Musique from
the Balconies, usher'd in the Meat, so the softer
(which consisted of Voices, Lutes, &amp;c.) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
all, whilst they were eating.</p>
               <p>Towards the middle of Dinner, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
(who sate at the upper end of the
Table) stood up, and (calling to his Cup-bearer
for a Glass of Wine) began the Popes Health;
and (within some small time after) the Kings, in
the same manner, and order; which was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pledg'd with the utmost demonstrations of
Joy, and Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>And now, the Company (who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd
themselves to mirth) beginning to be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51905:44"/>
satisfied, the aforesaid twelve courses, or changes
were by the Officers (to avoid tediousness) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
to ten; and then, the Triumphs, and
other Ornaments, being taken away, they
cover'd the whole Table, with all kind of
Sweet-meats imaginable; which after a little
time (as the Liberty or Confidence of the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by encreast) were all snatch'd, and carried
away.</p>
               <p>Thus (after three hours) ended this
Famous Entertainment, with universal satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and applause: And tho' the Delicacy of the
Meats, Wines, and other Liquors, as well as the
Abundance (which fed above 1000 Persons)
was wonderful, yet the Order, seem'd more sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising;
for every one not only eat, and sate at
ease, but was all the while as well attended, and
as readily served, as if he had been at a private
Feast: Nay, all confest and declar'd, that
the common Fate of Feasts, <hi>viz. Beuer Caldo
e Mangiar Freddo, Drinking hot and Eating cold,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:51905:45"/>
was here, wholly chang'd to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And now the Month of <hi>January</hi> was
over, when several Great Personages, and Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies
in <hi>Rome,</hi> thought fit to Complement His
Majesty, in shewing personal Honours to his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador.
The first, was the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
who had prepar'd an elegant composition of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Lyricks, in Honour of His Majesties Accession
to the Crown; which being now ready, and her
Palace fitted for it, Her Majesty appointed it to
be celebrated on the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and
therefore invited his Excellence, to be present
at it.</p>
               <p>It was perform'd in her great Audience
Room, adorn'd with extraordinary Pictures, and
Lights: At the upper end, under a cloth of
State, was plac't a rais'd Chair for Her Majesty;
and at the other, a large Theater, with rising
Benches, for the Musick; on either side also
were cover'd Benches, the one for the <hi>Roman</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
the other, for their Husbands, or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51905:45"/>
And now the Lady being plac't, and every
thing else in due order, The Lord Embassador
led the Queen to her Throne, and sate himself, on
a Velvet Stool, under the first step of it, with a
Row of English Gentlemen, and other Cavaliers
of Her Majesties Court, standing about him.</p>
               <p>The composition, was sung in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
by five persons, representing, <hi>London,
Thames, Fame, The Ruling Genius, and The Genius
of Rebellion;</hi> with a Chorus of an hundred
Voices, and an hundred and fifty musical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.</p>
               <p>The subject was, The Encomiums of
the English Nation, and their Great Monarch,
<hi>James</hi> the Second; with the Augury also, and
Assurance, of happy successes, under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of so mighty a Prince: About the middle
of which, and just before the first Chorus, there
was a sudden stop; when Monsignior <hi>Francisco
Albani,</hi> A Prelate (and now Secretary of the Pope's
Briefs) stept into a Pulpit, there ready prepar'd,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51905:46"/>
and in A florid Italian Oration, first addressing
to the Queen, continu'd the Argument, thro' a
world of matter; but how to bring that world
into a Compendium, or Map, will be a question.</p>
               <p>In short, he trac'd His Majesty, from his
infancy, to his riper years; and his early cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
to his full manhood: Follow'd him, through
all his various fortunes, at home, and abroad:
His exemplary Actions in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi>
where, to capacitate him for Admiral of the
Ocean, Victory shook of her Pinnions, as resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
never to part from him: He further went
on, That Fortune had provided new Darts, to
wound his succession, yet they broke themselves,
on what they were shot at; nay, all her tryals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
his mastery, and instead of overthrowing, did
but contribute, to the fastning his roots: Nor
ought I (continued he) in the day of so much
joy, to have mention'd it, but that it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
to <hi>Hercules,</hi> to look back, on his past
toils.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:51905:46"/>
But now, in that the appearance of Day,
had disperst the Clouds, All the Ideas, he could
fancy to himself, towards the forming A Statue
of publick Felicity, were conspicuous in His
Majesty: Witness, his <hi>Justice,</hi> in governing by
his Laws: His <hi>Goodness,</hi> in forgetting nothing,
but Injuries: His <hi>Clemency,</hi> in being ever
readier to pardon, than offenders to ask it:
His <hi>Liberality,</hi> in the Patronage of Arts, and
Arms: And lastly, his <hi>Prudence,</hi> in advancing
the Trade of his Kingdoms; thereby supplying
the defect of Time, and joyning divided <hi>Britain,</hi>
once more to the Continent: And therefore, if
such were his dawn, what must his full Day be?
Or what would we the reward of all? Even that
God give him the accomplishment, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and multiply his seed, as the
Stars of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Nor was it sooner spoken, than eccho'd
back again, by a Chorus (as before) of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Voices, and an hundred and fifty Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51905:47"/>
And from thence, the Dialogue went on,
intermixt with three other Chorus's, crying out,
<hi>New Laurels! New Palms! Victory, Victory, Victory!</hi>
And at last, the whole, clos'd with this fourth.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Live King of an exalted Name!</l>
                  <l>Live ever, in the top of years the same!</l>
                  <l>And as He's Great in <hi>Britain,</hi> even,</l>
                  <l>Let Him be Great in <hi>Rome,</hi> and Great in Heaven!</l>
               </q>
               <p>And with this, ended the Entertainment
of that evening, but not the Queen's inclinations
of honouring his Majesty, for it was for several
days together, again presented, to the general
satisfaction, of both Court, and City.</p>
               <p>A Queen had led the way, and his
Eminence Cardinal <hi>Pamphilio</hi> (in whose Brother's
Palace, his Excellence then dwelt) A person of no
ordinary literature, sharp witted, eloquent, and
(which every Age has not to boast of) <hi>A Purpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Poet,</hi> made his Lordship the next invitation,
to his Palace, in the <hi>Corso</hi> (a long Street in <hi>Rome</hi>
where, during the Carnival, all people appear in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51905:47"/>
                  <hi>Masquerade)</hi> where, after a splendid Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was further caress'd, with an Excellent
Tragedy, sung in <hi>Recitativo:</hi> The Subject, was A
particular Complement to His Majesty, in the
History of St. <hi>Dimna,</hi> an Irish Martyr; The Stage,
beautifully set out with proper Scenes; and the
Argument, interwoven with such variety of noble,
yet surprizing Accidents, that it appear'd altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worthy of the elevated Genius, of himself,
that wrote it.</p>
               <p>Nor stood it with the Grandeur of The
<hi>Barberine</hi> Family, to slip this opportunity of show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the world that real respect which their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Gallantry, made them always declare
was due to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> For Cardinal
<hi>Francisco Barberini</hi> (not long since Dean of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
College) was Unckle to <hi>Carlo,</hi> his present
Eminence, and had been Protector of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Nation at <hi>Rome;</hi> as had been heretofore (if I
mistake not) Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth; famous for
his humanity and good nature: This Family
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51905:48"/>
also, was ally'd to the most Illustrious House of
<hi>Este,</hi> and consequently, to Her now Majesty,
our great and gracious Queen: Under this
double obligation, was the said Lord Cardinal,
when he invited his Excellence, and seven other
English men of quality, to an Entertainment at
his Palace, on the <hi>Shrove-Tuesday</hi> following, being
the Eve of the <hi>Carnival, viz.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
the honourable <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ratcliffe,</hi>
with Mr. <hi>Arundell, Tichborn, Wamesley,</hi> and <hi>Eggleston:</hi>
And that there might not be wanting persons of
the highest Order in the Church, he invited,
their Eminencys, The Cardinal of <hi>Norfolk</hi> (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
of the English, and Scotch) Cardinal <hi>Alteri</hi>
(Protector of the Irish) Cardinal <hi>Pamphilio,</hi>
before spoken of, and Monsignior <hi>Barberino,</hi>
his Nephew, one of the twelve principal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Apostolick Chamber.</p>
               <p>The day being now come (out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
and pleasure to view, the not to be parallel'd
Statues, and Paintings, of that Palace) his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51905:48"/>
with his company, came early; when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
past the large Court, famous for the Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
about it, he was led to a magnificent Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case,
which brought him into a more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Hall, where the Cardinal receiv'd his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
and by the Antichambers, conducting
him through the rest of the Palace, show'd him
the inestimable Collections, which nothing but a
like Family could have brought together; After
this, he led the Embassador to his Library, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
(perhaps) in nothing to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> but the
Manuscripts, and that it is not The <hi>Vatican.</hi> And
here it was, that his Eminence, presented his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,
with forty Books, Folio's, and others,
exquisitely bound, and Printed by the care
and Beneficence of this Family; and here also
the Cardinals who were invited, came to
them.</p>
               <p>The Hall before-mentioned, was the
place of this Entertainment, where that scarcely
to be exprest Cieling (the hand also of <hi>Pietro de
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51905:49"/>
Cortona,</hi> was (if yet possible) out-done, by the
costly Hangings; wherein (with all the Mastery
of Art, Colours, and Design) were exprest, the
most considerable actions of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the
Eighth; and upon a Freeze under them, The
History of <hi>Deborah:</hi> And at the upper end of
all, A full Picture of His Majesty, on a sprightly
Horse, trampling, The many-headed Monster of
Rebellion, under his feet.</p>
               <p>The Hall its self, was set round, with
Crimson-Velvet Chairs, edg'd with a deep Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Fringe, and in the middle, upon a small
rising, stood a Table of thirty foot long, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
broad; through the length of which, ran a
range of Triumphs, and beside them, other lesser,
of Arts, Peace, War, Victory, with their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Symbols, and Trophys: Nor was the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Services, the vastness of the Dishes, the
variety of the Inter-messes, and relishing Plates
round every Trencher, the plenty, and choice of
Wines, the nobleness of the Desart, excellence of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51905:49"/>
the Musick, and great Order of the whole, in any
wise disproportionate, to the magnificence of the
place, or the person, that made it: And if it fell
short in any thing, of that of the Lord Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's,
it was not, that his Eminence's intention,
was not the same, but the company less.</p>
               <p>The Entertainment lasted above two
hours, and from the Hall, they withdrew into a
curiously hung Room, which was a ready con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
into all the other parts of the Palace;
and from hence they came into A second, hung
with Crimson Velvet, and beautifully adorn'd
with Statues, and Pictures, of inestimable value;
where, his Eminence had prepar'd, an excellent
composition, of Vocal, and Instrumental Musick,
in honour of His Majesty, and this glorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy.</p>
               <p>From thence, his Excellence, and their
Eminences in Cardinal <hi>Barberini</hi>'s Coach (the rest
of the Coaches following) drove thro' the <hi>Corso</hi>
(of which, before) And thence, to the Palace of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51905:50"/>
Cardinal <hi>Pamphilio,</hi> where his Excellence receiv'd
a second Regal, and the satisfactory Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of the Tragedy before mention'd.</p>
               <p>This of the Lords Cardinals, begot an
Emulation in The <hi>Literati,</hi> nor was it long, ere
they follow'd the example: The first of this kind,
were the Fathers of the <hi>Gregorian,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
(founded by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>) who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
his Excellence, to an Entertainment of the
Muses, on the 25<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of the same month; At which
time, he came largely attended, with <hi>Roman</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and other great men; and was receiv'd at
the Gate, not only by the Rector, but by the
Assistants, and chief members of that Learned
Body; for, as for the General himself, he was
lately dead, and the Vicar sick, even to keep his
Bed. At his entrance they exprest their satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and joy, by ringing their Bell, and a flourish
of Trumpets: Then having with much ado past
the throng'd Court, and view'd the Inscription,
erected (in honour of His Majesty, and that days
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51905:50"/>
Solemnity) over the <hi>Portico,</hi> that leads into the
first Hall, his Lordship was at the great Door of
it, met by the Prefect of the Studys, who in a
short, but elegant Latine Oration, accosted him,
to this effect.</p>
               <p>That amidst the noise of the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding,
and rejoycing at his Excellence's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
at <hi>Rome,</hi> The <hi>Gregorian</hi> Academy, neither
ought to be silent, nor indeed, could it: In their
name therefore, he first rejoyc't with His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in that it happen'd in his Pontificat, and
that <hi>James</hi> the Second, reign'd in <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Innocent</hi> the XI<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> In the next place, he
gratulated, To The Christian World, so Great A
Defender of the Faith: To <hi>Britain,</hi> Queen of the
Ocean, so potent an Assertor: And lastly, To
his Excellence, his Embassy; And stil'd His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
The most Great King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> in
that he had chosen, such an Embassador; the
one, only fit to chuse the other, to be chosen.</p>
               <p>And now his Excellence had a full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51905:51"/>
of the Hall it self, the further end of which,
was one entire piece of Architecture, in Perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;
where, under a Regal Canopy, upon A
Throne, rais'd four Steps, and a round Pedestal
of equal height, between two erected Female
Figures, <hi>viz. Scotland</hi> admiring, and <hi>Ireland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
sate a Third, on a Lion couchant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
<hi>England:</hi> On her head she bore a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Crown; in her right hand, A Scepter; and
her left, held the Helm of a Ship: Upon the
Cornishes over that, supported by large Pillars,
were Their Majestys Pictures (as done in Brass)
wreath'd about, with Laurels, and Palms, each
also supported, by two Angels: And somewhat
over that, in the middle between both, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestys
Arms, with their wonted Quarterings, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and Supporters, standing on Festons of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and Thistles: And on a proportionable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitrave
to the whole, four large Urnes, or Pots
of Incense.</p>
               <p>The Walls on either side, were hung
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51905:51"/>
with Arras, of Silk; and upon a Cornish over
them, several Shields, and Tablets, of Devises,
Epigrams, and Elogies, in honour of His Majesty,
and that days occasion: Among the number of
which, it may not be unpleasant, to divert the
Reader, with some of them.</p>
               <p>A Ship, her Sails furl'd, and lying close,
against the weather. The word <hi>(—Ubi noxia per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant)
While dangers are abroad.</hi> Signifying thereby,
A Tempest may shake, not rend a wise man's
Sails: And therein also, His Majestys prudence,
in giving way to the Storm, which so much
threaten'd him, before he came to the Crown.</p>
               <p>A Leopard regardant, <hi>i. e.</hi> looking back
on his spots. The word <hi>(Ornant, non maculant—)
They beautifie, not blemish.</hi> Intimating thereby, That
all the obloquies against His Majesty, when Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> are so far from giving him any Blot, that
they rather add, so many Flowers to his Crown.</p>
               <p>A Cannon, firing. The word <hi>(—Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura
dat ictum) 'Tis the true Levil hits.</hi> Thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51905:52"/>
That those true measures, His Majesty
took of his Affairs, gave Him, and his Kingdoms,
the happiness, they now enjoy.</p>
               <p>A Shield, with an <hi>Umbo,</hi> or spike of
Steel, in the Centre. The word <hi>(Ferendo, &amp; fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riendo)
By bearing, and pushing.</hi> Thereby shewing,
His Majestys readiness to receive, and repel, the
force of his Enemies.</p>
               <p>A Horse, ready appointed for War,
beating the ground, and (as it were) neighing
for the Battle. The word <hi>(—Animoque paratior—)
More ready in himself.</hi> Intimating thereby, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Resolution.</p>
               <p>A Marriners Compass, the Needle to
the North. The word <hi>(Quo semel, huc semper—)
Once, and ever.</hi> Thereby denoting, His Majestys
constancy.</p>
               <p>A Lion, tossing a large Orbicular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
The word <hi>(—Et tanto in pondere ludit) And
under the great weight, He plays.</hi> Alluding thereby,
to His Majestys expeditiousness, and happy dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51905:52"/>
in the easy dispatch, of so many his
weighty Affairs.</p>
               <p>The Sun, throwing his Beams over a
Landskip. The word <hi>(—Circumspicit omnia—) He has
an eye, on all.</hi> Thereby intimating, That no part
of his Dominions is so remote, but that he bears,
a particular regard to it.</p>
               <p>A Harp, full strung. The word <hi>(Summis
consentit &amp; imis) And every string accords.</hi> Denoting
thereby, That (notwithstanding their diversity
in Opinions) all His Majestys Subjects, meet in
one Consort, <hi>i. e.</hi> a general satisfaction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
under his happy Government.</p>
               <p>Lastly (for I intend not a Volume) A
Bee, flying round a Garden, of Herbs and Flowers.
The word <hi>(Non legit infectos—) She takes no poisonous
Plant.</hi> Pointing thereby at His Majestys Judgment,
that he makes choice, of the Best men.</p>
               <p>Besides these, there were several other
Odes, Epigrams, and Elogys, on larger Tablets,
in honour of His Majesty, his Late Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51905:53"/>
and the particular accidents of his now
Majesties life; One among the rest, more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
relating to The Embassy, in which (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
to his Excellence the Lord Embassadors
Name, of <hi>Palmer)</hi> under the Emblem of A Palm,
or Date Tree, was represented, That it is the
Nature of that Tree, not to yield to any weight,
but rather, to endeavour the more upwards: In
short, they gratulate The <hi>Omen;</hi> foretel Him,
Victory over his Enemies, of which also, that
Tree is the Symbol, And wish him, <hi>A Prince, of
many Palms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence in the passage to the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Hall, by the Humanity Schools of Grammar,
Syntax, Poetry, Rhetorick, &amp;c. Several Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
youths, (chief of the <hi>Caesarean, Matthean, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial,
Pamphilian,</hi> and <hi>Altierian</hi> Families) stood
before the doors of their respective Schools, and
saluted his Excellence with Distichs; and from
thence, by a fair ascent, he came up to the Hall
its self, which was statelily furnish't, with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51905:53"/>
and Tapestry hangings, heightned with
Gold.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of it, was erected A
Theatre, on which stood the Rhetorick Master,
who complemented his Excellence in a Latine
Heroick Poem of 571 Verses, the Sum and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of which, was this.</p>
               <p>He took his rise, from the year, or
two, before His Majesties accession to the Crown,
And thus fabled; That the Genius of <hi>England,</hi>
having (by reason of the late villanous Plot)
found every thing, in disorder at home, had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
all the Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> and finding
them successful in their Affairs, began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult,
whether Fortune (whereby yet, he meant
no other, than that Divine Providence, which is
always awake for the good of Mankind) had not
forsaken his Countrey, and being half doubtful
in it, resolv'd to go in quest of her: To which
purpose, having advice, that she had betaken
her self, to the Imperial Eagle, he follow'd her
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51905:54"/>
from place, to place, and at last found her, at
the first unsuccessful Siege of <hi>Buda:</hi> where, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
laid before her, the close Argument, of not
pressing Fortune, against Fortune; He encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
her with the certainty of the next Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
and only begs her, that during that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy,
she would take a Journey into <hi>England,</hi>
which wanted nothing, but her presence, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it.</p>
               <p>In short, the Genius prevails, takes For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
into his Chariot, and (after a full-wrought
Poetical description of the Journey) brings her
into <hi>England;</hi> where the first thing they met with,
was the death, of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; and
two Rebellions, then rising, against his Brother
and Heir, His now Majesty: This Fortune (that
ever hated the profane rabble) cover'd the Kings
Arms, disperst the Rebels, and having seated
him, in the Imperial Throne, return'd back to
the Eagle, for its next more successful expedition
against <hi>Buda.</hi> And with this, ended the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51905:54"/>
which was all perform'd, in the Latine
tongue.</p>
               <p>The next, was that of The <hi>Clementine</hi>
Colledge, founded by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>;
which, albeit it be governed by religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
has in it yet, an Academy of The <hi>Literati,</hi>
and (besides their more serious studys) The
young Nobless, and Gallants, are train'd up, in
all those Exercises, that may render them useful,
either for Peace, or War: Hither also his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
was invited; and came fully accompany'd
with Prelates, Cavaliers, and others; nor was
the Entertainment less learned, tho' for the most
part, the Composition was in the Vulgar Tongue;
for the Italian wits, by critically considering it
in their <hi>Academies,</hi> have at length render'd it,
both Polite, and Elegant.</p>
               <p>His Excellence was receiv'd at the first
Gate, by the Fathers, and young Noblemen
Convictors, with A double range of Trumpets;
and thence, conducted into the Great Hall, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51905:55"/>
adorn'd with Paintings, and Damask, fring'd
with Gold; Where he was seated on A Velvet
Chair rais'd, and beside him, hung A full Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of His Majesty, under a Royal Canopy;
over which, stood the <hi>Impress</hi> of The <hi>Academicks</hi>
(by the name of <hi>The Extravagants) viz.</hi> two Palms,
folded into the Figure of a Warlike Hand-bow.
The word <hi>(placidis, coeant immitia) Let Arts, and
Arms, join hands.</hi> Thereby signifying, That Gowns,
and Swords, are not so incompatible, but they
may very well meet, in the same persons.</p>
               <p>The Entertainment began, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
of Musick, Then stood out, A Noble
Youth (A Marchese) of about seventeen years
(who also bore a part, in the following Exercises,
of Vaulting, Dancing, Fencing, and Horsman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
and caress'd His Excellence, in a smart
Oration, to this purpose,</p>
               <p>That the old Historys of <hi>Rome,</hi> must
give place, to modern Annals; In as much as
the Glorys of the first, were more believ'd, than
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51905:55"/>
true, these on the contrary, carry'd in them,
more of truth, than credibility.</p>
               <p>That the multitude of people, made
<hi>Rome,</hi> look bigger, than her self, and <hi>Rome</hi> now,
might be found, in <hi>Rome</hi> again.</p>
               <p>That Glory, lay not in quantity, but
quality, and that the brave men, not the number,
made A Monarchy great, and Illustrious; For
otherwise, Vices, and Privation (that in despight
of Noble Enterprises, had destroy'd Confines)
might set up for Soveraignty, among the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
               <p>That the Trophys of The August Eagle,
surpass'd not yet, those of The winged Lion; And
tho' Antiquity, might pride its self, in her <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Caesars,</hi> &amp;c. yet the real Grandeur of all, was,
to be found in <hi>James</hi> the Second, and what was
prodigious in them, render'd not only probable,
but certain in him.</p>
               <p>Then making an Excursion, on the
Praises of The Pope; The Emperors Victorys
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51905:56"/>
over the Turk; The Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> Patroness
of their Academy; The Lord Embassador, and
his Embassy, he thus, came back to His Majesty:
Let <hi>James</hi> the Second live! to the Terror of Evil
doers, and the Example of <hi>Heroe</hi>'s: Live The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Britain,</hi> and Glory of the Capitol! And with
him, encrease The Triumphs of <hi>Hungary</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd,
and <hi>Greece,</hi> wounded.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in the name of the Academicks,
he besought his Excellence, to accept that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,
so much the more affectionate, by how
much the less artificial; And to temper their
boldness, That he would yet content himself, to
repeat with them, what <hi>Varius Geminus,</hi> once said
to his <hi>Caesar; Qui de te Jacob audent dicere, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem
tuam ignorant, qui non audent, Humanitatem.</hi>
They that presume to give an account of Thee,
<hi>James,</hi> understand not Thy Greatness, and they
that dare not offer at it, know nothing of Thy
Clemency.</p>
               <p>This ended with a Chorus of Musick;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51905:56"/>
And then, were rehearst several short Epigrams
(of half a dozen, or a dozen Verses) <hi>Stanza</hi> wise,
by the like Noble Youths, in honour of The
Pope; The King; The Queen; The Queen of
<hi>Sweden;</hi> The late Dutchess of <hi>Modena;</hi> The now
Duke; The Lord Embassador; And Cardinal
<hi>Azzolino,</hi> Protector of the Academy; Which also
was answered by a Chorus of Musick.</p>
               <p>Then follow'd the exercise of Vaulting,
on the Horse, perform'd by six Noble Youths,
with singular dexterity, and variety; and after
some respite of Musick, those other, of Dancing,
and Fencing, by the same, or like Youths.</p>
               <p>The first, was an high Dance, by one
single person; And after that, A Duel of two.
The second Dance also, was single; and after
that, a Duel of two.</p>
               <p>The third Dance, was a French Minuet,
of two. And after that, a skirmish of three; One,
defending himself, against two.</p>
               <p>The fourth Dance, was in a figure of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51905:57"/>
six; And after that, a Duel of two.</p>
               <p>The fifth Dance, was in a figure of four;
And after that, a skirmish of three: One, with a
Sword and Dagger, defending himself, against
two Swords.</p>
               <p>The sixth Dance, was a Saraband of
six; And after that, a skirmish of eight; four,
against four; with a flourish of Trumpets.</p>
               <p>The seventh Dance, a figure of eight.
The eighth Dance, was a French Minuet of two;
And after that, a skirmish of eight; and clos'd
those exercises, with a Chorus of Trumpets.</p>
               <p>And now, while the Academicks were
preparing themselves for their riding the great
Horse, His Excellence was entertain'd with A
Symphony of Musick; and that over, conducted
into A Gallery, which lookt into the riding
Court, from whence, he beheld all the Exercises
of Horsmanship, perform'd by eight Noble
Youths of The Academy; which ending, his
Excellence was reconducted to his Palace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:51905:57"/>
Nor was it long, ere a like festivous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
was made him, by The <hi>Academicks</hi> of
the <hi>Infecondi,</hi> for the 21 of <hi>April</hi> following; where,
accompany'd with a numerous train of Prelats,
and others, he was as splendidly receiv'd, and
entertain'd, with even the height, of Rhetorick
and Poetry, in honour of His Majesty, Himself,
and The Embassy; more particularly, with a
problematical discourse, (in <hi>Italian)</hi> whether
The Victorious Arms of the Christians in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
and <hi>Greece,</hi> or The Generous Indulgence,
of the King of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> (uniting thereby,
his Subjects) were more conducing to the peace
of Christendom?</p>
               <p>And now his Excellence (having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Orders) prepar'd for his Return; and
therefore (to begin where he ought) he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the Pope, that (with his permission)
the next Audience, should be that of <hi>Congee;</hi> So
that on the fifth of <hi>May</hi> he came in great state to
the Palace, and after an hour's Private Discourse
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51905:58"/>
or thereabouts, he receiv'd the Embraces, and
Benediction of His Holiness, with the usual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
of a Pair of Beads, at which hung a Gold
Medal of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>This Ceremony being thus over, His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
was to take his leave of the Queen of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> and after her, of every Cardinal; all
which being in a fortnight's time perform'd, he
chang'd his Livery, and (ordering his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
to make ready, with all possible hast for his
Journey) he put himself wholly Incognito;
that is to say, neither to give, nor receive Visits,
unless about Business, and that, privately, and
by the Back-stairs also: But an Accident inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
this so necessary a Retirement, to one
that had so great a Family to dispose of, and so
many Home-Affairs to settle, before he stirr'd.
For the four new Cardinals <hi>(Ciceri, Petrucci, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffa</hi>
and <hi>Medici)</hi> who had been long mew'd up,
were on the 24<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Current to receive their Hats,
in open Consistory; which being the only Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51905:58"/>
Papal Solemnity, since his Lordships Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it was thought fit (by the whole Court) that
he should have a more particular Invitation, as
he had, and which, he readily comply'd with.</p>
               <p>About ten in the morning that day, his
Excellence (attended by all his own People) came
to the Palace, where he was Receiv'd by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and conducted to the Great Gallery, from
whence he might see Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi>'s Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade,
or Solemn Procession on Horse-back; for
in this manner was every Cardinal formerly wont,
to come to his First Audience, accompany'd by
the Sacred Colledge, and Prelates, on Mules, the
other Grandees, and followers, on Horses: But
the Charge being excessive, none had for several
years perform'd it, nor could it be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
reviv'd, by any one, than a Prince of so
much Wealth, and Greatness.</p>
               <p>The other three Cardinals having been
excus'd Riding, came privately before, and by
noon, the rest; and then, his Excellence went
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51905:59"/>
to the Pope's Inward Antichamber, where he
found the <hi>Conestable Colonna</hi> attending; for he,
and the Duke <hi>de Bracciano,</hi> are the only Romans,
that are <hi>Principi del Soglio;</hi> that is to say, <hi>Princes
that can stand (on great Days) under the Canopy, or Cloth
of State:</hi> His Lordship and he, having saluted
each other, and discours'd for a while, the Pope
came out, and after his Benediction (they, and
some of the Bed-chamber preceding) he was
brought to the Vestry; where being Pontifically
Rob'd, and Mitred, by two Cardinal Deacons
(to wit, <hi>Maldachini,</hi> and <hi>Pamfilio)</hi> his Excellence
took up his Train, and so follow'd him to the
Throne, in the Room where the Consistory was
then held; standing close by him on his Right
hand, and discoursing still with him, during the
Casmes, and Intervals of the Function.</p>
               <p>The Function it self consisted chiefly,
in the Pope's Blessing the people; the Salutations
he received from the Cardinals; and his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
(at his giving the Hats) that God would
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51905:59"/>
incline each of them, faithfully to serve his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majesty, in their respective Stations; and
so (after two hour's) he return'd in the former
order. After which, his Excellence took the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of taking his second leave, of all his
Friends, and (after many kind Adieu's) was
conducted to his Coaches, which, together with
his Liveries, never appear'd more magnificent,
nor ever happen'd to be more descanted upon,
than at this time: For being all intermingled,
with the stately Equipage of Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi>
The people had a fit opportunity to compare,
and give their judgments of both, which was
highly in favour of his Lordships.</p>
               <p>Our Embassador being again retir'd,
every Servant was at liberty to look after his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
business; and in three weeks, the Baggage
was made up, and All Persons (as well Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as Domesticks) paid off: And to obviate the
mistakes; which Chance or Malice, might after
his Departure occasion; He order'd (ten days
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51905:60"/>
before he stirr'd) Printed Bills to be pasted up in
the most Remarkable Quarters of the City,
which gave notice of his intended Journey, and
willed every one to repair to the Palace,
that had any Dues, or Pretensions: But so far was
this, from creating trouble, to his Excellence or
Officers, that it gave the Town occasion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
and wonder, nay, confess it, a thing not
only unusual, but scarce heard of before, in those
parts; For thro' the whole course of this Embassy,
no man (after the stating of his Accounts) ever
ask't twice for his money; nor was any Bill (upon
what place soever drawn) which was not punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and precisely satisfied.</p>
               <p>And now his Excellence (having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of his English Servants, and Baggage, some
to return by Sea, others by Land) began his own
Journey the 23. of <hi>June,</hi> by night, because the
Heats were excessive; and by Post, for expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-sake,
according to his late Orders: Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
rid in a handsom, commodious Callesh,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51905:60"/>
made purposely for that service; and was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by his Secretary, his Sewer, a Page, a
<hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> and a Running Footman; and
overtaken on the Road, by the Gentleman
of his Horse, whom some necessary Business had
hinder'd, from setting out with him. But before
we leave <hi>Rome,</hi> it may not be amiss to recount
an Affair, which his Lordship fully settled, before
his departure.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Flori</hi> (a <hi>Piedmontese</hi> of quality, and
banish'd thence, a while since) after he had lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriously
spent vast sums at <hi>Paris, Vienna,</hi> and other
places, man'd out to Sea (in Person) a Privatier,
under the <hi>Polish</hi> Banner, tho' that Kingdom, has
no one foot of Land, near Salt-water: When
Roving in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> he met (towards the
Coast of <hi>Egypt)</hi> two English Ships, the <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
and another; and making them both Prizes (the
last, because she wanted a sufficient Pass, and the
other, for having the New <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> with
his Family, on Board) carry'd them directly for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51905:61"/>
                  <hi>Malta:</hi> The News of this Insult, being divulg'd
every where, the <hi>Leghorn</hi>-Factory presently
made Applications to his Lordship, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him, that if this past without satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
not only all Christian Men of War, but
every Privatier, would be still searching, and
disturbing their Merchants: That the Turks
would do the like also; and all people (for the
future) would load on the French and others,
that could protect them from such dangers,
and Inconveniencies; Nor were these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the sole Plaintiffs, but Letters came from
the Consul of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> nay the <hi>Bassa</hi> himself, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
his Excellences Help, and Assistance.</p>
               <p>His Excellence, who (by his former
Travels in the <hi>Levant)</hi> knew the Turkish Justice,
which usually, makes the National Traders, feel
the smart of such Accidents, borrow'd Mr. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
(Gentleman of the Horse to the Cardinal
of <hi>Norfolk)</hi> and sent him in all hast, for <hi>Malta;</hi>
having first communicated the whole Affair, to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51905:61"/>
the Embassador of that Order, then Residing at
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Time Mr. <hi>Hanford</hi> got thither,
<hi>Flori</hi> had again put to Sea, and given the <hi>Bassa</hi>
his Liberty, upon security of 30000 Dollars; but
represented the matter so falsly, that many
thought, he had some Right on his side; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the aforesaid Gentleman follow'd his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
Instructions so well, that he secur'd all
further Embeazlements of the Goods; Enform'd
the <hi>Bassa</hi> (by Letter) what Care His Majesty had
taken of him; comforted his Wife, and Servants,
who were before, in the utmost Despair; and
brought also an Inventory of what was taken, and
what remain'd behind.</p>
               <p>Nor was his Excellence on his part idle
at <hi>Rome;</hi> for he acquainted all the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Princes, and Governours with the fact; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
them, that if the King had not Justice done
him, He would do it himself; writ kindly to the
<hi>Bassa;</hi> left Letters at <hi>Genoua, Leghorn,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:51905:62"/>
for our Men of War (that call'd in) to pursue
the Pirate: And lastly, satisfi'd every body in
the main Point, to wit, of having Infidels, and
Enemies on Board; For he not only let them see,
the Determination, and Practice of the State of
<hi>Venice,</hi> the Grand Duke, and others, upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of ours in like cases, but shew'd them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
how the contrary Procedure, would be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
prejudice to All Christendom; for seeing
our Merchantmen, carry a hundred Forreign
Christians, to one Turk, if Turks, and their
Goods, were lawful Prize to the Christians, they
also must be so to the Turks, and consequently,
run the same Risque in their Persons, and Effects,
which now (as 'twas evident to every body) they
were absolutely out of danger of, tho' the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi>-Pirates,
or the Grand Signiors Fleet, should
meet them at Sea, and even knew, who they
were.</p>
               <p>In short, after much Negotiation, his
Excellence made <hi>Flori</hi> (as a Bandit or Out-Law)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51905:62"/>
totally abandon the Sea; Caus'd the Priz'd
Goods, and Persons, to be Restor'd to the <hi>Bassa;</hi>
Had the Security, for his Ransom, declar'd Null;
Sent his Money, and Jewels, found in the hands
of the Captain of the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Tripoli;</hi> and
forc'd the Vessel it self (now discountenanc'd
every where, and wanting all manner of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries)
to run into <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> where being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by the Officers, and pillag'd by her own
Men, she remain'd as a kind of Wreck: And
thus ended this Affair, to the Great Honour of
His Majesty, and the Reputation, and full Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of the English Navigation, thro' the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean;</hi>
Nor did his Excellence fail of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
many Thanks from the <hi>Bassa</hi> (who in the
end, lost no very great matter) and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
from all our Merchants in <hi>Italy,</hi> and
our Turky Company also.</p>
               <p>On the 23d. of <hi>June</hi> (as before) his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
left <hi>Rome,</hi> accompany'd by Cardinal
<hi>Howard,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Sir <hi>John Lytcott,</hi> and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51905:63"/>
other Persons of Quality in several Coaches, to
the first Post; and having there, taken his Leave
of them, and particularly of his Eminence (so
remarkable for his exemplary Life, and English
Temper; And who <hi>(Athanasius</hi> like) chose rather,
to change his Country, than any one Article of
the Catholick Faith) He prosecuted his Journey,
with great satisfaction as to the Heats, and Dust;
but not to the Ceremony, which he now hop'd,
to have been wholly free from; For he no sooner
arriv'd (the following night) at the first Village
in the Grand Duke's Territory, but he met there,
his Highnesse's Officers (with all necessary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments)
that expected him: From hence (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some stay in a Chamber particularly furnish't
for that purpose) he went on, and arriv'd (a little
before Sun-rising) at <hi>Radicofani,</hi> where he found
a Bed put up for him; and not only Wines, and
Provisions of all sorts (even <hi>Ortolani</hi>'s and the
like) but the Duke's Servants, and Cooks at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending;
And in the same manner was he still
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51905:63"/>
treated, where-ever he Repos'd, in this Generous
Prince's Dominions, as well on this, as on that
side <hi>Florence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Florence,</hi> his Highness order'd Duke
<hi>Salviati</hi>'s Palace (which is the best in Town) to be
put in Order for his Lordship; where he was
brought as soon as he arriv'd; and where Count
<hi>Magolotti,</hi> with great Attendance, was ready to
Receive him: His Excellence (after he had been
in Bed, and well refresht) went to Court to wait
on the Duke; and from him, was carried to the
Prince's Apartment, whom he saluted also. Next
day, they both came to see his Excellence, and
in the Evening, he waited on the Great Dutchess,
at her Villa, about a mile out of Town, where
the Beautiful young Princess also was. On the
Third day, the Duke invited his Excellence to see
the running of Barbs, after the Italian manner;
which being ended, he took leave of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and of the Ducal Family, who were all, then
present together; And having after Supper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51905:64"/>
his Obligations to Count <hi>Magolotti</hi>
(who never left him from first to last) he took
Post, and still found the same Treatment on the
way, where-ever he past in the Grand Duke's
Territories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bologna</hi> was the next City of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
and this, his Lordship pass'd at break of
day, leaving his Secretary to complement the
Cardinal Legat, and so follow to the design'd
Resting-place, about ten miles short of <hi>Modena;</hi>
where (as soon as the Post-Master could give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice)
Prince <hi>Caesar D'Este</hi> was pleas'd to come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
And carrying away his Excellence, they were
soon met on the Road, by the Duke's and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's
Coaches, with Persons of Quality in them, to
complement so welcom'd a Stranger.</p>
               <p>'Tis difficult to express the wonderful
Entertainment his Lordship found here; and
therefore, not to lessen it by a low, and flat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
I shall content my self in saying, That his
Excellence was lodg'd in the Palace it self; had
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51905:64"/>
several Gentlemen, Pages, and Officers, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to Attend him; was feasted by His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
both in Town, and at his Delicious <hi>Villa</hi>
of <hi>Sassoli;</hi> receiv'd all the Caresses imaginable
from the incomparable Cardinal; and in short,
that nothing was wanting in this Illustrious Prince,
or in his most Serene Family, that might express
the high Veneration, and Esteem, they all had,
for our Mighty Monarch, so great in himself, and
so happy in his Glorious Consort.</p>
               <p>The Embassador's stay here, was about a
week, and as Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> (out of his profound
Respect to the King and Queen) met him (as was
said) several miles from <hi>Modena,</hi> so he conducted
him as far out of the City on the other side, and
then with Embraces left him, having first gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Necessary Orders for his passage thro' <hi>Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi>
(which was about midnight) as also thro'
all other places of this flourishing Dukedom.
Nor did his Excellence make any further stop
till he came to <hi>Lyons:</hi> for he past <hi>Milan,</hi> send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51905:65"/>
only a Complement, by one of his Gentlemen,
to the Governour: And as for <hi>Turin,</hi> the Duke
and Dutchess, were then at one of their Palaces
in the Country.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Lyons,</hi> his Excellence was forc'd to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
himself for a day or two: And now the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being alter'd to the worse, his Journey to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
was neither so Pleasant, nor Easy, as otherwise it
would have been: But all the Inconveniencies of
it, were well repair'd, by the Noble Treatment he
found at our Envoy's Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> who having
in his long Ministry abroad, still kept up the
Dignity of the Character he bore, was now, far
from being behind in it: He met therefore his
Lordship on the Road; lodg'd him in his house;
feasted him there; accompany'd him to <hi>Versa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illes,</hi>
to wait upon the King; nor would he let
him stir in a fortnight; that is to say, till he was
probably sure, that the Yatcht (which was sent for)
would be attending at <hi>Calis,</hi> and so his Excellence
at his Arrival found it: But the Winds with-held
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51905:65"/>
him for two days, from going to Sea; after which
setting Sail, he landed in two days more at <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
and so came to <hi>London,</hi> staying only there, till
he could put himself and Attendants into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for at his leaving <hi>France,</hi> he receiv'd the ill
News, of the Death of that Excellent Lady, the
Dutchess of <hi>Modena,</hi> who had been so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
kind to him, and whom he left well, or at
least far from ill, at his departure from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude then, on the 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
1687.</hi> his Excellence went to <hi>Windsor,</hi> where
the King owning his Services, very graciously
gave him His Hand to kiss, as did also Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
who was pleas'd to acknowledge, that he
had fully answer'd her expectation.</p>
               <p>And thus ended this Great Embassy, in
which kind, no King has done more, and no
Embassador, that had not study'd his Masters
Honour, more than his own Profit, would have
done so much.</p>
