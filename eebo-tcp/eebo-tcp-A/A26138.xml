            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Original and Growth of PRINTING.</head>
            <p>COncerning the Time of bringing this Excellent ART into <hi>England,</hi> and by whoſe Expence and Procurement it was brought; Modern Writers of good Reputation do moſt Erroniouſly agree together. Mr. <hi>Stow,</hi> in his <hi>Survey</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> ſpeaking of the 37th year of Henry the ſixth his Reign, which was in 1459. ſaith, That the Noble Science of PRINTING was about this time found in <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Mentz</hi> by <hi>John Guttenberg</hi> a Knight, And that <hi>William Caxton</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Mercer, brought it into <hi>England</hi> about 1471. And firſt practiſed the ſame in the Abby of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; With whom Sir <hi>Rich. Baker</hi> in his Chronicle agrees through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. And Mr. <hi>Howell</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtorical Diſcourſe</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> agrees with both the former in the Time, Perſon, and Place in general; but more particularly declares the place in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to be the Almory there; And that <hi>Iſlip</hi> Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſet up the firſt Preſs of Book-Printing that ever was in <hi>England.</hi> Theſe three famous Hiſtorians having filled the World with the ſuppoſed truth of this Aſſertion, (Although poſſibly it might ariſe through the miſtake of the firſt Writer only, whoſe Memory I perfectly honour) makes it the harder Task upon me to undeceive the World again: Nor would I undertake this Work, but under a double notion; As I am a Friend to Truth, and ſo it is unfit to ſuffer one Man to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled to the worthy Achievements of another. And as a Friend to my ſelf, not to loſe one of my beſt Arguments of Intituling the King to this ART in his private Capacity.</p>
            <p>Hiſtorians muſt of neceſſity take many things upon truſt, they cannot with their own but with the Eyes of others ſee what things were done before they themſelves were, <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia</hi>; 'Tis not then impoſſible they ſhould miſtake. I ſhall now make it appear they have done ſo from their Own, as well as from other Arguments: Mr. <hi>Stows</hi> Expreſſions are very dubious, and the matter expreſt very Improbable; He ſaith PRINTING was found in <hi>Mentz,</hi> which preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it was practiſed ſome where elſe before, and loſt: And further, That 'twas found in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, in 1450. and not brought into <hi>England</hi> till Eleven years in the ſucceeding Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, being twelve years after, as if it had been loſt again. If this be true, there was as little Rarity as Expedition in obtaining it, the age of twelve years time having intervened, and ſo indeed it might be the Act of a Mercer rather than a more eminent Perſon: But when I conſider what great advantage the Kingdom in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral receives by it, I could not but think a publick Perſon and a publick Purſe muſt needs be concerned in ſo publick a Good. The more I Conſidered of this, the more inquiſitive I was to find out the truth of it: At laſt, a Book came to my hands Printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in 1468. which was three years before any of the recited Authors would allow it to be in <hi>England</hi>; which gave me ſome reward for my Curioſity, and encouragement to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further: And in proſecution of this Diſcovery, the ſame moſt worthy Perſon who truſted me with the aforeſaid Book, did alſo preſent me with the Copy of a Record and Manuſcript in <hi>Lambeth-Houſe,</hi> heretofore in his Cuſtody, belonging to the See, (and not to any particular Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>;) the Subſtance whereof was this, (though I hope, for publick ſatisfaction, the Record it ſelf, in its due time, will appear.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Bourchier,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> moved the then King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, to uſe all poſſible means for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Printing-Mold (for ſo 'twas there called) to be brought into this Kingdom; the King (a good Man, and much given to Works of this Nature) readily hearkned to the Motion; and taking private Advice, how to effect His Deſign, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it could not be brought about without great Secrecy, and a conſiderable Sum of Money given to ſuch Perſon or Perſons, as would draw off ſome of the Work-men from <hi>Harlem</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> where <hi>John Guttenberg</hi> had newly invented it, and was himſelf perſonally at Work: 'Twas Reſolv'd, that leſs then one Thouſand Marks would not produce the deſir'd Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Towards which Sum, the ſaid Arch-Biſhop preſented the King with Three Hundred Marks. The Money being now prepared, the Management of the Deſign was committed to Mr. <hi>Robert Turnour,</hi> who then was of the Robes to the King, and a Perſon moſt in Favour with Him, of any of his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Mr. <hi>Turnour</hi> took to his Aſſiſtance Mr. <hi>Caxton,</hi> a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of good Abilities, who Trading much into <hi>Holland,</hi> might be a Creditable Pretence, as well for his going, as ſtay in the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> Mr. <hi>Turnour</hi> was in Diſguiſe (his Beard and Hair ſhaven quite off) but Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> appeared known and publick. They having received the ſaid Sum of One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Marks, went firſt to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> then to <hi>Leyden,</hi> not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to enter <hi>Harlem</hi> it ſelf; for the Town was very jealous, having impriſoned and apprehended divers Perſons, who came from other Parts for the ſame purpoſe: They ſtaid till they had ſpent the whole One Thouſand Marks in Gifts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences: So as the King was fain to ſend Five Hundred Marks more, Mr. <hi>Turnour</hi> having written to the King, that he had almoſt done his Work; a Bargain (as he ſaid) being ſtruck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and two <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for bringing off one of the Work-Men, who ſhould ſufficiently Diſcover and Teach this New Art: At laſt, with much ado, they got off one of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Workmen, whoſe Name was <hi>Frederick Corſellis,</hi> who late one Night ſtole from his Fellows in Diſguiſe, into a Veſſel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for that purpoſe; and ſo the Wind (favouring the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign) brought him ſafe to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas not thought ſo prudent, to ſet him on Work at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> (but by the Arch-Biſhops means, who had been Vice-Chancellor, and afterwards Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,) Corſellis</hi> was carryed with a Guard to <hi>Oxford</hi>; which Guard conſtantly watch'd, to prevent <hi>Corſellis</hi> from any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſcape, till he had made good his promiſe in Teaching how to Print: So that at <hi>Oxford</hi> Printing was firſt ſet up in <hi>England,</hi> which was before there was any Printing-Preſs, or Printer, in <hi>France, Spain, Italy,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> (except the City of <hi>Mentz</hi>) which claims Seniority, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to Printing, even of <hi>Harlem</hi> itſelf, calling her City, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbem Moguntinam Artis Typographicae Inventricem primam,</hi> though 'tis known to be otherwiſe, that City gaining that Art by the Brother of one of the Workmen of <hi>Harlem,</hi> who had learnt it at Home of his Brother, and after ſet up for himſelf at <hi>Mentz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Preſs at <hi>Oxford</hi> was at leaſt ten years before there was any Printing in <hi>Europe</hi> (except at <hi>Harlem,</hi> and <hi>Mentz</hi>) where alſo it was but new born. This Preſs at <hi>Oxford,</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found inconvenient, to be the ſole Printing-place of <hi>England,</hi> as being too far from <hi>London,</hi> and the Sea: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King ſet up a Preſs at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and another in the Abby of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where they Printed ſeveral Books of Divinity and Phyſick, for the King, (for Reaſons beſt known to himſelf and Council) permitted then no Law-Books to be Printed; nor did any Printer Exerciſe that ART, but onely ſuch as were the Kings ſworn Servants; the King himſelf ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Price and Emolument for Printing Books.</p>
            <p>Printing thus brought into <hi>England,</hi> was moſt Graciouſly Received by the King, and moſt Cordially Entertained by the Church, the Printers having the Honour to be ſworn the Kings Servants, and the Favour to Lodge in the very Boſom of the Church; as in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> St. <hi>Albans, Oxford,</hi> &amp;c. By this means the ART grew ſo famous, that <hi>Anno prim. Rich.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. when an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> was made for Reſtraint of Aliens, from uſing any Handicrafts here, except as Servants to Natives, a ſpecial <hi>Proviſo</hi> was inſerted, that Strangers might bring in Printed or Written Books, to ſell at their pleaſure, and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the ART of Printing here, notwithſtanding that Act: So that in the ſpace of 40 or 50 years, by the ſpecial Induſtry and Indulgence of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> prov'd ſo good Proficients in <hi>Printing,</hi> and grew ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as to furniſh the Kingdom with Books; and ſo Skilful, as to <hi>Print</hi> them as well as any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>yond the Seas, as appears by the Act of the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. which Abrogates the ſaid <hi>Proviſo</hi> for that Reaſon. And it was further Enacted in the ſaid Statute, That if any perſon bought Forreign books Bound, he ſhould pay 6<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d. per</hi> Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Printing</hi> became now ſo dangerous to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, That there were more Books Burnt in Ten years, then could be Printed in Twenty: So that it Concern'd the Prince altogether as much to Suppreſs the Abuſe, as it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Obtain the Uſe of <hi>Printing</hi>; And had there not been a Reſerve of Licenſing ſuch Books as ſhould be <hi>Printed</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Crown, they might have publiſhed the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own Imaginations with Authority. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at her very firſt Entrance to the Crown, finding ſo great Diſorders in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> by reaſon of the abuſe in <hi>Printing,</hi> Secures in the firſt place the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> of both which the Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> have Inherent Right as Heads of the Church, and Supream of the Law; and not onely in their publick, but private Capacity, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors; the Power and Signiory of this, under Favour, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſevered from the Crown: The Kings being the Truſtees of the People, who have formerly taken an Oath at their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, <hi>That they ſhall keep all the Lands, Honours, and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Rights, and Freedoms of the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>in all manner whole without any manner of miniſhment; and the Right of the Crown, hurt, decay'd, or loſt, to their Power ſhall call again into the Ancient Eſtate.</hi> Which Oath, the ſaid Queen kept inviolably, and liv'd the more quietly for it all the time of her Reign, and died in Peace. True it is, they may, and do gratifie their Friends and Servants, in giving them the Emoluments and Profits that ariſe from <hi>Printing</hi>; but the Power they cannot alienate from the Crown, without loſing the moſt precious Stone out of their Diadem. To ſhew you one Example for all: The ſaid Queen, the firſt Year of her Reign, grants by Patent the Priviledge of ſole <hi>Printing</hi> all Books, that touch or concern the Common-Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>
