            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Suter</hi> who prayeth is King <hi>Dauid:</hi> Next, <hi>for whom hee prayeth,</hi> it is for <hi>Solomon:</hi> And thirdlie the <hi>thinges that hee suteth,</hi> which are three: First, the <hi>Gift</hi> of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wisedome; <hi>verse</hi> 1. 2. The <hi>vse of that Gift</hi> in righteous Iudgement: <hi>verse</hi> 2. And thirdlie the <hi>fruite</hi> of that <hi>Gift</hi> so vsed, <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquillitie: verse</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>For the first, the Suter is King <hi>Dauid,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> for<note place="margin">King <hi>Dauid</hi> a Supplicant.</note> his Childe, a <hi>King</hi> for his succeeding Sonne, and a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> for one that GOD was to blesse. Nature might moue him as a Father to seeke the good of his Sonne; and Civilitie as a King, a greater Father of a Kingdome, to seeke the good of his Successour: But as a Prophet hee is moued diuinly to sute that which GOD had showne him hee was purposed to doe: In the first two respects, hee had an ordinary grace as a Father, and a King to seeke this Blessing. In the thrid: hee had an extraordinarie gift to augment the former two, beeing priuie to Gods mind in this particular. Therefore it is not onelie a Prayer, but a Blessing: The one suting a Gift, the other conferring the sought <hi>Gift,</hi> or rather declaring that it was to bee conferred on <hi>Solomon.</hi>

So that this Prayer is not so much a Prayer for obtaining, as a prophecie that hee shall obtaine. That extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar Gift is now ceased in the Church, yet euery one<note place="margin">Amos cap 3 5</note> should take heede how hee prayes: That as the matter hee seekes is good in it selfe, needfull for vs, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">Cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ipse Pater qui largitur ista suggerat peti, &amp;c.

                        <p>GOD had purposed this blessing to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and now hee moueth <hi>Dauid</hi> to pray for it as a meanes both to giue his purposed Gift to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and to oblige <hi>Dauid</hi> the more for obtaining of it by prayer: The Blessing hee hath ordained for vs, hee giues an heart to seeke it, and in the very time of so free and affectuous seeking, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in vs an hope of receiuing: <hi>For wee know not what</hi>

                        <p>Prayer is on our part a Condition required, and a meane to obtaine; and on Gods part, a sort of beginning and obligeing to giue vs that blessing that he hath made vs to seeke.

and then to performe it in vs, that as GOD presenteth Saluation vnder condition of Faith and other workes of grace, so hee promiseth these conditions, and worketh them in vs. <hi>Hee promised that they should beleeue, who said, And they shall not teach euery man his neighbour,</hi>

So soone as the father dyes, the most powerfull Brother embrues his Funerals in the blood of all the rest of his Brethren; but there the father bathed himselfe in the funerall of his sonne.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18470:21"/>
                        <hi>There is no such Rhetorick to perswad a people to loue the Kings Sonne, as the good governement of his Father:</hi> Their loue to the Sonne diminishes not their loue to the Father, but rather augments it; and the increase of the Obiect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth loyalty.

                        <p>The Lord who hath blessed vs with this ioyfull Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and brought vs together in this house, to testifie our ioy before Man and Angels, put this Day amongst these <hi>white and ioyfull Dayes, that are marked with rare bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,</hi> and make it a <hi>period and beginning</hi> of a ioyfull reckoning of yeares to come.

                        <p>Next, this exception <hi>chargeth the Primitiue Church with many faults:</hi> As <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that they knew not their right: And <hi>Feeblenesse,</hi> that they drust not vse it: Of <hi>Prevarication,</hi> that they neglected to plead that greatest Article of Faith, And of <hi>Infirmitie,</hi> that they neither knew the right, nor had power to maintaine it.

their power. And what sturres see wee presentlie in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope for the vrging of their Monarchie?

                        </p>
                        <p>Their second shift is, that these first <hi>times called them more to Martyrdome, than to represse Princes,</hi>

                        <p>Their third shift is <hi>from Merite:</hi> That these Auncients were not <hi>oblidged to obey infidell Princes, so that their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was meritorious,</hi> and that they who did the worke manfullie <hi>in resist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Their fourth shift is, <hi>that there was no matter, or subiect of the vse of their power, because then there was no Christian Emperours.</hi>

But the two maine causes of these broyles (<hi>vsurping over Princes, and rooting out of Protestants</hi>) flow from the Pope.

Therefore hee maketh greater Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the lesser, and feedeth discords among the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to weaken them mutuallie, and withall stirreth them vp to destroy the Protestants.</p>
