         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>For here we have no abiding City, but
we ſeek one to come.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <div type="introduction">
               <p>IN theſe words the Author encourages Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
couragiouſly to bear up under reproaches,
in Conformity to their Lord and Maſter, who
in a diſgraceful manner was Crucified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the City, as if they thought his Blood
would have deſecrated it; or feared, leſt his laſt
Breath might have ſcattered a Contagion through it.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152987:3"/>
Let us therefore, ſaith he in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Verſe, go forth
unto him without the Camp, bearing his reproach:</hi> i.e.
Let us be contented with him, to be thrown forth,
as the dung and off-ſcouring of the ſtreets, from the
Society of Men; and not be concerned, that for his
ſake we are made the abjects of the Earth: <hi>For
here we have no abiding City;</hi> and ſo 'tis not long that
we ſhall endure this, <hi>but we ſeek one to come,</hi> whither,
when we are once arrived, we ſhall be above all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and malice for ever.</p>
               <p>In which words you have,</p>
               <p>I. The Chriſtian's preſent State, <hi>Here we have
no abiding City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. The Chriſtian's preſent practice, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his future ſtate, <hi>but we ſeek one to come.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <p>I. I begin with the firſt, <hi>Here we have no abiding
City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The preſent and future ſtate of Chriſtians, is here
compared to a City, in alluſion, I ſuppoſe, to thoſe,
who though they were not born at <hi>Rome,</hi> but lived
it may be, a great way off from it, had yet <hi>Jus Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis
Romanae,</hi> the Priviledges of Citizens of <hi>Rome;</hi>
even as we Chriſtians, though we are born in this
World, and do ſpend our lives in it, do yet belong
to another Corporation, and are Denizens of that
City which is above: and therefore, ſaith he, this
preſent ſtate is not our home, in this City we are but
Foreigners, and do only ſojourn in it for a time, till
we go home to the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the place
of our abode, and the City we are already free of.
And indeed, that <hi>Here we have no abiding City,</hi> is a
truth ſo ſenſible, that one would think we need not
be put in mind of it; for which way ſoever we
turn our Eyes, we ſee a dark and deadly ſhade over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152987:3"/>
the World, and behold Men vaniſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day like the ſmoke, quitting the Stage round
about us, and diſappearing almoſt as ſoon as they
have ſhewed themſelves. To day we converſe with
our Friends, and among our other Feſtivities, we
tickle our ſelves with the Joys of our future Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation:
To Morrow their Paſſing-Bell tells us a ſad
ſtory, that they are gone to converſe with Worms,
where theſe Eyes of ours ſhall never ſee them more;
and indeed, if we conſider our preſent ſtate, we are
but a kind of fictitious Beings, that rather ſeem to be,
than are; and do ſo little deſerve to be taken for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
that we only ſerve to cheat one another into
an opinion, that we truly exiſt; when preſently, by
vaniſhing away, we baffle that Opinion, and ſhew
our ſelves to be but hovering ſhadows, that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are, and are not. Indeed all Created things
have more of not being than of being in them. For
it is only a limited portion of being which they have;
but there is an infinitude of being which they have
not: So that being infinitely nearer to nothingneſs,
than to fullneſs of being, they rather deſerve to be
called nothing, than real beings. And if the beſt of our
being be ſo near to nothing, what is our outward
Man, which is but the umbrage and ſhadow of our
being? Alas! If we conſider the Frame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of it, it is nothing but a continual Flux
and defluence of parts, inſomuch, that each Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterick
of our Age, changes our whole Fabrick,
and we are at no one time all our ſelves, but ſeven
years hence ſhall be another thing: This Body will
be all vaniſhed and gone; and of the parts it now
conſiſts, there will be none remaining. So that
while we are, we are haſtening away, and within a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152987:4"/>
little time, ſhall vaniſh into Worms-Meat. And hence it
is, that the Scripture compares our preſent life to ſuch
fleeting and evanid things, to an Image, a Dream,
a Poſt, a Shadow; by all which, it's deſign is, to
make us ſenſible of this truth, that <hi>Here we have no
abiding City.</hi> And indeed, ſo volatile and fugitive is
our preſent Exiſtence, that if it were not for another
World, it were ſcarce worth the while for a Man to
be. And could we but have underſtood, before we
came into being, what an uncomfortable Stage this
World is, I am apt to think, we ſhould rather have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to remain for ever in the Womb of nothing, than
venture into the Theatre of beings, only to take a turn,
or two, and weep, and grone, and die. For what
an impertinent thing would it be, for a Man to come
out of nothing into being, only to open his Eyes, and
look about him, and vaniſh into nothing again. And
yet this is all that moſt of thoſe do that are born into
the World; and as for thoſe that act a longer part,
there is, alas! ſo much of Tragedy in it, that the
Pain doth even counter-balance the Pleaſure of it. That
therefore which makes Life truly deſirable, is this,
That though <hi>we have here no continuing City,</hi> yet <hi>we
look for one to come;</hi> which is the ſecond part of the
Text, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <div n="2" type="part">
               <p>II. The Chriſtian's preſent Practice, in order to his
future State, <hi>but we ſeek one to come;</hi> which implies
theſe four things,</p>
               <p>1. Our belief of the reality of this abiding State.</p>
               <p>2. Our hope and expectation of enjoying it.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:152987:4"/>
Of each of theſe briefly.</p>
               <div n="1" type="subpart">
                  <p>1. Our ſeeking this abiding City, implies our
ſincere belief of the reality and exiſtence of it: For
what wiſe Man will hunt after a Dream, and a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
which he believes hath no Being or Exiſtence?
Who was ever ſo mad, as to make a Voyage for Gold
or Spices to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia?</hi> For that which I believe is not,
is to me, as if it were not; and hath no more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon us, than the moſt palpable Dream and
Fiction. So that how real ſoever Heaven be in it
ſelf, it is impoſſible it ſhould move us to ſeek after it,
unleſs we believe its Exiſtence. 'Tis our Faith muſt
influence our Minds, and Spirit all our powers of
action; otherwiſe, all the Joys of another World,
will never be able to move or affect us. Unleſs our
Faith aſcends the <hi>Piſgah</hi> of God's Promiſes, and from
thence takes a view of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and of thoſe
Joys and Delights it flows and abounds with, we
ſhall loiter for ever in this Wilderneſs, and never
think our ſelves concerned to ſeek any other Country
or Habitation. But, <hi>Faith</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of things hop'd for, and the evidence of things not
ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. <hi>i. e.</hi> 'Tis that which realizes Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to us, and poſſeſſes our Minds with its Being and
Exiſtence; and when this is once done, one would
think it ſhould be impoſſible to withold us from the
queſt and purſuit of it; eſpecially, if to our Faith we
add the next thing which this ſeeking implies, and
that is,</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="subpart">
                  <p>2. A lively hope and expectation of enjoying it.
For no Man will ſeek after that which he never hopes
to find, or enjoy. A Man may poſſibly be ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant,
as to deſire to fly up to the Stars, that ſo he
may the better ſurvey their refulgent Bodies, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152987:5"/>
ſearch into their Form and Subſtance; but no Man
was ever ſo mad to attempt it, becauſe he knows it
is impoſſible: And ſo, if a Man did only believe
there were a Heaven of joys above, but had no hope
of coming thither; he might poſſibly deſire againſt
hope, and wiſh that he could fly up thither, but he
could never be ſo vain as to indeavour; his deſpair
would cramp the ſinews of his action, and freeze up
all the motions of his Soul; and all the Joys of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
would no more be able to affect or move him,
than the promiſe of a mighty Empire in the World
in the Moon. Wherefore to put us upon ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Heaven, it is neceſſary, that our Minds ſhould be
animated and enlivened with a vigorous hope and
expectation of it: That our Hearts ſhould be inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a ſtrong perſwaſion; not only that there is
a Heaven of Endleſs Joys on t'other ſide the Grave,
but that it is poſſible for us to arrive to it; and that,
if by a patient continuance in well-doing, we faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
contend and aſpire after it, we ſhall be ſure not
to fall ſhort of it: which perſwaſion is ſufficient to
animate the moſt dull and reſtful Soul, and make it
all Life, and Spirit, and Wing, in the purſuit of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Immortality.</p>

               <div n="3" type="subpart">
                  <p>3. <hi>Our ſeeking this abiding City,</hi> doth alſo imply
our propoſing it to our ſelves, as the great end and

after, he makes the great end of his ſearch and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution;
and no Man can be ſaid to ſeek in earneſt
after Heaven, who doth not ſet it up, as the great
mark of his Actions, and the ultimate point and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre

Life is expreſly ſaid to be the end of having
our Fruit unto Holineſs, and as ſuch we are bid to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152987:5"/>

Everlaſting Life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. and to do good, that
we may lay hold on Eternal Life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 18, 19.
and conſequently Heaven is deſcribed to be the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's
<hi>Canaan,</hi> to which we are to direct all our ſteps,
while we are travelling through this World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
14, 15. and the whole Life of a Chriſtian is expreſt

through the whole courſe of this Life, with Heaven
in our Eyes, and conſtantly directing all our ſteps and
actions thither: not that it is neceſſary we ſhould
actually aim at Heaven in every action we perform;
for that is impoſſible, our thoughts being very often
otherwiſe imployed, by the neceſſary occaſions of this
Life, and always unable to attend many things at
once. It is ſufficient therefore, that we habitually
intend and aim at Heaven, and propoſe it as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and fixed end of our Actions; that we make
it the ſtanding Goal of our Race, and in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

and implies the proſecuting an end by due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
means; ſo that our ſeeking Heaven denotes
our vigorous proſecution of it, by a courſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
actions. Wherefore, ſince Heaven, as I have
often ſhew'd you, is nothing elſe but the Perfection
of all Vertue and Piety, ſeeking Heaven, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
imply our purſuing and endeavouring after it,
in a conſtant ſeries of Pious and Vertuous Courſes;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152987:6"/>
in which Courſes, we are gradually growing up to
Heaven, and riſing to that Bleſſed State, in which
Piety and Vertue will be our Everlaſting Pleaſure and
Entertainment. And hence we are ſaid, by patient
Continuance in well-doing, to ſeek for Honour and
Glory, Immortality and Eternal Life: Every degree
of Vertue and Piety we arrive to, being a ſtep to
Glory, and a Stair to the Chambers of Bleſſedneſs.
Wherefore our queſt of Heaven, is very truly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by the Apoſtle, to conſiſt in <hi>all diligence, to add
to our faith vertue, and to our vertue knowledge, and to
our knowledge temperance, and to our temperance patience,
and to our patience godlineſs, and to our godlineſs brotherly
kindneſs, and to our brotherly-kindneſs charity; for ſo,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7, 11. And now give
me leave to conclude this Argument with three or
four Inferences.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="1" type="subpart">
                  <p>1. From hence I infer, how much we are obliged
to be contented and ſatisfied under all the preſent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of this Life. For ſince our abiding City is to
come, it can be but a little while ere all theſe ſtorms
will be blown over, and conclude in an Everlaſting
Calm: and when that Bleſſed time comes, Lord!
How trifling and inconſiderable will all our preſent
griefs appear! And with what Contempt ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon our preſent meanneſs of Spirit, that could
not bear with a few inconveniencies on the Road to
the Bleſſed City of our abode. Wherefore if our
Voyage be not ſo pleaſant as we would have it, let
us remember 'tis not long, we have but a ſhort days
Sail to Eternity; and when once we are landed on
that Bleſſed Shore, with what raviſhing Content and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152987:6"/>
Satisfaction ſhall we look back on the rough and boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous
Seas we have paſt, and for ever bleſs the
Storms and Winds that drove us to that happy Port.
Let us therefore comfort our ſelves with theſe things,
and when at any time our Spirits are ſinking under
any Worldly trouble, conclude with our ſelves, that
while we have a Heaven to hope for, we can never
be miſerable. When therefore we are bemoaning
our ſelves under preſent griefs and afflictions, let us
lift up our dejected Eyes to yonder bleſſed Regions of
Reward, and think of thoſe Joys and Pleaſures,
thoſe Crowns and Everlaſting Triumphs which do
there await us; and conſider how neceſſary theſe
bitter trials are to prepare us for, and waft us to
them: And if this doth not ſtop our Mouths, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
our complaints for ever; nay, if it doth not
cauſe us to rejoice in our Tribulations, and to thank
God for them on our bended Knees: If it doth not
make us chearfully ſubmit, and cry out with that
reſigned Soul, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re, Seca, Vulnera.</hi> Lord, burn or
cut, or wound me as thou pleaſeſt; ſtrip me of all
my deareſt Comforts, handle me as ſeverely as thou
wilt, ſo I may have but my Fruit unto Holineſs, and
my End Everlaſting Life. If, I ſay, we can complain
of our preſent afflictions, while we thus compare
them with our future reward; we are infinitely fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
and ungrateful. But then,</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="subpart">
                  <p>2. Hence alſo I infer what a vaſt deal of reaſon we
have to ſlight and contemn this World; for we are
born to infinitely greater hopes than any this World
can propoſe to us; even to the hopes of an abiding
City, where our Happineſs ſhall be no longer the
ſport and dalliance of every puff of Wind, the Ball of
every accident and contingency; but remain for ever
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152987:7"/>
ſafe and inviolable, as the happineſs of God himſelf.
And it being thus, methinks our Ambition ſhould
ſore as high as our hope, and diſdain ſuch low and
ignoble Quarries, as the Pleaſures, and Profits, and
Honours of this Life. Sure, Sirs, We miſtake the
Scene of our Immortality: We fancy that our abiding
City hath ſhifted its ſituation, and is come down
from Heaven to fix its Foundations here below; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
we are moſt ſtrangely beſotted, who being
born to live for ever above, in Everlaſting Glory and
Delight, can ſuffer our ſelves to doat, as we do, upon
the tranſitory Vanities of this Life. O could we ſtand
a while in the mid-way between Heaven and Earth,
and at one Proſpect ſee the Glories of both, how faint
and dim would all the Glories of this World appear
to us in compariſon with thoſe above! how would
they ſneak and diſappear in the preſence of that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Brightneſs! how would they be forc'd to ſhroud
their vanquiſh'd Glories, as Stars do when the Sun
appears, whilſt we interchangeably turn'd our Eyes
from one to the other! With what ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
ſhould we reflect upon the wretched groveling
temper of our minds! What poor mean-ſpirited Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
we are, to ſatisfie our ſelves with the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
trifles of this World, when we have all the Joys
of an Everlaſting Heaven before us! and may, if we
pleaſe, after a few moments of Obedience, be poſſeſt
of them for ever. Ah! fooliſh Creatures that we are,
thus to prefer a far Country, where we live on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Husks, before the Everlaſting Feſtivities of
our Father's Houſe and Boſom; thus fooliſhly to,
chuſe <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Fate, and leave Crowns and
Sceptres, to live among the Salvage Herds of the
Wilderneſs; Could but the bleſſed Saints above, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152987:7"/>
ſo much from their more happy employments, as
to look down a little from their Thrones of Glory,
and ſee how buſie poor Mortals are a ſcrambling for
this wretched Pelf, which within a few Months they
muſt leave for ever. How they juſtle and run coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
defeat, defraud, and undermine one another:
What a moſt ridiculous Spectacle would it appear to
them; with what ſcorn would they look on it, or
rather, with what pity, to ſee a Company of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-born
Souls, that are capable of, and deſigned for
the ſame Glory and Happineſs with themſelves, thus
miſerably buſied and employed! One priding it ſelf
in a gay Suit, another hugging a Bag of gliſtering
Earth, and a third ſtewing in Luxury and Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
and all employ'd at that ſordid rate, as if
they had nothing to do with Heaven. To tell you
truly and ſeriouſly my thoughts, I cannot imagine, but
if when we are thus extravagantly concern'd about
the pitiful trifles of this World, thoſe bleſſed Spirits
do ſee and converſe with us; it is a much more ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous
ſight in their Eyes, than 'twould be in ours to
ſee a Company of Boys, with mighty zeal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
wrangling for a Bag of Cherry-Stones. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in the Name of God, Sirs, Let us not expoſe
our ſelves any longer to the juſt deriſion of all the
World, by our exceſſive dotage upon the vanities of
this Life, but let us ſeriouſly conſider, that we are all
concern'd in matters of much higher importance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the Joys and Fruitions of that abiding City
which is to come.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="subpart">
                  <p>3. Hence alſo I infer, how unreaſonable a thing it
is for good Men to be afraid of dying, ſince on the
other ſide of their Grave, there is an abiding City
ready to receive and entertain them. So that to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152987:8"/>
them Death is but a dark Entry out of a Wilderneſs of
Sorrows into a Paradiſe of Eternal Pleaſure. And
therefore, if it be an unreaſonable thing for ſick Men
to dread their recovery, for Slaves to tremble at their
Jubilee, for Priſoners to quake at the news of a Gaol-Delivery;
how much more unreaſonable is it, for
good Men to be afraid of Death, which is but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany
paſſage from Sickneſs, Labour, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement,
to Eternal Health, and Reſt, and Liberty.
'Tis true, the paſſage from one to the other, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
very painful and grievous, but what of that:
in other Caſes we are willing enough to endure a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Pain in order to a future Eaſe; and if a few
Mortal Pangs will work a perfect Cure on me, and
recover me to Everlaſting Health, methinks the hope
of this Bleſſed Effect, ſhould ſweeten and indear that
Agony. But alas! to die, is to leave all our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
to bid adieu to our deareſt Friends and
Relatives, and to paſs into an unknown State, where
we are to converſe with Strangers, whoſe Laws and
Cuſtoms we are unacquainted with. Why now, all
that looks ſad in this, is a very great miſtake: For I
verily hope, I have more Friends, Acquaintance, and
Relations in Heaven, than I ſhall leave behind me
here on Earth: and if ſo, I do but go from worſe
Friends to better; for one Friend there, is worth a
thouſand here, in reſpect of all thoſe indearing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments
which render a Friend a Jewel: but
if I die a good Man, I ſhall carry into Eternity with
me, the genius and temper of a glorified Spirit, and
that will recommend me to all the Society of Heaven,
and render the Spirits of thoſe juſt Men, whoſe
Names I never heard of, as dear and familiar Friends
to me in an inſtant, as if they had been my ancient
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152987:8"/>
Cronies and Acquaintance. But why ſhould I grieve
at parting with my Friends below, when I ſhall go
to the beſt Friends I have in all the World; to God
my Father, to Jeſus my Redeemer, to the Holy
Ghoſt my conſtant Comforter and Aſſiſtant: and
what though that ſtate, and the Laws and Cuſtoms
of it, be in a great meaſure unknown to me; yet
what I know is infinitely deſirable: from whence I
may reaſonably infer, that what I know not, is ſo too;
and if I have but the Temper of Heaven, I am ſure
I ſhall eaſily comply with the Heavenly Laws and
Cuſtoms. So that conſidering all, I cannot well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
what ſhould move a good and well-reſolv'd
Man, to be afraid of dying; for when I am verily
perſwaded, that Death is only a narrow Stream, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
between Time and Eternity; and I ſee my God
and my Saviour, with Crowns of Glory in their
Hands, beckoning to me, from the further ſhore, to
come over and receive thoſe bleſſed recompences:
Why ſhould I thus ſtand ſhivering on the Bank, like
a naked timorous Boy, as if I were afraid to dip my
Foot in the cold ſtream of Fate, which as ſoon as I
am in, I am over, and landed ſafely on Eternal Bliſs.
But to conclude,</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="subpart">
                  <p>4. And laſtly, Hence alſo I infer, how diligent and
induſtrious we ought to be in Religion, ſince we are
therein ſeeking this abiding City; and how can we
account any work hard, of which Heaven is to be the
Wages. Methinks this ſhould be enough to infuſe
new Life and Spirit into the moſt Creſt-fal'n Souls;
for how much pains do we ordinarily take upon far
leſs hopes, in hopes of a little tranſitory Wealth, which
we know we ſhall enjoy but a few years, and then
part with it for ever. We thruſt our ſelves into a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152987:9"/>
perpetual Crowd and tumult of Buſineſs, where with
vaſt concern and thoughtfulneſs, with eager and
paſſionate Proſecutions, we toil and weary out our
ſelves, and make our lives a conſtant Drudgery; and
ſhall we flag when Heaven is the object of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions.
When therefore we find our endeavours
in Religion begin to droop and flag, let us lift up our
Eyes to that Crown of Glory; and if we are capable
of being moved by objects of the greateſt value, that
muſt infuſe new vigour into us, and make us all Life,
and Spirit, and Wing, whilſt we are running the
ways of God's Commandments. For what though
my way lies up the Hill, through Thorns, and over
Precipices, ſo that I ſweat and ſmart at every ſtep,
and each aſſent is a torment to me; yet when I am
up, I am ſure to be entertain'd with ſuch pleaſant
Gales, and glorious Proſpects, as will infinitely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance
all my Pains in climbing thither; ſo that
there, with an over-joyed heart, I ſhall ſit down, and
bleſs my labours. Bleſſed be you my bitter Agonies
and ſharp conflicts; Bleſſed be you my importunate
Prayers and well-ſpent Tears, for now I am fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid
for you all; and do reap ten thouſand times
more Joys from you, than ever I endur'd Pains. For
what are the Pains of a moment to the Pleaſures of
an Eternity? Wherefore hold out my Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
yet a little longer, and your Work will ſoon
be at an end; and after a few laborious Week Days,
you ſhall keep an Everlaſting Sabbath: For what
though your Voyage be through a ſtormy Sea, yet
'tis to the <hi>Indies</hi> of Happineſs, and a few Leagues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lies that Bleſſed Port, where you ſhall be
Crowned as ſoon as you are landed. Go on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
O my Soul, with thy utmoſt Courage and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152987:9"/>
Alacrity, and then let the Winds bluſter, and the
Waves ſwell never ſo much, yet thou canſt not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
unleſs thou wilt. For thou art not like other
Paſſengers, left to the mercy of Wind and Weather;
but thy Fate is in thine own hands, and if thou wilt
have but thy Fruit unto Holineſs, thy End ſhall be
Everlaſting Life.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <p>AND now I will crave your leave to conclude
with a few Words upon this ſorrowful Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
the Funeral of my Lady <hi>Newland;</hi> with whom
I never had the Happineſs to be otherwiſe acquainted,
than by the frequent Reports I have heard of her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
Piety and Vertue; which was ſuch, as I think
my ſelf bound in Juſtice, both to her and you, not
to bury them with her, but, ſo far as in me lies, to
Embalm her Memory with them, and to repreſent
them, as an Excellent Pattern to you, her Survivers.
And what I ſhall ſay of her, I have under the hand of
her Reverend Paſtor, who intimately knew her, while
ſhe was living, and who attended her, through her
Sickneſs, to the Gates of Eternity. She had a Mind
fairly prepared for the Eternal Exerciſe, and Joy of
Saints and Angels; which is, to adore and praiſe the
Fountain of their Being and Happineſs; as appeared
by the Conſtancy of her Devotions, both in private
and publick; in private, her Devotion was always
the firſt buſineſs in the Morning, near two hours of
which ſhe continually ſpent in Prayer, and Reading,
and Meditation; and how late ſoever ſhe happened
to be detained at Night, whether by buſineſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Diverſion, ſhe always ſeparated, at leaſt, one
hour from her reſt, for the ſame Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Exerciſes; after which, ſhe conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152987:10"/>
the Family Devotions, not ſuffering one Duty
to interfere with another. And then as for her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
upon the publick Prayers of the Church, it
was ſo remarkably conſtant, that whenever ſhe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
from them, one might certainly conclude, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that ſhe was detained by Sickneſs, or ſome very
extraordinary Occaſion: Yea, ſo very exact and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
was ſhe in this matter, that ſhe always took
care, ſo to contrive her Buſineſs, and Diverſion, as
that they might comport with her Attendance on the
publick Service; ſo as that when ever it did ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
as that ſhe could not be preſent, either Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Evening, in her own Pariſh Church, ſhe
might be ſure not to miſs of it in ſome other. And
as for the Holy Sacrament, that beſt Repaſt and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
of Devout Souls, ſhe was a conſtant Gueſt at it,
once a Month at leaſt, and as for the moſt part often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as ſhe found opportunity, her hunger and thirſt
after that Righteouſneſs therein ſealed and conveyed,
being too eager to be ſatisfied with the common
ſtint of twice or thrice a Years participation of it.
Thus did this Divine and Heavenly Soul ſpend the
much greater part of her Life in Heaven, and this
in ſo great a plenty of Worldly Enjoyments, as was
ſufficient to have corrupted an ordinary Piety, and
to have vitiated its reliſh of the Enjoyments of the
World to come. And which is very remarkable, this
ſevere and abſtracted kind of Life, which ſhe led,
and which in others, is too commonly attended with
ſome very bad conſequents, with Moroſeneſs and
Peeviſhneſs, Pride and Cenſoriouſneſs; was ſo far
from producing theſe bad effects in her, that they
produc'd the quite contrary: For as for her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
it was always free and open, charming and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152987:10"/>
obliging; and, as my Author expreſſes it, carried
ſuch an amiable air about it, as ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
the excellency of the temper from whence it
did proceed: And ſo remote was ſhe from any thing
that lookt like Pride and Self-Conceit, that I am
very apt to think, there is no Perſon in the World
could think ſo meanly of her as ſhe did of her ſelf;
none that ſhe found ſo much fault with, as ſhe did
with her ſelf. She was a very ſevere, and truly I
believe, a too ſevere Animadverter on her own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for though ſhe was ſo punctual in her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
upon the Worſhip of God, both in private
and publick; yet when in the opinion of others, the
condition of her Health made her abſence from the
publick neceſſary, ſhe could hardly allow her ſelf to
be thereby excuſed; fearing, as ſhe often expreſs'd
her ſelf (out of the tenderneſs of her Piety) that her
indiſpoſition was not to that degree, as to excuſe or
juſtify her omiſſions before God. She would often
acknowledge, in the moſt ſenſible manner, her own
great Unworthineſs; the ſenſe of which, would ſtill
raiſe up her Soul to the higheſt ſtrains of Praiſe and
Thankſgivings to God, for his manifold Mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her; and particularly, for preſerving her, by
his Grace, from falling into the greateſt Impieties.
And as for the many temporal Bleſſings which God
had heapt upon her, with ſo liberal a hand, ſhe took
great care, by her Works of Charity, to make her a
ſure Friend of the <hi>Mammon</hi> of Unrighteouſneſs, and
to convert and improve them into Everlaſting Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
And ſo far was the ſeverity of her Piety,
from rendring her cenſorious of others, that ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
took care to make the moſt Charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
of Men, and to put the beſt comment, ſhe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152987:11"/>
could, even upon the worſt actions: ſuch as would
bear a fair ſenſe, ſhe was always ready to vindicate
from foul imputations; and ſuch as ſhe could not
excuſe, ſhe would indeavour to extenuate. And
then, if you conſider her as to her Relative Vertues,
ſhe was a great Pattern in them all: As a Child to
her Father, who died not long ago, ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for her Piety and Obedience; as a Wife,
for her Love, Reſpect and Obſervance to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
as a Mother, for her tender care of, and good
Counſels to, and prudent Authority over her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
As a Miſtreſs, for her Condeſcention, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Gentleneſs to her Servants: And in a word,
as a Friend, for her Fidelity, Openneſs, and Obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to her Friend. Thus did this Bleſſed Lady run
a glorious Courſe through all the Vertues of Religion;
and ſtill as ſhe moved ſhe ſhone; inſomuch, that in
deſpight of that modeſt Vail ſhe caſt over her ſelf,
her light did ſo diſplay it ſelf before all that knew
her, that they ſaw enough of her good Works to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to glorify her Father which is in Heaven.
And being now entered upon the laſt Scene of her
Life, and by the increaſe of her Diſeaſe, finding her
ſelf arrived to the Borders of Eternity, ſhe here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified
another ſort of Vertue, to a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<hi>viz.</hi> Patience, Submiſſion, and Reſignation to
the will of God; which as it was her Guide while
ſhe lived, ſo it was her Reſt and Repoſitory when
ſhe died; to which ſhe chearfully ſurrendred up her
White and Heavenly Soul, as into the hands of a
Faithful Creator and Redeemer. Seeing therefore
while ſhe lived, ſhe lived in the Communion of the
Saints and Angels above, and did partake, with
them, of their Bleſſed Temper and Nature, and join
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152987:11"/>
with them in their Bleſſed Exerciſe and Imployments;
and ſeeing likeneſs doth naturally congregate Beings,
and cauſe them to flock to thoſe of their own Feather;
we have all manner of reaſon to conclude, that now
ſhe hath left this World, ſhe is aſſociated with thoſe
Bleſſed Beings above, to whom ſhe was here ſo near
allied by Nature: and that in their Bleſſed Quire,
ſhe is now offering up far more ſprightly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Songs of Praiſe, than ever ſhe was able to breath
while incumber'd with Fleſh, and with the remains
of a ſinful Nature. And, God grant, that we who
remain here behind her, may by following her ſteps,
at laſt arrive where ſhe is, and be Partakers with
her, in the Everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. To whom with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and God the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and
Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>
