            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for that bloudy and deſperate

diſapointed their wicked hopes, and
(to their owne ſhame and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
diſcovered and laid open their

helliſh plot to ſucceeding ages, that
the Lord alone might be admired, and
they confounded. And this he did by
moving in the heart of one of their

of ſo foule and deteſtable a

up, ſo that with much adoe hee crept
out of the kennell, and reeled to the
ſtoop or ſeat of a door, and ſate down
to ſleepe, but the workings of his
thoughts would not ſuffer him to reſt
till hee had diſcovered this devilliſh
deſigne neither did hee (at all) intend
to reſt as himſelfe confeſt, till hee
had made it knowne, but hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to ſleepe, the fellow which
was left with him to watch him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
which this <hi>Owne Mack-Connel</hi>
perceiving, aſſoone as ever his backe
was turned, with a bold reſolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
up, and went to the Merchants
Key in <hi>Dublin,</hi> betweene eleven and
twelve of the clocke at night to Sir
<hi>William Parſons</hi> houſe, one of the
Lords Juſtices of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where
knocking at the doore, the Porter
knowing him, demanded of him what
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65305:16"/>
he would have, he anſwered the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that hee muſt needs ſpeak with his
Lord, the Porter replyed that his
Lord was in Bed, It is no matter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Owen Mack-Connel,</hi> I muſt and
will ſpeak with him, for my buſineſſe
concerns both King &amp; Kingdom, then
the Porter let him in, wondring to ſee
him in ſuch a pickle, ſtill hee haſtned
the Porter, untill hee had called up
one of his Lords Gentlemen, who got
up ſpeedily, and went into his Lords
Bed-chamber, where hee acquainted
his Lord with the earneſt deſire that
this <hi>Owen Mack-Connel</hi> had to ſpeake
with him concerning a buſineſſe of
waighty conſequence, but would not
reveal it to any but his Honour, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was called up and had acceſs
to my Lord, unto whom hee diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the whole Plot, which was to be
executed the ſame morning at nine of
the clock, this being between twelve
and one.</p>
               <p>At the firſt the Lord <hi>Parſons</hi> did
ſeem to ſlight it, but <hi>Owen Mack-Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi>
confidently affirmed the thing to
my Lord in the hearing of his ſervants
to be true, and withall told him thus:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65305:16"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> My Lord, my Lord, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
my duty and my conſcience,
look you to it; I will goe backe to my
Maſter, becauſe neither hee nor the
reſt ſhall ſuſpect me.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip ſhall find my Lord
<hi>Mack-Gueere</hi> at Maſter <hi>Cadowgans</hi>
houſe in Cookſtreet, and Captaine
<hi>Mack-Mahown,</hi> at the Artichoke in the
aforeſaid <hi>Maryes</hi> Abbey, to which
place I am going now. This <hi>Owen
Mack-Connel</hi> going homewards to his
Maſters lodging, takes up dirt in his
hands and beſmuts and dirties his face
that he might appear to them to have
tumbled over and over in the dirt,
whoſe approach and entrance into the
roome (where a great many of them
were aſſembled together, drinking
and making merry, for they intended
not to goe to bed) was ſo ridiculous
that the company burſt out into ſuch
a loud and ſudden laughter with ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and hollowing that the place
rung of them round about, and to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him home the company fell to
their old courſe to make him drinke
more, but at laſt he told them that he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65305:17"/>
muſt needs goe down into the yard, ſo
they ſuffered him to goe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
two of his companions to
attend him and bring him up againe,
but they let him goe into the yard by
himſelfe, not ſuſpecting what he had
done; nor what hee meant to doe: no
ſooner was he in the yard, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the place, leaped over the pale,
and ſo eſcaped from them.</p>
               <p>Great ſearch they made in the
yard for him, and up and downe the
houſe, thinking hee had been crept to
bed, or hid himſelf in the barn of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſo that they were amazed to
think what ſhould become of him,
becauſe they generally believed him
to be ſo drunk and in ſuch a pickle,
they refrained looking any further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, conceiving that hee was paſt
care to tell tales whereſoever he was,
and ſo fell to their mirth and jollitie
again.</p>
               <p>But not long after, in the midſt of
their mirth, came ſome of the Guard
belonging to the Lords Juſtices, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

being the chief in that place at
the Artichoake, and brought them
bound before the Lords, about five of
the clock in the morning, being upon
the Saturday, which was the three
and twentieth day of <hi>October</hi> laſt. At
the ſame time and hour the reſt of the
Guard apprehended the Lord <hi>Mack-Gueere</hi>
in Cookſtreet, in the houſe of
Maſter <hi>Cadowgan</hi> where they found
him under a bed with a caſe of Piſtols
charged and a Skeene by his ſide, but
did not offer to ſhoot.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Mack-Mahowne</hi> upon his

how that morning the Caſtle of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin</hi>

               <p>Firſt, they ſhould have gone into

               <p>Some of thoſe Villains that ſhould

and examined before the Councill,

confeſſed, that upon the Sabbath day

(being the day following) their
intent was to have marked all the
Iriſh houſes with a Croſſe, to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed

               <p>It was concluded by the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices

               <p>As for the Proteſtant Miniſters
whom they ſurprize, their cruelty is
ſuch towards them, as it would make

could ſpeake good <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and ſo eſcaped,

broke in forcibly into the houſe where

made no reſiſtance, in the Kitchin, but
going further into the houſe they found
Maſter <hi>Davenant,</hi> ſitting by a fire with
his Wife and Children two young

them upon ſpits before their faces,

ſuch barbarous cruelty was never
knowne. With great patience they were
compelled (poore ſouls) to behold that
cruelty which they could not help, after
they ſtript his wife, forcing her moſt
uncivilly and unmercifully before his
face, and afterward cut her throat, the
diſtreſſed Gentleman being overpreſſed
with the lamentable ſight of the death
of his wife and children, ſtrived and
ſtrugled in his chaire where hee was
bound, and held, hoping they would
have kild him, chooſing rather to die
any death, then to live any longer. So
when they had made an end of his wife
and children in this barbarous manner,
they untied him and ſtript him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
murthered him, when hee had
confeſt to them where his money was.

heating a paire of Tongues in the fire,

the Proteſtant ſide, which the Lord
himſelfe made to his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that
five ſhould chaſe a hundred.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed God by one man and few

cauſe is baſe, whoſe Religion is but a
meere pretence for their bloudy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,

related.</p>
               <p>A very great Army of about thirty
thouſand Rebels beſieged <hi>Drohedah,</hi>
wherein was that valiant and religious
Commander Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn,</hi> with
a few of the Proteſtant party with him
in compariſon of thoſe multitudes of
Rebels, truſting to their great Army,
boldly demanded the Towne, if they
would yield, no queſtion, but they
ſhould have faire quarter: but Sir <hi>Henry</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:65305:44"/>

how perfidious they were, and the leſſe

Be it knowne to you I am a Souldier

               <p>Nay, rather then I will give up, I will

               <p>Theſe ſtories I relate that all true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Proteſtants may take heart, and
likewiſe take notice that God is vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
his owne glory againſt theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
Atheiſts that began to inſult, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65305:47"/>
to aske (as wee are credibly informed)
what is become of the God of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
and likewiſe what ſpirit and
courage God is able to put into the
hearts of thoſe that fight for him, and
for his cauſe againſt his bloud-thirſty
enemies. And therefore be not diſmaid
you Proteſtants, 'tis a great honour to
fight under the Banner of Chriſt, they
fight under the Banner of Antichriſt, the
Lord is with you while yee are with
him. See the blaſphemies and cruelties
of theſe bloudy men: it is that their
names (as <hi>Amalek</hi>) may be blotted out
from under Heaven, for ſurely the day
of recompence is comming, that God
will make his arrowes drunke in their
bloud, they love bloud, and therefore
God will give them bloud in great
meaſure.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance. I ſhall relate you a
bloudy ſtory of one of thoſe cruell
beaſts. The Proteſtant Troopers about
the beginning of <hi>February</hi> laſt, marched
out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as they uſe to do, to view
the Coaſts, they eſpied a cruell Rebell
hewing and mangling a woman in ſo
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65305:48"/>
horrid a manner that it was not poſſible
to know her, having acted his Devilliſh
part he triumph'd over her dead corps,
and waſhed his hands in her bloud,
whereupon the Troopers apprehended
this barbarous Villaine in the very act
of crueltie, and brought him to <hi>Dublin</hi>
with his hands all bloudy, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to be hang'd immediatly, hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
the Ladder, and would not ſtay
till the Executioner turned him off, but
deſperatly lept off and hanged himſelf.
This was in the beginning of <hi>February</hi>
laſt, and is credibly reported by a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who ſaw him thus hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his hands all bloudy.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable to take notice of the
rice of this bloudy act, it was thus. A
Frier and this Villaine was drinking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in a Village, the Frier hearing
of a poore Engliſh woman, there hee
commanded this Rebell to murther
her which he did, as you have read at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
by a Gentleman of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of
good credit.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe poore deluded wretches
guld with their Jeſuits damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,

man<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er that it was not poſſible ſhee
ſhould be knowne &amp; after the Villaine
waſhed his handes in her bloode was
taken by the Troopers adiuged to be
hanged leaped of the lader &amp; hanged
himſelfe like a Bloodey Tyger.</p>

who aſſure them on their words,
that the <hi>more cruell, the more meritorious.</hi>
An Article no where to be found but in
the Devils Creed.</p>
               <p>Would any man believe that theſe
Villains ſhould take children and toſſe
them with pitchforks like dung into Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one was an eye witneſſe (who
loſt a great eſtate there, and ſince have
received reliefe from the Parliament)
who ſaw a cruell wretch, throw a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
crying with teares one way, and
her Childe with a pitchfork another
way.</p>
               <p>They have cruelly murdered women
great with child, and then left them in
ditches, to the fury of their dogs, who
learned to be cruell from their bloudy
Maſters, for they have eaten the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
out of the bowels of the mother.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Leſgoole</hi> Caſtle in the County of
<hi>Four managh,</hi> they have burned fifty
<hi>Scots,</hi> men, women, and children.</p>
               <p>Sixteen <hi>Scots</hi> more they have barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
hanged at <hi>Cloynes</hi> in the County
of <hi>Monaghan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirty <hi>Scots</hi> they burned in <hi>Tolagh.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:65305:49"/>
It is remarkable that they deale thus
cruelly with thoſe Noble <hi>Scots,</hi> who
have bin renowmed through the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World, for their zeale againſt that
Antichriſtian Rabble, that theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
would wiſh they had but one neck,
that they might cut them off at one
blow, but the Proteſtant Cauſe ſhall
ſtand in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they
and their <hi>Babel</hi> ſhal be caſt into the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe

                  <hi>Rory Mackqueere</hi> at <hi>New towne</hi> in the
County of <hi>Fourmanagh,</hi> above foure
hundred poore Proteſtants fled in the
Church to ſhrowd themſelves under its
roofe, for ſafety from the rage of thoſe
men of bloud, where they might have
been famiſhed, but the mercy of this
mercileſſe Beaſt affords them quarter to
goe away with their clothes to <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and vows he will not hurt them: before
they got out of the Town, his Souldiers
ſtript ſome and killed others like baſe
perfidious wretches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ireſh</hi> Lievtenant pretending they
came for the King perfidiouſly come

quell the Rebels, then breake into their
houſes, and turne their weapons againſt
themſelves, make havock taking their
featherbeds, &amp; throw out their feathers,
and in the tikes put up what precious
things they can find in the houſe, and
carry all away, and ſo turns them out
of doores, the next company takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their clothes, and clothe them with
their rags. The next company thinking
they may have mony in thoſe rags, they
will take them alſo, ſearch their
mouthes, and thoſe parts which mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
will not admit of an expreſſion: if
they can find none, they ſet their Skeins
at their breaſts, that if they can extort
any thing when the poore Proteſtants
are naked. Bluſh! ô Sun, to behold the
inhumane cruelties and beaſtly uſages
of theſe unheard of Cannibals.</p>
               <p>They inſlave the poore proteſtants
under them, making them worke like
