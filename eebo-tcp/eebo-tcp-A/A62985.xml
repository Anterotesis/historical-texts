            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE TORIES.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Could find no fitter Persons to Dedicate this Poem to then your selves, and that for several reasons; First because you account your selves men of Parts, and Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Wit; and indeed (to keep the World in its usual Course) we will yeild you to be so; for in all ages some Fools have had preferment, mad Men have been Iudges, and Knaves have been Honourable: To talk Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; whore, Lye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are your natural accomplishments; but those more solid endowments that beautifie a rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> Learning; and Exercise of right Reason, are of little value to you, who can speak Nonscence by Patent, Slander by Prerogative, and Lye by Commission: Iudg of Wit then as much as you please, since none but Fools and Knaves will be guided by your judgment: For it is well
<pb facs="tcp:99876:3"/>
enough known, that your Wit is as thin as your Skulls, and your Skulls as thin as your Estates; and that thin enough all know. Take a Tory from a Pot of Ale, and he's out of his Element; and when his Catalogue of Oaths in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place-Book are ended, he is as indispos'd and unfit for any kind of Company, as the Asses Mouth was for Food when it had been eating of Thistles. Another reason may be, because it treats chiefly of your Champions, the Pillars of your faction, the supporters of that great Mass of Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish Politicks that keeps alive the <hi>Good Old Tory Cause</hi>; but I think (if you are no better Poets then you are Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians, and no better States-men then Divines) the late joynt endeavours of the Stage and Pulpit, will prove very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to the accomplishment of your designs! a lack a day! what pitty 'tis so much Labour and Divine sweat should be spent for just nothing! that ever the zealous Preacher should screw up his jaws, thump his Pulpit, and Divinely rail at <hi>Forty one,</hi> and it have no other effect, then to serve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a pleasing murmur to loll the drowsie females asleep, whilst all his Congregation of half-drunk Bullies are devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly snoaring in their Pews. But what damned incorrigible wretches are these Whiggs, they are not moved at the least with the numberless Satyrical Epilogues and Prologues, that are roared out on the Stage: Notwithstanding we have Plays stuft as full of Burlesques upon the <hi>Ignoramus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> the <hi>Salamanca Doctor,</hi> &amp;c. as a Courtier is of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senc and Knavery; these head-strong wretches keep on their way, though the Whelps bark their guts out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they call them Rogues, Rebels, and Traytors, they turn a deaf ear to all their clamours, and answer them (as wise men do fools) with silence. But the final Catastrophe of our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions will prove who were the Rebells; when Plots shall be unravell'd, and Court intrigues expos'd to the view of the
<pb facs="tcp:99876:3"/>
world; when the private Machinations of indigent Clocks-combs shall be made manifest, and truth shall once more appear on the Stage; then I doubt those persons, who now go under the Name of Loyallists, will be as obscure as their Knavery is now publick. But all are Traytors now that speak against Arbitrary Government; if they see their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, their rights, their liberties going to be taken from them, they must hold their peace and sit down like contented asses, and bear what burthens the Courtiers and a few small States-men will lay on their Shoulders; and this must be born with Patience, and let the burthen gall our Shoulders nev<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r so much, we are Rebells if we but so much as winch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; if a man hear bad Counsel given (which is the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Government) he must hold his peace, and see those liberties left him free by his Ancestors taken from him and his Posterity; he must contentedly see the Throne enslaved, the Nobility Vassals, and the Commonalty lackey after a company of Arbitrary Debauches, and if he shew his dislike of it, he is a Rebell. But when the fatal Dagger is about to pierce my soveraigns Breast, am I Rebel if I stop the blow? Am I a Traytor if I discover the Designs and Plots of our Enemies against the Government and my Prince? But you shall hear what even Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> himself speaks of Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Government and those that, are the Supporters of it in his <hi>Spanish Fryar.</hi> pag. <hi>61.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Should not a lingring Fevour be remov'd;</l>
                  <l>Because it long hath rag'd within my Blood?</l>
                  <l>Do I Rebel when I would thrust it out?</l>
                  <l>What, shall I think the World was made for one,</l>
                  <l>And men are born for Kings as Beasts for Men;</l>
                  <l>Not for Protection but to be devour'd?</l>
                  <l>Mark those who dote on Arbitrary Power,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:99876:4"/>And you shall find'm either hot brain'd Youth</l>
                  <l>Or needy Bankrupts, servile in their greatness,</l>
                  <l>And Slaves to some, to Lord it o're the rest.</l>
                  <l>O Baseness! to support a Tyrant Throne,</l>
                  <l>And crush your free-born Brethren of the World:</l>
                  <l>Nay, to become a part of Usurpation;</l>
                  <l>To Espouse the Tyrants person and his crimes,</l>
                  <l>And, on a Tyrant, get a race of Tyrants</l>
                  <l>To be your Countries curse in after Ages.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> dares go so far, I hope I (who have always an aversion to wooden Shoos, and to be reckoned in the number of French Camels) may call them Traytors, Rebels, Betrayers of their Country, egregious Knaves, and infamous Scoundrels: But suppose (which Heaven grant may never come to pass) there should be such a thing as Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> we should then see how those Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Leg'd Divels, called Courtiers, would tilt at th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

'Tis only want, that makes a Loyal <hi>Tory,</hi> and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mercinary Scriblers; and pray how long doth their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty last? e'en just as long as their Coat and their Money;

when the one is thred bare and the other spent, and by their Loyalty they are in no hopes of procuring another, then for a little cash they will cut the Throat of the best Lord in the Land, <hi>Whigg or Tory,</hi> 'tis all one; men that are like to be Shipwrackt upon the Rock of Hunger are desperate, but now none are His Majesties Loyal Subjects, but such who are daily drunk with drinking his Health, (though they cheat the Vintner for it) and that never so well done, as when it is set of with the best flowrish in their <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> a fashionable <hi>Dam me.</hi> But now I could heartily wish I had some of Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> his confidence, that I might speak in the praise of my own Poem, as he doth of his, indeed a rotten Post covered with Brass goes through all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but I am no fond fool of my own Issue; I shall e'en speak not one word in its commendation, but let it shift for praise in the World as it's Brethren have done before it. I cannot expect any Tory should speak in its praise, since it treats most of Fools and Knaves and then it is impossible they should read it, but they must read their own Characters. Or how can I expect any fvaour in the world, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Absalom Senior</hi> was so spoken against? but by whom was he spoken against, by whom, why by the nonsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cical <hi>Observator,</hi> and the thrice stupid <hi>Heraclitus</hi>; but I write not to please these Ideots, if I please the best I have my end, and one smile of theirs is able to weigh down all the others frowns.</p>
