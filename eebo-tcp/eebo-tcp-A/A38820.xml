         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PART I.</head>
            <p>THe Ancient and Modern Hiſtories furniſh us ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
with very good Examples, that the greateſt
part of the Monarchies, Kingdoms, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
which have heretofore flouriſhed with
great Glory, and have afterwards for the moſt part
been entirely demoliſhed, fell into that miſerable deſtruction by
two defaults, eſpecially.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by degenerating and totally abandoning their priſtine
virtues, and a ſoft negligence in not applying themſelves to thoſe
means which might have re-eſtabliſhed them in the practice of
the ſame virtues as the principle whence their former puiſſance
was to be derived, and from the practice whereof they might be
in a condition to preſerve it.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, by internal Diviſions, which Ambition, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,
Avarice or Vain glory fomented by the Artifices of their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96566:4"/>
Enemies, have frequently produced amongſt Princes, or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors
of their flouriſhing Eſtates.</p>
            <p>Now then, ſince theſe pernicious courſes have cauſed the ruine
of all the greateſt Puiſſances of the World; I conceive that no
man will be ſo imprudent, as not to be of accord with me in this
point; That it is the wiſdom of thoſe in whoſe hand God hath
truſted the direction of any ſoveraign and lawful power, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
with all their care and might to avoid falling into ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
            <p>And I alſo believe, that every wiſe man will likewiſe agree;
That they more eſpecially have the ſtrongeſt Reaſons to keep
themſelves moſt exactly on their guard, who cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
by many preſſing experiences, that they have on their necks
very many both ſecret and publick, armed, ſubtle, powerful and
active enemies, who are perpetually in motion to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of all favourable conjunctures to procure their ruine, which
they endeavour with very great care, and by all ſorts of means to
procure and foment.</p>
            <p>This foundation being laid; let us briefly examine whether in
the modern conduct of the Proteſtant States in <hi>Europe,</hi> they have
ſtrictly guided themſelves in every thing which may be called
the Intereſt of their Preſervation, according to ſuch Rules as are
ſufficient, not only to contribute to their maintenance in their
Eſtate, but to procure unto them the moſt conſiderable Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
therein; or whether a good part of them have not rather
been viſibly engaged by the Modern Artifices of their natural ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
into ſuch paths as are capable not only to enervate their
principal Forces, but by conſequence to draw them on, like the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
States into an entire deſtruction.</p>
            <p>No man can deny, as it ſeems to me, that God's bleſſing was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
powred out on the labours of thoſe great Perſons,
whom his Providence was pleaſed to make uſe of in the laſt Age
for the advancement of the work of Reformation and extirpating
out of the Chriſtian communion, all the abuſes and Idolatrous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
which the Spirit of darkneſs, by the Miniſtry of the Papacy
had eſtabliſhed throughout the whole extent of the Weſtern
Church. By this ſucceſs it came to paſs that two Parties were
formed; which in what concerns Spirituals and Temporals, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
all this part of <hi>Europe,</hi> which compoſes the ſaid Church.</p>
            <p>Now being the Firſt-Fruits of this Reformation were ſuch as
ſuddenly ſtopped the progreſs of the Papacy, and broke the
greateſt part of the meaſures which the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96566:4"/>
taken up, ſucceſſively ſince the Reign of the Parricide <hi>Phocas,</hi> to
eſtabliſh a deſpotick and univerſal Monarchy over all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as well in Temporals as Spirituals. This Truth being
perfectly well known by the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> it were extreme folly
to doubt of the true Reſentments which thoſe Biſhops have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Proteſtants, and eſpecially againſt the Kingdoms and
States that protect and profeſs this Faith; ſo that it ought to be
the more obſerved, that ſince the providence of God gave this
overthrow to the Papal Tyranny, this Beaſt which hath horns
like thoſe of the Lamb, is in a condition to ſpeak with the power
of the firſt Beaſt; that is to ſay, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Servant of Servants,</hi> which they craftily affect to aſſume, have
ſo well ordered their Conduct, that they have thereby been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
no leſs than the ancient <hi>Caeſars</hi> by ſword and fire, (as <hi>Greg.</hi>
7. <hi>Urb. 2. Paſchall 2. Boniface</hi> the Eighth did) to attempt to make
themſelves to be acknowledged for deſpotick and univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
of Chriſtendome, as well over Temporals as Spirituals.</p>
            <p>And to prove in a few words, and in an uncontrolable manner,
what we have propounded we may conclude for certain, as to
temporal concerns; that ſince the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald,
the Roman Biſhops after many Debates and cruel Wars, which
they cauſed to be raiſed on all hands againſt the Emperors of the
Weſt, have not only been diſpenſed with from being named; or
approved by the Emperors themſelves, as the ancient cuſtom
was; but having by ſucceſſion of time and a thouſand unjuſt
ways, ſo highly advanced themſelves above them, that theſe
Monarchs have been forced afterwards, as Hiſtory aſſures us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth incluſively, not only to acknowledge the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Biſhops for their Superiors; but unleſs they would incur
their Indignation (which uſually was followed with their ruine)
to abaſe themſelves unto that abjectneſs of ſpirit, as to go and kiſs
their feet, in all humble proſtration, or as they mounted to or
lighted from their Horſes; and the moſt part of them durſt not
take upon them to be Emperors, till after their Approbation or
Coronation by their or their Legates hands.</p>
            <p>The chief Monarchs of all Chriſtendom being reduced to this
paſs; is it not true, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hold it for a
Maxim, never to let go their Pretentions, and to make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that falls out for their advantage, a Preſcription, have
really uſurped and effectually enjoyed the Superiority over the
Principal Temporal Dominion of Chriſtendom? And this is ſo
true, that before the holy work of Reformation this petty Prieſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96566:5"/>
hath been ſeen inſolently many times to take the Imperial Crown
from the Father after he had trod one of the moſt Illuſtrious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
as a Baſilisk under his feet, to transfer it to his Son; or if
indeed the Emperor's Children were more careful to obſerve the
Law of God in this point, than that of this man of ſin, and
would not recede from the reſpect and obedience due unto their
Father, then to transfer it to the firſt ambitious perſon, who
could be found of a ſeditious humour, his preſumption being
riſen to that Inſolency, that he made not more difficulty in the
quality of a Supreme Diſpenſer both of the Imperial, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Crowns of Chriſtendom, than to diſpoſe of them of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
order, albeit they were Hereditary for the moſt part, in
favour of whom he pleaſed: of this <hi>Navarre</hi> affords us a living
example, which abides entire unto this day. Paſſing by (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
prolixity) the Subſidies and burdenſome Homages which
have been eſtabliſhed on the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Poland, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
Naples</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> as well as what they have endeavoured
to execute on all the other States of Chriſtendom; this may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
(as ſeems to me) to make all theſe States to ſee the Intereſt
they have unanimouſly to oppoſe the progreſs of the Papacy, ſo
as to prove what I have above propounded, what theſe proud
Biſhops have attempted upon the Temporal Dominion of all
Chriſtendom until the time aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>To prove what progreſs the ſame Biſhops have made in their
Uſurpations upon the Spiritual Power, it is ſufficient to read their
own Decretals, and what they have been able to cauſe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
in the greater part of the laſt Councils, and to know the
Doctrine which all the Sophiſters of the <hi>Vatican</hi> do openly teach
and Preach more or leſs, according to the Places where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and which is univerſally received (ſave in the Eſtates of the
Republick of <hi>Venice</hi>) in all the extent of <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the Monarchy
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and hath taken but too pernicious roots in all other States
where the Magiſtrate is of the Roman Communion.</p>
            <p>And the Proteſtant States flatter themſelves extreamly, if they
be perſwaded; That by the Progreſs which the work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
hath made in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the infeebling which in its
proceſs it hath cauſed in the Papal Power, this Enemy is ſo far
weakned; that he is not to be feared any more: for it is ſo far from
being ſo, that it is the more dangerous, as well for its formidable
Power wherein it ſtill appears, having in ſome degree abated its
Politick Severity, as not judging it neceſſary any longer ſince the
checks that have befallen it by the advancement of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96566:5"/>
or Imprudence of ſome of its Biſhops; ſo alſo for that the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is now more than ever rectified in its refined Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
to be able by imperceptible and ſecret ways to recover its
ſelf to its firſt glorious Luſtre. And being <hi>Rome</hi> cannot attain
thereto but by the total ruine of its natural Enemies, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
(as I have ſhewed above according to my ſuppoſition) in the
Proteſtant Party, it is not to be admired if after this ſhock, they
have ſtirred every Stone to bring about the deſtruction of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that ſo long as there are any Roman Biſhops, <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
it with all its forces, and all its diligence.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, when the Imperial Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
by its great Inheritances, which ſucceſſively fell to it in the
two laſt Ages, by its immenſe Indian Treaſures, by its greatneſs
and dignity of the firſt and moſt conſiderable Monarchy of
Chriſtendom, and by its numerous and formidable Armies to
puſh on the Progreſs of its great and vaſt Deſigns of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Monarchy: The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſubtle and happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to perſwade it that it could not attain thereto, but by
taking on it the quality of its principal Protector, and in being
the cruel Executioner of the eſtabliſhment of its Authority, and
all its freques. <hi>France, Germany, Hungary, Bohemia,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Low-Countries know what Rivers of blood have
flowed from this pretence; and all <hi>Europe</hi> knows the enfeeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which this Illuſtrious Houſe hath brought on it ſelf by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſurpriſed by Maxims ſo little enlivened by the ſpirit of true
Chriſtianity, and of ſo little Diſcretion and Judgment.</p>
            <p>For this ſame Reaſon alſo <hi>Rome</hi> after it had ſerved it ſelf of
the Puiſſance and Forces of this Imperial Houſe ſo far as to have
reduced it to an extenuation and feebleneſs capable to draw on its
total deſtruction, if the providence of God by the generous Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
of its Allies had not prevented; knowing otherwiſe that
this Houſe was not any longer in condition to ſerve and advance
its Projects, but in the quality of a ſuffering Party, and that its
diminution ſeemed to give place to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty
by the formidable power of his Forces, and his numerous Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
to purſue with ſucceſs the career of the Univerſal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.
<hi>Rome</hi> I ſay, which hold for a Maxim from the time of its
firſt progreſs, to ſpend the Forces of the moſt puiſſant for its own
Elevation, hath been alſo crafty and fortunate enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
this Monarch againſt all the Rules of a Judicious Policy,
that he could not attain his great and vaſt Deſigns, but by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
at the ſame time (as the Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> had before
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96566:6"/>
done, the ruine of the States and Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Holland,</hi>
and by taking contrived meaſures without the privity of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> with many of his Subjects, to re-eſtabliſh
the Romiſh Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and alſo to ruine the Proteſtant
Religion in <hi>Germany,</hi> and all his own Dominions.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeak the truth, this laſt enterprize, which by this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
hath been in a great part managed by the Emiſſaries of the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath been ſo ſubtly conducted, that it may be ſaid
nothing hindred his Majeſty the moſt Chriſtian King for many
days, but that by the ſurpriſe of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> after that of <hi>Utrich</hi>
and <hi>Naerden,</hi> he might have made himſelf in leſs than four
Months, abſolute Prince of the principal part of the Seventeen
Provinces of the Low-Countries, and thereby to have become
in one <hi>Campania,</hi> the abſolute Arbiter of all Chriſtendom both at
Sea and Land: And thoſe who more ſpecially underſtand the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Eſtate, which this Monarch hath made on this occaſion,
may know ſomewhat of the true Reaſon of that great Traverſe
of State in particular, which for my part I attribute to a formal
Protection of the King of Kings, who in his Supreme Councils
had doubtleſs ordained otherwiſe, of that affair, and underſtand
that if his Majeſty after he had ſurpriſed <hi>Utrich</hi> and <hi>Naerden,</hi> had
ſent only 500 Horſe to <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> it was probable that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
and Burgeſſes of that Town in the Conſternation into
which the Rapidity of his Conqueſts had put them, would have
delivered up the Keys and Gates thereof purely and ſimply into
the hands of the Conquerour. Yea, I am aſſured from good
hands, the major part had concluded to ſend him them without
ſtaying for Summons, had not a Doctor of Phyſick in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
threatned to call and mutiny the Common People againſt
them, and ſo compelled them to change their Reſolves. Now
they who know the Treaſures and Sea-Forces of this ſingle
Town, may thence deduce ſolid proofs of the conſequences, that
would thereupon have followed.</p>
            <p>By this only blow, and the manner after which the Miniſters
of <hi>France</hi> had begun thereupon to behave themſelves in the States
of the <hi>Palatinate, Cleve,</hi> the <hi>Marquiſatte,</hi> and all the Proteſtant
States in <hi>Europe;</hi> all they who love their Faith and their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may ſee the fatal point, whereby they were about to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of both; for the moſt part, and all this, by the Miniſtry
of the Emiſſaries of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by their own neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
too much the ſolid means of their Conſervation.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96566:6"/>
Awake thou who ſlumberest, that thou be not ſurprized with Sleep, which
will draw on thee Ruine and Deſolation.</q>
            <p>Making a ſerious reflection on the active conduct of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
party, for the extenſion and maintenance of their Faith, and
the ſoft effeminateneſs and indifferency wherewith the Proteſtant
party are accuſtomed to act in the propagation and ſupport of
theirs; I think I may ſay, that the former may be juſtly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to an Army not only numerous, but very well diſciplined,
provided of very good Leaders of excellent counſel, who march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Field make their Scouts to advance carefully on their
right and left, to make all ſorts of Diſcoveries, who when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
retrench themſelves always very well, who cauſe every
night their Rounds and Guards to be made very regularly, and
who as perſons accompliſhed in worldly wiſdom know ſubtly to
foment in their Enemies Camp perpetual Diviſions amongſt their
Chieftains, and cauſe an infinite number of crafty, ſubtle and
faithful Spies to ſlide in amongſt them, who render a moſt exact
account of all their motions and condition.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, I think that the Proteſtant party, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to an Army very numerous indeed, and provided of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Commanders, who want neither Experience nor Courage,
but who are by ſome unhappy Jealouſies, fomented for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part by the Artifices of the contrary party, divided amongſt
themſelves, and ſo reduced to that miſery, that this Army which
is capable by the Excellency of its Captains, and nature of its
Forces to fall upon what part it could deſire, of the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
having abandoned all uſe of Retrenchment, and of <hi>Corps de
Guard</hi> to ſecure its ſafety, and alſo neglected all the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it might be informed of the motions of the Enemies Camp; ſo
great diſorder is thereupon enſued, that the Army of the Enemy
doth often, to their ſhame, beat up their Quarters, and make them
actually fall into confuſions, unworthy the honour and courage of
the Heroick Commanders, which the providence of God hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
in the Head of their Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, comes to destruction,</hi> ſaith the
Saviour of our Souls: In truth this is a Leſſon of which all the
Proteſtant States ought very carefully to make their advantage,
and on the account of their Glory, their Faith, and their Intereſt
think a little more ſeriouſly then hitherto they have done, for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96566:7"/>
laſt half Age, of the means to procure their Union as the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
point of their preſervation.</p>
            <p>The providence of God, which is miraculous in all the cares
it taketh for the conſervation of his Children, hath eſtabliſhed a
natural oppoſition betwixt the two principal Puiſſances of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,
which ſame are the two principal Balwark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> ſpirit knows to
ſuggeſt never failing means to this Roman Court to make this
Diviſion (which were capable to bring about us entire ruine, if the
Proteſtant States knew how to uſe their advantages) turn to its
profit; ſo that whatſoever oppoſition or diſunion hath hitherto
happened, betwixt theſe two States, <hi>Rome</hi> knows the ſecret there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
effectually to make an advantage as it deſigns.</p>
            <p>For in the firſt place is it not by the effect of this oppoſition,
that <hi>Rome,</hi> as the great <hi>Rohan</hi> obſerves, doth preſerve its tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Authority entire in a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which would be in a

his Concurrent, had free Elbow-Room in that pleaſant part of
<hi>Europe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, during the ſitting of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being the chief mouth of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo
qualified became the head of that party of the Fathers, who in
this Council inſiſted on a real and actual Reformation to be made
in the Church; <hi>Rome</hi> was too clear ſighted not to perceive that
this ſingle Propoſition carries in it the means to undermine at one
blow all the Foundations of its Monarchick Deſigns, as manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did appear in that troubleſome conjuncture; for at that time
more than half Chriſtendom had ſhoke off the yoke of its tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and had openly embraced the Reformation with little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the leſs or more, and the other half extremely diſpoſed
to receive it; nevertheleſs in this extremity, <hi>Rome</hi> know to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
her Intereſt with ſo great dexterity by means of the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
which raged betwixt theſe two Houſes, that having promiſed
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second, the Deſtruction or Conqueſt of <hi>France,</hi> and to
the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to make the Crown of <hi>France</hi> fall into
their Houſe, the League which ſhould have deſtroyed <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſigned thereupon, by this diabolical expedient, <hi>Rome</hi> made
not only all the Pretenſions of the Council illuſory, which it
diſpoſed of afterwards how it pleaſed; but by the oppoſition
it raiſed by <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, and the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96566:7"/>
the Third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth; <hi>Rome</hi> brought the buſineſs ſo about
that it was impoſſible for the later to Reign in <hi>France</hi> without embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
its Communion, and by that means <hi>Rome</hi> continues there tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
unto this day, and the Proteſtants have been and are ſtill moſt
ſeverely dealt with.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is not an effect of the Jealouſie that reigns betwixt
theſe two Houſes, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath had opportunity to inſpire them
ſo ſtrongly to contend mutually in making out whether of them
were more zealous of the Worſhip of the Roman Faith; ſo that
contrary to all the moſt eſſential Rights of their States and Crowns,
the former to preſerve himſelf in the quality of the Catholick King,
hath ſuffered the new Emiſſaries of the Papacy in leſs than one Age
to invade many very good Inheritances; ſo that the Church at this
day enjoys near a third part of the Temporal Eſtate through the
whole extent of that Monarchy, and the other to maintain the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the moſt Chriſtian King, though he hath ſeen two of his moſt
Illuſtrious Predeceſſors aſſiſſinated by their Parricides or Miniſters in
a very ſhort time, and the Laws of his Kingdom are repugnant to
ſuch Eſtabliſhments; yet nevertheleſs hath and doth ſtill every day
tollerate the ſame, ſo far that the Cities of <hi>France</hi> may be ſeen as well
provided of Fortreſſes and Colonies of the Papacy under the names
of Covents, Religious Houſes, Colleges and Abbeys, as thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi>
and <hi>Italy,</hi> which may be called the Triumph of the Papal Policy, it
being infallibly certain that in proceſs of time, if God redreſs it not,
The Succeſſors of theſe Monarchies muſt by all the Rules of a Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Policy, together with their Subjects, become the Miſerable Slaves
of the Deſpotick Monarchy of the Papacy?</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, <hi>Spain</hi> being no longer in a condition to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
the Emiſſaries of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> with a real Eſtabliſhment in
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> nor in the remaining extent of the whole United Provinces,
nor durſt any more enterprize any thing openly againſt <hi>England,</hi> nor
the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> hath not <hi>Rome</hi> now ſerved it ſelf of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
which reigneth betwixt theſe Houſes, ſacrificing impudently
that of <hi>Auſtria</hi> at this blow, to the violation of all ſorts of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to make his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to attempt in our dayes in
this particular, what all the Forces of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> could not
do heretofore, and well it was that God was pleaſed to blow upon
all theſe Deſigns; for otherwiſe the States of the United Provinces
had not been the only miſerable, but all European Chriſtians muſt
have changed Face as to the Liberty of their Faith and Eſtates in a
very little ſpace of time?</p>
            <p>In the fifth place, as <hi>Rome</hi> hath the Art to ſubtilize all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
that it can draw from all Conjunctures, and as it embraceth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96566:8"/>
more readily in all its Projects, than any Deſign to deſtroy the
Proteſtant Party, from their Heads, to the meaneſt member of them,
that the poor Proteſtants of High <hi>Hungary</hi> might not eſcape this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Perſecution; was it not an effect of the oppoſition which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
betwixt thoſe Houſes, that <hi>Rome,</hi> being about to draw a cruel ſtorm
over the Proteſtants, the Emiſſaries of the Papacy had the craft to
make his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to underſtand, that there being none
but his Imperial Majeſty, who could vigorouſly traverſe his Deſigns
on <hi>Holland;</hi> it was his Intereſt to give him Buſineſs in his own
State, and that this could not be done by any probability other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
than by ſomenting the Revolt on the Coaſt of High <hi>Hungary,</hi>
therefore he muſt of neceſsity purchaſe the Heads of the Proteſtants
in that Country to his part? Now at the ſame time that theſe Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
cauſed this Doctrine to be ſolicited in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and
by their ſolicitation obtained Money and Treaties in <hi>France,</hi> and
inſinuated themſelves into High <hi>Hungary;</hi> the Brethren of the ſame
Emiſſaries, who are as puiſſant in the Imperial Court, as the former
in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> by Intelligence and Conſpiracy with the
former, had the dexterity without notice it may be preciſely given
thereof at firſt to his Imperial Majeſty, to cauſe it to be determined
at the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> that cruel Perſecutions ſhould be raiſed againſt
thoſe miſerable People; we muſt not wonder then, that thoſe poor
People, Members of our Faith, perſecuted on one hand, and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the other, are fallen into the trap ſet for them by the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> with ſo great dexterity, and that thereupon we have ſeen the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Body in that Country in this laſt conjuncture, agitated with
ſuch furious Convulſions.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place, the Tripple League of <hi>England, Sweden,</hi> and the
United Provinces, having made Peace between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in
the Year 1668. becauſe by the continuance of this League the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Party might have made themſelves really the Figure in the
Number of the true Arbiters of the worldly Powers, is it not by an
effect of the ſame oppoſition, that <hi>Rome</hi> in this laſt Conjuncture, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
uſe of the Ambitions, Forces, and management of the Miniſters
of <hi>France,</hi> knew by its charms caſt upon <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
this <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot of Peace, and force out of the hands of the
Proteſtant Party the advantage to them ſo glorious, and which might
have been ſo profitable to the Repoſe and Tranquillity of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom?</p>
            <p>And that Poſterity may not be ignorant of the Succeſs of theſe
Managements in this Point, was it not in the ſeventh place by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
conſequences of the aforeſaid Breach, that for a <hi>Praeludium</hi> to
all the Advantages which this Mother of Tares might hope from this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96566:8"/>
diſſolution which we have ſeen; ſhe knew to arm <hi>England</hi> againſt the
Republick of the United Provinces with ſo much cruel obſtinacy, that
at the ſame time, when this laſt was hurried by the Land-flood of one
of her Miniſters paſſionate or corrupted, and was to ſuſtain on the
Continent all the Forces of <hi>France,</hi> and its Allies, after an unhappy
Invaſion upon 46 or 47 Places, the former joyns all its Sea-Forces
with thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> and gave fiercely in one Expedition three cruel
Battles to this later, capable to have wrought its total Deſtruction, if
in this conjuncture God had openly declared himſelf for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection?</p>
            <p>For the eighth conſideration, is it not from the natural conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the ſaid management, that we now ſee ſince the laſt <hi>Campania,</hi>
the three Puiſſent Proteſtants of the North have entred into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglement
of a War, which cannot but prove fatal to one of thoſe
three Potentates; and ſo to the general Proteſtant Body, which we
may ſay is to know very well by a dexterity worthy of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
to make their Enemies deſtroy one another, a Policy which a
thouſand Experiments one following the other have taught us very
vell to know, that <hi>Rome</hi> doth poſſeſs in greateſt excellency, and
whereuuto without doubt ſhe ows her Elevation?</p>
            <p>But if the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> from ſuch an oppoſition as ought in all
Appearance, to be fatal unto it (if the Proteſtant Party knew to make
uſe of it) hath notwithſtanding the dexterity to draw from thence
ſuch real Advantages for the advancement and maintenance of its
greatneſs, and is by the ſame means arrived at a Power to draw to its
ſelf ſuch conſiderable ones, as it hath already or would have attained
had the Invaſion of the United Provinces ſucceeded; then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
themſelves ought not to doubt (if for their ſins God ſhould
ever permit the effective Union of theſe two Puiſſances, whether by
ſome Treaty advantagious to both, as the diviſion of ſome Proteſtant
Eſtates may be, or naturally by right or Succeſſion which may happen
in the greateſt part) that in ſuch caſe <hi>Rome</hi> will know to take its
Advantage and infallible Meaſures, if God hinder not to deſtroy at
once the Proteſtant Party in <hi>Europe:</hi> And from thus much I think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man who is but a little clear ſighted, and makes reflection ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
on the Conduct of the Papal Court, muſt needs be put out of
doubt concerning this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> beſides hath found out an infallible means by the diſpoſal of
its Purple without being at a penny charge, to acquire the ſuffrage and
protection of the greater part of all the Miniſters of State to the moſt
Crowned Heads of their Communion; for as they are commonly
men of mean Birth, ſo, If they were of the moſt Illuſtrious, a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's
Cap by the corruption of blindneſs of theſe laſt Ages, is ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96566:9"/>
great a glory to a Family, that there are very few who to procure
this vanity to their Houſe in cauſing it to be conferred on a Son, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or Nephew, would not ſubmit and render themſelves ſlaves to
this Court as much as the moſt paſſionate of all their Monks, and as
thoſe Miniſters are for the moſt part perſons corrupted with the Affairs
of the World, and who know perfectly the weakneſſes of their Princes;
it is no wonder if they know and will take exactly the favourable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to perſwade them what they pleaſe, ſo that <hi>Rome</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
all the ſatisfaction it deſires by the Counterpoiſe of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of theſe Intereſts to caſt all the Princes of its Communion
when it pleaſes; and it is by theſe Maxims which cannot riſe but
from the bottomleſs pit, that we ſee the Proteſtants ſo cruelly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
in many places of Chriſtendom, as in <hi>France, Hungary</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy;</hi>
and hence it was that our Grandfathers ſaw or ſuffered in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
day of Saint <hi>Bartholomew</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> with the Maſſacre; that
have been made in <hi>Bohemia, Hungary,</hi> and the Low Countries, <hi>Ireland</hi>
the Valley of <hi>Piedmond,</hi> the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> without ſetting in the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of this reckoning what the Ancient <hi>Huſſites, Vandois</hi> and <hi>Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gois</hi>
have ſuffered in their times on the ſame accompt in divers Places
in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it will infallibly come to paſs, that unleſs the Proteſtant States,
with regard of what I give them to know, do reſtifie their conduct
at the moment they leaſt ſuſpect, and when they have conſumed
their principal Forces by their Wars and Diviſions amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or perhaps by maintaining the Intereſts of ſome power of the
Roman Communion, and when they confide in the Faith of ſome
Treaties; this Roman Dame (by her Managers reuniting all the
Forces of her Communion) will feed them with a diſh of her cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to their total deſtruction, which is the principal Butt of all her
Applications and all her Labours, the Sallies and Retreats of all her
Guards, which ſhe ſends out into all Parts, in the mean time all this
while till a blow come, the whole Proteſtant Camp ſleep all in perfect
reſt, or at moſt, they are but half awake, or perhaps buſie themſelves
to cooperate by the deſtruction of its own Members unto its own
ruine, as they of the Republick of the United Provinces in the
conjuncture of the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> in the laſt place
againſt that Republick, have furniſhed us with two capital and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
Examples.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> on the foreſaid occaſions have provided
us of unhappy proofs of what I above propounded, what hath the
<hi>Swede</hi> done in an almoſt equal caſe? for what had the <hi>Swede</hi> more to
deſire than to preſerve peaceably the glorious Conqueſts which the
Great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> had made in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Chartos Guſtavus</hi> had made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96566:9"/>
in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> but to ſee himſelf at the ſame time, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation
with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to be one of the Principal, who
was in a condition to regulate the Bounds and Frontiers of all the
Powers of Chriſtendom. All which advantages this Crown had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
preſerved to it ſelf, if acting as a true Member of the Empire,
it had put it ſelf in a poſture, as their Electoral Highneſſes of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,
Saxony,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> to oppoſe it ſelf with the Head
and other Members againſt the Enemy, who did invade it with all his
force; it being certain, that by one advance of this nature, the <hi>Swede</hi>
had infallibly brought about three things which had been very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and glorious for him.</p>
            <p>1. He had taken away all lawful pretence from the Emperor and
Empire, whereon they could aſſail his Eſtate in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He had raiſed no occaſion to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to put him
in condition to recover his Eſtates, which the <hi>Swede</hi> had poſſeſſed in
the Reign of his late Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> his Father.</p>
            <p>3. If <hi>France</hi> had not flattered himſelf into a perſwaſion, or rather
had not been aſſured by his managery and tampering with ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Miniſters of that Crown, that the <hi>Swede</hi> was engaged in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
he durſt never have attempted what he enterprized upon the
Empire; and thereby this War, whereof God knows when we ſhall
ſee an end, had probably been immediately concluded after his Irru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
into <hi>Holland</hi> was defeated; which would have given an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
means to the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to reaſſume their true Intereſt,
to renew much more ſtrongly than ever the Tripple League, and ſo
to become again the Pillars of Peace in <hi>Europe,</hi> from which the one
and the other are very far removed, if God provide not a remedy;
the <hi>Swede</hi> for his part ſeeing himſelf in this unhappy condition about
to looſe, it may be, in a very little time, (by ſuffering himſelf to be
ſeized by the Current of <hi>France,</hi> and carried away to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Papal Emiſſaries) all the Conqueſts which the great
<hi>Guſtavus</hi> had gloriouſly made, for having oppoſed with all its Forces
the Eſtabliſhment of its Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Let it not diſpleaſe the Swediſh Miniſters of State, that were of
the opinion to declare themſelves againſt the Empire, to underſtand
that there was a very great difference of the time of great <hi>Guſtavus</hi>
from this. That Heroick Monarch leagued himſelf with <hi>France</hi> for
the advancement of his Progreſs in <hi>Germany,</hi> becauſe he entered into
it in the quality of a Reſtorer of the Proteſtant and German Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and when <hi>France</hi> at the ſame time declared for ſuſtaining the ſame
Liberty.</p>
            <p>But in this juncture the <hi>Swede</hi> himſelf was an Eſſential Member of
the Empire; and whereas <hi>France</hi> formerly imployed his Arms to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96566:10"/>
that Liberty he in this juncture imploys them to oppreſs the
ſame. It is hence evident, that the <hi>Swede</hi> joyning himſelf unto his
own true Intereſt, ought in common, with the reſt of the Empire,
Head and Members, to have oppoſed all his Forces againſt this Puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance;
and ſo much the more, becauſe he might ſee by what <hi>France</hi>
had endeavoured to execute againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> and their Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of the Palatinate of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> what he was
himſelf to expect of <hi>France,</hi> if they had proſpered in their firſt Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and in all his vaſt Deſignes againſt the Empire.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Swede,</hi> to ſecure all in caſe that <hi>France,</hi> by the ſequel of
the War, had loſt its Eſtabliſhments in <hi>Alſatia</hi> (which is the point that
ſeemed to have produced this Declaration againſt his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Brandenburg</hi>) had deſired any preſident and particular Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of his Imperial Majeſty and his Allies, it is very probable that
in the beginning of the War, when all ſorts of Events were dubious,
his Imperial Majeſty and his Allies, would have given that Crown all
the ſatisfactions and ſecurities which it could reaſonably deſire in that
point: and that which may juſtifie this againſt all Objections, is, that
it was very remarkable and manifeſt, that his Electoral Highneſs and
his Allies, did not, till the very laſt Extremity, take thoſe ſtrong Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of oppoſing his Enterpriſe: So that it is certain, that if the
<hi>Swede,</hi> by his Invaſion of the Eſtates of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> had not drawn on
him the Storm which at preſent overwhelms him, he had till now, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all appearances, been in the peaceable poſſeſſion of all his
Eſtates and Eſtabliſhments through the whole Extent of the Empire.</p>
            <p>But whatever have been the Counter-marches of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Sweden,</hi> on the ſaid occaſions, it being impoſſible to hinder
what is already done, I believe it becomes the generoſity and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Proteſtant Princes, to ſtrip themſelves from all prejudices
which might divide them, and apply themſelves ſeriouſly to all the
means that may unite them, as the fundamental point of their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and which may render vain all the deceits their common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
can project or take in hand for their deſtruction: and ſo much
the more, becauſe they ought formally to conclude it for a poſitive
Truth, that the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which by the principle of its Intereſt,
neglects nothing that may procure their deſtruction, directs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
in certain Caſes, the State-Councils of the Monarchies of
its Communion, though otherwiſe cruelly divided by their particular
Intereſts, or will find an infallible ſecret to delude their deliberations,
when they find them contrary to their Intereſts and Intentions.</p>
            <p>And to prove this truth in an uncontroulable manner, I will make
it good, without departing from this Age, by four poſitive and cogent
Examples upon this Subject.</p>

               <label>Example 1.</label> 
               <hi>France</hi> neglects nothing in the conjuncture of the laſt Troubles of
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> to perſwade his Electoral Highneſs the Elector Palatine of
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to attempt the Conqueſt of that Realm, ingaging himſelf
for that purpoſe, to furniſh him with all ſorts of real Aſſiſtances
and Succours, which in that Conjuncture, by all ſorts of Circmſtances,
appeared to be the true Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> without all contradiction;
notwithſtanding, when the Prince was ingaged in the Affair, becauſe
the matter of Religion was concerned therein, <hi>Rome</hi> knew ſo well to
manage the Councils of <hi>France,</hi> by the means of Spaniſh Piſtols, that
<hi>France</hi> did not only fail of all thoſe points in this matter, but by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
treachery, (the <hi>Palatine</hi> Houſe being oppreſſed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
through the evil Suits of that War) made a private League
with the Houſe of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> of the Roman Communion, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the ſtate of the former, and in conſequence thereof, <hi>France</hi> was
the capital and principle cauſe, which hindred that his Serene High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the Elector Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> hath not been fully re-eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in all the Eſtates and Dignities of his Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Example 2.</label> A fatal experience, as I have elſe-where obſerved, hath been but
too apparent in the moſt Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which in the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of <hi>Rochel,</hi> hath felt that fatal point which hath broken all its
Forces, when in its greateſt ſtate of glory, and reduced it to ſuch an
abaſement, as was capable to have drawn on it a total deſtruction, if
two thirds of <hi>Europe</hi> had not generouſly confederated with all their
Forces, in this laſt conjuncture to ſuſtain it. The great <hi>Spinola</hi> who
paſt by <hi>Rochel</hi> in the time of the Siege, fore-ſeeing the Surrender of this
place, [by the means he fooliſhly ſuggeſted of ſhutting them out
from the Sea] if it were not readily relieved, and therewith the loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that thereupon would follow to the prejudice of this Houſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
like a man of worth, at the Council-Table at <hi>Madrid,</hi> preſſed
it with all his Judgment and Experience, to cauſe that place to be
relieved; his Reaſons were ſtrong, and the greater part of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Council were convinced; nevertheleſs, becauſe the Affairs
of Religion were concerned, or rather a point of the Roman Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery
and Bigottery, one ſingle word of the Pope's <hi>Nuntio</hi> overbore
all, and cauſed <hi>Rochel</hi> to be abandoned on that accompt, and with it
the moſt eſſential Intereſts of this Imperial Houſe, were ſacrificed at
the only appearance of a Papal Emiſſary.</p>

ſo much the more, for that the latter in a few Months did ſuch
things in the Valley of <hi>Valtolline,</hi> as ſurpaſſed all imagination, and
have immortalized his memory. But becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> by a principle
of its Intereſt made it ſelf a party to the Event of this War, as gave
in this conjuncture moſt real proofs of its Authority in theſe Courts;
<hi>France</hi> made its Treaty ſo with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> without concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Griſons</hi> therein, for excluding the exerciſe of the Reformed
Religion from the Valleys of <hi>Borneo,</hi> the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and County of

by the French, through timerouſneſs, corruption, or otherwiſe,
to make a ſecond Treaty with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> with very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome
Clauſes, as to the concern of theſe Exerciſes, whereof I
ſhall ſpeak hereafter in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Example 4.</label> In the Year 1672, when the Arms of <hi>France</hi> were in ſo high a
point of proſperity, that all <hi>Europe</hi> looked on the Republick of the
United Provinces as an Eſtate almoſt undone; his moſt Serene Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral
Highneſs, the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who judged profoundly
of all conſequences which were to be expected from the ambitious
Enterprizes of <hi>France,</hi> if no oppoſition were made to the Current of
theſe proſperities, acquired to himſelf both the glory of being the
firſt Prince of Chriſtendome who generouſly drew his Sword for the
protection of this diſtreſſed State, and did alſo by his moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Repreſentations at the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> cauſe his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
(riſing out of his unhappy Lethargy, whereinto ſome corrupted
Counſellors had plunged him) to reſolve to arm vigorouſly, and
League with his ſaid Electoral Highneſs, for the maintainance and
protection of this Republick. In conſequence of this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his Electoral Highneſs being advanced to the Bank of the
<hi>Rhine</hi> with a conſiderable Army, the Count <hi>Montecuculi</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
an Imperial Army, marched therewith to that end, and
were in proſpect of doing together ſome conſiderable thing in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of that Common-wealth. <hi>France</hi> allarmed with the march of theſe
two German Armies, ſent away Marſhal <hi>Turenne</hi> with a Body of an
Army, who might obſerve the motions of theſe two; but by the divers
Marches and Counter-marches which theſe two Armies made, and
ſpecially that of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> ſometimes making as if he would paſs
the <hi>Rhine</hi> in many places, and ſometimes as if he would fall on the
Allies of <hi>France</hi> on the other ſide the <hi>Rhine;</hi> the Army of <hi>Turenne</hi>
was ſo beaten out, that in the end of the <hi>Campania</hi> it was in a manner
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96566:11"/>
wholly diſſipated, and was indeed in ſo pitious an Eſtate, that it is
certain, that all what <hi>Turenne</hi> could have done in that conjuncture, was
onely to bring himſelf into a condition to defend himſelf againſt one
of theſe Armies; but if their conjunction had really followed upon
a publick confidence and appointment, <hi>Turenne</hi>'s deſtruction had been
notoriouſly inevitable: and his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
who knew how eaſie it was to deſtroy <hi>Turenne,</hi> and the conſequences
which might enſue, made all theſe things to be vigorouſly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the Court and Council of <hi>Vienna;</hi> this Repreſentation took
effect, and thereupon poſitive Orders were expedited and ſent to
<hi>Montecuculli</hi> to joyn with his Electoral Highneſs, and in conjunction
without delay to fight <hi>Turenne;</hi> which by that ſingle ſucceſs would
have diſſolved all the ſecret and manifeſt contrivances of <hi>France,</hi> and
by this blow alone have withdrawn the whole Empire and <hi>Holland</hi>
from oppreſſion. But for the intereſt of the Roman Court the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was carried quite otherwiſe; His Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himſelf to be perſwaded in this Juncture to conſent, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Declaration which he reported himſelf to his Parliament, to give
liberty of the Exerciſe of Religion in favour of the <hi>Non</hi>-conformiſts
of his Realms; which was not done ſo much, as we may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
to favour the Conventicles of ſome particular Puritans or Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
as under this name to indulge ſomewhat with the Roman
Catholicks. Now as this Counter-march of <hi>England</hi> was one of the
Firſt-fruits which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had promiſed it ſelf from the
ruine and deſtruction of the United Provinces, we muſt not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,
if that Court have, and then did actually move every ſtone to
make this deſtruction ſolidly real: but as that which capitally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this deſign, conſiſted in the ſucceſs of his Electoral Highneſs of
<hi>Brandenburg</hi>'s Succeſs in his undertakings againſt <hi>Turenne,</hi> (the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of that Army being ſufficient to re-eſtabliſh the Republick of
the United Provinces, and its re-eſtabliſhment to overturn all the
Progreſſes of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>England</hi>) it was here that the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite
took up his Reſt to break off that blow, in which he ſucceeded
too well, againſt the Univerſal Intereſt of all <hi>Europe;</hi> for <hi>Montecuculi,</hi>
inſtead of receiving an Order to joyn with the Army of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
and to fight <hi>Turenne,</hi> received one quite contrary, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
forbad him both the one and the other; and as nothing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to the Impudence of theſe venerable Fathers for puſhing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
this affair to their end, their firſt endeavours were by different
attempts to make his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> to ſuſpect
the ſincere Intentions of his Imperial Majeſty; which was ſo much
the more eaſie for them to do, becauſe his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
had received formal Letters from the Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96566:12"/>
related unto him preciſely the very Order which his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
had ſent to <hi>Montecuculi</hi> to joyn and fight; and his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
having thereupon ſummoned <hi>Montecuculi</hi> to execute the Order,
<hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who knew he had received an Order quite contrary, and
had no knowledge of the former, could do no leſs than refuſe both
the one and the other of his Electoral Highneſs's Propoſition; nor
could his Electoral Highneſs otherwiſe than doubt of his Imperial
Majeſtie's ſincere Intentions upon this refuſal: and at the ſame time
that they practiſed to inject theſe Suſpitions into the mind of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral
Highneſs, the ſame Emiſſaries neglected nothing that might
bring <hi>Montecuculi</hi> to ſuſpect the ſincere Intentions of his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
which Suſpitions were but too much impreſſed upon him for his
part: ſo that it was not to be wondred at, if his Electoral Highneſs
did at laſt ſuffer himſelf to be perſwaded, as theſe Emiſſaries had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated
by a third hand, that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> did privately car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on a particular Treaty with that of <hi>France;</hi> which ſeemed ſo much
the more likely, becauſe his Electoral Highneſs ſaw daily the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition of <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Army to increaſe, and yet <hi>Montecuculi</hi> to
continue in his obſtinate refuſal to fight it. But as all this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but miſ-underſtanding, ſo yet notwithſtanding theſe Emiſſaries
had the means to imploy his Serene Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi>
to buſie himſelf mightily to manage a particular Peace for his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Highneſs with <hi>France;</hi> which this Prince in ſuſpition and deſpight
of the Imperial Conduct, ſuffered himſelf to be drawn to accept, with
ſo much the more reaſon, becauſe on the part of <hi>Holland,</hi> it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
they had not performed all they were ingaged to; and as for
the Empires Intereſt, he ſhould preſerve his entire Liberty if <hi>France</hi>
ſhould attack it. Now by the whole ſincere Warp of this Hiſtory
here related, we may ſee how raſh a thing it is to judge of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a great Prince; it being certain, that in this Juncture, all <hi>Europe</hi>
found themſelves extremely divided about what they were to judge
of the proceedings of his Electoral Highneſs. But as this Prince for
his own Honour would have his Imperial Majeſty well to know, that
he had a juſt reſentment of the proceedings of <hi>Montecuculi;</hi> ſo this
General was greatly ſurpriz'd at his return to <hi>Vienna,</hi> that his Maſter
demanded ſo rigorous an account of his Conduct, and the Reaſons
why he had not joyned the Army of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and fought <hi>Turenne,</hi>
after he ſent him preciſely an expreſs Order: but if <hi>Montecuculi</hi> was
ſurpriſed with this demand, his Imperial Majeſty was no leſs, to ſee
what his wiſe General replied for his entire diſcharge, a preciſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his Majeſty in very good form, which forbad him all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and fighting with <hi>Turenne;</hi> and for certain,
this General had then need of all the Juſtice of his Cauſe, and of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96566:12"/>
the knowledge his Maſter had of his fidelity, to extricate himſelf
from this troubleſome Affair.</p>
            <p>I know very well that this Intrigue was one of thoſe Engines
which we never could have well penetrated, had not the Author
thereof voluntarily given us the Key. I know that it is from this
foundation that one of the moſt unhappy of this Court hath been
formally accuſed to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Principal of this Cheat; but to ſpeak
truth, he was not culpable at all in this Affair, but to thoſe Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Court, in combination with thoſe
of <hi>France</hi> upon the aforeſaid principles; the chief of whom found
means to intercept the ſaid Original Order, ſo as to tranſmit by the
ſame diſpatch, a falſe Order, but very well counterfeit both in the Sign
and Seal, and that by thoſe people who have not begun now firſt of
all to contrive ſuch ſurprizes; it being certain that High <hi>Hungary</hi>
had not been ſo often in flames, had it not been that theſe Emiſtaries
had held ſo great credit and relation in the ſaid Court.</p>
            <p>His Imperial Majeſty, his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and
the Count <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> know if I ſpeak true, in every particular which
hath come to their notice, in this Affair. I know that ſcarce one of
theſe three, or perhaps none of them, yet know well the Original,
nor the Principles of theſe ſecret Engines which have been ſet at
work in this Conjuncture; and what I know thereof is not from them,
but from a place where no particular of this whole Negotiation is
unknown, nor of the Principles that animated it; it being moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that if the Catholick Account had not been found in <hi>England,
France</hi> could not have brought about this Cheat ſo eaſily; but upon
the feaſibleneſs of this laſt Principle, the venerable Society having
voluntarily taken on them to act all the principal Seenes of this
Tragi-Comedy, they applied themſelves with ſo much greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
thereunto, becauſe, beſides that they expected thence to proſper
in their Capital Deſign, they hoped alſo by that ſucceſs to find ſome
means to blemiſh in ſome ſort the Reputation and Glory of a Prince,
who in the latter part of this Age hath been the principal mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the four rehearſed Examples, to which I could joyn many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
ones, (if ſome Reſpects hindred not) the Proteſtant Princes
of <hi>Europe</hi> may ſee what the Emiſſaries of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> can do
in the Courts of their Communion, whenever the Intereſt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
matters are concerned: And ſince theſe Emiſſaries have been,
and are, as Hiſtory convinces us, in full poſſeſſion of the power of
promoting the greateſt part of the Wars which for many Ages paſt
have from time to time moleſted Chriſtendom; and that all theſe
Wars, as well as the preſent, have been kindled by them only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96566:13"/>
to ſome particulars conducing to dilate the Papal Dominion,
and to work the deſtruction of the Powers and People who are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
oppoſite to ſuch Projects and Deſignes, I leave it to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to judge if their ſafety can be ſolidly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in their Leagues and Confederations with the Princes of the
Roman Communion, as it may be undoubtably effected by their
Leagues and Conſederations amongſt themſelves, if the matter be
practicable: and all theſe are ſo many Arguments to prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
they have to reconcile, without delay and loſs of time, all the
different Intereſts which divide them.</p>
            <p>I know, by the Engagements that have been made ſince the laſt
year againſt the <hi>Swede</hi> it will be very difficult to reconcile this Affair;
ſo much the more, becauſe it is without doubt the Intereſt of the
Empire to expulſe out of all the extent of its Territories all forreign
Powers, amongſt whom the <hi>Swede</hi> is unhappily comprized under
his prejudice, with ſo much the more Juſtice, in that by his unhappy
Conduct he hath imprudently drawn the ſtorm on his own head; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
I dare ſay, ſpeaking as a Proteſtant, and pretending to ſpeak
to Proteſtants, that I believe all the Proteſtant States of <hi>Germany</hi>
ought to yield ſomewhat to the memory of the great <hi>Guſtavus;</hi> that
<hi>Hero</hi> of our Faith did ſo great things to ſuſtain the Proteſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

made by the Enterprize of <hi>France</hi> upon <hi>Treves, Colmar, Schelſtead,</hi> and
all the Banks of the <hi>Rhine, &amp;c.</hi> to the violation of that Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> He proceeds; Now this Peace betwixt the Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the North may be made for ought I can ſee to hinder it; and
being <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> have accorded their differences, all the
Proteſtant Powers may make alſo a Politick Union for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of every one of them in particular, which Union as to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
States, which are Members or Vaſſals of the Empire under
which I comprehend alſo the two Northern Crowns, may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd,
as I conceive, on theſe Conditions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the maintenance of the Intereſts of the Empire, and his
Imperial Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for their own particular preſervation, and that of their
Allies, and in the matter of the ſecond Article they may make a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Union with Reſervation for the Intereſts of the firſt with his
Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and the United Provinces for their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
preſervation, and principally for the preſervation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion in all places wherever it ſhould be aſſailed or oppreſſed
by the Artifices of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Princes of that Communion.</p>
            <p>And as to ſome ancient grudges upon ſome Pretenſions betwixt
ſome Proteſtant States in the Empire, which are yet to be regulated,
it ſhould be ordered that every one ſhould continue in his Rights,
and that no armed hoſtility ſhould be practiſed betwixt theſe States,
but they ſhould rather endeavour to clear and avoid their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by the moderation of their Friends, Allies, and Confederates.</p>
            <p>For this being eſtabliſhed in this manner, his Imperial Majeſty and
the whole Empire could not but well approve, that a Body ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
ſhould unanimouſly agree for the firſt Article of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96566:14"/>
to ſuſtain one anothers Intereſts againſt all; and it would
naturally follow upon this agreement, that as the Republick of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
hath very judiciouſly taken for its particular Intereſt the general
of all <hi>Italy;</hi> the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany</hi> taking for their principal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
that of the Empire in general; this would neceſſarily follow
thereupon, that the Emperor and Empire would be politically ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to take for their Intereſt the preſervation of the Proteſtant States,
which would by conſequence draw on very favourable ſucceſſes to
the advantage of the Proteſtant Body through the whole extent of
the Empire and elſewhere: and the Emperour and Empire ought
ſo much the more cleave to this Intereſt; for that it is certain, that if
this great blow were once given, the Emperour and Empire needed
no more to fear the practiſes or ſecret workings of <hi>France</hi> with the
Electors and private Princes of the Empire of the Roman Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor of all their armed attempts on that part; and this being not
eſtabliſhed, the Emperour and Empire ſhall be in a perpetual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to fear every thing as they both have at preſent, if the principal
Princes of the Proteſtant Body in the Empire had not generally
joined their Forces to thoſe of his Imperial Majeſty; and the Empire
in that juncture, when <hi>France</hi> by its formidable Armies and publick
and ſecret Leagues with the greater part of the Princes and Electors
of Roman Communion in <hi>Germany,</hi> thought to extend his Victorious
progreſs to the <hi>Danube</hi> or beyond, which without the aſſiſtance of
the Proteſtants he had doubtleſs executed too well.</p>
            <p>Being then an Union of this nature can produce ſuch good effects,
by all theſe Reaſons according to the ſmall Intelligence I have, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
afreſh, that if the Northern Peace be a thing poſſible, and the
Union of the Proteſtant States in the form and under the clauſes and
reſervations aforeſaid; in as much as to eſtabliſh the repoſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Empire on the ſide of <hi>France,</hi> no more is required than to
force the French Army to repaſs the <hi>Rhine;</hi> whoever counſelleth
the Emperour and Empire, and all its Allies, according to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſollicitation of a certain party to treat with <hi>France</hi> in the Eſtate
things now ſtand, ſhould do the ſame thing with a Phyſician, who
ſeeing his Patient aſſailed with a mortal diſeaſe, if not fundamentally
cured, ſhould notwithſtanding adviſe him to take no other than
palliative Remedies.</p>
            <p>And one of the firſt truths which ought to be conſidered, is, that
all the Arms of the Emperour and Empire, <hi>Spain, Holland,</hi> and their
Allies, have not hitherto taken one ſingle piece of ground of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Patrimony of <hi>France,</hi> and that <hi>France</hi> brought its Arms actually
into <hi>Campania,</hi> and in the places of the Empire, <hi>Flanders, Brabant, Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalt,
Luxemburg, Limburg, Lorain</hi> and <hi>Burgoigne,</hi> and hath actually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
its Conqueſts in ſome of theſe Provinces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96566:14"/>
Now to make an honourable and ſure Peace, it's neceſſary to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
ſolid means for the Expulſion of the French Armies from the
ſaid Countries, and to force them to ſubmit to ſuch a Peace which
may work the ſecurity and ſatisfaction of all the ſaid Eſtates, and this
ſatisfaction and aſſurance, if it muſt be ſuch as I have declared, it muſt
herein eſſentially conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as to the Empire, that he willingly reduce himſelf to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
of <hi>Briſſac,</hi> unleſs his Imperial Majeſty ſhall chooſe rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that this place, if it be conquered from <hi>France,</hi> ſhould be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
demoliſhed, or together with its dependences given to ſome
Prince of the Proteſtant Communion; for in this ſecond caſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be altogether ſafe and wholeſome to expel all the French out
of the Dominions of the Empire, the ſame is to be concluded of the
Biſhoprick in the Country of <hi>Metz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, as to what concerns <hi>Spain, France</hi> ſhould be content to
reduce it ſelf to the State of the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Peace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that to recompence <hi>Holland</hi> for <hi>Maſtrick,</hi> which this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
is obliged to concede unto <hi>Spain</hi> to ſave ſhipwrack, and for
ſatisfaction for the dammage of the unjuſt War which <hi>France</hi> had
made on them, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> or ſome other place of equal value ſhall be
given them.</p>
            <p>And in the fourth place, that his Highneſs of <hi>Lorain</hi> ſhall be fully
eſtabliſhed in his Dukedoms of <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Bar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt be excuſed from ſpeaking of what remains to be ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in favour of other Confederate States, becauſe I have no good nor
preciſe cognizance thereof.</p>
            <p>But to come to a Peace both ſure and honourable, there are preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
without which it is certain our end cannot be attained, and
when it doth ſucceed, all that cannot be called ſolid and ſure.</p>
            <p>To attain to the one and aſſure the other, we muſt proceed to
means to eſtabliſh in <hi>France</hi> what would ſo ſettled make <hi>France</hi> to
contain it ſelf modeſtly in its juſt bounds, without unreaſonable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
and attempting on its Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The one and only means to reduce <hi>France</hi> to this point, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh,
as I have ſaid above, the Civil and Proteſtant Liberty
throughout the whole extent of that Eſtate, the one of the ſaid eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments
being notoriouſly inſeperable from the other, and that all
the Confederate States ſhould ſtifly ſtand, not to hearken to any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of Peace, till this double Eſtabliſhment were made, and
that for the ſecuring it, the Proteſtant Party ſhould be poſſeſſed of
ſome of the ſtrong and maritime places they formerly had.</p>
            <p>Neither ought any perſon to imagine that I am herein carried only
with paſſion for my Religion: for I abſolutely affirm, that withont a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96566:15"/>
real execution of the ſaid two Articles, nor ſolid Peace can be made
with <hi>France,</hi> and that it is the only means to ſtop at once the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sallies of the Monarch of that Nation by a total incapacity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this eſtabliſhment only can be a poſſible execution.</p>
            <p>And that the Reader may more ſenſibly apprehend this Truth, I
intreat him to read with a little conſideration before he proceeds any
farther, my particular obſervations of the effects which followed in
<hi>Europe</hi> upon the fatal Surrender of <hi>Rochel;</hi> the reading of that alone
will make him underſtand that which we are about, and the ſolidity
of my precedent Propoſition.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all the unhappy miſchiefs ſucceſſively befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> by this only error of State on its part, for not
having imployed all its Forces to hinder this ſurrender, it will for all
that perhaps not be eaſie for that Illuſtrious Houſe (ſuch is the Zeal it
unhappily reſerves ſtill for the Intereſts of a Court which hath cauſed
all its misfortunes) to be perſwaded to favour the Eſtabliſhment of
the Proteſtant Party in the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> to help nature herein,
I believe it is neceſſary for their content by way of prelude thereto,
unanimouſly and in a publick way to demand a Seſſion of the States
General of <hi>France,</hi> to effect the eſtabliſhment of the Common Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which will be unanimouſly embraced by the three Orders of that
Eſtate, and in the conſequent explication of the means of Security
for its maintenance, it will not be abſolutely impoſſible to attain our
purpoſe of the ſecond part of my Propoſal.</p>
            <p>Now all the Confederate States with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and that
Illuſtrious Houſe, are more than poſitively concluded of this point, in
this preſent Conjuncture not to hearken to any Peace, but in doing
what heretofore the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in common with the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and States General of his
Realm; for this Imperial Houſe and all its Allies have more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proved by what ſucceeded upon the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Peace, that no
ſecurity can be re-eſtabliſhed by any Treaties made with the preſent
Miniſters of that Realm by the moſt ſolemn Oaths and ſtraiteſt ties
of Conſanguinity, which were not ſtrong enough to hinder the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Peace; there is therefore a neceſſity to reduce him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
in the manner aforeſaid and no other way, which will infallibly
draw after it ſuch conſequences as will be wholly for the advantage
of the ſaid Confederation, and the Proteſtant Party in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Propoſitions are too advantagious to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>
for them to reject them; and it is certain, that if all the aforeſaid
States, act in Combination and with a perfect Union to procure all
theſe benefits, they will be able fully to attain them, and bring all
<hi>France</hi> perhaps into a mutiny to make their Monarch conſent thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:96566:15"/>
But as it would not be juſt that the <hi>Proteſtant States</hi> ſhould act in
the foreſaid Union to bring about all theſe benefits for the <hi>Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and all the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but that at the ſame time they ſhould procure for thoſe of
their Body all the <hi>advantages</hi> that ſo favourable a <hi>Conjunction</hi> could
procure; I am bold to ſay, that all thoſe <hi>States</hi> by the <hi>Principles</hi> of
their <hi>Faith,</hi> of their <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and of their <hi>Glory,</hi> ſhould bring them
to an Unanimous <hi>Reſolution</hi> to labour in this <hi>Conjuncture</hi> two things
in favour of the <hi>Electoral Houſe Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with a pure
and truly <hi>politick reſpect</hi> unto the ſaid <hi>Confederation,</hi> and other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Managements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is to <hi>procure</hi> to this <hi>Illuſtrious Houſe</hi> a <hi>Juſtice</hi> that ſpeaks
ſufficiently for it ſelf, it being certain that the ſame <hi>Reaſons</hi> which
cauſed it to <hi>loſe</hi> part of its <hi>Eſtabliſhments,</hi> ought to cauſe a <hi>Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
thereof to be made unto it in this <hi>Conjuncture,</hi> and if the
<hi>League</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant States</hi> were <hi>ſolidly</hi> made, and they would
act with <hi>neceſſary vigour,</hi> they would without doubt be in an <hi>Eſtate</hi>
to do <hi>all things</hi> that were juſt and reaſonable in this point.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, not to <hi>neglect</hi> by preſſing Inſtances <hi>to urge his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine
Highneſs</hi> Prince <hi>Robert</hi> to a ſuitable Marriage, which might
give hopes of <hi>Succeſſors</hi> to this <hi>Illuſtrious Houſe,</hi> leaſt (by an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
<hi>neglect</hi>) the <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Electoral Dignity</hi> may <hi>fall</hi> into the
hands of a <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Roman Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe are two <hi>Capital Points</hi> whereunto all the ſaid <hi>Proteſtant
States,</hi> as well they who have <hi>openly</hi> armed themſelves, as thoſe
who have been content to <hi>ſupply</hi> their ſeveral <hi>Quota</hi>'s to the Arms
of the Circles, as being all <hi>naturally intereſſed</hi> in the Cauſe, ought
to <hi>apply</hi> themſelves, as to a <hi>point</hi> which <hi>capitally</hi> concerns them <hi>all,</hi>
and whoſe <hi>conſequents</hi> if not prevented muſt needs be <hi>fatal</hi> to the
whole. But as there is no <hi>Rule</hi> ſo <hi>general</hi> that admits of no <hi>excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
it may be <hi>gathered</hi> from all that I have written above, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
my <hi>Scruples</hi> againſt <hi>Confederations</hi> made with Princes
of the <hi>Roman Communion;</hi> I am far from <hi>blaming</hi> thoſe <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
States,</hi> who in this laſt <hi>Conjuncture</hi> embraced the Intereſts of
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> I am perſwaded they could not <hi>diſpenſe</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
without <hi>betraying</hi> their <hi>true Intereſt,</hi> it being certain that ſince
the <hi>Providence</hi> of God hath ſuffered the Houſes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>
to aſcend in <hi>Europe,</hi> its neceſſary that all the <hi>Proteſtant States</hi>
ſhould ſince then be <hi>Confederated,</hi> and ſhould put <hi>themſelves</hi> into a
condition to ballance <hi>theſe two,</hi> that whenſoever the <hi>one</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> his Corrival, he might not be able to
<hi>ſubdue</hi> all the reſt to his <hi>blind obedience;</hi> and as it is manifeſt that
<hi>France</hi> at the <hi>preſent,</hi> is the unjuſt Aggreſſor, and by the principles of a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96566:16"/>
devouring ambition alone, without any Right, but that of his own
Honour or <hi>bienſeance,</hi> would raiſe to himſelf the Title of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
by invading the Soveraign Dominions of his Neighbours, the
Empire, <hi>Auſtria, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> it may be truly ſaid, that all the
Proteſtant Princes who have liſted themſelves with the oppoſite Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by all the Rules of a judicious and ſtrict Policy have ranged
themſelves without contradiction in the Line of their true Intereſts.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all it ought to be conſidered, that in the Modern Irrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the Arms of <hi>France</hi> made into <hi>Holland</hi> four years ſince, by
the manner whereby <hi>France</hi> attempted it, and management precedent
to it, or which followed on the Enterprize; the Monarch of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath plainly taken off his Mask, and made us viſibly to know
that he ought to be conſidered in this Conjuncture, not only in the
ſame Character of Conquerours of former Ages towards all Eſtates
who had the unhappineſs to have Dominions adjacent to their Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
but that he ought alſo formally to be look'd on as the declared
Protector of the Tyrannick Deſigns of the Papacy, and ſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
and poſitive Enemy and Deſtroyer (if the matter had
been poſſible for him) of all the States and People whoſe Faith is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
oppoſite to that Tyranny.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, that the Imperial Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> forced by
the threats of its utter ruine, having in this occaſion now Leagued and
Confederated its politick Intereſts with the greater part of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
States of <hi>Europe,</hi> to oppoſe it ſelf by a joint endeavour and
force to the ambitious Deſigns of <hi>France;</hi> it is for the Honour of all
theſe States to cauſe this Imperial Houſe in this Conjuncture to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that Juſtice, Reaſon, and Equity hath been the Baſe, the
ſolid and unmoveable Foundation whereon they have laid all their
motions; and that it is alſo in the Proteſtant, that all the oppreſſed
Powers of Chriſtendom may find the Bulwark of their Security.</p>
            <p>For Conſiderations of this force ſerve to confirm the reſpects of
Intereſts and Glory which eſtabliſh the Juſtice of theſe motions of all
the Proteſtant States in favour of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in a ſolid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
and theſe motions are ſo much more glorious for theſe Princes,
and they may draw from thence ſo much the more happy Events,
becauſe the Houſes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Bourbon</hi> by what hath happened
in Times paſt and preſent, cannot hinder it, but muſt needs thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
make reflexions ſufficient to open their eyes and make them know
in the concluſion:</p>
            <p>In the firſt place their Imprudence in regulating their Councils and
Sallies by the paſſions of the Emiſſaries of the Roman Communion.
Secondly, the temerity and danger of attempting the ruine of any
Proteſtant People, Prince, or Eſtate. Thirdly, what the United For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96566:16"/>
of this Party are naturally capable to execute. And fourthly, the
Honour, Candour, and Conſtancy of that Party; when they are
concerned to oppoſe unjuſt Enterpriſes, or to maintain the part of
Equity and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Reflections of this nature ought in conſequence teach theſe two
Houſes, the regard, eſteem, and reſpect which they ought to have and
reſerve for a Body ſo Puiſſant and Illuſtrious, as is by God's grace
that of the ſaid Proteſtant Powers, and the people whereof they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and if this Party were always ſo managed, as to inſinuate into
theſe two Houſes, the Doctrine of theſe four particulars, we ſhould
certainly not ſee thoſe who are Natives and Inhabitants of the
Eſtates of thoſe two Potentates (<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi>) handled any
more in the manner they now are, nor would theſe two Families,
whatever Solicitations ſhould be made on the behalf of <hi>Rome,</hi>
attempt with ſo much injuſtice as they have both done at divers
times, the ruine of the Principal Members of this Communion.</p>
            <p>But if in this preſent Conjuncture all the Proteſtant States (except
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi>) have followed their true Intereſt; I perſiſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that the ſame Intereſt engages them Capitally to rectifie the
Conduct of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sweden;</hi> ſo as to neglect nothing to gain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them theſe two Crowns, in proſpect of uſing all poſſible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to effect an Union of all the aforeſaid Proteſtant States; that
when by many happy Succeſſes, the Arms of his Imperial Majeſty,
the Empire, and all the Confederate States have reduced <hi>France</hi> to
that abatement that their ſaid Intereſt can require, and in almoſt in
the manner which I have above unfolded; all theſe States may be
in a condition to nail the Wheel, and to produce an Univerſal Peace
in Chriſtendom with all the advantages and ſolemnities aforeſaid,
both for their own particular and general Intereſts, and for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of their Brethren through the whole extent of the Empire,
and without it, which by the ſaid Union they may be capable to effect
(if God permit) without any Impediment from any Power; and
without this Union, it may be, ſome <hi>Nuncio</hi> or Emiſſary of <hi>Rome</hi> may
poſſibly at a moment, when they think leaſt of it, ſecretly manage
ſome Marriage betwixt theſe Families, ſo as to reconcile their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
differences, and they not be in an Eſtate to oppoſe them, nor to
gather the Fruits which they might have juſtly expected.</p>
            <p>And I inſiſt ſo much the more on this that the Proteſtant States
ſhould put themſelves in ſuch a condition as I have ſaid above; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it being certain that the Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> have been the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of the underworkings which have raiſed this War, and of
the League of <hi>France</hi> with the Electors of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Strasburg</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Newburg</hi> and <hi>Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:96566:17"/>
and of the meaſures taken for the deſtruction of the Proteſtant
Party in <hi>Europe,</hi> as is too well proved; we muſt not doubt, but that
<hi>Rome</hi> will make all its uttermoſt poſſible endeavours to procure it
ſelf the honour of making peace. But that all <hi>Europe</hi> may know
how far the Morality of the Proteſtant Faith is diſtant from the black
and earthly malice of the Papacy; I think it belongs to the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Proteſtant States without any mixture with the
<hi>Nuncio</hi> or any Emiſſary of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to procure to
themſelves the glory of eſtabliſhing an Univerſal Peace in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
to the ſatisfaction of all honeſt men, which by the foreſaid
Union they will find at one blow to be in their power to effect, if
by their private Intereſts and Jealouſies they bury not the Talent
which God hath put naturally in their hands, not only for obtaining
ſo great a preſent good, but alſo for couſtituting themſelves for ever
the infallible Guardians and Preſervers thereof; which is the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
point at which all theſe States ought to aim, as which will give
them the ineſtimable Character of the Supreme Arbiters of all the
Potentates of Chriſtendom and invincible Bulwarks of their Security.</p>
            <p>And if I may be allowed to continue to unfold my apprehenſions
as ingenuouſly as I have begun as to what I believe will be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of a Succeſs of ſuch force, for the good and advantage of the
Proteſtant Body through the extent of the Empire, and by relation
to them in ſeveral other places; I conceive that all the aforeſaid
Proteſtant States having laid down their Arms, ought ſeriouſly to
apply themſelves to ſolid means to obtain of his Imperial Majeſty a
modification of the Article touching the Biſhop of <hi>Oſnaburg,</hi> in ſuch
manner as this Biſhoprick may be ſucceſſively enjoyed by the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of his Highneſs of <hi>Oſnaburg,</hi> without any mixture of Roman
Catholicks, it being certain that as his Imperial Majeſty is very full
of a generous benignity, he ſeeing with what vigour this Illuſtrious
Houſe hath acted in this conjuncture; for his Intereſts he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be very eaſily perſwaded to teſtifie toward that Houſe his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
reſentment and acknowledgement, I doubt not but that a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this nature will be entangled with many difficulties; but the
ſaid Union compleatly made or to the greater part, will be a Rock
to all the Slights and Machinatious of the Roman Court, againſt
which they ſhall effectually ſplit and miſcarry.</p>
            <p>But if an Article of this force may, and as I believe it would alſo,
be very eaſie for the ſaid States to cauſe to be inſerted in the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of Peace which ſhall be made, ſome little Negotiations which
are neceſſary to pacifie and lay aſleep all matter of Jealouſie and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
betwixt the two Proteſtant Communions tollerated in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo
as to deliver them both from ſome ſenſible diſpleaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96566:17"/>
For Example, in ſome Imperial Cities of the Proteſtant Body, to
the ſhame of the Princes of that Communion, the Paſtors of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran
Congregation are obliged to wear, with a kind of Ignominy,
a Bonnet like the Jews; it ſeemed to me a juſt thing to diſpenſe with
them in this for the future, and leave them to their liberty; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no reaſon to conſtrain them to the like Infamy, this being only
an unneceſſary mark of the animoſity which reigned heretofore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Princes of different Communion, which ought upon all
Principles of a judicious policy be entirely ſuppreſſed and aboliſhed
throughout all the extent of the Empire.</p>
            <p>In other places in many Imperial Cities, where the Magiſtracy is
of the Communion of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> it is ridiculous to ſee that whilſt the
Jews have there, all liberty in the exerciſe of their Religion; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
are forced with great inconvenience to walk to the exerciſes
of their Devotion without the Wall of the City, who agree with
Lutherans in all the principal Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith, and
are, together with them, the common Butt of all the Impreſſions of
the Papal malice, which neglects nothing which might foment their
diviſion, and thereby to walk on to ſolid means of their deſtruction:
Wherefore I conceive, that the States of the Proteſtant Communion,
though of different belief in certain points ought unanimouſly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to cauſe an Article to be inſerted in the ſaid inſtrument of
Peace, which might for the future redreſs ſuch Incongruities which
whilſt they continue, can be only ſeeds of Diviſions which both their
proper Intereſt and their Charity oblige them to ſuppreſs continually
in the Proteſtant Body.</p>
            <p>But as all that appears in Chriſtian Faith is commonly animated
with the Spirit of Charity, which engages us not only to adhere to
what is our peculiar, but to what reſpects our Brethrens intereſt, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
theirs, whom we cannot be ignorant to be actually in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
I think the aforeſaid Proteſtant States ſhould do a very hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Act, if by their mediation, the intereſts of their poor Brethren
might be regulated in ſuch manner, that at leaſt the Emiſſaries of
<hi>Rome</hi> might not have ſo ample matter, whereupon to raiſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt them.</p>
            <p>For Example, now for a whole Age, <hi>Europe</hi> hath heard no diſcourſe
but of the diſorders which from Time to Time have riſen in high
<hi>Hungary, Sileſia,</hi> and other the Hereditary Countries of the Houſe of
<hi>Austria:</hi> I commend not thoſe of the Proteſtant Body of that Kingdom
who for their private Intereſts or Ambition may be the cauſe of theſe
revolts and ſeditions in thoſe Countries; but if a great part of thoſe
diſorders ariſe from the diſcontents which the want of means to attend
their ſpiritual Exerciſes do cauſe, which without doubt is almoſt the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96566:18"/>
only cauſe, I conceive it were a work very pleaſing to be able by
humble Repreſentations to his Imperial Majeſty to cauſe him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
an Order which might for the future baniſh from that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
all matter of diſcontent, which I judge to be very feaſible.</p>
            <p>For if his Imperial Majeſty ſhall conſider the merits of all the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
whom all the ſaid Proteſtant State ſhould leave behind them;
ſo that for Politick Reaſons which engage him to prevent ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
he would make an eſtabliſhment for the future, that ſo oft as
in any Country, or in any particular place, Proteſtants ſhould be
found to a certain number, and ſhould deſire to have a free exerciſe
of their Religion, they ſhould be qualified to procure it without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Obligation, then that of ſignifying by a ſimple act their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and deſire to the Magiſtrate of the place; I conceive that by ſuch
an expedient his Imperial Majeſty might cut up the root of all thoſe
unhappy Revolts which engage him to extraordinary Expences, and
of the perpetual cares and alarms, and other practices, which the
Court of Rom's Emiſſaries furniſh and trouble him with to redreſs
theſe miſchiefs, which are more proper to caſt thoſe Countries into
flames then to eſtabliſh their Repoſe, as fatal experience of a whole
Age cannot but have too well taught him.</p>
            <p>And as the Peace which ſhall intervene will infallibly be an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Peace to all Chriſtendom, and ſo different Intereſts which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
its Tranquility may therein be regarded, following ſtill my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
which is to reſpect the extent and advantage of the Proteſtant
Faith, I muſt ſay that it will be of great Importance for the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
States to obtain of his Catholick Majeſty a Modification of
the Inſtrument of the laſt Peace, which <hi>France</hi> made with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> as touching the matter of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in <hi>Chaveine</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> for the Inhabitants of both parts of
that Religion who are in the ſaid places though their Magiſtrates are
for the greateſt part reformed, are obliged by a corruption inſerted in
the Treaty of Peace to walk at leaſt three or four Leagues on the
Lord's days to attend their Exerciſes of Devotion: It is moſt certain
that it is a conſiderable intereſt of his Majeſty to conſent to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
of this Article, if he would preſerve the Amity of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;
and of this I have very preciſe knowledge; for if the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of St. <hi>Roman,</hi> Embaſſadour for his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi>
in the Propoſitions he made to ſome of the Republick, had
been adviſed to let fall a word, that the King his Maſter would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to a free Exerciſe of the Reformed Religion in thoſe places; I
know that the League of that Republick with the Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi>
had been in danger to be diſſolved: for thus I judge that this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
and maintained in ſuch manner as it may by the Plenipotenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96566:18"/>
of the Proteſtant States, it will not be abſolutely impoſſible to
annul this Article, which will be of extraordinary conſideration for
the good of the Proteſtant Faith in that Quarter; many good Souls
which profeſs that Religion, though they reſide in <hi>Italy,</hi> ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
this Conſolation, and this I can ſay of my certain knowledge.</p>
            <p>But we have inſiſted long enough upon ſome Acceſſaries, let us go
to the Principal; it is ſo common with very many Proteſtants of all
Orders who enjoy peaceably according to their wiſh all convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
temporal and ſpiritual, not to be able to diſpoſe themſelves by
the Principles of Charity to compaſſionate the miſeries and afflictions
of their oppreſſed Brethren, that it is for this Reaſon that I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
my ſelf to make them know whereunto they are engaged in
this particular for their temporal Intereſt.</p>
            <p>But if in the firſt Point I have proſpered ſomewhat to make
known the connexion and indiſſoluble bond of Intereſts which the
Providence of God hath eſtabliſhed betwixt the ſubſiſtence of the
Politick Intereſts of all the Potentates of Chriſtendom, and of the
Proteſtants more eſpecially with the re-eſtabliſhment of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Party in <hi>France,</hi> by the ſincere Rehearſal which I am about ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly
to make of the miſeries wherein that Body of our Brethren
in that Kingdom are plunged; I would ſhew the Proteſtant States
for my ſecond Head whereto their Pity, their Charity and their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ought to engage them.</p>
            <p>To make known ſincerely the Eſtate of the Proteſtant Body in
<hi>France;</hi> I will not amuſe my ſelf in expounding what is publickly
known to the greateſt part of underſtanding perſons who have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
through that Realm, or who have taken the pains to get ſome
Information thereof; I will content my ſelf only to obſerve that the
Emiſſaries of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> having ſucceſſively inſinuated into
the ſpirits of the Monarchs of this Nation, that they could not think
of advancing their Progreſs abroad till after they were ſolidly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of all at home, and that therefore it was neceſſary for them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to exterminate the Proteſtant Party out of their Kingdom; this
Counſel hath ſo ſtrongly prevailed in the Councils of theſe Monarks,
that ſince Cardinal <hi>Richelieux</hi> Miniſtry, nothing hath been omitted to
make it fully ſucceed.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe all the Biſhops in every Dioceſs have had order to
give Inſtructions to all the Pariſh Prieſts, to hold an actual eye on all
ſolid means to proceed unto this deſtruction; and the Governours,
Counſellours and Intendents of the Provinces, as well as all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of Juſtice have had like order to concur with the Solicitations of
thoſe Biſhops; wherefore we need not admire at the Tribulation
which theſe poor miſerables do ſuffer; for it is from theſe fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96566:19"/>
that we ſee dayly in all parts of that Kingdom; Children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
againſt their Parents, Wives againſt their Husbands, Vaſſals and
Subjects againſt their Lords, Houſhold Servants againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
for what ever injury or violence is committed in theſe ſorts of
Rebellions, he that embraceth the Religion of his Prince hath always
reaſon on his ſide, and he that perſiſts in the Proteſtant Faith hath
always wrong.</p>
            <p>So that as it is very hard in a Houſe to regulate every thing ſo well
that there ſhould not naturally arrive ſome accident betwixt the ſaid
Parties, theſe Emiſſaries never looſe any occaſion directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to bring about ſuch Conteſts to kindle the fire more ſtrongly,
and thence the heat more fiercely, and if this ſucceeds, to inſinuate
their Poyſon.</p>
            <p>Hereby it may appear what bitter potions the moſt happy and
wiſe of the Reformed in Popiſh Dominions are forced to ſwallow.</p>
            <p>More than two thirds of their Temples have been demoliſhed
within theſe ten years: more than half their Colledges ſuppreſt.</p>
            <p>No Proteſtant can have the leaſt place in the Offices nor Troops
of the King's Houſhold; and if in the common Troops perſons of
the higheſt merit riſe to the place of a Lieutenant Colonel, it is rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeen that they paſs farther: What hath befallen the <hi>Mareſchal
Schomberg,</hi> is not an Argument to prove, that the French Proteſtants
that deſerve well may riſe thither; he is at preſent that <hi>Phenix</hi>
which appears but once in an Age.</p>
            <p>But if any Proteſtant be ſo unhappy as to have any Suit againſt
any Roman Catholick, he may aſſure himſelf, how little dubious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Cauſe is, his Affair is loſt.</p>
            <p>If two Proteſtants have any Suits, he that Apoſtotizeth is ſure to
carry it againſt him that perſiſts in his Faith, who ſhall never fail to
looſe his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But all this aboveſaid is nothing at all to that which was provided
for them, if the Invaſion of <hi>Holland</hi> had ſucceeded, for warrant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I can alledge one of the moſt Heroick Princes of all <hi>Europe,</hi> who
read himſelf the Declaration ready provided, and who thereupon
was ſtruck with an Horrour, and ſpoke immediatly with liberty his
thoughts upon that point to conſiderable Perſons; but the ill ſucceſs
of that Irruption and ſome other Reſpects have cauſed that Monſter
for the preſent to be laid up in due darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all the King declared himſelf by this goodly Declaration,
Tutor of all the Infant Pupils of Proteſtant Fathers, and ſo condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all thoſe poor unhappy Creatures to be ſacrificed to the adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Idols.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place all the Temples and Colledges of all the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96566:19"/>
Royal or Epiſcopal Cities or places belonging to Catholick Lords
were ſuppreſſed throughout all <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In regard that by the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> every Lord having right of
Fee-ſimple, might have at his Houſe the Exerciſe of Religion more
or leſs extended according to the nature of his Fee; by this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it was expounded not to extend to any places but thoſe, which
at the time of that Edict did belong to Proteſtant Lords; now for
that many Lords had ſince changed their Religion, and the greater
part of the Lands had by a natural viciſſitude of things changed
Maſters, thence it would have followed that no exerciſe of Religion
in thoſe Fees would have been preſerved in that Kingdom, though
it be thoſe only that, ſo many as they be, have in the furious over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
of Proteſtant Temples made the Exerciſes of Religion to
ſubſiſt abroad in the Country.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, all the Chambers of the Edict or Miparties,
were by this Infamous Declaration ſuppreſſed, and all the Miparti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
Mayoralties which were eſtabliſhed in former times in favour of thoſe
of the R. Religion.</p>
            <p>And to complete their miſery by the ſame Declaration; all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
born in Marriages, not bleſt by the Prieſts of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
after the publication of that Declaration, were declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
to ſucceed their Fathers and their Mothers in their Goods
and Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>Note that by a former Declaration all the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi>
who had received a bleſſing on their Marriage by the hands of a Prieſt
of the Roman Communion with Abjuration, in caſe they returned to
communicate in the Exerciſes of the Proteſtant Religion wherein
they were born, were declared Relaps'd, and their Goods Confiſcate.</p>
            <p>I forbear to ſet down here ſome other Articles not ſo conſiderable
as the former, which yet were no leſs unjuſt nor malicious; the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the preceding ſeem ſufficient to me, whereby the more ſound
Party of the Proteſtants of <hi>Europe</hi> may examine (as I do with all my
heart intreat them) the pernicious fare which the Papal Council had
prepared for the Proteſtants of <hi>Holland,</hi> at that very time, wherein
they pretended to make them ſubmit unto the Dominion, Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Diſcretion of <hi>France,</hi> and that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> in particular
may ſee the ſurprize, which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Channel of
<hi>France</hi>'s Miniſters had provided for them, and the Iniquity of the
Cauſe they have put themſelves into a condition of protecting, in
authorizing the Irruptions, Burnings, and ambitious Enterprizes of
<hi>France</hi> on the Low-Country Provinces, and the Empire.</p>
            <p>And all theſe States, and all the People of their Dominions being
inſtructed in their Intereſts, which engaged them to ſuſtain the cauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96566:20"/>
of the Re-eſtabliſhment of Liberty in <hi>France,</hi> both Temporal and
Spiritual, which as to the ſecond Head conſiſts in the common
cauſe of their Brethren in this Eſtate; all theſe Benefits cannot be
effected but by a poſitive Union of their good will and Forces; I
leave them to conſider whether I had ground to inſinuate this with
all my power, praying the good God with all the ardour of my ſoul
that he would inſpire into this Illuſtrious Body Sentiments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
of Piety and Glory, ſuch as a Cauſe ſo ſolid, ſo juſt, and ſo
holy requires. I finiſh the firſt part of my Diſcourſe, reſerving my
ſelf to preſs home this matter more ſtrongly, aſſaying in good earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to open the eyes of the Proteſtant Body in <hi>Europe,</hi> to make them
ſenſibly apprehend what they are to expect from their Enemies, and
what they are in condition to do by the Forces, which God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath put in their hand, not only to deliver themſelves from all
theſe Judicious Apprehenſions, but alſo to become the indiſputable
Arbiters of the Fortunes of their Friends and Enemies.</p>

            <head>PART II. The Error of Eſtate made by many Potentates in the Buſineſs
of the Reduction of Rochelle; the Conſequences whereof
have been the cauſe of moſt conſiderable Converſions of
Estate, Wars and Diſorders of Europe, which we have
ſeen ſince that time.</head>
            <p>CArdinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who without doubt was the greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

pierced into the knowledge of that wherein the true Intereſt of
<hi>France</hi> might conſiſt, to raiſe the glory of its Kings to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

than the fruits of the Heroick Labours of that great Miniſter, and
the Execution of the <hi>Memoires</hi> and ſecret Inſtructions of his Miniſtery;
it being certain that ſo far as they have not departed therefrom, their
Glory and Succeſs have been inſeperably united to the greater part of
their Expeditions, and ſo far as they have departed from them, their
Enterpriſes have many times been attended with loſs of Glory to
their Maſter; theſe are things which we obſerve ſometimes by the

and Remarks upon ſome Errors of Eſtate in the Miniſtry of <hi>France;</hi>

that Point alone for the Reduction of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> a Capital <hi>quid

might have hindered it; if they on that occaſion had known their
true Intereſt, and the excellent Conduct of that great Miniſter at the

            <p>And firſt of all we will apply our ſelves only to obſerve what is

            <p>The Siege of <hi>Rochelle</hi> being ſettled about it, the Town was but
weakly relieved by the Engliſh, ſo that we may affirm that their laſt
expedition which ſeemed to be ſet out for that purpoſe after the
death of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was rather a ſuccour of ſhow and appearance
than reality, if it might not be ſaid rather that the good King then
could not do all he would for their Relief, <hi>Holland</hi> blind to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
own true Intereſt upon this occaſion lent their Maritime Forces

            <p>
               <hi>Spain</hi> who ought more than any other Potentate to have known

all the miſadventures which befel them, and followed upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,

to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> it ſelf; I ſpeak of State Affairs, and alſo
by the conſequences thereof to the greater part of the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>England</hi> we need only take a ſmall taſt of the Travels and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
of the late <hi>Monſieur</hi> Preſident <hi>de Thou,</hi> Embaſſadour of <hi>France</hi>
in <hi>England;</hi> to underſtand that upon the King of <hi>England</hi>'s failing to

tended to nothing more then to procure the deſtruction of the

of ſupplies for the relief of <hi>Rochelle:</hi> we may ſay that it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this foundation that <hi>France,</hi> by the means of the ſaid Lord <hi>Thou,</hi>
gave life to the univerſal revolt of all <hi>England,</hi> and to that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Catastrophe</hi> which all <hi>Europe</hi> have beheld with horrour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment;
and this is the very truth, that the departed <hi>Monſieur

before his death to ſeveral of his Confidents, of which ſome are yet
alive, that he proteſted that he died with ſore regret, that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled

            <p>As for the moſt Illuſtrious Family of <hi>Austria,</hi> in examining what

            <p>Firſt, with reſpect to the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector

<hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and all their Confederates being humbled or deſtroyed;
we may truly ſay it was in a condition to do what it could reaſonably
deſire in <hi>Germany;</hi> but by the Conſequence of that Reduction, <hi>France</hi>
was in condition to ſend its Aids abroad, and to make Alliances, and
having in conſequence thereof ſubſcribed to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> League, it is
eaſie to ſee what, after the Great <hi>Gustavus</hi> did ſet foot in the Empire,
did happen through the whole extent thereof to the prejudice of this
Illuſtrious Houſe till the Peace of <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Oſnaburg.</hi>

            <p>The eight Electorate, <hi>Briſac</hi> and <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> with all the Conqueſts

            <p>For <hi>Spain</hi> we may ſay, that till the Reduction of <hi>Rochelle</hi> it was not
always triumphant, but it had thitherto ſupported the weight of its

greatneſs with glory; and was in an Eſtate to make all them to fear
it, who did not love it; till then <hi>Flanders, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> beheld
a numerous Armies on their ſide; the Sea alſo beheld their Nval
Forces of ſome conſideration, and the Frontiers of the <hi>Pirennes</hi> with
the two Seas were their only Neighbours and Frontiers through all
the extent of <hi>Spain,</hi> and all that <hi>Isthmos</hi> acknowledged their Laws
from the <hi>Pirennes</hi> to <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars and farther; till then they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to their advantage Friends and Penſioners ſecretly in all the
Courts of <hi>Europe, France</hi> it ſelf not excepted, but as if all that glory
had been buried in the reduction of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> it may be truly ſaid that
whoſoever ſhall examine the ruines of the greatneſs of <hi>Spain,</hi> with
their miſcarriages in the greateſt part of their Deſigns almoſt perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ſince the reduction of this petty <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſo that the aſtoniſhing
diſmembrings which this Puiſſance hath ſuffered, and the hard Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which it hath been forced to ſubſcribe will evince that its glory
ſeems to be interred in the ruines of the fortifications of this Town;
for whether it were through its Military Expeditions, or the Conduct
of its Miniſters, or the little care it hath had to keep its intelligence
amongſt its Enemies, and after with its Allies, as well as the facility
wherewith the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> after <hi>Richelieu,</hi> pierced into the
moſt ſecret deliberations of the Council of <hi>Madrid;</hi> it is moſt true
that after the Error of Eſtate on their part, this Puiſſance did flutter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with one wing, which gave courage together with other accidents
of a different nature; to the <hi>Catalonians, Portugeſe</hi> and <hi>Neopolitans,</hi> and
likewiſe to the <hi>Meſſineſe</hi> of late to enterpriſe by incitation and puiſſant
Succours of <hi>France,</hi> what they have hitherto attempted; it being
moſt certain that without vigorous Succours from its Allies, it would
be at preſent expoſed to an entire invaſion of the moſt conſiderable
part of its Eſtate, as well in the old as in the new World.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Holland,</hi> the Caſe is ſo hot and freſh in the miſeries which have
befallen them within theſe four years by their Error of Eſtate in the
conjuncture of that Siege, that certainly it is needleſs for me to make
a long diſcourſe to evince this truth; for I believe there is not any
man of perfect underſtanding, who knows not readily, and is not well
perſwaded, that if <hi>Rochelle</hi> in the time that his moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
did attempt to ſubject <hi>Holland,</hi> had been in the hands of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
of <hi>France,</hi> in ſuch manner as it was before, and as it probably
might have been if this Republick had not furniſhed out its Sea For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to make this Reduction, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had never da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to enterpriſe an Expedition of that nature, and that for two unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
Reaſons. The firſt becauſe <hi>Rochelle</hi> by its ſubſiſtence gave
life to two millions of Reformed Chriſtian Souls which are yet in <hi>France,</hi>
whatever the Jeſuits pleaſe to ſay, that there are but 1500000, <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:96566:22"/>
having in its bowels ſo conſiderable a number of Proteſtants, would
never have determined to have undertaken the deſtruction of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Republick, which by its ſcituation ſo favourable as it had to
<hi>Rochelle,</hi> was in condition to put <hi>France</hi> it ſelf into diſorder.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they would have found themſelves without a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or force to have attempted this enterpriſe; for the Liberty of <hi>France</hi>
(I mean that of Eſtate) being in force and its prime (as without doubt
it would have been to this time, had <hi>Rochelle</hi> been unſubdued) the
Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> and their Monarch would have been more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
than to have attempted it: if then this foundation be truly laid,
as I ſhall prove it more largely hereafter, my Maſters the Eſtates of
the United Provinces, who are perſons that commonly underſtand
ſtrictly to take the account of their intereſt, may calculate, after they
have ſet on one ſide the profits which they received from <hi>France</hi> for
Veſſels which they lent or ſold them to advance this Reduction, and
have ſet on the other ſide the loſs which by the late Expedition of his
moſt Chriſtian Majeſty againſt them they have ſuſtained, that which
ariſes of gain or loſs at the foot of the account in this Commerce of
theirs, and the <hi>quid pro quo</hi> of Eſtate in this Juncture ſhall be plain.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>France</hi> conſidered in it ſelf, I ſpeak of its State in its three
Eſtates, we may admire in this point the wonderful light of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
<hi>Monſieur</hi> Marſhal <hi>de Baſſompiere,</hi> which I quoted above; for it
is a truth no more diſputed, but generally known of all perſons of
worth and intelligence in <hi>France</hi> of the Roman Communion; That
the Liberty of all <hi>France</hi> was buried in the reduction and demolition
of the fortifications of the Town of <hi>Rochelle:</hi> It was this City that
ſuſtained the dying liberty of <hi>France</hi> ſince the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
and which was in a condition to re-eſtabliſh it, and with its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to uphold alſo the liberty of all <hi>Europe,</hi> both in their Religious
and Civil Concerns. If the aforeſaid Powers as well as <hi>France</hi> it ſelf,
ignorant of their true intereſt, had not by their connivance or by their
Succours brought about the aforeſaid Reduction; for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſerves it for the Gentry of <hi>France</hi> to ſee their Monarch triumph
over all his Neighboury Princes; if this only tend to increaſe the
number of Slaves under his Dominion, or rather to give them the
ſenſible and tormenting diſpleaſure to ſee the Forces and Power of
ſome Eſtates broken in pieces, who by their Subſiſtence and Ayds
might have had time and place to have holpen them in ſome favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
conjuncture to break the chains and ſhake off the yoke which
oppreſſeth them; whereas if no Power be in a condition to make
Head againſt their Prince, who ſhall be able to lend them aſſiſtance
to free them from their oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>But that it may not be thought that I advance a ſtrange notion, in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96566:22"/>
that I would build the ſafety of a whole Realm, and alſo of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of <hi>Europe</hi> on the ſimple ſurrender of one Town, which hath
been entitled with the name of a Rebel, we muſt examine it: And
to penetrate into the bottom of this matter, I conſider, that in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Authority now is there can be no other then
the re-eſtabliſhment of one of the three means which I ſhall after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
or ſome equivalent, which can hinder theſe Kings abſolutely
to diſpoſe of the Lives and Goods of their Subjects, and that thereby
they may not be able by the formidable multitude of people of all
degrees which are in <hi>France,</hi> their Induſtry, Courage and Martial Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
to hold all their Neighbours in perpetual and well grounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms;
I would be underſtood to ſpeak of the means which <hi>France</hi>
hath had or may have in it ſelf to maintain or eſtabliſh its liberty.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe means is as ancient an Inſtitution as the Office
and name of a King in <hi>France;</hi> for it hath been ſince the time the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Franks</hi> did conquer the <hi>Gauls;</hi> that is the Election of a Palatine
or Major of the Palace, who was the Conſul and Head of the People,
and the true Protector of the Liberty of his Country, who had Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to deal as an Arbitrator betwixt the King and his People, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
and decide all their differences, and in truth the ancient Kings
of <hi>France</hi> were no other to ſpeak properly than the chief Captains
General of their Realm, and in the Palatine reſided the Principal
charges of the Eſtate; as the Chancellour, Conſtable and Admiral,
and it is very true that in this manner the Authority was very well
parted betwixt the King and his People, who were repreſented as for
this laſt regard by the Palatine: but <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> knowing very well
by the conſequence of what he and <hi>Pepin</hi> had done, that the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines
might one day act the very ſame againſt their Succeſſours, he
with dexterity ſuppreſſed the Office of the Palatine, and annexed it
unto the Royalty: ſee here the manner wherein appears the firſt
means whereby the liberty of Eſtate in <hi>France</hi> hath ſubſiſted during
the two firſt Races of its Kings, ſuppreſſed and aboliſhed by a Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
himſelf, in whoſe Perſon the third Race of thoſe very Kings did
commence, whoſe Succeſſours have reigned in a continued Succeſſion
unto this day.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> could not come to this Crown but with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of all the Principal Members, and eſpecially thoſe of his
own degree; this was the cauſe that the evil conſequences which
would have ariſen from the Office of Palatine were not perceived
nor redreſſed, as the intereſt of State without doubt required; and
that he might take away all reſentments thereof; <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> being
too ſubtle and refined a Politician to leave any ſuſpicion in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
minds, he made uſe of this contrivance to ſubſtitute the Seſſions
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96566:23"/>
of the States General of the Kingdom under the name of Parliaments,
of which we find very little mention during the Reign of the Kings
of the two firſt Races: for in as much as the Deputies of the three
Eſtates compoſe this Aſſembly, it may ſeem at firſt view that <hi>Hugh
Capet</hi> had not ſuppreſſed the Office of Palatine for other purpoſe then
to diffuſe all the Authority of this Eminent Charge upon the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Members of the ſaid Aſſembly; but theſe good ſouls did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
that the Office of Palatine was perpetual, and that the Seſſion of
the Parliament was only then held when the King had a fancy to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
them; albeit it is true that the States General of <hi>France,</hi> if they
were in poſſeſſion would underſtand it otherwiſe, notwithſtanding by
the conſequence we may underſtand, how dangerous it is to change
under what pretence ſoever the Fundamental Laws of Eſtate, let the
appearances be never ſo ſpecious that the ſame advantage is retained,
it being certain that they who have the courage or dexterity to modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
or conquer Sovereign Eſtates know better than any other by
what Maxims their Succeſſours may be enabled to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
therein; for when the <hi>French</hi> firſt conquered the <hi>Gauls</hi> they
choſe a King out of the number of their Generals, they alſo wiſely
deviſed as I touched above, all that might hinder their Kings from
ever becoming Tyrants. Now in the Eſtates Generals or Parliaments
conſiſted the ſecond means whereby the publick Liberty in <hi>France</hi> did
ſubſiſt, ſo long as their Seſſions were frequent; but in proceſs of time
<hi>Lewis</hi> the Ninth having reunited the greateſt part of the particular
Principalities which were in <hi>France</hi> unto the Crown, <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth
having accompliſhed that great Work by his Marriage with <hi>Anne</hi> the
Heireſs of the Dukedome of <hi>Britain,</hi> theſe Princes believing and
finding themſelves above all accidents, the aſſembling of the Eſtates
General of the Kingdom hath been ſo long diſcontinued, that at
length all uſe of it hath been as it were quite loſt; and thereby the
ſecond means of maintaining the liberty of <hi>France</hi> through the whole
extent thereof is vaniſhed and diſſipated as the former, then the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
liberty was in a pitiful Eſtate until ſuch time as the Reformation
began to get footing in <hi>France:</hi> for as the Reformation of <hi>Luther</hi> was
doubtleſs the means of ſaving the <hi>German</hi> liberty, ſo the Reformation
of <hi>Calvin</hi> in <hi>France</hi> did not help a little to revive the dying liberty of
that Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Now by the following cruel and bloody perſecutions wherewith
the reformed were thereupon purſued in <hi>France,</hi> the Head of that
Party being incloſed in <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and from thence giving life to the reſt
of the Party through the whole Extent of <hi>France,</hi> it may be truly ſaid
that <hi>Rochelle</hi> in the defect of Palatines and General Aſſemblies with
the reſt of its Party did little leſs in <hi>France</hi> then what a pit or excellent
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96566:23"/>
Ciſtern of pure water doth in a dry and parched place, in the times
of greateſt heat, for the uſe of water being of an indiſpenſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for the ſervice of life, and theſe dry places in the moſt ardent
heat being deſtitute of Fountains or Rivers, as in the defect of theſe
natural means we think our ſelves happy in the comfort of Ciſterns,
though they be means extraordinary, ſo of the like nature was the
ſubſiſtence of the Proteſtant Party in <hi>France:</hi> for the Palatines and
Seſſions of the States General in <hi>France</hi> by their total or tacite ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
being not able to ſuſtain any longer the liberty of the State;
<hi>Rochelle</hi> and its Partiſans as an extraordinary means ſo long as it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
did in one manner or other maintain this accidental Liberty,
which hath entirely diſappeared ſince the reddition thereof, ſo that
at this day all <hi>France</hi> is wholly fallen into a domination purely deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
and to ſpeak the truth being a Body ſick of ill humours which
ſubſiſted by one only ſort of nouriſhment, and wholly excluded
from it, its death by conſequent is inevitable.</p>
            <p>As to the tacite intereſt which the greater part of other Powers of
<hi>Europe</hi>
might have had to oppoſe themſelves againſt this rendition
with as much vigour as <hi>Spain, England, Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> it ſelf ought
to have done, if they had followed their true Intereſt, for this they
need only in the firſt place ſee into what Eſtate all the Potentates of
<hi>Europe</hi> would have been reduced, if the irruption into <hi>Holland</hi> had
ſucceeded, and if the Sovereign Lord of all things had not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their light and ſpirit from the Miniſters of <hi>France,</hi> after they had
taken <hi>Utrich</hi> and <hi>Narden,</hi> to make themſelves Maſters of the Town
of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> which might have been done for ſome days more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than the Commonwealth of the United Provinces could by means
of this place alone preſerved have recovered unto it ſelf in a ſmall
time the poſſeſſion of the greateſt part of their conquered Eſtate.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place we muſt examine what by the loſs of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the People of <hi>France,</hi> this Monarch diſpoſing abſolutely as
I have ſaid before of the wealth and induſtry of all his Subjects is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do and execute againſt all his Neighbours, with relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
againſt all the Potentates of Chriſtendom, and by this Reflection
all the Powers concerned to deliver themſelves from ſuch apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
may ſee how much it imports them to redreſs ſuch an Evil; as
this cannot be done without bringing about an Eſtabliſhment of the
liberty of Eſtate in <hi>France,</hi> and that re-eſtabliſhment cannot probably
be effected without reſtoring life to the Proteſtant Party of <hi>France,</hi>
and being that Party cannot re-eſtabliſh it ſelf without Puiſſant For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Aid, all theſe Powers intereſſed in this re-eſtabliſhment may
ſee, that if ſo terrible a <hi>quid pro quo</hi> of Eſtate have been rendred them
for ſuffering the Proteſtant Party to be ſubdued by the Rendition of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96566:24"/>
the Town of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> they ſhall make it altogether irreparable, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they diſſolve their Confederacy and put off their Arms, they heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to any Propoſitions of Peace until they have by Succours and
real encouragements brought about ſo deſirable a re-eſtabliſhment;
for without this Foundation neither Peace nor Precautions can be
found, which may poſſibly deliver the Chriſtian World from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of changing as to the greateſt part of it, the State and
face, both temporal and ſpiritual, wherewith I conclude my ſmall
Obſervations concerning the aforeſaid Error of State.</p>
            <p>Though in theſe Obſervations nothing was ſaid of the Lords, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> nor of their great and abſolute Maſter
the Pope, yet it will be very eaſie from the Principles here laid down
compared with the Attempts this King of <hi>France</hi> hath made for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
his Subjects into a neutral Religion contained in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Articles, to evince that the Pope and Clergy both of <hi>France</hi> and
other Neighbour Countries, as much as they hate the Calviniſts can
hope for no other than a mongril and precarious Religion, Diſcipline
and arbitrary maintenance and tolleration from the Kings of <hi>France,</hi>
if once the Reformed Religion were expelled out of his Dominions,
beſides that if any one King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould at any time change his
Faith, or this King purſue his intended Reformation and re-union,
their utter ruine muſt thereon neceſſarily enſue.</p>
            <p>And it was for this reaſon the preſent Pope did herein imitate the
wiſe Counſel of his Predeceſſors, and did enter the League with this
preſent Emperour, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Catholick and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Princes againſt the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> to procure the
liberty of <hi>France,</hi> as he did with the King of <hi>France</hi> againſt <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth, Emperour and King of <hi>Spaine</hi> for the liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi>
remembring how unkindly his Catholick Majeſty detained his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
in captivity, and what Reformations he deſigned and had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
made, had his deſign taken effect in <hi>Germany,</hi> a Body though
greater yet not ſo united as this of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Articles of a New French Reformed Religion, follow.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Confeſſion of Faith ſhall be drawn up in general terms, which ſhall compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Faith profeſſed by both Religions without touching at all upon theſe Points

               <item>6. In like manner Benefices ſhall not be any more reſigned, but they ſhall be all in the

               <item>10. The Miniſters ſhall be provided of Cures in the places of their Reſidence, and
where they cannot be provided they ſhall part the Service with the Curates of the

               <item>13. A good part alſo of the leſs needful Ceremonies ſhall be reformed as Torches at
Funerals, part of the Canonizations, Proceſſion and Pilgrimages, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures

               <item>20. Baptiſm and the Euchariſt ſhall be the greater Sacraments, Confirmation ſhall be

adminiſtred by the Canons or Parochial Prieſts; the extreme, Unction ſhall be a
Sacrament, Orders and Marriage ſhall be adminiſtred by thoſe who have right to
Confeſs, Penance ſhall be a neceſſary Work, which the Biſhops, Curates, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors

of all the Lord's days in Lent, the Saturdays of all the year and all the Vigils.</item>
               <item>23. The Saints ſhall be honoured, but without invoking them directly, and all Prayers
ſhall be directed to God alone.</item>
               <item>24. Pardons and Indulgences ſhall be reformed, and endeavours ſhall be uſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the People as much as poſſible to make them apprehend that they ought to
ground the Remiſſion of their ſins on the blood of Chriſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All this and what elſe they can agree on ſhall be approved by an Aſſembly
General, which ſhall be compoſed of the moſt learned Divines of the one and
the other Religion, and they ſhall prepare the Confeſſion which is ſpoken of
above.</p>
            <p>But herein is the difficulty, that the greater part of the Catholicks fancy that
is too looſe, and they of the Reformed Religion think it too little, and are afraid
they ſhall be deceived in what is promiſed them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Articles were teſtified and made notoriouſly known through all <hi>France</hi>
