            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Second Relation from HERTFORD; CONTAINING The unjust Proceedings of some called Justices there at the General Quarter Sessions, upon the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of one and twenty innocent Persons called QUAKERS, for a pretended breach of the late Act, with an account of the most Material Passages between the Prisoners: and the Court, the 3d 4th. and 5th. dayes of the 8th. Moneth, 1664. Whereby it appears, that Meeting to Worship God in Spirit and truth is the great crime for which they are under so grievous a sentence: and that whatever is pretended by those that love the title of Justice, yet in very deed they hate Justice it self, as by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings appears.</p>

The first day of the Sessions (being the third day of the 8th.

               <p>I think I need not give any reason why, conceiving it my priviledge to challenge more then one, without shewing any cause; but however I have something against him, He is a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary man, and hath been active in that party, against which I have been charged, to be ingaged in opposition; and that therefore I may expect to have no justice from him; and also that he was one of that Jury that had already brought in four of my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Friends guilty, with some other reason; but he being a person chosen on purpose for that work, it would not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he should be put by.</p>

            <p>The Prisoners would have spoken further to the Jury, but were not suffered, onely some few words were spoken by <hi>Rich.

            <p>The Jury being sworn and charged (as before) well and truly to try betwixt the King and the Prisoners at the Bar, and true deliverance make, and to bring in their verdict, according to evidence. The Witnesses were called and sworn, whose evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reached thus far (and no further) <hi>That they were taken at such a time and place, met together, above the number of five; but that they heard them speak no word, nor saw nothing, but that they sate together in silence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Prisoners called upon the Jury, to take notice, that no matter of fact was witnessed against them by those Witnesses: but the Jury seemed to give more heed to the minde of the Court, and what they would have them to do, then either to the Prisoners, or Witnesses.</p>

The Jury was commanded to go forth, who did so, and quickly returned, agreed upon their verdict, that they were all guilty.</p>

                  <hi>I would not have you cheat your selves, it is not for Worship, for Conscience, or Religion, that you suffer; but the matter of Fact is for Meeting; the evil is to meet together, above the number of five.</hi>

            <p>H. C. Said also something to the same effect, quoting Judge <hi>Bridgman</hi> his opinion therein, and his practice as a president the last Assizes, and a sufficient warrant for their proceedings,</p>
            <p>Then the Jury was called, sworn, and charged, in the usual form. as is before expressed (being the same that brought in the former seven guilty) the Witnesses also were called and sworn, whose testimony agreed in this onely, <hi>That they were taken at such times, and places, met together, above the number of five.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prisoners</speaker>
               <p>We met there in the fear of God, for no evil end, but to worship him in spirit and truth, and not under colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

            <p>This answer <hi>H. Chancy</hi> noted down, together with the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the Witnesses, and then spake to the Jury, saying,</p>

               <speaker>H. Ch.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have two records against the Prisoners at the Bar alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> (which were read) <hi>and they are sufficient for the first and second offences: and as concerning the third offence, you hear what the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

say, That they were at such an house, met together, above five: And they acknowledge and confess, that they met there in the fear of God, to worship,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I think the evidence is sufficient, go forth.</hi>

            </sp>
            <p>But before they went forth <hi>H.

            <sp>

               <p>I conceive I am not to answer at this Court, for any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended offence, which is done within the Corporation; but am accountable to that Court, within whose jurisdiction I live.</p>

               <p>I am willing to plead, provided I may not be debarred of that which is my right, that is, that I may be tryed by the Corporation.</p>

               <speaker>H. S.</speaker>
               <p>I desire the Court would be pleased to satisfie me, <hi>By what power the Mayor committed me to the County Prison, seeing by his Charter he hath no such power; and without his Charter he is no more then one of us, or another man.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>To this they returned no answer, but bid the Clerk read the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93254:9"/>
IndictMent, which he did, and then it was demanded of him, <hi>Whether he was guilty, or not guilty</hi>?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H. S.</speaker>
               <p>If the Court would be pleased to satisfie me in this one thing; I know not but that I may plead, that is, <hi>By what power the Mayor committed me to the County Goale,</hi> or where he had it, seeing the Charter doth not give him it: for the Mayor hath the same power in the Corporation, to try all things that are to be enquired of, as the Justices in the County; for the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath power by their Charter to try all persons, Trespasses, and all offences whatsoever, except Treason, Murther, or Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or the taking away of Life or Limb; so he hath no power to commit to the County Prison in this case, but to his own prison, which is allowed by the Charter. If the Court please I will read the Copy of the Charter:</p>
            </sp>
            <p> so they bad him read it; and as he began to read, they asked him if it were in Latine, he said no; then they would not let him read it.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Court.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Will you plead or not? if not, sentence will be passed upon you as mute, and you will lose the priviledge of a Jury.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H. S.</speaker>
               <p>I desire the Court would give me an understanding of the Act; for as I understand it, I do not conceive it doth at all concern us; for by it, Meetings are allowed, so they are not above such a number; and certainly a number cannot be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of it self, provided the intent be not evil: So I conceive the Act is against such as do intend evil at their Meetings, as to plot and contrive against the Government: we are no such, but our intent is really to worship God, and nothing else.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cl.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thats your mistake, The Act is made against all Meetings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Religion of above five persons in number.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H. S.</speaker>
               <p>It would be an absurd thing to think that the Act is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst worshipping God; so understanding of it, it would violate the Kings promises, which in three Declarations (that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to the world) say, <hi>That no man should be disturbed in matter of Conscience, provided they lived peaceably</hi>: And I dare presume to say, That if the King were asked, whether any breach should be made of his promises, he would say no, not for abundance. For in his Speech to the Parliament, he saith, <hi>No man shall have power to charge us with the breach of our promises</hi>; so that the Act
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93254:10"/>
cannot be so understood, but as it self sayes, against such as shall at their Meetings contrive insurrections.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>We do not deny you your Religion, but you may meet, so you meet not above the number of five, that you may not have any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to contrive insurrections.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>H. S.</speaker>
               <p>Some have had a suspicion of us, but God knows we have no such design; but our design is to promote righteousness and holiness, and to reprove evil where ever we see it (although it be in the great ones of the world) and that we may live a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, in all honesty; and this is our design.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>H. S.</speaker>
               <p>I do not deny pleading, neither do I contemn the Court, but do expect my priviledge, to be tryed by the Corporation; and if it be not granted me, I do take it as a great injustice done unto me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>H. S.</speaker>

               <speaker>H. S.</speaker>
               <p>I thank God you have nothing of evil against me (now nor formerly) to condemn me for; but it is purely for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake, for worshipping God. One of the Jury, as he stood at the Bar told him, <hi>That if he did plead they should finde him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> So it seems it was determined beforehand what to do; and that all their shew of a legal Tryal was but under colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, having fore-judged them, and before hand concluded to condemn them.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>So the Jury went forth, and about the space of a quarter of an hour, returned agreed upon their verdict. And being asked, if they were agreed answered, Yes; and who should speak for them, answered, their Fore-man: who being asked if <hi>Henry Sweeting</hi> were guilty of the Crimes: he stood- indicted of, or not guilty; he answered, guilty, and so of all the rest.</p>
            <sp>

                  <hi>Look to them Goaler.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then was <hi>Henry Stout</hi> set again to the Bar, and his Indictment read the third time; and he still desiring to be tryed by the Court, that ought to try him, viz. <hi>The Court of the Corporation.</hi> The
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93254:10"/>
Clerk recorded him again for a Mute the third time. This done the Goaler was commanded to fetch the rest of the Prisoners to the Bar, being one and twenty persons, which also was done; and proclamation being made, that all persons should keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence while Judgement was given. The Prisoners were called over severally (one after another) to whom <hi>Henry Chancy</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his speech particularly as followeth, <hi>viz. What say you</hi> Lewis Laundy, <hi>why judgement of transportation should not be passed upon you</hi>?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. L.</speaker>
               <p>I am innocent in this matter, and have not transgressed this Law, for our Meetings are not contrary to the Liturgy, but your practice is contrary to it; for that sayes, <hi>Cursed is he that parteth man and wife,</hi> which thing you are doing this day; and assuredly the Lord will reward you according to your deeds.</p>
            </sp>
            <p> Then <hi>Henry Chancy</hi> being about to pass sentence, <hi>Richard Thomas</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Court, and said, hold, there is something to be said first before the Sentence is passed: whereupon <hi>Henry Chancy</hi> said, <hi>Richard Thomas, what have you to say why judgement of transportation should not be passed upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. <hi>T.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I have much to say, <hi>First, nothing hath been proved against me, as matter of Fact, which should deserve such Sentence.</hi> And again, I <hi>ought to have been tryed by the Corporation for the pretended offence; and therefore there ought to be an arrest of Judgement.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H. Chancy.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to that you have had a fair tryal, and the Court doth over-rule you in that thing, and you have been answered.</hi> 
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then <hi>John Reynolds</hi> was asked <hi>what he had to say, why sentence should not be passed upon him.</hi> And Tho. Vic. Fansh. stood up and said, He had done very much for him at the Assizes. To which <hi>J. R.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That the light in his Conscience would convince him of the evil he had done to him; whereupon Tho. Vic Fansh. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted in a rage, <hi>That the light you hold is one thing to day, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing to morrow.</hi> Before sentence, several others of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners said, <hi>They were innocent, and had not deserved any such sentence.</hi> But H. C. said, <hi>Your plea of innocency will not now avail you. The Jury hath found you guilty; therefore you must hearken to your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi> So the Prisoners were set to the Bar, and sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by him as followeth, <hi>Richard Thomas, John Bresbon, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Fairman, William Brown, Francis Haddon, Samuel Wollaston,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93254:11"/>
Thomas Crawley, John Reynolds, John Witham, Robert Crook. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and the Court doth award, That you, and every of you shall be transported beyond the Seas, to the Island of</hi> Barbadoes, <hi>being one of his Majesties Plantations, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main seven years.</hi> Then <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>It was observed in his speech, countenance, and deportment, by the spectators, that while he was passing sentence, he was as smitten of the Lord, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint away under the sence of his stroke for the wicked works he was about.</hi>
               </note> Sentence was also pronounced upon the rest thus, <hi>viz. Lewis Laundy, William Burre, Thomas Burre, Thomas Moss, Michael Day, Robert Hart, William Adams, John Throughgood, Henry Sweeting, Jeremiah Dean, Henry Stout, It is awarded, and the Court doth award, that you, and every of you shall be transported beyond the Seas, to the Island of</hi> Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, <hi>one of his Majesties Plantations, Forreign, there to remain seven years.</hi> But before the Prisoners went from the Bar, divers of them expressed themselves to this purpose, <hi>viz. Richard Thomas</hi> said, <hi>The Lord justifies though you condemn and sentence us.</hi> And be it known unto you, that I account it great honour, and much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Lord that I have been preserved unto this time, to <hi>hear a testimony for Gods eternal truth, against such a generation of men as you are</hi>: And as Sentence was pronouncing, <hi>Lewis Laundy</hi> (one of the Prisoners directed these words to <hi>Henry Chancy, Alas for thee poor</hi> Chancy, (observing a great change in his speech and countenance) <hi>it had been well for thee if thou hadst not done this dayes work, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a little space the said <hi>Henry Chancy</hi> recovering himself, spake to the Prisoners as followeth, <hi>viz. If you, on every of you will pay one hundred pound into the Court, you may be discharged from this sentence, and the Court shall not be discharged till the morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was now after the 9th. hour at night, and the Court ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed till eight the next morning, the Prisoners being reman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded back to Prison.</p>
            <p>On the morrow about the 7th. hour the Court met again (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the third day of the Sessions) and the Goaler being ordered to bring the forenamed twenty one persons, or whom sentence was passed: they were brought accordingly, and set to the Bar, and called over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93254:11"/>Court. Then the Court demanded of every several person respectively, whether they would pay down their several hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds to redeem them from the sentence of transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was passed upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pris.</hi> To which they returned, their several answers, some whereof are as followeth.</p>

               <speaker>Lewis Laundy.</speaker>
               <p>It is for the testimony of my Conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, that I am sentenced, and if I had an hundred lives, and could redeem them all with an hundred pence, I should not give them in this case.</p>

               <speaker>Rich. Thomas.</speaker>
               <p>Be it known unto you, that the service we are called unto, is more honourable then to be purchased off, with money; and therefore if the tenth part of a farthing would do it, I should not give it you: and further he also said, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion we profess, we are neither afraid, nor ashamed to suffer for; it is the Truth, and shall stand over the heads of all such transgressing wretches as you are.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tho Moss.</speaker>
               <p>I am in the service of God, and I do not intend to hire my self out of it; but you had more need to hire your selves out of the service that you are in</p>

               <speaker>R. Crook.</speaker>
               <p>Whether shall I be free, if I should pay an hundred pounds.</p>

               <speaker>R. C.</speaker>
               <p>Then I may go meet again with those you call Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to the disturbing of the Kings Peace.</p>

               <speaker>Court.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes, paying an hundred pound he might,</hi> for the Law said so. <hi>Will you pay an hundred pound that you may not be transported.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. C.</speaker>
               <p>No, I have not so much money to spare.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Others <hi>H. S. R. F. T. B</hi> said they were satisfied in their hearts and consciences, that they had done no evil, and therefore could not consent to give one farthing, or words to that effect: and <hi>Henry Stout</hi> (being included in their unjust sentence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his just Plea to the contrary) delivered himself in these words; Before I give an answer to your demand, I do expect a legal Tryal; and further desiring to be heard to speak a few more words, said, I remember I heard some upon the Bench speak very contemptuously of the Light. <hi>Now they chat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the light despise Christ,</hi> for the light is Christ, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93254:12"/>
was made manifest, to destroy the deeds of darkness, and to condemn sin in all its appearances; for he that is of God walks in the light, as God is light; whereupon they cryed, <hi>That is true, that is true,</hi> but would not endure to hear any further of that truth, but cryed <hi>Take him away, take him away</hi>; and so he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to speak no more.</p>
            <p>Friend, whoever thou art that readest the precedent passages, mayest observe, That though <hi>Henry Chancy</hi> (the Judge of this Court of pretended Justice) did oftentimes urge the Prisoners to confess what they met for, and what they did at their Meetings; yet when some of them did confess that they met upon no other account, but to worship God, and to wait upon God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: when he came to speak to the Jury, he made that confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the chief ground for the Jury to proceed, to finde the Bills; whereupon they are sentenced; notwithstanding one that was chief among them said (more then once) that they had their Religion free, and they meddled not with Worship, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and Religion; so that any people that have any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in true simplicity (be it of what form it will) that have not sold all honesty in that profession (on purpose to please and serve the present times) may see that the main ground of this grand persecution is <hi>for worshiping God in Spirit</hi>: and as it is said that one of the eminentest among them that sit in the seat of Cruelty and Violence in this day, hath said, that this Act was made against worshipping God in spirit: and if ever any person in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on read or heard of any people or nation, that hath so directly in plain words and open deeds manifested such defiance and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the worshipping of God in spirit and truth; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Scripture speaketh expresly, <hi>That God is a spirit, and will be worshipped in spir<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruth,</hi> and that these men do own the Scriptures in word) let him come forth and endeavour to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie this generation of Men. And further observe, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is here punctually proved (as to the breach of the late Act) but onely meeting above the number of five, which (without the proof of Sedition, or breach of the Peace) can be no violation of the Act: so that people may see the unjust proceeding of these <hi>unrighteous Judges,</hi> who pretend Law for their rule, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but practice none of it, as was clearly observed by them
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93254:12"/>
that were spectators; for no clear evidence they had for what they did: the Witnesses deposing onely their meeting together, but nothing that they spake or did; and this was the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Crime they sentenced them for.</p>
            <p>O generation of Vipers, do you think to escape the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hell for your illegal proceedings? who are not content to do wickedly your selves, but either fright or flatter other; to do the same. (As one of the Jury said at the Bar, besides what others were over-heard to say in a threatning way) what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were warned to attend your wicked service, that you might have your choice of fit instrumments to do your abominable work. O height of impudence and hard-heartedness, that you should dare do such things, and yet before the people, cover your wickedness with smooth words, saying, we do not deny you your Religion, and yet condemn them for it. God takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of these things, and if such great woes were pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as did not fit, when he was in prison, and did not feed him when he was an hungry, and cloath him when he was naked, what will be their portion, who when he was at liberty cast him into prison? and when he had food took it away from him? and when he had cloaths stript him naked. <hi>Inasmuch, saith Christ, as ye do it unto the least of them that fear my name, ye do it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</hi> But it was the portion of the people of God in dayes past to be so dealt withall by an hard hearted generation, as may be seen, Mat. 10.17, 18, 19. <hi>But beware of men, for they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you up to councels, and ye shall be brought before Governours and Rulers for my name sake, for a testimony against them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
