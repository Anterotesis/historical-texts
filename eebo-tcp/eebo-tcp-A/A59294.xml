            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Shall not go about, either to excuse, or justifie the Publishing of this Poem; for that would be much more an harder Task than the Writing of it: But however, I shall say, in the words of the Author of the incomparable <hi>Absalom</hi> and <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel, That I am sure the Design is honest.</hi> If Wit and Fool be the Consequence of <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> no doubt, but Knave and Ass may be Epithets plentifully bestowed upon me by the one party, whilst the other may grant me more favourable ones, than perhaps I do deserve. But as very few are Iudges of Wit, so I think, much fewer of honesty; since Interest and Faction on either side, prejudices and blinds the Iudgment; and the violence of Passion makes neither discernible in an Adversary. i I know not whether my Poem has a <hi>Genius</hi> to force <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts way against prejudice: Opinion sways much in the World, and he that has once gained it writes securely. I speak not this any ways to lessen the merits of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whose Wit has deservedly gained the Bays; but in this I have the advantage, since, as I desire not Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or vain applause, I can securely wrap my self in my own Cloud, and remain unknown, whilest he is exposed through his great Lustre. I shall never envy what I desire not, nor am I altogether so doting, as to believe the Issues of my own Brain to exceed all others, and to be so very fond of them, (as most Authors, especially Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, are) as to think them without fault, or be so blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as not to see their blemishes, and that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled by others; yet since Poems are like Children, it may be allowed me to be naturally inclined to have some good Opinion of my own, and not to believe this Poem altogether despicable or ridiculous. The Ancients say, that every thing hath two handles, I have laid bold of that opposite to the Author of <hi>Absalom:</hi> As to Truth, who has the better hold, let the World judge; and it is no new thing, for the same Persons, to be ill or well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
<pb facs="tcp:41788:3"/>
by several parties. I hope then, I may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused as well as another, since I have told my Dreams with the same Liberty; for the fancies of Poets are no more than waking Dreams, and never imposed as dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical precepts, which are more agreeable to truth or falshood, or according to the Poets Language, which proceed from the Horny or Ivory Port, will be senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced according to the Humour and Interest of several Parties who in spite of our Teeth will be our judges. Where I have been satyrical, 'tis without Malice or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; and though I brag not of my Talent therein, I could have said much worse, of some Enemies to our <hi>Jewish</hi> Heroe. He that will lash others, ought not to be angry if the like be returned to himself: <hi>Lex talionis</hi> is a general and natural Law. I call not this an Answer to <hi>Absalom,</hi> I have nothing to do with him, he was a Rebel to his Father; my <hi>Azaria</hi> a good Son, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by a worthy and Loyal Counsellor, and <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> and <hi>Hushai</hi> were men of contrary Opinions, and different Principles: And if Poets (as it is often brought for their excuse, when they vary from known History) ought to represent Persons as they ought to be, I have not transcurred the Precepts of Poetry, and <hi>Absalom</hi> is not so good a Poem, because his Character is not so agreeable to the virtue of an Heroe, as this of <hi>Azaria</hi> is: But certainly when Poetry and Truth are jo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned together, and that the Persons are truly what they are represented, and liv'd their Character, the glory is double, both to the Heroe and the Poet: And I could wish, that the same Hand, that drew the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Son, with so much I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>genuity and Skill, would out do mine, in shewing the virtues of an obedient Son and loyal Counsellor, since he may have as much Truth for a Foundation to build upon, the Artful Structure of the Heroes Glory, with his own Fame and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>IN Impious times, when Priest-craft was at height,</l>
               <l>And all the Deadly Sins esteemed light:</l>
               <l>When that Religion onely was a Stale,</l>
               <l>And some bow'd down to God, and some to <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>When Perjury was scarce esteem'd a Sin,</l>
               <l>And Vice like flowing Tides came rowling in:</l>
               <l>When Luxury, Debauch, and Concubine,</l>
               <l>The sad effects of Women and of Wine,</l>
               <l>Rag'd in <hi>Iudaea</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>Amazia</hi> of great <hi>Davids</hi> Stem,</l>
               <l>God-like and great in peace did rule that Land,</l>
               <l>And all the <hi>Iews</hi> stoop'd to his just Command.</l>
               <l>Long now in <hi>Sion</hi> had he Peace enjoy'd,</l>
               <l>After that civil Broils the Land destroy'd:</l>
               <l>Plenty and Peace attended on his Reign,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Solomons</hi> Golden days return'd again:</l>
               <l>When the old <hi>Canaanites,</hi> who there did lurk,</l>
               <l>Began to find both God and King new work:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Amazia,</hi> though he God did love,</l>
               <l>Had not cast out <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests, and cut down every Grove.</l>
               <l>Too oft Religion's made pretence for Sin,</l>
               <l>About it in all Ages Strife has been:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41788:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>But Interest, which at bottom doth remain,</l>
               <l>Which still converts all Godliness to Gain,</l>
               <l>What e'er pretence is made, is the true cause</l>
               <l>That moves the Priest, and like the Loadstone draws.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Canaanites</hi> of old that Land possess'd,</l>
               <l>And long therein Idolatry profess'd;</l>
               <l>Till Sins of Priests, and of the common Rout,</l>
               <l>Caus'd God and his good Kings to cast them out.</l>
               <l>Their Idols were pull'd down, their Groves destroy'd,</l>
               <l>Strict Laws against them and their Worship made.</l>
               <l>The Heathen Priests were banish'd from the Land</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Baal,</hi> no Temple suffer'd was to stand:</l>
               <l>And all succeeding Kings made it their care,</l>
               <l>They should no more rear up their Altars there.</l>
               <l>If some mild Kings did wink at their abode,</l>
               <l>They to the <hi>Iews</hi> still prov'd a pricking Goad:</l>
               <l>Growing more bold, they Penal Laws defied,</l>
               <l>And like tormenting Thorns stuck in their side.</l>
               <l>The busie Priests had lost their gainful Trade,</l>
               <l>Revenge and Malice do their hearts invade:</l>

               <l>For Piety shall never me forsake,</l>
               <l>Tho I his Royal Favour ne'er partake.</l>
               <l>And tho my Foes have with their subtil art</l>
               <l>Banish'd me from my Royal Fathers heart,</l>
               <l>Which is the source of all my grief and wo,</l>
               <l>My just Obedience I will ne'er forgo.</l>
               <l>Nor has Disgrace, nor my hot Passions wrought</l>
               <l>Within my Breast one bad disloyal Thought.</l>
               <l>I ne'er believ'd my Father would betray</l>
               <l>His People or sought Arbitrary Sway:</l>
               <l>Or though his People did his wrath provoke,</l>
               <l>He meant to curb them with an Iron Yoke:</l>

               <l>(But here his Passion made some little pause,</l>
               <l>Till sighing, at the last he thus went on)</l>
               <l>Why my Great Father does disown his Son:</l>
               <l>They say, I am but of a spurious Brood,</l>
               <l>My Mother being of Ignoble Blood;</l>
               <l>For <hi>Iocoliah</hi> was but mean by Birth,</l>
               <l>Though with the King she mix'd her baser Earth.</l>
               <l>I was begotten in my Fathers Flight,</l>
               <l>E'er to the Crown he had obtain'd his Right;</l>
               <l>And since I from his Favour did decline,</l>
               <l>He has declar'd her but his Concubine.</l>
               <l>This has the hopes rais'd of <hi>Eliakim,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>Amazia</hi>'s Crown's design'd for him;</l>
               <l>My hopes are lost, and I do think it fit</l>
               <l>I should to God, Right, and the King submit:</l>
               <l>But yet wise <hi>Hushai</hi> know, I still do find,</l>
               <l>My Birth has not so much debas'd my Mind,</l>

               <l>Of <hi>Davids</hi> Royal Bloud my self I own,</l>
               <l>And with it never can disgrace the Throne.</l>
               <l>Though my bold Spirits mounting thus do fly</l>

               <l>To my known Foes I would not leave the Field.</l>
               <l>I'd not be trampled on by sordid Feet,</l>
               <l>Nor take Affronts from every one I meet.</l>
               <l>I'd give no cause they should my courage doubt,</l>
               <l>Nor to Rebellion push the vulgar Rout.</l>
               <l>I to my Father would give no offence,</l>
               <l>Nor while he lives lay to the Crown pretence:</l>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41788:11"/>But since Life's sweet, by Wisdom I'd keep mine,</l>
               <l>From <hi>Baalites</hi> Hate, and <hi>Eliakim</hi>'s Design:</l>
               <l>This (my wise Friend) is my chief business now,</l>
               <l>To take some sage and good Advice from you.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hushai</hi> in silence heard the Prince, and weigh'd</l>
               <l>Each word he spake, then to him thus reply'd:</l>
               <l>Great Prince, th'Almighty has to you been kind,</l>
               <l>Stamp'd Graces on your Body and your Mind,</l>
               <l>As if he for your Head a Crown design'd.</l>
               <l>We shall not search into Fates secret womb,</l>
               <l>God alone knows the things that are to come;</l>
               <l>But should you never sit on <hi>Davids</hi> Throne,</l>
               <l>'Tis better to deserve than wear a Crown.</l>
               <l>Of Royal Bloud and of great Birth you are,</l>
               <l>Born under some benign auspicious Star,</l>
               <l>Lov'd by the best, and prais'd by every Tongue,</l>
               <l>The glorious Subject of each worthy Song;</l>
               <l>The young mans wish, Joy of each warlike Wight,</l>
               <l>The Peoples Darling, and the Worlds Delight.</l>
               <l>A Crowd of Vertues fill your Princely Breast,</l>
               <l>And what appears more glorious than the rest,</l>
               <l>You are of Truth and Loyalty possest.</l>
               <l>That I would cherish in you, that would raise</l>
               <l>To an admired height, that I would chiefly praise.</l>
               <l>Let Fools and Politicians scorn</l>
               <l>Fair Vertue, which doth best a Prince adorn:</l>
               <l>Whilest you her bright and shining Robes put on,</l>
               <l>You will appear more great than <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Let not, Great Prince, the Fumes of Vulgar Praise</l>
               <l>Your bolder Spirits to Ambition raise.</l>
               <l>We cannot see into the Mist of Fate,</l>
               <l>Till time brings forth you must expecting wait:</l>
               <l>But Fortune, rather Providence, not Chance,</l>
               <l>The constant, stout, and wise doth still advance.</l>
               <l>Let your quick Eye be to her Motions tied,</l>
               <l>But still let Noble Vertue be your Guide:</l>
               <l>For when that God and Vertue points the way,</l>
               <l>There can be then no danger to obey.</l>
               <l>But here in Wisdoms School we ought to learn,</l>
               <l>How we 'twixt Good and Evil may discern.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41788:11"/>For, noble Prince, you must true difference make,</l>
               <l>Lest for the one the other you mistake.</l>
               <l>You must not think you may your self advance,</l>
               <l>By laying hold on every proffer'd chance.</l>
               <l>Tho Fortune seems to smile, and egg you on,</l>
               <l>Let Vertue be your Rule and Guide alone.</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>David</hi> for his Guide his Vertue took,</l>
               <l>Nor was by Fortune's proffer'd Kindness shook.</l>
               <l>His Vertue and his Loyalty did save</l>
               <l>King <hi>Saul,</hi> when Fortune brought him to his Cave.</l>
               <l>And if that I may to you Counsel give,</l>
               <l>You should, without a Crown, for ever live,</l>
               <l>Rather than get it by the Peoples Lust,</l>
               <l>Or purchase it by ways that are unjust.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>David</hi> your Ancestor, from whom you spring,</l>
               <l>Would never by Rebellion be made King;</l>
               <l>But long in <hi>Gath</hi> a Warring Exile stay'd,</l>
               <l>Till for him God a lawful way had made.</l>
               <l>In <hi>Hebron,</hi> full of Glory and Renown,</l>
               <l>He gain'd, at last, and not usurpd, the Crown.</l>
               <l>By full Consent he did the same obtain,</l>
               <l>And Heav'n's anointing Oyl was not in vain.</l>

               <l>My Skill in secret these with slander wound;</l>
               <l>With every Line I drew still faults were found;</l>
               <l>Till wearied, I at last my Work gave o're.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Amazia</hi> (I shall say no more)</l>

               <l>For this they think I must my Vertue change,</l>

               <l>We cannot every Action so applaud,</l>
               <l>As if it came from an unerring God.</l>
               <l>Kings have their Passions, and deceiv'd may be,</l>

               <l>To Evil prone, to Mischief ever bent,</l>
               <l>Th'all Objects with false colours represent;</l>
               <l>The Guilty clear, condemn the Innocent.</l>
               <l>Thus, noble Prince, they you and me accuse</l>

               <l>He left the Evil, and embrac'd the Good:</l>

               <l>And tho he might have Empire in his Eye,</l>

               <l>Yet in his Soul such Virtue did remain,</l>
               <l>He by Rebellion would not Empire gain.</l>
               <l>Through every Vein his Loyal Bloud did run,</l>
               <l>Yet Royal too, as <hi>Amazia</hi>'s Son.</l>
               <l>About his noble heart, he felt it spring;</l>

               <l>If that to <hi>Azaria</hi> were a Blot,</l>
               <l>His Father made it when he him begot:</l>

               <l>As not to shew Resentment at my Shame.</l>

               <l>My Father's Bloud runs thorow every Vein;</l>
               <l>He form'd those Spirits which desire to reign,</l>
               <l>Mount t'wards a Throne, and sordid Earth disdain.</l>
               <l>In Glory, Fame, Crowns, Empire, they delight,</l>
               <l>And to all these they would assert my Right.</l>
               <l>And my great Thoughts do whisper there is none</l>
               <l>Can be more neer a Father, than his Son.</l>
               <l>This prompts me to oppose <hi>Eliakim,</hi>

               <l>And never yield my Father's Crown to him.</l>

               <l>Nature must in the Father deeply groan,</l>

               <l>I'le still keep for them my forgiving right.</l>
               <l>I feel a tenderness within me spring,</l>
               <l>I am my Peoples Father, and their King,</l>
               <l>And tho I think, they may have done me wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>I can't remember their offences long.</l>
               <l>Nature is mov'd, and sues for a Reprieve,</l>
               <l>They are my Children, and I must forgive.</l>
               <l>My many jealous fears I shan't repeat,</l>
               <l>My Heart with a strong pulse of Love doth beat,</l>
               <l>Nature I feel has made a sudden start,</l>
               <l>And a fresh source springs from the Father's heart.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41788:22"/>A stubborn Bow, drawn by the force of men,</l>
               <l>The force remov'd, flies swiftly back agen.</l>
               <l>'Tis hard a Fathers Nature to o'ercome,</l>
               <l>How easily does she her force assume!</l>
               <l>Sh'has o'er my Soul an easie Conquest won,</l>
               <l>And I remember now I have a Son,</l>
               <l>Whose Youth had long been my paternal Care,</l>
               <l>Rais'd to the height his noble frame could bear,</l>
               <l>And Heaven has seem'd to give his Soul a turn,</l>
               <l>As if ordain'd by Fate for Empire born.</l>
               <l>By our known Laws I have the Scepter sway'd,</l>
               <l>By them I governed, them my Rule I made.</l>
               <l>To them I sought to frame my soveraign Will,</l>
               <l>By them my Subjects I will govern still:</l>
               <l>They, not the People, shall proclaim my Heir,</l>
               <l>Yet I will hearken to my Subjects Prayer,</l>
               <l>And of a <hi>Baalite</hi> will remove their fear.</l>
               <l>From hence I'le banish every Priest of <hi>Baal,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And the wise <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> together call:</l>

               <l>Their Counsel and their Wisdom mix with mine;</l>
               <l>All former Strife betwixt us be forgot,</l>
               <l>And in Oblivion buried every Plot.</l>
               <l>We'l try to live in Love and Peace again,</l>
               <l>As when I first began my happy Reign,</l>
               <l>Before our Trait'rous Foes with secret toil</l>
               <l>Did fair <hi>Iudea</hi>'s blessed Peace embroil.</l>
               <l>May all my latter days excel my first,</l>

               <l>Spoke his Consent, in Thunder through the Skie:</l>
               <l>The Augury was noted by the Croud,</l>
               <l>Who joyful shouts returnd' almost as loud:</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Amazia</hi> was once more restor'd,</l>
               <l>He lov'd his People, they obey'd their Lord.</l>
